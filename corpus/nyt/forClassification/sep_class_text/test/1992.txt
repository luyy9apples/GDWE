zagreb , croatia , aug 15 the first images of emaciated men peering through barbed wire in serbian detention centers in bosnia and herzegovina riveted the world s attention in the week since , a clearer picture has begun to emerge of the scope of the camps , their conditions and the role they play in the larger serbian military strategy interviews with officials of international relief agencies and dozens of bosnians some of them still held in the camps , others living as refugees in croatia establish these major points about a conflict that has created europe s worst refugee crisis since the end of world war ii conditions at the detention camps were described as brutal , but there is little evidence as yet that the serbs were using them to carry out a policy of mass killing witnesses said repeatedly that death was usually more of a random event , resulting from beatings by drunken guards , disease and revenge shootings by serbian irregulars whose friends had died in combat elsewhere the camps were only one of the instruments of terror in the arsenal of ethnic cleansing , the campaign to drive muslims and croats from their homes in large swaths of bosnia and herzegovina the serbian efforts gathered momentum in midmay , after western aid workers and journalists were temporarily driven out of most of bosnia by a series of lethal , premeditated attacks the ethnic cleansing operations were largely complete by early july , when western aid workers returned to the area assertions of genocide the existence of the detention centers , and the possibility that summary executions were taking place within them , were made known to western governments and aid agencies at least a month before the first extensive press report on the subject appeared in newsday on aug 2 it was only after that report , and the first broadcast of film from the camps four days later , that president bush announced that he had ordered american intelligence to use every asset available to investigate the conditions at the camps the interviews have shed little light on the assertions of the combatants themselves , which are wildly divergent the serbian forces that control 70 percent of the country say , for example , that they are holding no more than 8 , 000 prisoners in a handful of camps , but their beleaguered bosnian government foes say the number is 105 , 000 people in 94 locations bosnia estimates that 17 , 000 have died in the camps , but refugee interviews can account for only a few hundred such deaths though the investigation did not substantiate assertions that the camps had once again brought genocide to the heart of europe , it has turned up ample evidence of mistreatment , beatings and abuse involving thousands of prisoners some have spoken of dozens of inmates being taken away , never to be seen again , and others have told of an incident in which more than 100 prisoners were machinegunned when they rioted for lack of water those accounts cannot be directly confirmed but their credibility is bolstered by the consistency of testimony from refugees and prisoners in disparate places who have had no chance to coordinate their stories more damaging evidence may still be hidden , for even as they let western reporters into the region to visit the camps , serbian officials were shuttling prisoners out of sight and dismantling the most notorious camps croats and muslims are , to a lesser extent , setting up their own prison camps as of this week , the international committee of the red cross said it had visited 13 detention centers or prisonerofwar camps in bosnia and herzegovina 7 croatian , 4 serbian and 2 muslim the offensive villagers' tales of brutality bosnia and herzegovina was the most ethnically mixed of the six republics that made up yugoslavia after world war ii muslims , slavs whose forebears converted to islam during the centuries in which bosnia was ruled by the ottoman turks , were the most numerous group in bosnia and herzegovina , with 44 percent of the population of 45 million , as measured in the 1991 census serbs , an orthodox christian slavic group that predominates in the neighboring serbian republic , were 31 percent of the bosnian total croats , who like the others are slavs and speak serbocroatian but are roman catholics , are 17 percent of the population the remainder identified themselves to the censustakers as yugoslavs , embracing a nonethnic nationalism that today is all but crushed those groups were interspersed throughout bosnia , with many towns and villages having no majority ethnic group and many muslims , serbs and croats living next door to each other mixed marriages among all three ethnic groups were commonplace slovenia and croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 , but the bosnian leadership was leery of following suit , having watched neighboring croatia plunged almost immediately into vicious fighting with the serbdominated yugoslav armed forces but the sarajevo leadership scheduled a referendum on independence for feb 29 of this year the muslims and croats voted yes , while serbs boycotted and insisted on dividing the country into three ethnic cantons

palisades park , nj , sept 7 broad avenue , the commercial heart of palisades park , was abuzz with rumor and innuendo today , as the police and neighborhood residents tried to piece together the events leading to a bloody knife fight sunday night that left two high school football players dead and two others wounded the fight , which erupted 50 yards from the police station at 8 30 pm on the corner of broad and central boulevard , started as a verbal skirmish between the four palisades park youths and another crowd of teenagers from nearby ridgefield park , the police said two of the ridgefield park youths were arrested and one was charged with the two killings the two slain youths were identified as thomas johnston , 17 years old , who was stabbed twice in the chest , and philip raymundo , 16 , who was stabbed in the heart by midmorning today , life on broad avenue , a busy suburban thoroughfare lined with small businesses , had resumed a steady hum , with pedestrian and vehicle traffic brisk and several stores open even though it was labor day the talk on the street was all about the events of the night before , by all accounts a brief but grisly episode that ended with mr raymundo bleeding profusely on the steps of the police station and mr johnston about 100 yards away , lying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk insults , then knives according to the accounts of witnesses and the police , the four palisades park youths , teammates on the palisades park high school football team , were among several teenagers walking south on broad avenue when they encountered two teenage boys and one girl from ridgefield park , at the corner of broad at central boulevard insults were exchanged , and then two ridgefield park youths pulled knives mr johnston then ran diagonally northwest across broad avenue , where he was chased down and stabbed , according to witnesses and john j fahy , the bergen county prosecutor mr raymundo , apparently already wounded , staggered southwest to the police station , where he banged on the door calling for help another witness , wayne santiago , was in his thirdfloor apartment across the street when he heard the commotion there were people trying to attend to him , keep him calm , mr santiago said but he was angry he was screaming , 'i 'll get you for this' the two wounded youths were gino zilocchi and yang chung , both 16 , who were both stabbed in the arm none of the four was armed , the police said seeking trial as adult the names of the two arrested youths were not released because of their ages one , 16 , has been charged with the two murders and is being held in the bergen county juvenile center in paramus mr fahy said he would seek to have him tried as an adult the second suspect , who is 15 , brandished a knife but did not stab anyone , mr fahy said he was charged with illegal possession of a weapon and released to his mother s custody the police recovered two knives at the scene it was a stunning event in this borough of 16 , 000 , which has grown increasingly diverse the storefronts on broad avenue , where korean , hispanic and indianowned businesses line both sides , reflect the ethnic mix the town itself once had a reputation for its roughhousing youths , but there had been just two murders in palisades park in the last decade , neither involving young people there s nothing on the books comparable to this , said capt frank martini of the palisades park police the police said today that they had not established a motive for the killings , but classmates of the victims said that both mr raymundo and one of those arrested had dated the same girl the assailant , they said , had been enraged when the girl broke off their romance phil still really loved her , said aurelia quinones , 14 , a sophomore at palisades park high school he would have been trying to protect her the police would not confirm that the fight was focused on the a girl , saying only that they were aware of the rumors nothing but speculation it might have been a boyfriendgirlfriend kind of thing , said chief alan lustmann you do n't know who has their eye on who , and suddenly they 're with somebody else but , he added , that s all speculation right now he confirmed that the two groups knew each other , but said there was no indication that any sort of gang rivalry was involved he added that the part of broad avenue where the fight occurred is a strip where teenagers regularly hang out , and that the fight seemed to have been spur of the moment , a spark lit too close to a fuse the whole thing was over in maybe a minute , chief lustmann said it could not have been prevented , no matter what map of new jersey showing location of palisades park
taking jerry brown seriously means taking his flat tax proposal seriously needlessly , he s made that hard to do by being careless , the former california governor has bent a good idea out of shape he could fix it , but until he does , bill clinton is right to attack the plan as a budgetbuster and a dagger aimed at poor families mr brown s basic idea creating a simplified code that encourages saving is exactly right but he ignores allimportant details the tragedy is that his cavalier attitude has armed his critics to denounce the one truly creative and important idea to emerge from this presidential campaign the present tax code is riddled with wasteful contradictions and complexity for example , profit from corporate investment is taxed twice when earned by the corporation and again when distributed to shareholders that powerfully discourages savings and investment the exact opposite of what the economy needs to grow the remedy is , in a word , integration , meshing personal and corporate codes so that the brunt of taxes falls on consumption , not saving tax reform should also simplify the code , making loopholes harder for congress to disguise , and enact and for reasons of elemental decency , tax reform should n't come at the expense of the poor remarkably , there is a reform that achieves all these objectives robert hall and alvin rabushka , economists at the hoover institution , have proposed an integrated code that applies a single rate to both personal and corporate income their plan wipes away most deductions and exemptions , permitting a low tax rate of 19 percent the important term is not flat but integrated under the hallrabushka plan , individuals would pay taxes on earnings and corporations would pay tax on interest , dividends and profits that way , every dollar of income would be taxed once and only once the plan would subsidize saving , and create an exemption that would protect the poor for that very good reason , hallrabushka is n't perfectly flat but it is perfectly simple the tax return would fit on a postcard jerry brown borrowed some of the elements of hallrabushka he too would eliminate wasteful exemptions , adopt a single rate and favor saving by exempting corporate investment but at that point , he turns glib he would impose on corporations a valueadded tax , similar to a national sales tax that eliminates the elegant symmetry of hallrabushka indirectly , mr brown s variation would tax some income twice which is why his supposed 13 percent rate would collect revenue equal to about 20 percent of total income mr brown s plan would also eliminate hallrabushka s lowincome exemption that makes his reform even more unfair the valueadded tax , acting as sales tax , would drive up consumer prices regressively the poor , unlike the rich , must spend most of their income on necessities with even a little thought , mr brown could have averted these disabling details he could have built in exemptions , credits and progressive rates to ease burdens on low and middleincome families he could have raised rates high enough to make his plan truly revenue neutral and he could have followed hallrabushka closely enough to produce a truly integrated code but for no obvious reason , he has done none of these things he may go on contending that his campaign represents poor and alienated voters but as it stands , his version of a superb idea turns the tax tables against them
belgrade , yugoslavia , march 23 less than two weeks before united nations peacekeeping troops are to begin deployment in force in contested areas of croatia , the 11weekold ceasefire in the republic has come under increasing strain with a surge in fighting between serbs and croats the tense situation in the republic of bosnia and herzegovina , where the 14 , 400member force will have its headquarters , also appears to have worsened , with outbreaks of heavy fighting in two towns , neum on the adriatic coast and gorazde , about 30 miles southeast of sarajevo , the capital in both republics , the violence reached a peak during the weekend , with signs today that the fighting was beginning to recede fighting was reported from more than a dozen towns in the republics , including several in croatia that were at the center of fierce battles during the sevenmonth civil war that erupted between serbs and croats after croatia declared its independence last june according to accounts reaching belgrade , at least a dozen people have been killed and many more wounded , but none of the recent fighting has compared with the bloodshed at the height of the war , which is estimated to have killed about 10 , 000 people united nations officials in sarajevo said there were no reports of injury to any of the 500 united nations personnel from 22 countries who have moved into the contested areas of croatia as advance units under current plans , united nations commanders expect to begin deploying the 12 infantry battalions at the core of the force into three areas of croatia about april 5 there have been worries that the force could find the croatian ceasefire collapsing around it , but officials who have assessed the recent action said that what appeared to have occurred was not a general breakdown in the ceasefire so much as an effort by serb and croat forces to improve their positions before the battalions are deployed map of yugoslavia showing locations of neum and gorazde
tower of love it is n't definite yet courtships can be tricky on long island , and she seems a little young , he a little slow but if they do mate , they could n't have picked a more romantic spot to make history a pair of peregrine falcons have set up housekeeping atop the jones beach water tower the birds , on the federal endangered species list , could become the first nesting pair of peregrines on long island in recent history , said mike scheibel , a senior wildlife biologist for the state department of environmental conservation we 're crossing our fingers , mr scheibel said we hope she gets under way soon that endangered birds of prey would select long island s most widely visited landmark as a home may seem odd to many , but to the falcons it makes perfect sense they like high rocky cliffs long island s coastal plains have few so they look for manmade spots , mr scheibel said that is why nine pairs of peregrines are now reported living in the new york metropolitan region they 're on the throgs neck bridge , the verrazano , the goethals , the outerbridge and the tappan zee , said the state manager of nesting sites for endangered species , christopher nadareski bridges look like cliffs to peregrine falcons they are also at home on several skyscraper ledges they live in the city yearround now , he said , because they feed on pigeons , and pigeons live there yearround the peregrine falcon , recognizable by its white and brown streaked breast , was almost wiped out in the early 1970 s because of ddt and other pesticides for the last 20 years just a few of the falcons have passed long island shores none have stayed but a conservation program is bringing them back it s exciting to be a small part of it , mr scheibel said his part has been supplying the bedroom peregrines do n't build traditional nests of sticks and twigs they lay the eggs right on a ledge , mr nadareski said on a skyscraper or a 200foothigh water tower that means the eggs can roll right off so the conservation department supplies nesting boxes mr scheibel placed one atop the jones beach tower it was dedication beyond the call of duty i'm not too happy with heights , he said but he is excited about a possible mating the female was in the nesting box making a scraping motion the other day , he said he saw her through a peephole he had made in the box the superintendent of jones beach state park , joseph lescinski , views the falcons in a more traditional way i 've got my binoculars right by the window , he said i watch the male sunning himself on the south side the superintendent would love to see a falcon family on the tower i wish them every success , he said he was n't sure how he would know there was success experts suggested listening it s really something when they court , mr nadareski said they 're very vocal birds they do a lot of screaming mr lescinski says he has heard no unusual screaming in the park so far mother goose on trial cynicism is no longer reserved for adults a group of long beach second graders recently put mother goose on trial they claimed that she was an unfit mother mother goose was not around when her children needed her , argued the prosecutor , chris labella , age 7 so the class sued her for negligence we were studying a unit on law , said susan abrahams , the teacher of the class for gifted and talented second graders at lindell elementary school to understand court procedure the 7 and8yearolds needed a defendant they chose the queen of nursery rhymes , mother goose class members became nurseryrhyme characters , writing their own modernized testimony derrick kenneltycohen was the old man in the shoe excuse me , but was n't it supposed to be an old woman in the shoe \? the prosecutor asked that was before women got their new rights , old man derrick said now a lot of women have great jobs , and the man stays home with the kids he was suing mother goose because she would not help him find a decent home we were homeless , he said , and we ended up living in a shoe do you know how cramped it is with kids in the toe and kids in the heel \? one of the three little pigs complained that mother goose was always sending the pigs out to build houses , including a condo for herself tom , tom the piper s son stole the pig because mother goose had told him to and you are always supposed to do what your mother says , he said one of the three little kittens caught pneumonia because he lost his mittens , and mother goose did n't get him new ones even with contac and chicken soup he was still sick , a kitten testified peter , peter the pumpkin eater said that his wife grew fat and that mother goose did nothing well , why did n't you give her a diet pepsi \? the defense lawyer , sarah monaghan , asked when mother goose was called to testify the characters booed it is n't easy being a mother , the goose said she had never copyrighted her stories , so she did n't have much money to take care of all her children prosecutor chris was relentless it runs in the family , said his mother , maura chris s father , charles , is an assistant united states attorney they practiced together , mrs labella said after summations , parents were asked to vote mother goose guilty or innocent the second grade found her guilty last week , a teacher , mildred mccarthy , said the defense attorney cried the parents , however , voted not guilty the prosecutor could n't believe it how many votes did i get \? chris asked she ca n't be innocent a few minutes later he was in the garbage pulling out the ballots he s going to ask for a recount , i know it , his mother said deer for the homeless john a meringolo of port jefferson has come up with an interesting proposal giving groundup deer meat to the homeless on long island there is an abundance of deer and an abundance of hungry homeless i 'd like to bring the two together , said mr meringolo , a hunter and lawyer who practices in commack we have people who have hunting licenses , and they wo n't shoot deer because their wives would kill them if they brought an animal home on the roof of the car , he said this gives them an opportunity to hunt they could bring the deer right to a butcher shop and have it ground into chop meat and distributed to the needy hunters in alabama and colorado donate their kill to nonprofit organizations , mr meringolo said the program is sponsored by safari international , a hunting and conservation club mr meringolo , a club member , would like to see the program in new york his research has found that the state department of agriculture and markets might have a problem with it officials say the law prohibits distributing meat that is not professionally slaughtered so mr meringolo is going to the legislature to try to have the law changed he knows that some people hate the idea of hunting deer but , he said , this is going to put the bambi people in a dilemma we tend to think of liberals as those who are champions of the needy and also opposed to hunting here they have a conflict other wild game is available , but deer seems the logical choice , said mr meringolo , who also hunts rabbit , quail and pheasant small game would n't be practical for this , he said if you used rabbit , you 'd have people picking over the bones photo members of susan abrahams s second gradeclass at the trial of mother goose , seen leaving the witness stand \( steve hart for the new york times \)
major league baseball s ownership committee held its first formal meeting to discuss a japanese company s bid to buy controlling interest of the seattle mariners , but the only decision resulting from the twohour meeting yesterday was that more information was needed because the committee members also said that they doubted they would have enough information gathered in time to make a presentation to the full body of club owners at a quarterly meeting in the first week of march , the mariners seem to be barreling toward a showdown with a march 27 date that the mariners owner believes to be the last day in which seattlearea groups will have the opportunity to purchase the team aside from announcing the decision to put off further joint action for a month , none of the committee members seven owners , two league presidents , commissioner fay vincent and steve greenberg , the deputy commissioner would reveal details of the meeting so it is not known whether the executives also discussed their policy of barring investment from outside north america , a stance that has been much debated since it was announced publicly on jan 23 in response to nintendo s initial overture next session is march 45 yesterday , the owners asked nintendo and its american partners to furnish more information and documentation for the committee to consider when it meets again the ownership committee s next session will take place in chicago during owners meeting , march 45 but fred kuhlmann , chairman of the committee , said in a written statement it is unlikely that the matter will be ready for submission to the major league ownership at that time getting its case to the full membership of owners is important for nintendo since the leagues actually do the voting on whether or not to approve the transfer of ownership of a franchise to gain approval , potential buyers for an american league team need an affirmative vote from 10 of the 14 american leagueclubs and 7 of the national league s 12 clubs by indicating that even more time may be needed , the ownership committee is taking the mariners intriguingly close to the march 27 deadline set by mariners owner jeff smulyan he contends the team will be freed of lease obligations to the king county s kingdome after that time though the county contests smulyan s claim , the owner has publicly stated that if a seattlearea buyer has not been approved by major league baseball by that time he has a right to sell the franchise to any bidder vincent has doused part of smulyan s contention by guaranteeing that the mariners would play in the kingdome this coming season smulyan attends meeting smulyan attended the meeting yesterday as a member of the ownership committee , but declined to comment on the march 27 deadline none of the other owners would comment on the issue the committee had previously discussed the offer by nintendo on jan 23 , the day the firm announced it would bid for the mariners but yesterday s meeting was the first called since nintendo and its fellow partners in the baseball club of seattle group had submitted the official documents offering 100 million for the club and an additional 25 million as operating revenue in that offer , nintendo has proposed that it provide 60 percent , or 75 million of the financing , making it the first japanese firm to officially test baseball s policies barring foreign ownership vincent , addressing the timetable , said , we 're trying to do this as efficiently and expeditiously as we can , but obviously we want to also do it properly he also pointed out that during his tenure , five teams montreal , san diego , seattle , texas and baltimore have changed ownership and that the time required to approve those sales was substantial
to the editor the latest demonstration of the unfortunate popular practice of lawyerbashing came from both president bush and vice president quayle in accepting their party s renominations on the last night of the republican national convention \( speech transcripts , aug 21 \) while the habit of blaming lawyers for many of society s ills has been practiced by both political parties , it has never received such prominent , nationwide , primetime exposure vice president quayle asserted that the nation s financial woes and overloaded court calendars were the fault of the legal profession he declared the explosion of frivolous lawsuits burdens our economy and weakens our system of justice the vice president , a lawyer himself , then presented , as prima facie evidence , that america has 5 percent of the world s population and 70 percent of the world s lawyers one can assume he will soon announce that the reason americans are annoyed with the federal government and the administration is that we have more newspapers , radio and television stations , reporters and editors per capita than the world s population average mr bush s denunciation of the legal profession was peppered with phrases like sharp lawyers , crazy lawsuits and every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasseled loafer there are , however , many causes for the high level of litigation initiated by citizens against physicians , hospitals , manufacturers and government america has the best protections of an individual s rights and ability to seek recourse for damages of any nation our federal and state constitutions , laws and court decisions wisely place great emphasis on an individual s prerogatives and ability to seek justice in the courts this is a blessing , not a curse curtailing this freedom would violate a basic principle of our society better and continued evaluation of doctors and hospitals , and quicker actions when warranted , are the means to reduce malpractice litigation and lower insurance costs weak product liability legislation or none at all , with almost meaningless government testing of a product s claims , safety and reliability , are the basis for much of today s civil actions against merchandise , drugs and goods the overburdened court calendars are due , in great measure , to the lack of sufficient numbers of judges and constant underfunding of our courts but the majority of civil suits against manufacturers , physicians and hospitals would not be initiated , entertained by the courts and supported by decision of juries if government agencies responsible for pro tecting the public lived up to their legal and moral obligations government , to a large extent , still follows a let the buyer beware policy , which leaves seeking justice in the courts as the only means of gaining protection and safety in the marketplace joseph a baum flushing , queens , aug 25 , 1992 the writer is president of the queens county bar association drawing

it was n't as if the yankees should n't have known long before george steinbrenner , then in power as the principal owner , agreed to sign pascual perez to a threeyear , 57 million contract , enough warnings had been posted as if they were highway signs for speed zone or construction , slow in 1984 , perez served three months in a dominican republic prison after a conviction for cocaine possession in 1989 , the righthanded pitcher missed all of spring training with the montreal expos while in a drugrehab center in 1990 , after perez arrived seven days late for his first spring training with the yankees because of what he described as visa problems , the expos manager then , buck rodgers , described perez as a time bomb that the yankees will have to monitor closely in his third start that season , perez departed with an ailing arm that required rotatorcuff surgery that august again last year , perez showed up late for spring training with the yankees ten days late visa problems this year he reported five days later than scheduled , but glowed that it was beautiful to be with his 26yearold brother , melido , a righthanded pitcher obtained from the chicago white sox in the offseason trade for second baseman steve sax even at home , we never played together , not even catch , pascual said now we 're together but now , 34yearold pascual perez is no longer together with his brother , the yankees , or baseball he has been suspended for one year by commissioner fay vincent for having failed a drug test taken feb 26 , the day he reported the time bomb finally exploded the time bomb the yankees knew was ticking , but did n't hear in the off season pascual perez s problem is his weakness , his illness what happened is his fault , not the yankees' fault and it s not as if the yankees did n't try at all from spring training until the season ended , general manager gene michael contended that the yankees had a guy who goes with him , who drives him around , who gets him places on time , who keeps him away from the wrong places two years ago , doc ellis , once a yankee pitcher turned drug counselor , was around him last year , cesar presbott babysat him but once pascual goes home to the dominican for the off season , michaels was saying , there s not much you can do wrong if you invest 57 million , you invest more than dozens of unanswered phone messages in the off season you go to san cristobal yourself or you send somebody to check him out if you invest 57 million , you invest more than a request that he pitch in the winter league to strengthen his arm after a twoyear record of 36 you make sure he pitches asked how much drugrelated support the yankees provided pascual over the last two years , michael bristled i could ask the same question how much did the commissioner s office do \? how much did his agent do \? the general manager said , alluding to tom reich how much did the players association do \? but the question lingers since perez was a yankee pitcher , how much did the yankees do \? unlike the mets , whose dr alan lans has supervised their employeeassistance plan for several years , the yankees do n't have a resident shrink although the yankees have what they call an affiliaton with the smithers institute , none of their players have ever been known publicly to have spent any time there , as both dwight gooden and darryl strawberry of the mets did the yankees have also asked for trouble by pursuing players with a drugrelated history , notably steve howe , the relief pitcher now facing a cocainerelated trial in montana in other years , the yankees acquired three players who had been disciplined by baseball for their involvement in the 1985 drug trial in pittsburgh claudell washington , rod scurry and dale berra but anybody familiar with perez s past could ask the basic question why did the yankees even consider signing him \? he had a good arm , said michael , then a yankee scout who would succeed harding \( pete \) peterson as general manager around the time of perez s rotatorcuff surgery people thought he could help us as it turned out , pascual perez could n't help himself but the yankees could have done more to help him and themselves photo pascual perez \( reuters \)
white plains the three dozen supporters at the westchester coalition for legal abortion should have been a piece of cake for attorney general robert abrams his abortionrights stand is a strong political card yet even here it was not straightforward why are n't you saying more on abortion \? asked a contributor why are we getting clouded up \? i did n't think i 'd have to repeat my record for this group , said mr abrams , flushing every stop i make , i mention i'm prochoice , it s one of the three cornerstones of my campaign for mr abrams , it has been a campaign where his message is constantly clouded up his opponent , senator alfonse m d'amato , has often controlled the agenda the senator has raised twice as much money as mr abrams , who still devotes half his day to fundraising it s hard for mr abrams not to hear himself being attacked when he turns on the radio or tv during an hourlong interview en route to a news conference thursday , mr abrams mainly answered questions in campaign jargon even with easy questions he was cautious asked what it was like battling a senator who had voted with president bush 80 percent of the time and yet now touts his similarities with bill clinton , mr abrams answered i feel like i'm living in a surreal world is that proper grammar \? he grew animated , when asked about senator d'amato s negative ads that reminds me , he said to his aide i heard a new d'amato commercial we 've got to get a copy 'fact bob abrams will raise medicare taxes on old people fact bob abrams will do this fact ! fact ! fact ! ' none of it s true it sounds like i hate old people , but all i hear is , 'fact ! fact ! fact ! ' his next stop should have been easy , a sidewalk news conference to blast mr d'amato s work on the senate banking committee but there was senator d'amato s press aide , zenia mucha , holding her own impromptu news conference beside mr abrams s news conference we do n't do this to you , said an abrams aide are n't i free to speak \? said ms mucha another d'amato staff member stood among reporters , asking mr abrams loaded questions mr abrams spent much of his news conference with a miserable , frozen smile the attorney general , a democrat , has n't had much luck selling even his best assets in 1990 the national association of attorneys general voted him the best in america he created the modern attorney general s office that s public policy oriented , says the group s president , jeffrey amestoy , a republican who is attorney general of vermont offices across the country look to new york yet mr abrams s ads do not mention the award eric goldstein , of the natural resources defense council , says mr abrams s office led challenges in the reagan and bush years , forcing tougher standards on acid rain and incinerator emissions matthew diller of the legal aid society , says mr abrams has been virtually unique in fighting for grants that the bush administration withheld from the poor , forcing the release of 200 million to new york mr abrams started a criminal division edward mcdonald , a former federal prosecutor and an expert on organized crime , credits the attorney general for first spotting massive tax fraud by the mafia in the gasoline industry they saw it before we did , he says and yet in the press you hear senator d'amato s charges more loudly that mr abrams procrastinated for days before taking a position on the persian gulf war and did the same before visiting crown heights during the racial disturbances last summer and that many cases he prosecuted were more show than substance the candidates' hate for each other is plain at the end of the recent radio debate on wfanam with don imus , they weakly shook hands , making no eye contact they did not speak during commercials you could have cut the tension , said mr imus the dirtiest state campaign in memory has taken a toll on senator d'amato , too at wfan mr imus noted that the senator seemed the more nervous of the two when he rose to shake mr imus s hand , mr d'amato knocked over the stand holding the moderator s questions a little tense , said charles mccord of wfan mr abrams has always been considered a strong campaigner , but this time he s been portrayed as the nebbish , boring and humorless you know i 've always found bob abrams to have a good sense of humor , says mr amestoy , the vermont attorney general i remember him at a convention walking around in shorts and tshirt , this attorney general people hold in awe and he s carrying around his daughters' crayons and coloring books and joking about it so what happened to the funny guy \? i guess i did n't really realize how vicious it would be , said mr abrams

moscow , nov 30 after five months of intense and sometimes emotional testimony , russia s highest court today upheld president boris n yeltsin s ban on the communist party but sidestepped any broad condemnation of the still potent legacy of soviet communism the 13member constitutional court found that mr yeltsin s decrees banning the soviet and russian communist parties after the aborted putsch of august 1991 were basically sound but it ruled that the issue of property was for civil courts to decide , and that lowlevel party units were legitimate the narrow legal decision was a far cry from the sweeping ban that mr yeltsin s supporters had sought in what they saw as the trial of communism or the russian nuremberg it was also far from the vindication of the party s tarnished ideals and history sought by the communists who really won \? in the end , the court chose a judicial compromise that did not fully satisfy either side , but left both grumpily claiming victory it also declared that since the soviet party was essentially defunct by the time of the decrees , and the russian party not yet legally registered , there was no need to rule on the separate issue of whether the party was constitutional with or without mr yeltsin s ban contributing to the dryness of the decision was the fact that the court announced its it with no explanation the chief justice , valery d zorkin , said the full opinion would be issued in two weeks but already it was evident that the muted decision would not have a major immediate impact on the political upheavals of the state eight heirs to party legacy mr yeltsin never banned communism , only the official communist party , and in the 15 months since the coup and the suspension of the party , diehard communists have already formed at least eight new parties , none with anywhere near the clout of old lawyers acknowledged that the ruling on property could prompt a welter of legal claims but they noted that since no one could legally claim to be a successor to a banned party , it was unlikely any of the countless properties seized from the party , ranging from the vast headquarters in moscow to innumerable resorts and rest homes , would ever be given back the decision came on the eve of what is expected to be a tempestuous session of parliament , and all sides had been anxious that an unfavorable ruling could bolster the other but in the absence of a strong verdict , the decision seemed to give no one much solace that may well have been what the court sought formed only six weeks before the coup attempt , the constitutional court was intended to give the new democracy something russia had never had an independent judiciary throughout the proceeding , justice zorkin struggled to enforce the unfamiliar concept , curtailing the constant political and ideological harangues independence of court at a news conference , mr zorkin admitted that the court was still far from a true third power to the executive and legislative , and not yet truly independent of the forces raging in the country but the decision today , he insisted , was not a political compromise there is , if you understand me correctly , a constitutional compromise , he said , adding in my view , we must live within the framework of the law there is a legal platform , and on either side is dictatorship or anarchy the hearing was actually a merger of two petitions the first was filed by communists seeking to overrule mr yeltsin s ban on the party the president s supporters countered with a suit seeking to declare the communist party unconstitutional and criminal rebuilding from below after the ruling , communists declared that they would start rebuilding the russian party from the newly legal primary cells mr yeltsin s supporters said they were satisfied that the party had in fact been declared unconstitutional the court displayed a very interesting methodology , said sergei baburin , one of the most vocal procommunist members of parliament and himself a legal expert it s as if a doctor is asked whether a patient is dead or alive 'the right hand is warm , ' the doctor says , 'the left is cold , the heart is ripped out but seems to be beating , the kidneys are gone but you decide yourself if he s dead' mikhail a fedotov , a lawyer on mr yeltsin s side , declared it a halfdecision that could pose problems for the government but he also acknowledged that it was probably the only position the court could take 'concrete composition' of court i am satisfied with it , given the concrete political situation and the concrete composition of the court , he said after decades of regimentation , it s very difficult , psychologically difficult , for them to declare the party unconstitutional they understand it s unconstitutional , but they 're not able to pronounce it mr fedotov was alluding on one level to the fact that all but one of the justices just as most of the lawyers , and for that matter mr yeltsin and virtually all his administration had been communists not many were prepared to declare that everything they once believed in and worked for was utterly wrong but mr fedotov s thought also applied more broadly to the entire process , which began last may 26 by sheer volume , it was a monumental case 52 sessions were held , 46 witnesses were called , 16 experts were heard and a mountain of documents , many culled from the most secret files of the communist party , were submitted the witnesses included some of the most powerful men of the former regime nikolai i ryzhkov , vladimir i dolgikh , yegor k ligachev but the most prominent of all , mikhail s gorbachev , raised the one notable controversy when he refused to participate in what he dubbed a political show the last soviet president was briefly barred from going abroad , but in the end the court canceled its summons yet the process never captured any public interest on most days the courtroom was all but empty , and none of the commentaries in the press ever treated it as the great trial of communism that mr yeltsin s side wanted to underscore its new role as a disinterested referee , the court moved immediately after upholding mr yeltsin s ban of the communist party to a hearing on his recent ban of the national salvation front , a newly formed coalition of communists and nationalists the court is widely expected to overturn this ban
two black couples , each of whom had been awarded 100 , 000 in compensatory damages in a racial discrimination case saw that award reduced to 20 , 000 last week by a federal judge in manhattan , who found that that the discrimination , by a realestate company , was not serious or profound enough to warrant the higher amount the judge , robert w sweet , also ruled that the harry macklowe real estate company did not have to pay 62 , 500 in punitive damages , on the ground that there was no malicious racial intent behind a series of advertisements for two of its luxury apartment buildings in manhattan that featured only white models last month , a jury had awarded the two couples and a fair housing organization a total of 262 , 500 in compensatory and punitive damages after finding that the macklowe company had violated a federal antidiscrimination law by using only white models in a series of advertisements for riverbank west , at 555 west 44th street , and river terrace , 515 east 72d street but because the jury had only four members when it made the award , or two less than the legally required number , its verdict was only advisory , leaving judge sweet with final authority the two couples , deborah and luther ragin and renaye and jerome culyler , contended they suffered indignation , humiliation and distress because the ads made them feel they would not be welcome at the two buildings but judge sweet said whatever emotional distress they suffered was caused by racial discrimination in this country and was not caused by the macklowe company while there is no doubt that the individual plaintiffs were offended by the defendant s ads , they have not established that the ads caused them to suffer profound emotional distress , the judge said for example , he said none of them sustained depression that has affected their relationships judge sweet also found that the evidence did not support the jury s finding that the macklowe company acted with racially discriminatory intent a lawyer for the couples , thomas a holman , said he was disappointed with the ruling but had not decided if he would appeal

michelle marriott , an elementaryschool teacher from australia , wanted to go to niagara falls she stood patiently in line at a ticket window in pennsylvania station for 45 minutes , only to be told that amtrak could not take her there , that the trains last night were sold out and that amtrak was taking no reservations for today though an amtrak strike was averted late last night , that did not help commuters caught off guard all day yesterday gayle olsenraymer of mckinleyville , calif , was in new york for a longplanned meeting with the publisher of her new college text on terrorism the meeting had been scheduled for today , but yesterday , after what amounted to a crash course in transportation logistics , she canceled it for commuters , chaos a couple of conversations with clerks at penn station were enough to convince her that if she stayed in new york , she might not be able to take a train to washington and join her two children for the trip home it was the uncertainty that troubled them on suburban commuter platforms and in stuffy waiting rooms at penn station , passengers had braced yesterday for a possible strike by amtrak and conrail employees that would have also disrupted service on the long island rail road and on nj transit but a systemwide strike was averted at least temporarily after rail maintenance workers said overnight that they would hold off any action for two days , after failing to reach agreement on a new contract by a 12 01 am deadline today canceled trains nevertheless , some nj transit and long island rail road trains had already been canceled early this morning in anticipation of a strike , stranding commuters like christina page , 21 , of lynbrook , li , at penn station ms page , a writer for ms magazine , missed the 11 49 pm train to port washington , li , last night , the last train before the deadline , leaving her with no idea how she would get home life is really tough , she said james longaro , an lirr spokesman , said he expected all service to be restored by rush hour this morning , but warned commuters to expect delays commuters with questions can call the railroad at \( 718 \) 217lirr or \( 516 \) 822lirr , he said kathleen donohue , a spokeswoman for nj transit , said she expected normal service into and out of penn station this morning commuters with questions can call nj transit at \( 800 \) 7722222 or \( 201 \) 7625100 the strike , by 20 , 000 workers at amtrak , conrail and 40 freight lines , was postponed , for two days , just before today s 12 01 am deadline it would have closed down penn station , from the baggageclaim counter to the concourse gift shop , where batterypowered seals spend their days squirming across the floor , balancing plastic beach balls on their noses the commuter lines serving the new york metropolitan region , although not directly involved in the dispute , would not have made their usual runs into and out of penn station because amtrak controls the tracks that the lirr uses through western queens , as well as long stretches of track used by nj transit lirr workers handed out brochures with maps showing how to survive a rush hour involving unfamiliar changes at jamaica the strike would have left 66 , 000 commuters 40 , 000 from the lirr and 26 , 000 from nj transit scrambling to go to manhattan transit authority officials prepared for 40 , 000 extra subway riders 'my second day on the job' like thousands of other commuters , linda maurice , another spokeswoman for nj transit , tried to figure out what to do if she could not take the raritan valley line to newark this is just my second day on the job , she said everything s very new some commuters figured that they would just take the day off in the event of a strike i already told my boss not to expect me , said rich garhmann , a computer engineer from piscataway , nj at pennsylvania station in newark , which unlike its more modern manhattan counterpart is an oldfashioned train station , commuters milled around discussing alternatives robert zale , who works in the gateway center in newark , said he would rather drive from his home in rahway than take a bus the turnpike will be a mess , but it s always a mess , he said maria quintana of elizabeth , a seamstress in newark , said she would take a regular bus to avoid the crush of bodies on the special buses none of the alternatives will be fun , she said but commuting is n't supposed to be , is it \?
i fell across a passage in george eliot s daniel deronda a few days ago it is not really about music but speaks to people who hear a lot of it young deronda is looking with apprehension at his uninteresting future , and eliot writes he dreaded , as if it were a dwellingplace of lost souls , that dead anatomy of culture which turns the universe into a mere ceaseless answer to queries , and knows not everything , but everything else about everything as if one should be ignorant of nothing concerning the scent of violets except the scent itself for which one had no nostril forgive the victorian syntax , which out of context seems forbidding it is worth reading again , especially by the critics , annotators , scholars , journalists and commentators \( myself spread somewhere among them \) who have toiled over a chosen subject , circled it assiduously , and may have ended up knowing everything else about everything but not the thing itself some 20 years ago i went to hear leonardo balada s steel symphony , a depiction in sound of life within a pittsburgh mill my companion s grandfather had come from eastern europe and spent his life in one similar her father began as a steelworker and escaped into the whitecollar world she had grown up in the shadow of the giant jones laughlin mill she knew who beethoven was , vaguely afterward , my companion listed in order the activities she had heard in the steel symphony , from blast furnace to rolling mill i heard none of these things later i confirmed that all were there for my part , using what might pass as a trained ear , i had made myself ignorant of nothing concerning mr balada s music its instrumentation , use of rhythm , dynamic effects , thematic layout she , presented with violets , leaned over and smelled them a happy accident of naivete \? i think not this was innocence free of encumbrance , able to penetrate to the sensuous act itself i , on the other hand , found myself in eliot s dwellingplace of lost souls , answering questions that danced around music i was not really hearing knowledge means different things for different people for some it is like bodybuilding accumulated weight and sinew add ballast to the spirit , give it a center of gravity but knowledge can also become an impediment , like a callus that thwarts the sense of touch i and my colleagues know a lot and may not be doing enough touching take beethoven s eroica symphony most of us know at least 20 of its recordings we have filed away memorable performances heard in the concert hall we produce our stopwatches bruno walter conducts the funeral march in 15 minutes 33 seconds , frans bruggen in 13 minutes 9 seconds the opening eflat chords are subject to our measurements we put them on the scales toscanini registers bite , furtwangler breadth , solti sheer violence but i wonder , as yet again this great music leaps out at us from silence , if our investigations have led us astray , become mere ceaseless answer to queries some would argue that the eroica , like all art , comes to us in little pieces of perception a picture puzzle is to be assembled from many fragments the more pieces we capture , the clearer the picture eliot does n't think so for her , knowledge pursued unquestioningly is a sinus condition it makes smelling flowers difficult so is ignorance bliss \? eliot might put it another way knowing is a corrective procedure , like going to the optometrist before we go to the art gallery knowing can get us on the right track , but it is not a destination the trick of hearing music and few of us master it is to know when to stop knowing and surrender ourselves to the blessed mindlessness known as listening and to that end , a brief list of suggested do s and do n't s may they bring you closer to the particular violets in front of you on the eve of an eroica performance , do n't listen to the eroica at home lie in bed put a pillow over your head think about sex do your laundry under no circumstances come out of a performance and say to your companions , well , what do you think \?

as meeting the new head of county hospitals \( dec 29 \) made clear , the county medical center s recent history taught different lessons to different players county executive andrew p o'rourke , the board of legislators , mack l carter jr , carol farkas \( then chairwoman of the hospital advisory board \) and the physicians represented by dr george e reed have offered diverse and interesting interpretations of what occurred before the proceedings to confirm mr carter as commissioner of hospitals the disparities are so great as to suggest that either the players live in different worlds from each other or that none of their statements can be believed without reservation following the proceedings , mr carter , who evidently made a close study of the clarence thomas hearings and burst into tears when he described the effects of racism , suggested that this episode is about the hospital and what we can do to make it better mrs farkas , who earlier announced that the advisory board would undertake a legal action to prevent mr carter from assuming his position , declared that there never was a war , and the hospital must move forward ernest davis , a black legislator who helped decide for a population of various religions and hues the man who would manage their largest healthcare facility , claimed , i'm a product of 400 years of racism , and offered up that claim as a legitimate argument for confirmation not a word was said by the players about the sorry history of policies at a medical center where the commitment to public relations has become all consuming nor was it even hinted that the trouble with mentalities completely devoted to such intangibles as opinions and good will is that reality gets short shrift , and breakdowns in services become inevitable thus , for example , if you complain to the medical center about a stay characterized by a filthy room and bad service , at a charge of more than 1 , 000 a day , you receive a warm , friendly communication advising that the problem has been recognized and will be addressed physicians will advise that they are incensed by the managerial incompetence and that is the last you ever hear about the matter mr carter s proceedings might have offered great comic relief except for the fact that at some time or other any westchester resident could be a patient at the center dr reed happily reports that rich and poor receive the same care if so , the medical center may be the only healthcare facility in the nation in which all classes of society can rightly make common cause against administrative chaos in the riot of accusations that accompanied the proceedings , if it was possible to find one group utterly confused , it was the advisory board aside from exercising a nondefined function with respect to the commissioner of hospitals \( the adjective , advisory , hardly tells the public who is responsible for what \) , the board members were prey to mr o'rourke s attempts to make certain that they lost any claims to respect not only did he contemptuously dismiss the procedure by which the commissioner was to be chosen , he suggested to the board members that they retire from the scene , supplying them with both a draft letter of resignation and stamped envelopes addressed to his office the call for the board s mass departure turned out to be as meaningless a gesture as the board s threatened legal action what the confirmation process has taught the public is what the new york state commission on government integrity had to say about westchester county s government in the late 1980 s namely , that it is blemished all the way through milton goldin tarrytown

young korean choreographers the danspace project st mark s church second avenue at 10th street korean modern dance as performed in new york city over the past two decades or so has seemed freshly imaginative , with much of the simplicity and power of traditional korean dance and none of the derivative look of the modern dance presented by many countries where the form is received rather than homegrown the young korean choreographers concert , presented by the american dance festival on thursday night , reinforced that impression the program , to be repeated tonight , was a happy blend of the old and new , almost all of it charming and provocative the range of traditional korean dance was suggested with taepyung mu , an old court dance performed by a queen for her king , and the more abstract salpuri the first solo served to introduce the gliding , dipping style that generally characterizes the old dances , along with a look of rootedness that is never heavy the costume added extra charm to taepyung mu , as did the traditional score , so subtle yet so enjoyably raucous in salpuri , the performer is dressed in white robes and carries a slender white sash it is that piece of cloth that seems to motivate the solo , a slightly broken flow of more formal motion , serving as the dance s poetic voice an extra richness of texture is created with pauses or sloweddown rhythms , delicate flicks of the hands and arms and pivotturns inyoung son , who danced both solos , is an exquisitely gracious performer whose concentration and focus made salpuri look like a gradually unfolding natural phenomenon the program s two other dances were modern and narrative in les jeux interdits , a delightfully nutty look at the adam and eve story choreographed and performed by hae joon park and mee young yuk , two hip youngsters bump up and down , fight and embrace on a large sofa to jaunty , lilting music by carlos d'alessio an apple intervenes , of course , this one plucked out of a lantern he chomps on it she watches and they capitulate to sadness in a slow walk in fading light miss yuk , who also designed the costumes , has a charmingly woebegone face and both she and mr park dance with a compellingly savvy innocence the theme is familiar , but their treatment of it is n't that was n't the case , however , with the concluding dance , nostalgia , choreographed by ae sook chang two young women and a young man sit glumly around a large table they are joined by a second young man photographs are spilled solemnly out of a handsome white basket red flowers are scattered across the table and the dappled floor though wellperformed , nostalgia never pricks the surface of regretful memory the dance was performed by the choreographer , mi kyung song , so byung koo and jeong joon ahn the stage design was by mi ra lee , the decor by jin hwan ahn and the costumes by yu sook lee visa problems caused the cancellation of a bird s eye view , a dance by hee jin kim photo in nostalgia , ae sook chang , left , the choreographer , and jeong joon ahn performed in the american dance festival presentation \( beatriz schiller \)
washington , jan 4 syria , lebanon and jordan postponed the departure of their negotiating teams today for the second round of peace talks with israel in washington , joining the palestinians in protest over israel s planned deportation of 12 palestinians from the occupied territories united states officials said , however , that they expected the palestinians , syrians , jordanians and lebanese to turn up in washington , where the talks are scheduled to resume at the state department on tuesday the officials said that the four delegations apparently felt the need to make some gesture of protest over the israeli actions , but that none of them appeared to want to scuttle the talks over the issue more explosive issue the chief palestinian spokeswoman , hanan ashrawi , said by telephone from her home in the west bank that the palestinians are making our point by delaying their departure but she said it was her surmise that the palestinians and others would end up going to washington , now that the united states has strongly condemned the israeli deportation orders at the first round of washington negotiations in december , israel postponed its delegation s arrival in protest the venue of the talks , which israel had wanted to hold in the middle east while the postponements are troubling , united states officials are more worried about another issue that could have a far more lasting and explosive impact on the negotiations israel s pending request for 10 billion in housing loan guarantees to resettle soviet jews the loan request is coming up for reconsideration coincidental with this second round of peace talks in washington , and how the bush administration responds to the israeli request could drive either israel or the arabs away from the negotiating table when the israeli loan guarantee request was first raised last september , the bush administration insisted despite israeli complaints that it be postponed 120 days so that the issue would not complicate washington s efforts to get the first round of the peace talks convened in madrid us plans demands the reason the loan issue might have complicated the peace talks is that the administration intends to demand certain restrictions on any new settlements that israel might build as a precondition for the loan guarantees united states officials knew that this demand would lead to a dispute with the israeli government that might have dissuaded israel from taking part in the peace talks administration officials say recent actions by the israeli government have not diminished the inclination of president bush and secretary of state james a baker 3d to insist on restrictions on israel s use of any american loan guarantees in building settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the actions american officials point to range from the israeli government s decision to allow jewish settlers to buy homes in silwan , an arab neighborhood in east jerusalem , over the protests of mayor teddy kollek , to prime minister yitzhak shamir s promise to farright members of his coalition last week that he would spend twothirds of his 1992 housing construction budget some 350 million on new jewish settlements one administration official said prime minister shamir is behaving in a very shortsighted manner the official said mr shamir appears to be doing almost anything to placate farright parties to hold his coalition together , without considering how his actions might affect president bush and the american public at precisely the time the loan guarantee issue is coming up again obviously this is something that we will be watching very closely , said rashid khalidi , a historian at the university of chicago who has served as an adviser to the palestinian delegation the continuation of settlements affects vital palestinian interests and ultimately the peace process itself there can be peace or there can be settlements , but there ca n't be both no decisions made according to senior administration officials , no decisions have been made yet on how washington will respond to the israeli request all the administration has been telling the israelis for the past four months is that if and when such guarantees are granted , washington reserves the right to attach certain terms and conditions on how the money is spent israeli officials say that since september they have been trying to find out from the administration what terms and conditions they might attach , particularly regarding israeli settlement activities unfortunately we have not received any answers , one israeli official said we 'll address that when the president gets back from asia next week , a senior administration official said about the loan guarantee issue i would not speculate on what the outcome might be these loan guarantees would allow israel to raise money from commercial banks at preferential rates of interest the cost to the american budget depends on certain accounting rules , but would probably require at least 200 million to be set aside american jews mute support interestingly , many prominent american jews , who actively lobbied the administration for the guarantees back in september , have since adopted a much more lowkey approach
washington , april 3 just as the summer season for transatlantic travel begins , a dispute between the united states and france over how many passengers united states airlines may carry between the two countries is threatening to disrupt flights and increase ticket prices after the latest round of negotiations in washington ended fruitlessly on tuesday , france warned that it intended to act unilaterally to restrict the capacity of the american carriers , which have made strong gains recently , perhaps as early as this weekend but by this evening it was uncertain what steps , if any , the french government would take immediately it appears that the uncertainty might last for a few days , if not longer , as the brinkmanship that typifies such negotiations takes over the dispute could have implications for americans flying to other countries as well the bush administration is reluctant to accede to the french demand out of fears that germany , japan or other nations might follow suit eventually , airline and administration officials warned , the dispute may severely disrupt air travel france wants the eight american carriers that fly to france to cut their available seats by 500 , 000 , or nearly 20 percent , in the coming six months then , air france , which is heavily subsidized by the french government , would face less pressure to compete for passengers by cutting fares passengers from both nations would end up paying higher fares regardless of which airline they chose although the united states has been pressing its trading partners for more free trade in airline flights , this dispute shows how far from a free market the situation remains although domestic air travel was deregulated in the 1970 s , for international routes the airlines and the governments in effect negotiate cartellike marketing agreements that vary in the kinds of restrictions they impose the dispute comes as travel between the two countries is recovering strongly from the recession mainly to the benefit of the united states airlines , which have captured at least twothirds of the market most of the eight american carriers that fly to france resubmitted their schedules today , ignoring the french demand some made modest reductions , but without eliminating anything near the 20 percent , 500 , 000seat cut that the french have demanded , representatives of several airlines said we are planning to fly our schedules as announced , said a spokewoman for united airlines , lynn martenstein we remain confident that the us government will be able to resolve outstanding issues with the french government on tuesday , transportation secretary andrew card signaled a tough negotiating stand in a speech before a large gathering of aviation industry executives in washington he said he had spoken to his french counterpart , paul quiles , and had insisted that the americans be allowed to fly their full schedules let me be clear about this issue the united states places a very high value on its bilateral agreements , mr card said , referring to a 1990 agreement between the two countries we respect those agreements , and we honor them faithfully and we do expect the same from our trading partners laurent aublin , the spokesman for the french embassy , replied that in the french view the 1990 agreement , which would have accommodated the increase in service sought by the americans , was superseded by the original 1946 aviation treaty between the two nations and could be revised at will in any event , he said , the french are willing to allow an increase in seats , but not as many as the americans have sought the americans hope to sell 27 million tickets between the two countries for april through october flights , better than a 40 percent increase from the 19 million tickets sold in 1991 the french have insisted that the total come to no more than 22 million seats this summer many different air fares thousands of different air fares are in effect between various american and french airports , depending on when a flight is , how far in advance it is reserved , special promotions and other factors , but as one airline executive said , if the number of seats is cut back , the lowest fares will be the ones to go the united states carriers flying to france are american , continental , delta air lines , northwest , tower airlines , trans world airlines , united airlines and usair none are heavily dependent on flights to france , but several are planning to add to their service between the two countries this month for example , united airlines will begin using a boeing 747 instead of a smaller plane from washington s dulles international airport on saturday , and will inaugurate nonstop 767 service from san francisco on sunday if france turns down increases in service , washington can retaliate immediately by restricting air france flights to the united states the only reductions that the united states is willing to offer would be those proposed voluntarily by american airlines during the negotiations , the airlines volunteered to cut between 100 , 000 and 150 , 000 seats , but the french rejected

a british airways concorde that reported problems with one of its engines landed safely at kennedy international airport yesterday morning with a large section of its rudder sheared away , officials said none of the 58 passengers aboard the supersonic jetliner flight b1 from heathrow airport in london was injured or apparently even aware there had been a problem it was not immediately clear when the piece of rudder , which measured 5 feet by 10 feet , fell from the plane , but emergency rescue crews called to runway 4r after the pilot shut down an engine were the first to notice it was missing , a spokesman for the federal aviation administration said the pilot reported that he had shut off one of the plane s four engines because of serious vibration as the plane descended on its approach to new york city , the spokesman , duncan pardue , said the plane , which departed at 5 30 am eastern standard time and landed on schedule at 9 12 am , was cruising at 1 , 350 miles an hour 53 , 000 feet above the atlantic when the pilot first reported a small vibration in one of the engines , a spokesman for british airways , john lampl , said after the vibration worsened and the pilot shut down the engine as a precaution , the plane landed safely as emergency rescue crews stood waiting when it landed , the first thing everybody saw was that something was wrong with the rudder , mr lampl said the piece was missing from the front section of the rudder , he said mr lampl said it did not appear that the engine problem was related to the torn rudder , but rather that the two were an odd coincidence a concorde has never crashed , but there were two previous incidents like yesterday s , mr lampl said in those incidents one a scheduled flight from london to new york and the other a chartered flight between new zealand and australia small sections of the planes' rudders tore away during flight after water eroded sections of the laminated surface , he said there was no danger to the passengers or the crew of the flight , he said
just to prove that he does n't hold a grudge , pat riley gave greg anthony and anthony mason back their minutes just to demonstrate that they had learned their lesson , anthony and mason made riley look like the coaching genius he is paid so handsomely by the knicks to be just in case anyone believed riley was ready to rotate eight players , and turn his team over to crafty veterans , he turned back against the grain of conventional wisdom last night , using mason , anthony and rookie hubert davis for the final 15 minutes 33 seconds of the knicks' 9888 victory over the washington bullets at madison square garden it was those players who , along with patrick ewing \( 28 points , 18 rebounds \) , ignited a 2811 run at the start of the fourth quarter , as the knicks shook off a familiar lethargy they were struggling against a bad bullets team further weakened by injuries to pervis ellison and rex chapman and a dismal performance by their star rookie , tom gugliotta of huntington , li , whose homecoming became a scoreless 39minute , 7turnover nightmare down to the wire the whole thing came down to the fourth quarter , said riley , who was happy to volunteer that his team had challenged 70 percent of washington s fourthquarter shots it was a tossup as to which was more impressive , the knicks' team defense or their coaching staff s amazing capacity to compute such an eclectic statistic minutes after the fourth quarter had ended the defense , especially as played by mason and anthony , was firstrate , and helped the knicks lower their leagueleading defensive average to 936 mason locked up harvey grant , who scored 24 points over the first three quarters and none in the fourth anthony s quick hands and happy feet became a severe nuisance to the bullet guards , and provided an eyecatching 7 assists and 3 steals in 16 minutes as for anthony s penchant for heaving up more shots than he has a right to , he took three last night , none of them terribly offensive we were struggling , coach looked at the bench and they responded , said doc rivers the defense created our offensive , and what greg did was great , especially for a guy who had just been taken out of the rotation it was exactly what riley had in mind when he referred to his angry young men as role players who , with john starks , were benched during last saturday s victory over orlando role players \? riley never said their roles had to be small , provided they provided a jump start to the knicks' transition game and managed to steer clear of becoming too distracted with selfabsorbed macho nonsense i 'll play whatever combination is playing well , said riley not part of any combination once again was starks , whom riley was not yet prepared to grant a work release looking up to find approaching reporters , starks waved them away , as did anthony , who would n't even discuss his exemplary 16 minutes of retribution he 'll get his chance , riley said of starks , whose minutes have been taken by rolando blackman , which was supposed to happen , and by davis , which was n't he s the one guy i'm not worried about , rivers said i 'd hate to be on the other team when john does get back the guy he guards is going to catch hell which is similar to what fourthquarter life was for grant when mason , who also had 13 points and 5 rebounds in his 24 minutes , was asked what he had done to try to shut down grant , he looked insulted by the choice of words you mean when i tried or when i did \? he said his point precisely made , mason explained he s an excellent jump shooter and curl player , so you have to stay with him all the time force him wide when he curls to the basket , stay right in his chest the knicks took a 6663 lead into the fourth quarter , which began with ewing draining a 15footer and then following a missed anthony layup on the break mason scored three of the knicks' next four baskets , and the knicks' lead grew to 10 , at 7969 the game did n't get completely away from the bullets until inside the last six minutes , when anthony , driving across the lane , found charles oakley for a layup , followed by mason scoring on a 3point play set up by anthony s perfect bounce feed to the low post it s about the team , said riley , in summary , referring to the lessons of saturday s benching about the team , he was reminded that it had struggled at home against a team it might have buried early , and had once again failed to score 100 points getting to 100 points is like a miracle for us , he said he will take the smaller ones , like anthony s and mason s quick lesson , and work from there photos knicks' greg anthony , who returned to action last night , driving past bullets' tom gugliotta knicks won , 9888 \( pg b9 \) bullets' guard michael adams , who had 19 points last night , leaping toward the basket past knicks' doc rivers at right \( pg b11 \) \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
new york city parents scrambled yesterday to improvise day care and find ways to amuse their children as they coped with a virtually unprecedented weeklong school vacation in the dead of winter some dropped their children off at grandparents' homes others juggled baby sitters' schedules , dragged their children to the office or simply took the day off from work although parents knew about the break since late last year , many had trouble adjusting their lives to it for lowincome working parents this week is a nightmare , said jan atwell , president of the united parents association , who led a placardwaving demonstration by 75 parents at the board of education s headquarters in brooklyn yesterday the danger is that there are children around the city being left alone or poorly supervised many parents ca n't afford child care to help parents through the week s rough spots , the board of education organized what it called keys to the city , kids week it opened 170 of the 991 schools , most simply to serve breakfast and lunch and offer some recreation in the morning hours , and at 66 of these schools it offered a handful of daylong instructional classes it also put together a list of 400 activities available around the city to occupy children , many arranged just for this week by private companies , museums and charities the uncommon midwinter break , which will become a permanent feature of the school calendar , was begun this year as part of complex budgetcutting deal under which the united federation of teachers was persuaded to defer 40 million in wages until 1995 the recess , which many suburban school districts have long had , was devised by clustering lincoln s birthday and washington s birthday in the same week and giving students and teachers an additional three days off the board said it served 14 , 114 lunches and 4 , 436 breakfasts yesterday , but at some schools the turnout was a disappointment at public school 33 in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan , only 11 of the school s 400 students showed up for lunch and none for breakfast those who made it to lunch got the kind of attention even the most exclusive private schools do n't offer watching and feeding six children at ps 33 as they sat at a lone table in the cafeteria were two security guards , two cafeteria workers , a teacher , a teacher s aide , a dietitian and at least two custodial workers although the teacher and the aide were prepared to amuse them with bingo and other games , the students slowly chewed their fried chicken , pears , and chocolate chip cookies and then dashed out for the freedom of the streets five more students , the board of education said , showed up for lunch before the day was over it s a waste , said luisa ferrera , a cafeteria worker who had cooked 75 meals in the expectation that there might be a bigger turnout instructional days originally , schools chancellor joseph a fernandez and sandra feldman , president of the united federation of teachers , promised that teachers would make up the additional three days off by working other holidays , but the only day they could ultimately agree on was election day mr fernandez argues that no instructional days were lost because the two other days would have been teachertraining days , but critics say that under some possible calendar arrangements two instructional days could have been added without sacrificing the teachertraining days the last time the system had a midwinter break was during the fiscal crisis of the mid1970 s , when schools were closed as a way of saving heating expenses one place that drew a large number of children was the brooklyn children s museum chase manhattan bank , one of many companies sponsoring activities , arranged for 250 children from four brooklyn schools and two centers run by the children s aid society to spend the day savoring the museum s pleasures children raced up and down a 200footlong sloping tunnel with a bubbling stream and waterfalls and they petted a twopound marine toad named gina while the children enjoyed the time off , many adults at the museum said they were unhinged by the unusual vacation julia moliere , a parttime museum employee , said her husband had to take two days off from his job as a paralegal to care for their children , lyle , 11 years old , and jenel , 2 , and she planned to leave them with her sister for the remaining days 'no preparation' i 'll have to sit down and think about what i 'll do with them for the rest of the week , she said you 've got these programs set up for the kids but somebody s got to take them and pick them up gwen williams , the museum s director of public affairs , said the museum s phones were ringing incessantly with calls from frenzied parents looking for amusements beyond the museum , ronda smith of manhattan , a childcare administrator , said she searched fruitlessly yesterday for a baby sitter for her two children ian , 12 , and kirin , 9 , until her husband , david , decided to take them to his art gallery she is hoping that her motherinlaw will take care of them for the rest of the week i'm terribly annoyed , she said there was no preparation or thought put into this john fager , executive vice president of the parents coalition for education , is fortunate enough to have a spouse who works as a teacher , so she had the week off to care for their 12yearold daughter , patty , a student at manhattan east public school mother and daughter planned to spend the week sightseeing what s positive about an unsupervised week vacation \? mr fager said and what about parents who both work , or ca n't afford day centers \? movies and double dutch at the parents' demonstration , nancy plese , a freelace writer from brooklyn , said she was writing at night this week so she could spend the daytime with her 8yearold son , andrew i'm taking care of a woman s child on thursday because she could n't find child care , ms plese said this is so unfair to working parents at ps 33 , where administrators would not allow children to give their full names , rasheeda , 11 , said she liked the break because she could sleep later and because she had the time to see the film juice tanya , 10 , said she was going to spend part of the week skipping rope in games of double dutch i like sometimes having nothing to do , but it s good to

it s a risky business to select an olympic squad a year ahead of time this may be dawning on the committee that selected the united states men s basketball team so hucksters could sell stamps and coins and tickets and advertising based on familiar names like bird , jordan and johnson however , larry bird s back is creaky , michael jordan is touchy about the league s exploiting him for endorsements , and magic johnson has retired because of hiv meanwhile , dennis rodman has emerged as one of the most formidable players in the world , yet he is not on the 10man olympic a list rodman , who is merely leading the league in rebounds with 18 a game , will not necessarily show to advantage in sunday s allstar game he s a very unique individual , but he wo n't get the minutes to show what he does , said chuck daly , his coach from detroit , who would not mind having rodman on the olympic team next summer , if the committee members bothered to ask daly s opinion oh , yes , and take a look at the two starting point guards on sunday , those close friends , magic johnson and isiah thomas they are going to be beautiful , going at each other none other than charles barkley is mouthing off that magic should not be an allstar because he has not played a minute all season but magic is in good shape , and as don nelson , the allstar coach , said last sunday , magic is going to have some bad moments in the future and deserves as many good moments as possible charles just oughta shut up this time magic will be playing for the feelings , for the memories , but isiah will be sending a message to michael jordan , who apparently does n't want isiah as a teammate , and isiah will also be sending a message to the selection committee from usa basketball you remember usa basketball , those bumblers who let the united states get to seoul , south korea , for the 1988 summer games without 3point shooters or international experience then usa basketball sent the wrong message to its college players at the panamerican games in cuba last summer , flying them to a luxury motel in florida between games the american kids did not have the resolve to stand off puerto rico in the semifinals this kind of embarrassment is not likely to happen this summer in barcelona , spain there is no soviet union or yugoslavia as we knew them , and for the first time , the united states is sending national basketball association stars i have been writing for years that the olympics should never have crossed the ultimate border of professionalism , which i used to call the magic line but the olympics are only about money now , and its leaders are selling the summer games on the prospect that john mcenroe and magic johnson will be there the united states has done itself no favors by picking a team a year in advance anticipating injuries or illness or changes of heart , daly has been saying all along that the squad was only a marvelous rough draft jordan , scottie pippen , john stockton , karl malone , charles barkley , chris mullins , patrick ewing , david robinson , johnson and bird the final two spots will be filled by at least one college player and probably one professional it has been my belief that isiah should never have been excluded so soon like magic and bird , he made his reputation in the past decade , but he is still a great clutch player nothing against stockton , who is leading the league in assists and 3point percentage , but in any close game , the player i most want to be handling the ball next to magic johnson in peak condition is that little opportunist from the pistons i 've got three guys capable of being on that roster , said daly , advancing thomas and joe dumars , his smooth allstar guard , as well as rodman daly deserves the choice of somebody who will do the dirty work , even with the modest 98 scoring average if the japanese saw rodman s highlight film , they might not criticize american work habits \( actually , the japanese have it backward it s not the workers who are our problem it s the corporate raiders and the junkbond dealers \) dennis always worked this hard , daly said yesterday , but he was sharing minutes until this year this year we could n't win a game if he did n't play all those minutes the common wisdom is that other teams should assign a center to him , but the other night miami s 7foot center , rony seikaly , a superb leaper and a proud man , could not contain the 6foot8 rodman nobody stops dennis rodman except the selection committee , which moved too fast , for the wrong reasons photo isiah thomas \( associated press \)
two teams won approval from a federal panel yesterday to treat cystic fibrosis by inserting sturdy new genes into the patients' frail and beleagured airway tissue , a scheme that if successful could amount to a cure for cystic fibrosis , the most common lethal hereditary disease the two teams take a very similar approach to rallying the power of human gene therapy against the illness , and human trials could begin by early next year i think this is a major step along the way , and after working so hard on this for so long , i feel really good , said dr ronald g crystal of the national heart , lung and blood institute in bethesda , md the time is right to cure this disease , and while i do n't think we 're going to be able to do that immediately , we now have the potential for a cure dr crystal led one of the teams whose projects were approved yesterday by the recombinant dna advisory committee , the federal panel that oversees gene therapy research 'just a first step' but other researchers and experts on cystic fibrosis cautioned against overly buoyant expectations of success even if the therapy proves promising in the initial clinical trials , they said , it will still take about six years before it is widely available we 're very encouraged , said robert k dresing , president and chief executive officer of the cystic fibrosis foundation but this is very early work , and it s just a first step toward getting that ultimate therapy at any given time , cystic fibrosis afflicts about 30 , 000 americans many die from the disease before they reach 30 years of age several new drugs designed to ease the extreme mucus buildup and chronic lung infections often associated with the disorder are now being tested , but none , if effective , would rank as a cure dr james wilson of the university of michigan in ann arbor led the second group whose project was approved by the advisory committee a third group , headed by dr michael welsh of the howard hughes medical institute at the university of iowa , plans to offer a similar but somewhat more conservative gene therapy method today its approval is believed to be likely fda approval also needed the projects must next be authorized by bernadine healy , director of the national institutes of health , who is expected to take her cue from the advisory committee and the food and drug administration the three teams will try to deliver fresh copies of the crucial cystic fibrosis gene to patients by packaging the gene in a harmless cold virus called an adenovirus , and then , essentially , squirting the virus into the patients' airways two teams will deliver the virus and the gene it enfolds to the patients' nose and lungs , while dr welsh s team , concerned about possible lung inflammation from the treatment , will start with nasal administration alone preliminary results from animal and test tube experiments have been described by many scientists as impressive , although researchers say they will only know how well the plan works by trying it on humans some doctors have expressed concern that using a cold virus as a delivery vehicle for the gene carries risks that have not been sorted out , and some say they would not immediately recommend such a treatment for patients who have only a mild form of cystic fibrosis risks viewed as minimal but dr welsh said he believed that the risks of unexpected infections from the adenovirus are minimal , and notes that the virus the scientists will be using has been genetically manipulated to prevent it from reproducing once it has entered a cell this is a lethal disease , and the chances that gene therapy will work are high , dr welsh said the potential benefits clearly outweigh any risks involved mr dresing said he , too , believes the method is safe my own son , who has cystic fibrosis , may very well volunteer for the early trials , he said mr dresing s son is 24 years old the current wealth of gene therapy offerings is no surprise , given the fervor with which geneticists have been studying cystic fibrosis in the last several years some researchers say the entire field of human gene therapy was practically invented with the goal of thwarting cystic fibrosis in mind , although the approach has already been tried against an immune disorder , a lethal cholesterol defect and several types of cancer , with varying success the teams plan to begin experiments with adult victims of the disease , enlisting about 30 patients over the age of 21 for the early phases of the trials the scientists will give patients copies of the gene they lack , called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in its healthy guise , the gene directs cells to create a protein that controls the body s flow of chloride molecules cystic fibrosis patients , lacking that essential trafficking molecule , end up with a dangerous imbalance of salt , which in turn leads to excessive mucus buildup in the lungs the mucus serves as a broth for chronic bacterial infections , and eventually the pulmonary tissue gives out , leading to death the researchers hope that the adenovirus delivery vehicles will infect about 10 percent of the cells of the airway tissue , installing just enough copies of the cystic fibrosis gene to correct the defective chloride flow diagram a cold virus to carry a missing gene cystic fibrosis patients lack a gene for a protein to control salt flow in lung cells mucus builds up and infections destroy tissue scientists will try a replacement method that worked in animals adenovirus , which causes colds , is altered so it cannot reproduce missing gene is inserted into virus the virus is to be delivered through the lung or nasal passage in the lung tissue , it is expected to infect about 10 percent of airway cells the gene should begin to work , producing the control protein , and mucus buildup should be significantly reduced
sacramento , calif , sept 1 negotiators for the state legislature entered intense talks with gov pete wilson s staff today to resolve a dispute over future state support for public schools , the last remaining hurdle to ending california s twomonth budget crisis people on both sides familiar with the negotiations said they were trying to find some facesaving concessions to offer speaker willie l brown jr and the fractious democraticcontrolled assembly as inducement to vote for the main elements of the republican governor s plan the dispute revolves not around this year s actual appropriations but around the governor s efforts to make his schoolspending plans immune to challenge in the courts the deliberations came as the state staggered through its 63d day without a budget the lawmakers worked past their deadline of midnight monday before recessing early today leaders said they were prepared for another long session the pressure builds intense pressure is building for a solution as the state continues to pay its bills with iou s it has stopped paying for health care for the poor it will owe doctors and hospitals nearly 270 million by thursday over the last two months , the lawmakers have grudgingly yielded to the governor in agreeing to balance this year s recessionracked 576 billion budget with many deep and painful cuts but no new taxes no agreement has yet been possible , however , on the numbingly complex plan that mr wilson has offered to hold down increases in school spending in future years the governor has demanded and obtained legislative agreement to recapture 11 billion overpaid to local school districts last year under a state constitutional provision called proposition 98 that guarantees the public schools and community colleges 40 percent of state revenues , which is about 24 billion this year to keep school spending steady this year , he would lend the schools 959 million from future years this would reduce the original base on which support in future years is based wanting a 'poison pill' and to protect this plan , he wants a poison pill in the legislation that would suspend proposition 98 and allow him to cut spending should any school district successfully challenge the plan in court democrats in the assembly and educational interests , including the powerful california teachers association , opposed the governor s idea but they have been discussing a number of concessions as the price of their support , including adding 100 million to the base of school support next year , changing the formula by which daily attendance is calculated , restoring some of the cuts suffered by community college and rolling back some of the fee increases forced on the two state university systems among other means , they would pay for this by cutting the state bureaucracy , laying off public information officers , for example we 've put to bed 99967 percent of all spending , said assemblyman phil isenberg , a democrat from sacramento who has been a leader in the budget issue the rest is some turf protection and giant egos assembly is the key the difficulty was to get the twothirds majority of 54 votes required in the 80seat assembly in which both liberal democrats and conservative republicans are unhappy with governor wilson the senate had earlier passed the bulk of his budget proposals and was expected to go along with whatever compromise he reached with the assembly leadership the daylong negotiations followed a hectic legislative night on monday , during which both houses passed all the necessary legislation to resolve the stalemate except for a schoolspending plan acceptable to the governor after that , an aide to mr wilson said , speaker brown telephoned the governor and there was a polite conversation in which the two agreed to end the impasse and send their representatives to work out the details of the compromise anybody who thinks the governor has won is crazy none of us are winning , said the senate republican minority leader , kenneth l maddy of fresno , during the debate the other day we 've all lost , in terms of the credibility of the public the governor s aides hope he will benefit from public anger this november , when all the seats in the assembly and half in the senate are up for election they hope to raise the number of republicans in the 80seat assembly to 37 or 38 from the current 33 assuming an alliance with conservative democrats , the republicans would have a working majority and could probably force mr brown out as speaker twentyfive of the incumbents are leaving the house , and 15 or so others are in tough races in addition , the governor has mounted a voter initiative that would amend the state constitution to give him considerable additional powers over budgetary matters and welfare grants

johannesburg , may 16 negotiations on south africa s future remained at an impasse today , even though tension produced by a deadlock on friday was dissipated in a meeting between president f w de klerk and nelson mandela , the leader of the african national congress the only results announced at the twoday session of the negotiating forum , the convention for a democratic south africa , were a restructuring of its format and a declared willingness among the 19 political parties and other groups that are taking part to try again at the next session , hopefully by the end of june in the next six weeks , the convention s management committee is to try to resolve the deadlock , which has developed over guidelines for a new constitution the current round of talks was scheduled to review progress since the negotiating forum was convened in december to create a south africa beyond apartheid , including the writing of a constitution giving political equality to blacks the convention is popularly referred to by its acronym codesa five working groups were appointed to propose various plans for the transition , but only four completed their reports the fifth , which focused on guidelines for the constitution , could not agree on a provision on regional concerns because the proposals were interlocked , in the end none was presented to the full convention despite all the hard preparatory work put in , nothing concrete has emerged , mr mandela said after the session ended he acknowledged that the negotiations had stalled he sounded more optimistic when he addressed delegates before the convention adjourned this afternoon we have been able to save codesa and the peace process , mr mandela said , referring to his meeting with mr de klerk on friday night we are going back home full of strength and hope the constitutional working group deadlocked because the government and the african national congress could not agree on the size of the majority required to enact constitutional provisions affecting the regions the government held out for 75 percent , which would make it easier for whites to veto decisions of the constitutionmaking body the african national congress sought to guard against such vetoes by insisting first that a twothirds margin be required , then 70 percent both sides attached other conditions , as well but this seemingly bridgeable difference reflected a far more serious political disagreement over whether minorities , like whites , should be able to block decisions affecting regions made by a blackmajority government the congress wants to keep the centralized governing structure that has been used by the national party to maintain whiteminority control president de klerk wants minorities to be protected through constitutional checks and balances , a second house of parliament that would represent regions , and a devolution of power from the central government to the regions he insisted today that he was not defining minorities in terms of race or color in a convention speech , mr de klerk said the government wanted the sort of protections that are part of the united states constitution they do so in the spirit in which the american founding fathers have instituted their checks and balances , he said the spirit was the spirit that no majority should ever be able to misuse its power to undermine the constitution , or to dominate or to damage the interests of minorities , however they may be defined mr de klerk urged that priority be given to drafting an interim constitution that would lay the legal ground for the political transition he said this should precede an interim executive body that would include blacks mr mandela s group refuses to accept less than a full transitional package because it fears becoming trapped in an interim governing arrangement that could drag on for years the delay probably benefited the government , which argues that the issues under discussion are too important to be rushed to a hasty conclusion a transitional or interim constitution cannot be a slapdash , rickety affair , mr de klerk said mr mandela , though , said south africa was in deep crisis , with a declining economy and rising violence and crime from where can we claim the moral right to assert that we need to move with less speed \? he asked why do we put off till tomorrow the solutions that we can reach today \? people cannot postpone their hunger similarly , they do not want their freedom postponed with the approval of the convention s delegates , the management committee today suspended the five working groups and took over their tasks in an effort to streamline the negotiating process it hopes that the greater flexibility will help break the deadlock mr de klerk denied that the government s refusal to yield further on regional principles meant that it wanted to maintain white privilege it is simply not true , he said when we say that the book on apartheid has been closed , we mean it but mr mandela suggested that a negotiating stalemate could engender protests by blacks , who cannot vote and let none of us make the mistake of thinking that the people will do nothing to change their condition , he said not only do the masses have the right , they have the duty to engage in struggle to change their condition change any government or leader they see as acting against their common good
washington , jan 15 hoping to speed the development of new mobile communications , from cheap and tiny wireless telephones to electronic notebooks that send and receive data over the air , the federal communications commission on thursday will propose opening up a big swath of radio frequencies for emerging technologies in its proposal , which is certain to create controversy , the fcc will recommend reallocating frequencies now used by railroads , electric utilities , police and fire departments for microwave communications but the public safety agencies and electric utilities are alarmed by the possibility of being forced to give up their frequencies , both because of the expense involved and for safety reasons paying for access to ease the transition for these users , agency officials said the commission would propose a relatively novel arrangement under which new customers would have to buy out the existing users and underwrite the costs of their moving to a new frequency or to wired communication networks although the details remain unclear , fcc officials said they strongly favored letting existing users keep their licenses until they reached a satisfactory agreement with the new users this is the first time the commission has proposed a marketplace mechanism to make room for new services , where the new services with new technologies buy out the old ones , said dr thomas stanley , chief of the fcc s office of engineering and technology the move comes as both congress and the commission have been intent on fostering personal communications networks , a broad family of wireless communication services that would be available to individual customers these range from telephones small enough to be strapped on the wrist to satellite networks that can track down customers anywhere in the country , or perhaps the world , to deliver telephone calls , messages or files of computer data at the moment , more than 80 companies have been authorized to start experimental versions of such services in the united states many of these services amount to the next generation of cellular telephones using scores of small relay antennas scattered throughout a metropolitan area , the systems would , for example , make it possible for people to use lowpowered telephones that are extremely cheap and small in addition , companies like motorola inc , based in schaumburg , ill , and the american mobile satellite corporation in washington have either proposed or plan to launch satellites that would provide portable telephone service to people anywhere in the country assigning radio frequencies is a crucial and politically controversial element in developing new communication services , because all frequencies considered technically useful are already allocated thus , making frequencies available for new technologies requires shifting existing users , who generally do not want to move dividing up the spectrum the new action stems from an effort begun a year ago by the fcc s chairman , alfred c sikes , to identify areas of the spectrum that are not being used as efficiently as possible and that could be reassigned the goal has been to make available about 200 megahertz about four times the amount of spectrum that was set aside for cellular telephone services in the early 1980 s commission officials acknowledge that they have been scrutinizing the band now used for microwave services by civilian public safety agencies , utilities and others these new frequencies would be renamed an emerging technologies band , and would be parceled out over the next several years as new services are tested and defined more precisely japan and europe have both been allocating hundreds of megahertz for new services , dr stanley said in part , this is the united states' attempt to parallel that effort though the action expected thursday would be only a proposal , dr stanley said the commission was eager to move the process forward rapidly people are in a hurry here and throughout the industry , he said the new proposal is the first step toward reassigning frequencies after receiving comment for the next several months , the commission will try to draft a final rule although the process can be bogged down by disagreements over the fine points , mr sikes has said on previous occasions that he would like to begin reassigning some frequencies for new uses before the end of this year if the commission can achieve that , the timetable would be eons faster than the 14 years it took to assign frequencies for cellular telephones after the fcc decides on a reassignment , it would be up to the companies proposing new services to reach buyout agreements with existing users of those frequencies the commission

when the new haven memorial day parade steps off today , a woman will be at the head of the march for the first time in its history dr doris troth lippman of westport , a professor of nursing at fairfield university and a vietnam veteran , will lead the parade down chapel street at 2 this afternoon since the gulf war , i think , more people are aware of women veterans , dr lippman said robert d fodero , cochairman of the veterans affairs council in new haven , said that having the parade s first woman as grand marshal has generated more interest than usual we usually get one or maybe two vietnam veterans' organizations marching , said mr fodero , a retired colonel with the health service corps in vietnam this year we 've gotten six dr lippman is very articulate , very dynamic and very sincere the vietnam veterans are looking for someone like that , and they 've zeroed in on her official recognition it is not just their male counterparts who are starting to recognize women who served in war these women are starting to receive official recognition as well dr lippman is the vice chairwoman of the vietnam women s memorial project , which is seeking to raise 2 million nationally for a statue to be installed near the vietnam memorial wall in washington the statue depicts a nurse cradling a dying soldier as she sits on a wall of sandbags , as another female soldier looks out over the barrier at the rocky hill veterans home and hospital , administrators are gearing up to provide the kind of care female veterans are going to require , said the state s commissioner of the department of veteran affairs , hamilton d harper jr mr harper said with women making up 20 to 25 percent of the soldiers on active duty status , i think you 're going to see that kind of recognition grow at a steady pace and with the dedication of a vietnam women s memorial anticipated next year , women might finally come to grips with their war service themselves , said heidi baruch , a nurse in fairfield who also served in vietnam , and who is a state coordinator for the project i did n't begin to deal with being a veteran until five or six years ago , ms baruch said in fact , i rarely even told anyone i was a veteran images of women while the images of women s roles in the persian gulf war brought home clearly how close to the fighting they were in the middle east , there was little recognition of their role in the vietnam war an estimated 265 , 000 women served in the military in noncombat roles all over the world during the vietnam war about 11 , 000 were stationed there as nurses , and thousands of others served in japan , guam , the philippines and hawaii , caring for some of the 350 , 000 soldiers wounded in the war the names of eight women are inscribed on the black granite wallin washington , dc that is a memorial to soldiers who died in vietnam for a long time , even the red cross denied our existence , said jeanne m christie of milford , who was in the red cross unit of supplemental recreational activities overseas their premise was , 'we did not send women into combat zones , ' so they could n't recognize us 'it was psychological health' ms christie said women in auxiliary organizations were issued military identifications and standard ranks , and they were called to do badly needed support it was n't unusual for a commander to call and say , 'we just lost have the company , could you come out and do your thing \? ' ms christie said it was psychological health and welfare but women were n't supposed to be in combat zones , so it was sort of done on the quiet , ms christie said after the war , she said , the organizations , and the military , might have conveniently forgotten because of the liabilities involved god forbid any of us got hit , ms christie said there was medical coverage for us over there , and for some it continued over here but for others , the medical coverage stopped once they came home , and the military might be worried about claims being reopened if the service is recognized , she said any problems that come up , they do n't want to be responsible , ms christie said as a result , ms christie said , it took a long battle with the red cross to get authorization for her unit to march in a parade to dedicate the vietnam memorial in 1983 ms christie said as a result of the problems that year , women in nonmilitary units began to work together it has really grown to quite a network , ms christie said a lot of recognition has come out of it today , at last , the red cross recognizes us , and the job we did 'harder to explain' female veterans say it is harder to explain why they have received little recognition when you think about veterans , you think about men , said dr lippman she once took part in a memorial service in milford , dressed in fatigues and carrying a helmet after the service , she said , news reporters rushed to interview the men , but none talked to her i talked to someone later who said they probably thought i was a veteran s wife , dr lippman said women need to do a better job of speaking out , of saying 'we are veterans , ' to tell our story i still do n't go out and say , 'hey , i'm a veteran , ' but i'm a lot less shy vietnam veterans , in general , were treated far differently than veterans of other wars , ms baruch said , but still , a male vietnam veteran was recognized as a veteran until recently , ms baruch said , a female veteran could not be treated at a veterans administration hospital perhaps it is because women have not pressed their case , she continued , because after viewing the wounds inflicted by war , women who came back physically intact were reluctant to seek credit for their efforts maybe 'i was n't unscathed' women are just now beginning to say , 'maybe after two years of war i was n't unscathed , ' ms baruch said she said a memorial would make a difference , just by providing recognition for the role women played in the war i hope the national memorial will bring more women to deal with it , ms baruch said or , at least , to deal with it better than they are now legislation authorizing the women s memorial was introduced by united states representative sam gejdenson , democrat of bozrah , in november 1987 , and was unanimously approved by congress in addition , the project is conducting a sister search that has located 8 , 000 women who served during the vietnam era , dr lippman said the statue is to be completed next year , the 10th anniversary of the dedication of the the original vietnam monument i think after next year , there will be even more of a focus on women veterans , dr lippman said our sense is that this will bring men and women together at the memorial , to complete the healing there are still a lot of women who have n't come to grips with that very important part of their life another memorial is to be built honoring women who served in all wars money is being raised for that monument by the women in military service for america , a washingtonbased group formed in 1986 dr lippman said she was also encouraged when the city of new haven recently unveiled its vietnam memorial , showing three men and a woman , the first she knows of in any major city dedicated to women as well as men mr fodero added i think the movement has come from within the veterans' groups themselves they want to see that women are recognized for their contributions in the medical corps , mr fodero said he had worked side by side with women , so he knows first hand the importance of their contribution it s like so many other things , in and out of the military women have not gotten credit for what they 've done , he commented it s about time
while the jets' dennis byrd remained partly paralyzed yesterday , the result of a headfirst collision with a teammate , an unsettling debate was under way was the injury truly unavoidable , or did byrd use his helmet improperly and endanger himself in the process \? was byrd on a fateful course with scott mersereau as the pair came at chiefs quarterback dave krieg from opposite sides \? had byrd simply missed tackling krieg \? or had byrd , in fact , disregarded national football league rules , as well as coaching advice , by barreling in headfirst \? dr alan ashare , chairman of the safety and protective equipment committee of usa hockey , said yesterday that he had viewed the tapes of the byrd incident he was playing with his head down and he was spearing , said ashare , echoing comments made two days earlier by dr joseph s torg , one of the country s leading sportsmedicine orthopedists byrd was aiming with his head , torg said it clearly was an example of a headfirst impact 'nonsense , ' says nicholas coach bruce coslet of the jets has termed the blow an accident and dr james a nicholas , the chairman of the jets' medical staff and the team s longtime orthopedist , said yesterday , when asked if byrd was spearing nonsense it was an unavoidable accident byrd has been in intensive care since the collision sunday , which left him with a fractured vertebra in his neck using the helmet at the point of attack is known as spearing , and it is considered one of the most dangerous acts in football it is against the rules in high schools , colleges and the nfl , but the league has no statistics to show how often this flagrant foul is called it often is called 'unnecessary roughness , ' said the league s vice president of communications , joe browne so it s difficult to tell how many penalties have been called for spearing but we believe it has abated since we brought in a seventh official in 1979 in 1978 , the league averaged more than one unnecessary roughness foul a game 241 in 224 contests after 12 weeks this season , there were fewer than one a game 130 in 154 in 1978 , darryl stingley of the new england patriots was left paralyzed for life as the result of a tackle by the raiders' jack tatum stingley was hurt when he was hit full force by tatum as he reached for a pass stingley , who is employed in the patriots' front office , said from his home in chicago yesterday that he saw the incident involving byrd and questioned the safety of byrd s technique it looked to me like he was overextending himself , said stingley i 'd hate to think he was spearing i 'd hate to see what would have happened if all three collided around the nfl , players contacted said that , indeed , improper tackling techniques , in general , and spearing , specifically , were often unavoidable they said it was not taught or encouraged as a means of taking out opposing players , but that it was difficult for a player not to spear since the natural reaction is to keep one s head down when hitting somebody else typically , broken necks in football occur because the head is lowered , which straightens the spine when the collision occurs , the spine is compressed because the spine is straight , the blow is not diffused thus , players are taught to tackle with their head up , which curves the spine according to a raiders defensive end , howie long , spearing happens all the time but the referees throw flags only when it involves the quarterback two people are spearing me all the time , long said if you eliminate spearing , eliminate highlow blocks on linemen that ruin knees what i mean is , i 'll get held upright by one guy and chopped by another they protect quarterbacks , but you ca n't say one guy is more important what makes the quarterback more important than me \? miami dolphins linebacker bryan cox said that he had been playing football since he was 6 years old , and that nobody ever really taught him proper tackling techniques in addition , cox said that in the high speed of an nfl game , one ca n't always use proper tackling techniques you 're trying to get him down the best way you can , he said but he said none of his coaches ever encouraged him to use spearing as a tackling intimidator in his first pro game , a preseason encounter against the bears last year , cox lay numb six minutes after the game all the way down to the fingertips i could n't feel anything , cox said now , he wears a collar to prevent his neck from going backward too far to be a good tackle , you have to have your head up , said dan reeves , coach of the denver broncos you do n't lower your head instinctively , you do it your head does lower to protect your body in drills , you teach the players to hit between the numbers i watched what happened to byrd the target he was going to hit moved that surprised his body he closed his eyes an emotional player byrd , 26 , was an emotional player who was admonished for overreacting in his very first rookie scrimmage by the veteran marty lyons it occurred in the summer of 1989 a redskins offensive lineman was called for holding byrd the rookie let out a whoop lyons took him aside and told him that such theatrics could be considered taunting , which is against league rules in last summer s preseason game against the giants , the charging byrd brought down the giants' jeff hostetler so hard , hostetler suffered a back injury byrd was penalized not for the hit , but for taunting while hostetler was on the turf byrd had approached that game as he had every other in his nfl career it will be like going to war , he said earlier this season , in the sept 27 game against the los angeles rams , byrd dislocated his right shoulder he missed three games before returning to action two weeks ahead of schedule to stingley , the size issue is crucial the 266pound byrd collided with the 275pound scott mersereau byrd s helmet hit mersereau in the sternum with such force , that mersereau sat dazed , unable to move for two minutes in the 1991 season , mike utley , a 6foot 6inch , 290pound offensive lineman for the detroit lions , became partly paralyzed after he lost his balance while blocking and fell on his head when i played i was 185 pounds , stingley said but the last two injuries , to utley and to byrd , were to big guys that s what makes it so scary now that means that every play something dangerous could happen byrd is satisfactory the jets announced yesterday that dennis byrd s postoperative condition is satisfactory , and that he remains in stable condition in the intensive care unit at lenox hill hospital in manhattan byrd , who had surgery wednesday to stabilize his broken neck , is scheduled to speak to his teammates in a telephone conference call today
hartford , nov 19 the fbi inquiry into the activities of connecticut s republican party chairman during legislative votes on bank regulation in 1989 shows little sign of expanding into a fullscale corruption investigation of either the house or senate , lawenforcement officials said today the investigation has included searches of the home and office of the party chairman , richard foley jr , and interviews with at least 18 present and former republican members of the house of representatives it has focused on two votes in april 1989 in which at least 26 house members in both parties in the 151seat chamber switched their votes on a heavily lobbied banking bill during a 24hour period however , mr foley was not among those who changed their votes waterbury connection investigators are also looking into a business relationship that mr foley had from the spring of 1989 into 1990 with a realestate company founded by two men later convicted of bribing the mayor of waterbury , who are cooperating with federal prosecutors mr foley was paid 2 , 500 a month by the company mr foley , who is also a state representative from oxford , vehemently denied any illegal or unethical actions at a news conference on wednesday he suggested that the entire general assembly had been put under a cloud by the inquiry , and urged other lawmakers who had been questioned to band together and sue the federal government for slander no charges have been filed in the investigation , and the affidavit that was the basis for the search warrants on mr foley s property has been sealed by court order plausible explanations but several senior federal lawenforcement officials , who spoke on condition that they not be identified , stressed in separate interviews today that most if not all of those lawmakers who switched their votes have offered plausible explanations for their reversals the people who switched their votes , almost without exception , appear to have switched for reasons that appeared to them legitimate , as opposed to money being passed to them , one official said this is not an investigation of the legislature , another official said lawmakers interviewed by agents of the fbi and the treasury department said on wednesday that they were closely questioned on those particular bank votes , however the subsequent revelations , partly by mr foley himself , that he received 2 , 500 a month from the realestate company that was later linked to corruption in waterbury also suggest that investigators perceive some connection if the inquiry is not a fullblown investigation into votebuying in the legislature , as investigators now say , then the focus would appear to be on mr foley s relationship with the realestate company , taft crosspoint , and what he was expected to do for the money he received under state bribery laws and federal corruption statutes , an elected official can be accused of taking a bribe if it can be proved that an understanding existed to perform certain actions or influence legislation , whether those actions were performed or not on wednesday , mr foley challenged federal prosecutors to produce any evidence linking his employment by taft to his actions on the bank votes , which granted a oneyear exemption from connecticut s interstate banking laws to the fleet financial group of providence , ri without the exemption , fleet would have been forced to sell its connecticut banking operations , because fleet had merged with a new york bank , and connecticut laws barred banks outside new england from doing business in the state mr foley opposed the bill consistently on the house floor , during its initial hearing , when it was voted down , as well as the next day , when enough votes were switched to revive the bill , which was later passed among the many other remaining mysteries in the investigation is what interest mr foley s employers at taft , richard d barbieri and john a corpaci both of whom were convicted earlier this year of conspiracy and of paying bribes to officials in waterbury would have in helping out fleet , if that is what prosecutors ever try to prove mr barbieri and mr corpaci both signed agreements when they were convicted promising cooperation in future investigations mr foley said his assignment for taft included trying to find tenants for at least four commercial realestate projects then under development , as well as helping to prepare documents for presentation to local planning and zoning boards none of those projects , he said , ever had any relationship to his work as a legislator or a party leader photo richard foley jr , connecticut s republican party chairman , challenged federal prosecutors on wednesday to produce any evidence of illegal behavior during the 1989 legislative session \( steve miller for the new york times \)
warsaw the fight is on for the hearts and minds of poland s consumers television viewers in central europe s largest country are bombarded nightly with advertisements for western laundry detergent , yogurt and candy bars previously taboo items like women s sanitary napkins are being openly advertised for the first time whole new markets have been carved out virtually overnight for products poles never knew they needed , like pet food in a country where most women traditionally do not shave their legs , one entrepreneur singlehandedly created a demand for electronic hair removers , starting with an advertising campaign featuring miss poland he is now selling about 30 , 000 a month camel cigarettes' name is now emblazoned on all the taxis of the most popular cab company in warsaw , radio taxi marlboro s colors and name adorn the no 4 tram that winds through the center of the city cat and dog food , unheard of a year ago , are selling fast but there are land mines for companies courting polish consumers , who were deprived of many goods for a generation and inculcated to dismiss as propaganda almost any message they found on television or in the newspapers whispering campaign one of the first heavily advertised western products , vidal sassoon s wash 'n' go shampoo , made by the procter gamble company , rocketed to the top of the market in a few weeks , then saw its sales plummet amid a bizarre whispering campaign from sophisticated cocktail parties to store checkout lines , the word went out on the same grapevine used to circumvent statecontrolled media during the communist days psst , pass it on , wash 'n' go being sold in poland has been adulterated , people told each other it makes your hair fall out willy delvaux , procter gamble s general manager in poland , said ruefully it s something completely absurd all dermatologists , everybody has stated that shampoo , any shampoo , has no effect on hair loss we 've never been able to find a single person who had hair loss it s always they heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend he said sales of vidal sassoon s wash 'n' go were beginning to recover some polish marketing experts believe wash 'n' go also fell victim to the suspicions of a generation raised on propaganda under the previous regime , television and newspapers purveyed propaganda the phrase television lies was a slogan for the solidarity movement one sure signal that something really awful was about to happen in communist poland say , a round of huge price increases was given when the authorities stepped up their propaganda about how well things were going vidal sassoon s wash 'n' go , which was heavily advertised on television , radio and newspapers , may well have been harmed by this inverse logic the more something is advertised , the worse it must be people here are naturally suspicious , said eugeniusz smilowski , director of pentor , a private polling and marketing company they think you 're just passing this junk to us it failed in the west , now you want us to buy it such fears were fed by none other than president lech walesa , who said in speeches and interviews earlier this year that the west was dumping brightly packaged junk on poland waldemar kochanski , the manager of zacisze , a wholesaler in warsaw , blamed wash 'n' go s troubles on the widespread advertising campaign for the shampoo , which , he said , eventually caused disgust he said he had been selling several thousand packages of the shampoo a day , and once could not get enough now it s down to a hundred a day , he said 'truth , not advertising' in a recent public opinion survey , 37 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement , any product that is advertised is surely poor on the other hand , 31 percent said repeated advertising must mean the product is of high quality one radio advertisement in a provincial city begins by saying , this is truth , not advertising billions of dollars are at stake from 1990 to 1991 , poland s imports mostly from the west rose more than 6 billion , to 156 billion much of the increase in the last year was in consumer goods from western europe or european subsidiaries of american concerns like heinz or ford in 18 months , procter gamble s office here has gone from one person mr delvaux to 100 employees the companies vying for the polish market are among the first to grasp that the official income statistics which say the average worker earns 130 a month are vastly understated while millions of poles live at or near the poverty level , a substantial minority , perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the population of 38 million , enjoys a considerably better standard of living , either through jobs in the underground economy or in the growing private sector no definitive data mr smilowski of pentor acknowledged that no one has ever produced a definitive study of income in poland in his judgment , consumer sales are the best available yardstick the first videocassettes appeared in 1985 , he said today , there are four million the first satellite tv s were in 1989 today there are over a million , and some say it s closer to 14 million color tv s \? only last year poles bought 12 million sets general motors estimates that poles bought 15 billion worth of cars last year dozens of western companies have flocked to pentor and other polish agencies for advice marketing and advertising is a new field in poland , and it has attracted worldwide industry leaders like young rubicam , as well as a host of new locally owned competitors one hotly contested market is laundry detergent procter gamble has ariel , but faces strong competition from henkel of germany and the britishdutch company unilever , both of which have bought detergent factories in poland on testing packaging western companies are also testing packaging for poland , and they have found some surprising results krzysztof b kruszewski of the polish company smg krc found last year that the best label for laundry detergent was written in polish , but with a small grammatical error or two this showed that foreigners cared enough to learn polish but were not smart enough to master it jacques tourel is one of poland s winners in the marketing game he has opened a chain of stores called kidiland selling children s items , and he is importing clairol shampoo , among other consumer products but his biggest triumph so far has been to convince polish women of the virtues of hairless legs mr tourel s campaign for sleek limbs and profits began in 1989 , when he enlisted miss poland to make a television ad extolling the remington electronic hair remover then he persuaded a leading polish clothing designer to hold a news conference to announce that hirsute legs were out of fashion in the capitals of europe he also organized local beauty contests for legs mr tourel s product is not cheap by polish standards , retailing at about 50 nonetheless , after a slow start , he said sales have jumped to 30 , 000 units a month people said 'you 'll never sell it women like to keep their hair they even think it s sexy , ' said mr tourel ,

los angeles , may 31 a month after rioting swept the nation s secondlargest city , financial aid promised by the government is beginning to reach those who lost jobs , homes and businesses recipients say they are surprised and delighted to get the money this quickly but some community leaders and local officials say thousands of people are still going hungry or homeless because of the riots , and they have called on federal agencies to do more to make people aware of the programs and help them apply when they picked up their 7 , 000 lowinterest loan from the small business administration on thursday to rebuild a wheelchairrepair business devastated by looters , sheila and ernie tousant said that before the riots they had consistently been turned down for bank loans but the government , mrs tousant said , removed all the red tape and actually gave us a chance i'm shocked , she said , because i was here in the watts riots , and i saw the money go to everyone except the people who needed it 'long way to go' visiting los angeles on friday , president bush said of the rebuilding , we have a long way to go , but he praised the federal relief effort as massive and quick the government is financing some efforts to address deeprooted urban problems the justice department , for example , is providing 19 million for anticrime and antipoverty programs but the emphasis is on patching up the damage from the riots , and some residents said they were angry that money was being spent to aid business owners while little was being provided to help those who had been homeless and hungry long before the riots a pastor at the first african methodist episcopal church at the edge of southcentral los angeles said that as late as last week up to 1 , 500 people a day had still been arriving to pick up donated food there s a problem that s not being addressed , said the pastor , the rev leonard b jackson it seems to me that if people can find the church to get food , then the government agencies that are coming in can find us and do more to help these people evelyn white , a volunteer at an encampment for homeless people set up in southcentral los angeles by the brotherhood crusade , a black community organization , said every person you see here needs aid , but they needed it before all of this started that s why all this happened through wednesday , nearly 15 , 000 people had visited one of the nine disaster application centers run by the federal emergency management agency , which is overseeing the process of taking requests for help from victims of the riots and routing them to the appropriate government agencies relatively few applications the centers offer onestop shopping for people needing almost any kind of assistance , from money for food and clothing to lowinterest loans for businesses but the number of people who have actually completed applications for aid under the programs remains relatively small the small business administration , for example , said that although it had passed out 11 , 000 applications , as of thursday it had received 528 completed requests for assistance as of may 23 , 4 , 876 people had filed claims with the state for unemployment insurance after losing jobs because of the riots by some estimates , tens of thousands of people lost jobs , at least temporarily , because of the damage to businesses i appreciate how fast the federal government has moved , but we need to work harder , said deputy mayor linda griego and they need to work harder to do the outreach and the followup to make sure people are getting what they need more applications expected federal officials said they expected the numbers of applications to some programs , especially those for small businesses , to increase sharply in coming weeks they said that federal agencies had been working hard to inform the community about the programs by meeting with local groups , answering questions and providing assistance with filling out forms at the application centers the city , too , has stepped up its efforts to encourage people to seek help , ms griego said concerned that undocumented workers are not applying for aid out of fear that they might be reported to the immigration authorities or the internal revenue service , the city has set up programs with churches and other groups to reassure people that none of the information from relief applications will be used against them federal officials said they were trying to shore up weaknesses in their response eleven days ago , after complaints that the government was not providing food fast enough , the agriculture department authorized the purchase of 2 million worth of food to be distributed through food banks to riot victims the first shipments will reach the food banks this week the agriculture department also loosened restrictions on providing food stamps , dropping , for example , a rule disqualifying people who own cars more money pledged president bush pledged in the week following the riot that the federal government would make available almost 638 million in financial assistance through a variety of existing programs , and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars more , depending on spending decisions made by congress on friday , he said he had authorized an additional 12 million for job training and publicservice jobs the amount of federal money actually disbursed since the riots is relatively small , totaling about 32 million as of thursday the largest chunk of that , 28 million , came from the small business administration for 42 lowinterest loans totaling 28 million , mostly to owners of small businesses that were looted or burned the federal emergency management agency , which had received 4 , 694 applications for emergency housing assistance so far , had processed 299 grants totaling 372 , 000 under another program to replace personal possessions , like clothing , appliances and cars , the agency had paid out 43 , 000 to eight applicants as of wednesday 'a great relief effort' at the disaster application center at the old ambassador hotel on the edge of koreatown , james baker , his wife , carolyn , and their 2monthold son , james jr , were among the more than 200 people a day who had continued to stream in during the previous week seeking aid mr baker said he had not found work since he lost his job as a stock person at a newberry s discount store when it was burned in the rioting after spending 45 minutes filling out forms and talking to officials from several government agencies and the red cross , he said the process of applying for help had gone very smoothly and that he had been assured he would qualify for food stamps , unemployment insurance and grants to help pay the family s rent

lumberport , w va harry l morris limped across his living room to turn off the television set , moving his arthritic left foot gingerly returning to his beige easy chair , mr morris ticked off on swollen fingers the reasons he wants to keep his medical insurance after a lifetime in the coal mines , including 19 years working on his knees in front of a fourfoothigh underground coal seam at age 64 , he takes seven pills a day for arthritis , stomach trouble and blacklung disease , caused by years of breathing coal dust he has had numerous bouts of pneumonia , including two in a single month and his 65yearold wife , billie d morris , suffers from osteoporosis , high blood pressure and high cholesterol i 'd rather give the pension up than the hospital card , he said yet the morrises and 100 , 000 other unionized , retired coal miners and family members are in danger of losing their medical insurance as health costs have climbed while the number of unionized coal mines contributing to the funds has plummeted , the two healthbenefits plans serving them face 1367 million in expenses beyond their investments promise of lifetime care the miners were promised lifetime health care 46 years ago after president harry s truman ordered a federal takeover of the coal mines to end a strike to bring the miners back to work , the government promised to oversee creation of a lifetime healthcare system , and mine owners agreed to finance it but the funds have fallen into the red as lifetime care has continued to be provided to retired miners whose former employers went out of business or dropped out of the health plan the question of whether taxpayers should help bail out the miners' health insurance fund will come up in the senate on tuesday but the issue has also become a test case in the broader debate over whether the federal government should deal with the high cost of medical insurance nationally or piecemeal , helping those politically connected groups that cry out most desperately for assistance republicans point out that 35 million americans lack health insurance , and most of them are too young to qualify for medicare like the retired miners do the program covers only americans who are 65 or older the most vocal supporter of the miners , senator john d rockefeller 4th , democrat of west virginia , has appealed to the senate for help do you just let this happen and let these people die at a much higher rate \? he asked it s an extraordinary moral issue the united mine workers of america and companies that have contracts with it are lobbying for a federal bail out of the fund , but the bush administration and a majority of congressional republicans are reluctant to become involved and nonunion companies strongly oppose possible new coal taxes to pay for a federal rescue democrats , while tending to favor federal action , are bitterly divided geographically , with senators from eastern and mostly nonunion western states preparing conflicting amendments to rescue the funds at the expense of each other s regions their split is almost certain to spill out in the open on tuesday , when the senate finance committee is scheduled to begin considering the most sweeping energy bill passed by the house in a decade democrats from both east and west are motivated by concern that not acting now could provoke a major strike in the nation s underground coal fields this winter , when the current national union contract expires because of their work , old miners are an especially sickly group of people and with pensions of as little as 100 a month , they have little extra cash to spend on the many medicines and hospital visits that they require but that are not covered by medicare after 37 years in the mines , mr morris receives a pension of only 487 a month to supplement his social security checks he and his wife can afford their medical bills only because medicare and their health benefits together cover all but 50 of the annual cost of their prescriptions and all but 100 of their annual doctors' bills without the union health fund , the morrises would have to pay a fifth of their medical bills and all of their prescription drug costs fears of footing the bill if we did n't have the card , we 'd probably have to sell the home , mrs morris said yet families like the morrises are among the reasons the administration and most senate republicans oppose federal involvement in rescuing the funds nonunion coal companies fear they may end up footing the bill , and they also question whether helping coal miners is the best use of the government s limited money ninetyfive percent of the retired miners and their dependents are covered by medicare for the remaining 5 percent , the health benefit funds cover all medical expenses except the 50 for prescriptions and the 100 for visits to doctors republican concerns about alternative coverage are best illustrated by the case of pete male , a 74yearold former miner who lives half a mile from the morrises and is covered by five medical benefit plans 14 prescription medicines
if robert abrams beats alfonse m d'amato on nov 3 , it will be by two inches all the debate over the debates , the disparities in fundraising and ideology and the questions of ethics notwithstanding , one calculation is likely to determine the outcome of the race for united states senator from new york how far mr abrams s name is from bill clinton s on the ballot in new york city , mr abrams is listed about two inches below his party s presidential nominee elsewhere in the state , the names of the two democrats appear side by side for all of mr d'amato s deft maneuvering , and however much he has distanced himself from the president , his name follows george bush s on the republican , conservative and right to life party lines which is why mr d'amato , by design , is depending on appearances rather than realities if mr bush appeared unexpectedly at a d'amato campaign rally \( neither the president nor mr clinton is likely to campaign here , though , given the prospects for a democratic landslide \) the startled senator might chirp who is he \? what is he doing here \? in a political paradox , mr d'amato is reminding new yorkers that he , not mr abrams , shares mr clinton s support of the death penalty , moderate cuts in defense spending , and the freetrade pact with mexico none of which seem likely to be pivotal mr abrams responded on saturday with a letter from mr clinton rebuffing mr d'amato s advances in 1988 , michael s dukakis carried new york but by a much narrower margin than senator daniel patrick moynihan s in the year s senate race still , in rockland county s new square , a largely hasidic community that mr moynihan swept by 756 to 21 , mr bush overwhelmed mr dukakis by 773 to 9 and in the senate race two years earlier , mr d'amato s democratic rival , mark green , got only 41 percent of the vote statewide while his fellow democrat , mario m cuomo , captured 65 percent in the gubernatorial contest the best advantage gained from mr clinton , the governor said , is the kind of people who come out to vote for him will decide to vote for abrams like mr clinton , mr abrams needs a big democratic turnout otherwise , last week s announcement that voter registration rolls in new york city had grown to the highest level in two decades will not have much value mr cuomo complained of the republicans' skillful use of the tangentially relevant , a tactic , he suggested , that mr d'amato had perfected even better than mr bush was mr abrams doing a worse job at responding than mr clinton \? i would prefer to say d'amato is doing it better , mr cuomo said if you have to try a big case like that for d'amato , the governor said , what every lawyer knows is you hit the table , you scream , you drop books , you throw up , you have your client faint , you do everything you can to distract the jury to the extent bob has made any mistake at all it is cooperating with the republican attempt to obscure the issues for his part , mr cuomo maintains that he is doing all he can the governor said he invited mr abrams to march with him in last week s columbus day parade and , in a first , made his inventory of contributors available to the abrams campaign mr cuomo went on to say that mr d'amato should release his testimony before the senate ethics committee i do n't believe you beat a guy just because he s investigated , he said but i would say , 'come forward with your transcript' in last week s debate , masterfully moderated by don imus \( imus and moderator ordinarily being oxymoronic \) , mr d'amato inadvertently revealed his methodology when mr imus bet his onair partner , charles mccord , that if mr d'amato let mr abrams complete an answer without interrupting mr mccord could have mr imus s house , the senator held his tongue when mr imus said he was just joking , mr d'amato replied with mock disappointment charlie , we were going to split that house this year s presidential campaign conjures up images of 1964 when having a new yorker , william e miller , on the republican ticket was insufficient to stanch the johnson landslide that helped elect senator robert f kennedy and other democrats in legislative and congressional races that phenomenon was immortalized years earlier when hymie shorenstein , the legendary brooklyn democratic leader , urged a nervous local candidate to think of franklin roosevelt as the staten island ferry in its wake , the garbage inevitably flows and with a babyboomer national ticket , shirttails might be more appropriate than coattails in a presidential election year , said john a marino , the democratic state chairman , people think more in terms of party which is why mr abrams , a record votegetter in his own right , may give new yorkers two democratic senators for the first time in a halfcentury since james m mead joined robert f wagner ethan geto , mr abrams s campaign director , said if he wins by 10 points , coattails were n't that important if he wins by 2 points , they would have been critical
uniondale , li , march 14 solid goaltending by mark fitzpatrick spoiled pat lafontaine s first visit to nassau coliseum since he was traded to buffalo in october as the islanders beat the sabres , 41 , this afternoon daniel marois , pierre turgeon , steve thomas and marty mcinnis had the goals and benoit hogue had two assists for the islanders , who benefited greatly from fitzpatrick s 38 saves fizpatrick s lone blemish was doug bodger s goal , which came before the game was two minutes old and while the islanders were killing a fiveminute major penalty to rich pilon it was the third victory in their last four games for the islanders , and it gave them a new infusion of hope that they might gain the last playoff spot in the patrick division , currently occupied by pittsburgh the game brought a symbolic end to lafontaine s eightyear relationship with the team and its fans , who greeted him loudly with jeers when he was introduced as a starter and throughout the game , each time he carried the puck a small segment of fans in the crowd of 10 , 315 , gathered in section 329 on top of the stands behind the north goal , chanted , traitor , traitor , a couple of times during the game not bothered by reception i have no resentment against anyone , lafontaine said after the game about the unfriendly reception by fans people are entitled to their opinion i saw what happened to some players when they returned to buffalo lafontaine was traded to buffalo on oct 25 with randy wood and randy hillier for turgeon , hogue , uwe krupp and dave mcllwain in a deal that has benefited both teams lafontaine s relationship with the islanders and their fans started in nassau coliseum on march 6 , 1984 , when he played his first game for the islanders and had a goal and an assist in a 52 victory over the flyers i 'll never forget that game because i lost my contact lenses , lafontaine said we looked for it , but nothing i think the zamboni found it lafontaine has lost none of his skills or his charm after he entered the building this afternoon , it took him a long time to get to the visitors' dressing room as he went past the islanders' dressing room he shook hands with everyone on his way , showed them the latest pictures of his daughter , sara elizabeth , and told them his wife , marybeth , was expecting their second child around the end of september goal waved off in the first minute of the middle period , lafontaine raised his hands in celebration after poking the puck in the net from underneath fitzpatrick , but the goal was disallowed because dan marouelli , the referee , had already blown the play dead bodger s goal came during a fiveminute major and a game misconduct to pilon for highsticking aleksandr mogilny 11 seconds into the game i tip my hat to mark , lafontaine said of fitzpatrick he seems to have sparked their team we would have a better fate if we had another goal early when we dominated buffalo s domination was so complete in the first half of the opening period that the islanders had their first shot at buffalo s goal 12 minutes 14 seconds into the game at that point , coach al arbour must have been angry with his team s inability to test buffalo s goaltender , david littman , who was making his first start this season littman saved the first shot , but he allowed two goals on the next three shots less than two minutes apart , and the islanders had a 21 lead before the first intermission they sealed their victory with goals by thomas and mcinnis in the third period hogue set up the first two goals , by marois at 15 minutes 45 seconds and by turgeon at 17 minutes 20 seconds hogue also had two assists in the islanders' 62 victory in buffalo last sunday slap shots the good news for pat lafontaine today was that he played without the protective helmet because his jaw has now healed completely he said the metal brace that held his jaw together and had been a nuisance going through metal detectors at airports will come out within a week randy wood , who also made his first visit since the trade , said his return to the coliseum was a combination of anxiety and nervousness the islanders left after the game for washington , the first of four games on the road photo sabres' pat lafontaine struggling for puck in his return to nassau coliseum yesterday \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
washington , sept 18 as finance ministers gathered here for the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank , a senate panel approved a foreign aid bill today that provides none of the 12 billion in additional american money that president bush has promised the imf the action , by the senate appropriations committee s subcommittee on foreign operations , sends a signal to the bush administration that some democrats remain leery of supporting the fund despite its newfound role in helping russia and the other former soviet republics i am deeply disappointed , a senior fund official said tonight for several years , senator patrick leahy , the vermont democrat who heads the subcommittee , has opposed more money for the fund until it does more in undeveloped countries to help poor people and the environment cash reserves of the fund are rapidly dwindling as the financially stricken nations of the former soviet union join it and immediately seek loans its financial health could deteriorate if european countries begin withdrawing their money to prop up stumbling currencies no country has exercised its unchallengeable right to withdraw money from the fund since the united states did so in 1979 , when president jimmy carter pulled out money to support the american dollar if the imf runs out of cash , it has the right to require member countries to contribute money today s vote hurt the prospects for congressional approval of the money this year , but the full senate appropriations committee and full senate could still restore the money the senate has passed separate legislation allowing the transfer of the money for the imf and the former republics without actually providing it photo finance ministers gathered yesterday in washington for the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank the managing director of the imf , michel camdessus , second from right , greeted members of the delegation from azerbaijan they were , from left , an interpreter , who was not identified , vahid akhundov , vagif ahmedov and galip agaev \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
jerusalem , jan 3 palestinian delegates to the middle east peace talks said today that they had suspended plans to go to washington for a new round of negotiations next week as a protest against israel s decision to expel 12 palestinians from the occupied territories the negotiators said a final decision on whether the delay would be temporary or turned into a fullblown boycott was to be made by the palestine liberation organization , which they called the legitimate political leadership of the palestinian people at israel s insistence , the plo has no official standing in the peace negotiations but the unstated reality is that it remains a pivotal decisionmaker for the palestinians even though a significant amount of authority has shifted in recent months to local leaders in the occupied west bank and gaza strip plo s decision by emphasizing the plo s continuing leadership , the negotiators might have sought to remind israel that it is dealing with that organization , whether or not it wishes to acknowledge so publicly it was not clear what the final plo decision might be a spokesman at the headquarters in tunis said yasir arafat , the plo chairman , and other palestinian leaders were still discussing the matter in washington , the united states strongly condemned the israeli action today and urged israel at the highest levels to reconsider and to rescind its decision the palestinian negotiating team had been scheduled to leave today for amman , where they were to follow their pattern of conferring with their jordanian counterparts before heading to washington as a joint delegation jordan s chief negotiator said his team would be ready to resume talks tuesday as scheduled israeli officials said their travel plans also had not changed there was no reaction from the other central parties in the process , syria and lebanon using similar language , palestinian officials here and in tunis denounced the israeli explusion order as a grave breach of international law and part of israel s destructive policy to torpedo the peace process delegates who met today in east jerusalem appealed to the united states and other major countries to put pressure on israel to reverse its decision through the day , american , russian , british and french officials all criticized the israeli action , although they also condemned terrorist violence in the territories that israel cites as the basic reason for the announced explusions defense minister moshe arens , who had ordered the deportations on thursday , said tonight that no amount of pressure would change his decision , which has yet to go into effect , to give the 12 palestinians time to appeal to a military review board and , if they wish , to the israeli supreme court mr arens and other senior officials , including military commanders , defended explusions as an effective means of reducing violence by getting rid of people whom they accuse of inciting and creating the atmosphere for terrorism since the start of the palestinian uprising against israel in december 1987 , 66 arabs in the territories have been deported , usually by forcing them to go to lebanon , where israel maintains a selfdescribed security zone along a southern strip of the country we 're not dealing with angels of peace , said ehud gol , a senior adviser to prime minister yitzhak shamir a government must insure the safety of its citizens ambush attacks surge but the israeli policy has been strenuously criticized by the united states and other western countries as a violation of internationally accepted humanrights accords , specifically the fourth geneva convention governing the treatment of people under occupation that convention s rejection of such deportations , put into effect soon after world war ii , came as a reaction to nazi policies in occupied lands under pressure from washington , israel has not expelled anyone since last spring but the last two months have seen a surge of ambush attacks that killed four israelis in the occupied territories , including a settler shot to death this week while driving near a palestinian refugee camp in the gaza strip none of the 12 people facing deportation seven from gaza and five from the west bank were specifically accused of responsibility for the recent ambush killings but they were described as belonging to various plo factions and to an islamic fundamentalist group called hamas , and purportedly fell within the israeli definition of those who incite violence the israeli army today identified the 12 palestinians ehab mohammed ashkar , 27 years old , from gaza s shati refugee camp , a key coordinator of the uprising sami abu samhadaneh , 29 , a leader of the mainstream fatah faction of the plo from the gaza town of rafah

sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , oct 1 over the last two days , hundreds of muslims have been pouring into sarajevo s city center from their homes in a serbheld neighborhood , offering compelling evidence that at least some of the serbs fighting in bosnia and herzegovina are reneging on a promise to end the widely condemned practice of ethnic cleansing from noon on wednesday until dusk today , at least 500 residents of grbavica , a leafy suburb that clings to the steep hillsides across the miljacka river from the heart of sarajevo , have come across the bridges into the city center , sometimes being fired on as they ran from their accounts it appears that most were given 10 to 15 minutes to leave their homes many told of being robbed of money , jewelry and other valuables , and most arrived with only small bags of clothing judge says she was raped at least one woman , a judge , said she had been raped an 80yearold woman arrived in her socks , saying she had been refused permission to get her shoes for the walk into the life of a refugee a month ago , the leaders of the serbs who have proclaimed their own state in bosnia met in london with leaders of the muslims and the croats , the country s other ethnic groups , and pledged , in the presence of top officials from the united states , britain and a dozen other countries , to halt ethnic cleansing the term is used by the bosnian serbs to describe their policy of evicting nonserbs from territory under their control in practice this has meant driving people from their homes , stealing their property and herding them into detention camps or across battle lines or killing them outright , as has happened in thousands of cases all acts involved in the practice of ethnic cleansing are abhorrent and should cease forthwith , conference documents signed by all the bosnian leaders said other recent violations of this pledge have been reported , especially in northern bosnia near the city of banja luka but the case of grbavica is unusual for having been observed by western reporters in progress with a hotel curtain pulled aside a couple of inches so as not to attract the attention of serbian snipers on the grbavica side of the bridge , the miserable realities of ethnic cleansing were plainly visible every now and then a gaggle of men , women and children dashed onto the bridge from the serbian side , clutching suitcases patched together with tape , scuffed backpacks and bulging plastic bags some children were so small they had to be carried , and some adults so old they had to pause every few steps , lean on the side of the bridge and catch their breath the lucky ones made it to the hotel without braving gunfire others were forced to make the dash in a crossfire between serbian and bosnian government troops a new term for them without electricity to power televisions and radios in grbavica , and with batteries long since exhausted , some of those driven from their homes at gunpoint had not even heard the euphemism for the misery being inflicted on them ethnic cleansing \? i did n't know what it was , but now i do , said aslija fetahovic , the old lady who made it across the bridge in her socks she said young serbian militants burst into her apartment at lunchtime on wednesday i was just getting something to eat when they came , she said they were big men , all bearded , with chetnik uniforms and badges , and they said 'you 've got 10 minutes to leave your home if you have any gold or foreign currency or jewelry , you must give it to us , or we will kill you' 'out ! out ! out ! ' the chetniks were the world war ii guerrillas who fought the nazis in the name of the serbian monarchy that ruled yugoslavia the name has now been appropriated by serbian factions that have committed many of the worst atrocities in the bosnian conflict i asked if i could get my boots from the cupboard , but they said , 'out ! out ! out ! ' mrs fetahovic recalled you would n't believe it now , but i had such nice things , from paris , from london as god is my witness , i did like many of the 13 million bosnians who have been driven from their homes in the sixmonth war , mrs fetahovic lost everything she could not thrust hastily into bags scores of muslim families in grbavica were uprooted in a similar fashion some of the chetniks wore the black jumpsuits and doubleheaded eagle badges of the paramilitary faction led by zeljko raznjatovic , described as a former agent for the yugoslav intelligence service in western europe his nom de guerre , arkan , has become synonomous with terror throughout muslim regions of bosnia judge tells of rape at the drafty reception center in sarajevo , many of the new refugees said they had been told to hand over their keys and not to lock anything , on pain of immediate execution mrs fetahovic said that before stepping out her door with two small bags of clothes , she was halted while one of the gunmen pulled off her gold earrings another woman , nadira sehovic , 47 , said she had handed over 6 , 000 german marks , about 4 , 250 , that she and her husband had saved for the education of their children , a girl of 12 and a boy of 10 a middleaged woman , a judge until the war , told reporters that she had been raped by serbian soldiers until april , grbavica , like most sarajevo districts , was an ethnically mixed neighborhood , where serbs lived harmoniously alongside muslims and croats but since serbian forces seized the neighborhood in the early stages of the sarajevo siege , muslims escaping the neighborhood have told of being subjected to midnight searches , denied pension payments and harassed on the streets hundreds of muslim men deemed to be of fighting age have been taken to serbian detention camps , and others have been dragooned into working parties to dig trenches , fill sandbags and clean latrines several times before , hundreds of muslims have been driven at gunpoint across the bridges into the governmentheld heart of sarajevo , where they start the dread round of finding new homes , scrounging for food and , in many cases , lining up at relief agencies in the hope of tracing missing husbands , brothers and sons the extent of the war s toll was underscored by the release today of figures compiled by the bosnian medical center in sarajevo , which said 14 , 364 people were known to have been killed across bosnia , with 57 , 000 others listed as missing , most of them believed to be dead the center said that the figures included 1 , 447 children known to have been killed and 8 , 500 who are missing in addition , the center listed 125 , 784 people as wounded , 47 , 284 seriously , among whom were 12 , 080 children bosnia s prewar population was 43 million this time , none of those crossing the bridges were injured , but one man , fadil dedic , appeared to have had a narrow escape the 40yearold muslim carpenter told of being halted by a serbian fighter as he rushed to the bridge with his wife , his 16yearold son and his mother as he kneeled on the sidewalk , mr dedic said , the serb drew his pistol and forced it his mouth i was sure he was going to kill him , said velija dedic , the man s son just then , a serbian policeman came around the corner and said 'do n't do it let him go' photo with the eviction of hundreds more bosnian muslims in serbiancontrolled neighborhoods of sarajevo , the horror of ethnic cleansing has reemerged in the war aslija fetahovic , 80 years old , recounted her evacuation yesterday after she reached the safety of a refugee center in central sarajevo \( associated press \) \( pg a8 \) map of grbavica \( pg a8 \)
to the editor it is reassuring to note , as you report oct 22 , that the united states tennis association and new york city , faced with strong community opposition to the association s proposed expansion in flushing meadowscorona park , have agreed to leave the golf pitchandputt course in place and not remove it to the flushing kissena corridor it is patent nonsense , however , to believe that the giveaway of a substantial portion of the park for the benefit of multimillionaire professional tennis players , probably none of whom reside in new york city , will be acceptable to the people because the increased acreage demanded will be reduced from 31 acres to 256 acres this will thus give the united states tennis association a total of 426 acres in the park , as well as the right to park thousands of automobiles on grassland during the united states open a giveaway of 426 acres is not less a cancer on the park than 48 acres the proposal , even as modified , and particularly with the history of mistreatment by city officials of flushing meadowscorona park , does not serve the interests of the people of queens or the rest of new york city it demonstrates on the part of city officials a singular lack of understanding of the importance of parkland in an urban society it does , of course , serve the interests of a private , wealthy , commercial group the mayor and his tennis partner sid davidoff , who is the united states tennis association s paid lobbyist the proposed expansion of the tennis center , even in its dubious reduced form , will be opposed with as much dedication as the original proposal was benjamin m haber vice chairman , committee for the preservation of flushing meadowscorona park flushing , queens , oct 22 , 1992
teheran , iran , april 7 in a fluorescentlighted mosque down a dark , narrow alley in the midst of the greengrocers' stalls of south teheran , three candidates for parliament are campaigning they do not kiss babies or shake hands or make promises rather , they sit crosslegged on a cold , damp floor covered with dusty carpets , sipping tea and fielding the questions from a group of 30 men who have come to hear them what about all we hear about the luxurious lives of some government officials \? said one man , asking a question often raised in a country where reports of official corruption are spreading and the unofficial inflation rate is 50 percent without mentioning names , the questioner asserted that hojatolislam mehdi karudi , speaker of the iranian parliament , had spent 200 million rials close to 150 , 000 on his daughter s wedding it burns me , the young man said , when i do n't even have 100 , 000 rials to get married parties banned in '87 the candidate s answer was predictable , if a bit off the point the united states is the enemy which wants to destroy us all and dishonor the leaders of the revolution , replied mohammed hassan rahimian , who is running on the rouhanioun , or clerics' , ticket as for the wedding , he said , i was at that wedding , and there was no more than a plate of rice and a bowl of stew it is a curious kind of persianstyle revolutionary democracy throughout iran , 2 , 050 candidates are struggling for name recognition in eight frenzied days of campaigning for elections to 270 seats in iran s parliament as friday s election gets closer , the various factions , bound more by family and tribal loyalties than by policy platforms , have stepped up attacks against their opponents and against the united states in sermons , debates , rallies and newspaper commentaries the verbal jousting is protracted for the parliament , the place where elected representatives come to settle the revolution s remaining ideological battles , lobby for porkbarrel projects back home , block enemy legislation and sling mud in the 12 years since it was created , the parliament has immersed its members in a kind of nationwide group therapy whose lengthy sessions are broadcast on radio and television not that iran s parliamentary system is democratic by western standards iran banned political parties in 1987 and politicians whose views veer too far from the mainstream may find themselves languishing in prison and certain points of view , like criticizing the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , would never be tolerated slow legislative process but with the exception of israel s parliament , iran s legislative body has proven to be the liveliest parliament in the middle east , so lively that at one point a couple of years ago , two deputies threw their shoes at each other during one debate as iranians are proud to tell the dozens of foreign journalists invited in for the occasion , none of the persian gulf countries has such a representative body , and the national assembly in neighboring iraq is nothing more than a rubber stamp under iran s constitution , parliament is charged with approving cabinet appointees and formulating and passing legislation but parliament s decisions are subject to long reviews by the council of guardians , a watchdog group of six clerics and six laymen that has often vetoed or simply ignored pending legislation , particularly when it appeared to violate the rights of private property and profitmaking permitted by islam in 1988 , ayatollah khomeini added another layer , creating a 13member expediency council to settle disputes between the reformoriented legislators and the conservative council of guardians parliamant also has the power to paralyze it took the elected body nine years to pass comprehensive labor legislation and it has yet to pass an extensive landreform bill it has purged cabinet members , muzzled debate on contentious issues like relations with the united states , and consistently urged a militant foreign policy spiritually correct choices president hashemi rafsanjani can count on controling only about 100 of its 270 members , while about 80 to 90 members consistently vote against him and the remaining 80 to 90 are swing voters although the current parliament has accepted his fiveyear plan and this year s budget , president rafsanjani has been repeatedly frustrated by its maneuvers to block his efforts to revive iran s crippled economy and to open up to the west parliament also provides a forum for the venting of complaints of the nation , a timeconsuming process that often prevents it from acting on more crucial business in a debate last month , for example , a deputy from abadan , which was badly damaged in the iraniraq war , called the money allocated to repair damaged homes insignificant and trivial , and called on the president and his ministers to direct more of their kindness to the condition of the people a deputy from khuzestan province called the taxes imposed by the city halls intolerable , and demanded economic relief for his constituents

tokyo , dec 25 japan s electronics industry , once considered nearly unstoppable , is now suffering from its worst slump since world war ii , according to new figures released by the industry s main trade association production of all electronics equipment in japan fell an estimated 106 percent in 1992 from 1991 , the first doubledigit decline since world war ii , the electronics industries association of japan said in a report released this week the trade group also predicted that the industry s output would grow a scant 15 percent in 1993 the organization s annual assessment painted a surprisingly gloomy picture of an industry battered by slack demand in its home market and a lack of innovative new products , technological changes and rising competition from lowercost manufacturers in east asia painful restructuring indeed , the slump affects virtually all products made by the japanese , including televisions , video recorders , computers , calculators , semiconductors , telecommunications equipment and scientific instruments and it is forcing japan s once vaunted companies to undergo painful restructuring the decline in 1992 japanese electronics production to 226 trillion yen , or about 180 billion , was unexpected a year ago , the industry association had projected that output in 1992 would grow 56 percent the results contrast with the united states electronics industry , in which at least some products , including semiconductors and personal computers , have seen strong growth the data suggest that american companies are gaining worldwide market share at the expense of the japanese while the main cause of the production downturn is the recession in japan , the report indicated that there are several factors that will continue to hurt the japanese industry even after the economy improves needed new demand consumer electronics companies , for instance , are suffering not only from recession but from the fact that most homes already have a videocassette recorder or a television set new products are needed to fuel growth , but none have emerged while some electronics companies have placed their hopes on highdefinition television and on new digital audio recorders like sony s minidisk system , the electronics association said these products would not make an impact for years , if at all it is not expected that recently introduced products , including highdefinition television equipment , will spur significant new demand , the report said in computers , japan s industry , particularly the producers of large mainframes , are starting to feel the effects of the same shift toward smaller machines that has devastated the world s biggest computer company , the international business machines corporation the widespread electronics industry slump has already led to at least onetime losses at leading companies like fujitsu , nec , sony and oki electric the problems are forcing the companies to jettison some marginal businesses and to reduce their work forces by thousands , though most companies are doing this through attrition rather than layoffs executives are now preparing for a decade in which growth will be far slower than in the past slow recovery expected we wo n't see a high growth rate like in the 70 s and 80 s , said shigeru yoshinaka , electronics analyst with barclays de zoete wedd securities and with companies reluctant to lay off people , he said , the recovery in profits will be prolonged compared with the united states companies japan s electronics industry had seen almost continuous growth for several decades , sometimes as much as 30 percent a year in the last two decades , there have been only two other years in which production shrank in 1975 , after the first oil shock , and in 1986 , after the strengthened yen made japanese products more expensive abroad worst hit in 1992 was the consumer electronics sector , perhaps the industry for which japan is best known production of audio and video equipment is estimated to have plummeted 17 percent , to 39 trillion yen , or a little more than 30 billion another decline of 35 percent is projected for 1993 exports fell 131 percent in the first nine months of the year measured in units , japanese production of color televisions dropped 107 percent , videocassette recorders 228 percent and video cameras 236 percent but production of compact disk players rose 79 percent , although output of other stereo equipment fell the report shows that consumer electronics is becoming less important here , accounting for 172 percent of total electronics production in 1992 compared with 307 percent in 1982 offshore manufacturing part of the decline in production in japan results from the fact that japanese companies have shifted their manufacturing offshore much of the movement has been to southeast asia , which offers lower manufacturing costs and is helping the japanese companies compete with lowcost suppliers in south korea , taiwan and other areas in other cases , production has shifted to the united states and europe to be closer to markets for color televisions and tape recorders , production by japanese companies outside japan now exceeds production in japan computer production also had a steep drop of 102 percent , to 546 trillion yen , or about 44 billion , as japan s hard pressed banks and securities companies have scaled back on their investments in automation even sales of personal computers , which should be a fastgrowing field , fell about 10 percent in 1992 , analysts said weak sales of computers and consumer electronic equipment in turn led to an estimated decline of 98 percent in integrated circuit production in 1992 some market research figures show that american semiconductor companies have now regained the lead in overall computer chip production from the japanese
meribel , france , feb 18 one by one they had zoomed down the mountain today chasing the crowd s beloved carole merle , a daughter of the french alps , and each had failed by an invisible electronic tick and now the italian , deborah compagnoni , known affectionately by her countrymen as tombagnoni because her daring style is reminiscent of her training partner , alberto tomba , dared to try to wrest the gold medal in the women s super giant slalom tomba was on another mountain getting ready to make his gold medal run in the giant slalom as compagnoni began her mile run over a course that combined the speed of the downhill with the sensitivity needed to negotiate the slalom gates , twists and turns at high speed compagnoni took off , low to the ground , arms in tight , not flapping it was just as she and tomba had learned in training together she looked good she hit the first marker in 2996 seconds faster than merle at this point at the bottom of the mountain , the crowd , carrying tricolors and waving cowbells , let out a nervous oh ! aching legs but the crowd recovered quickly after all , 11 other skiers had taken after their carole and failed and compagnoni was only 33 hundredths of a second ahead but suddenly , she was to recall , she did not think she could finish my legs hurt , she said i did not know if i could go on and who could blame her \? two years ago , a skiing accident interrupted her career , and last year she had two feet of her intestines removed but she pushed on today the crowd below could not see her yet , but they saw the new time displayed on the television screen oh ! again and the italian had increased her lead to more than a second now she loomed over the crest , arriving with a spray of snow kicking up behind her maybe she would go wide over the final 100 meters , just as petra kronberger of austria had done minutes earlier , just as katja seizinger of germany had done , just as ulrike maier of austria had done all had a shot at merle now , the crowd hoped , it was compagnoni s turn to fail not today doggedly , still low and tight , knees throbbing , compagnoni took the final gates she whizzed under the finish line in first place alpine silence my legs do n't hurt any more , she recalled thinking she had sped the mile in 1 minute 2122 seconds for her first olympic medal that was 141 seconds faster than merle , who had what had seemed a huge lead of more than half a second over seizinger compagnoni s victory was this decisive none of the first 39 finishers had a victory margin over the competitor behind her that was so great a television camera was thrust into her face i hope tomba wins like i did , she said she knew that in a few minutes , alberto tomba would go after a repeat olympic medal in the giant slalom he , too , would take a gold while compgagnoni , a northern italian , often trains with tomba , he does not train with others when she called him several years ago and said she would like to train with him , he told her it is ok you are not a rival fast start for an american for just a shade under half a minute , it seemed there might have been a medal for the united states also the first skier of the day was diann roff of potsdam , ny , and she brought gasps from the throng when she was timed at 2995 seconds for the first marker only seizinger would be quicker there today her attacking strategy had worked , but only up to a point after 10 more seconds , roff finished negotiating a gate there s a fallaway after the gate , she recalled i just got on my inside ski , hit a little bump , and it was over and so it was she was down 'not the best day' but three more americans skied the course , and eva twardokens of santa cruz , calif , finished eighth , 297 seconds out of first julie parisien of auburn , me , was 11th and hilary lindh , who had won the silver in the downhill , was 18th parisien , however , was disqualified because she started 16 hundredths of a second too soon obviously , this was not the best day , said the women s coach , ernst hager eva blew a turn julie held herself back not knowing what to expect , and hilary preferred a course straighter and faster if this were a world cup , i 'd be elated , said twardokens but there s so much focus on medals here merle , france s most popular female skier , knows these mountains her parents own a hotel in the southern alps and she is considered a local hero i am not disappointed , she said a silver medal is fantastic photos deborah compagnoni alberto tomba compagnoni celebrating her victory \( photographs by steve powell allsport , left , and barton silverman the new york times \)
el alto , bolivia in the shadow of a 50foot statue of jesus that looks down on la paz from this sprawling shantytown city , valentin quispe tossed leaves of coca onto a brightly colored cloth in his tiny , musty cubicle coca has the faith of god , said the gnarly faced yatiri , or fortuneteller , of the aymara indian culture it s the blessing from the lord coca feeds the poor it give you strength coca is the best , the only leaf if it falls on the white side , that is bad luck the green side is good luck the world may not be ready to accept the prognostications of this andean tealeaf reader but president jaime paz zamora and his government hope not only to make the plant legal to export , but also to create an international market for products like coca leaf tea coca impounded by spain many people outside bolivia who are strangers to this exotic culture chuckle at the proposal after all , coca is the raw material for cocaine , the cause of many of the united states' drug problems agents of the drug enforcement administration here say they would like to wipe out every coca plant in the country but the bolivian government says it is serious about efforts to commercialize coca since the tea is only a mild stimulant and has none of the addictive or intoxicating effects of cocaine in the last few months it has taken its case to major international organizations the campaign appears to have grown out of a political mixup at expo '92 in seville , spain , in april bolivia had taken about 20 pounds of coca leaf to use in its exhibition to show the scores of cultural uses of coca in bolivian society but the coca was impounded by the spanish government , prompting a series of diplomatic protests then early in may president paz zamora went to the 45th annual meeting of the world health organization in geneva to ask the agency to investigate the possible medical and nutritional uses of coca , with an eye toward removing it from the list of products that can be sold only under tight governmental supervision the use of the coca leaf is an andean tradition , he said the use of cocaine is a foreign habit cash shortage the impetus and at a meeting of the organization of american states in the bahamas in may , bolivia s foreign minister , ronald maclean , said his country was committed to seeking the legal industrialization and commercialization of the subproducts derivative from the innocent coca leaf much of the impetus is the need for more export revenues in this cashstarved country as a result of falling natural gas prices , bolivia s exports are expected to be at least 150 million lower this year than in 1991 moreover , most efforts by bolivia to persuade its 300 , 000 peasant farmers to eradicate coca and plant substitute crops have failed and because it is politically and socially impossible to take away the meager livelihoods of these farmers , the government has abandoned any effort at forced eradication bolivia s minister of planning , samuel doria medina , said that if the country could just begin to tap the world market for herbal teas and sell its mate de coca crushed coca leaves that can be used in tea bags to produce a soothing and aromatic tea it could easily make up the lost revenues at world herbal tea prices , the price of coca leaf would also be far greater than what drug traffickers are now paying , forcing them out of business , he said coca tea helps visitors look , it takes about 150 kilos of coca leaves to make one kilo of cocaine that a peasant can sell in bolivia to traffickers for about 2 , 000 , mr doria medina said if you make mate de coca out of the same amount of leaves , the export price would be more like 15 , 000 though it is questionable whether bolivia will be able to convince the world that it is safe to have large quantities of coca herbal tea shipped around the world , without a doubt those coming to this country understand almost immediately why coca has been such a vital part of its culture at 12 , 000 feet , the air is so thin that visitors are immediately offered coca tea , which eases headaches , nausea and weakness in a kind of diplomatic twist , queen sofia of spain publicly drank coca leaf tea at the airport bolivian peasants have traditionally chewed coca to combat hunger , thirst and fatigue four hundred years ago the spanish gave coca to their indian miners to chew so they could be pushed to mine more silver and entrepreneurs are springing up trying to market cocabased products like toothpaste , creams and tonics that are said to use the plant s medicinal properties the old and the new in la paz , dr walter alvarez treats patients with both modern medical techniques and natural medicine based on coca he rubs coca on the temples of patients to relieve headaches he mixes ground coca leaf with urine , ash , rosemary and salt as a compress for women after they have given birth he gives patients a mixture of coca and honey to soothe the stomach and he treats certain cases of diabetes with coca and like mr quispe , the fortune teller , dr alvarez will also let coca leaves look into the future the old and the new have value , he said you have to vary the treatment you do n't take coca every day but coca is the primary medicinal plant there is photo the bolivian government has begun a campaign to educate the world about the medicinal and cultural uses of the coca plant valentin quispe , right , and gregorio quinteros , aymara indian fortunetellers , tossed coca leaves onto a handwoven cloth in an attempt to divine the country s political

minneapolis , sept 22 keith jackson of the philadelphia eagles and three other national football league players will learn on wednesday whether they will become instant free agents united states district court judge david doty listened to arguments by lawyers representing the players and the league this morning before taking the case under advisement he did not announce a decision today , but a ruling was expected by wednesday at issue is whether the four players should become free agents because they had no contracts when the league s plan b system of free agency was found illegal under antitrust law the other players are detroit s d j dozier , cleveland s webster slaughter and new england s garin veris all four remain unsigned and away from their current squads , awaiting word if they will be able to begin negotiating freely with other teams none had contracts on sept 10 , when an eightwomen jury found in favor of the players in a lawsuit filed by freeman mcneil and seven others against the nfl the jury found that the league s primary system of free agency , in which players try to sell their services to other teams in an openmarket situation was illegal plan b annually allowed each nfl team to protect 37 players , leaving the rest to negotiate with other teams the 37 protected players were restricted by the right of first refusal compensation guidelines contained in plan b jeffrey kessler , lawyer for the players , argued that since the system has been found illegal , the four should not be restricted in any way frank rothman , lawyer for the league , said that since the mcneil case is scheduled for appeal , a ruling that would make the players instant free agents now would prove impossible to correct should the league win its appeal the crux of the issue is free agency for the players and how much of it the nfl owners will allow and what effect it will have on america s most popular sports entity it is a subject that the players and owners have not been able to resolve and the primary obstacle in reaching a collective bargaining agreement , which has been absent since 1987 players say that a less restrictive system of free agency will enhance competitive balance and that they will finally enjoy a right that most americans have to shop their services to the highest bidder the league argues that under such a system , the best players will flock to the glamour nfl markets , that salaries will soar but those of average nfl players will suffer , and that some teams in smaller markets could fold on sept 10 there were 10 to 15 players who were unsigned , but that number had dwindled to four by today as teams began releasing or trading the players after the jury s verdict on plan b two other groups of players are seeking free agency the eight plaintiffs in the mcneil case and more than 280 players , led by the eagles' allpro reggie white , whose contracts expire feb 1 kessler asked the judge today to hear the white case on dec 21 when he also is scheduled to decide the status of the mcneil plaintiffs during their arguments today , lawyers for both sides agreed that doty s decision would have farreaching impact , but disagreed in what manner kessler said that not granting the four players freedom would mean the jury s verdict on plan b was meaningless he argued that the type of injury and damages for the players would be difficult to calculate in the future and in some instances impossible to recover deserve to start slaughter is in a runoriented offense in cleveland and wants to play on a passoriented team , kessler said dozier has not had the opportunity to start , first behind herschel walker at minnesota and now behind barry sanders at detroit verins has been called a superstar but yet he does n't start with new england and he should have the chance to start somewhere on another team for jackson , it s not just about money , it s about getting security and a guranteed contract , something the eagles wo n't give him kessler used the eagles' 30 start and 300 victory over the denver broncos last sunday as proof that free agency does not harm competitive balance they win by 300 and get three touchdown passes , kessler said what do they want , to win by 500 and get six touchdown passes \? the eagles knew the risk and had a chance to sign jackson before it came to this point now what should jackson have to do , sit out a whole year like bobby hebert \( of the new orleans saints \) did \? rothman argued that since the entire mcneil case was on appeal that the reasonable thing to do was let the case play its way out in court even though they ask for a preliminary injuction here with these four players , the fact is if they sign with other teams , it s permanent , rothman said how do you unscramble these eggs \? you ca n't

indianapolis , june 26 at truck stops and picnics , in downtown high rises and farmtown cafes , the american heartland is talking politics i 've voted republican all my life , but i'm disgusted , 40yearold jim allmon said in ball park bleachers as he watched his son play little league in springfield , ill i'm leaning toward perot and hope he does n't come up with something off the wall but in the middle of iowa , in kellogg , another 40yearold , bonnie crook , who voted last time for michael s dukakis , said she was uncomfortable with ross perot , the dallas billionaire i do n't want bush i do n't like clinton but i'm afraid of perot , she said , gazing from the window of her grocery at the oneblock main street he s a trojan horse we do n't know what s really inside him four years down the line , will he hurt us \? will we be sorry \? i'm afraid so in a weeklong thousandmile drive and in chats with some 200 people around the midwest from kansas city , mo , north to iowa , then across illinois and indiana mr perot was very much the topic of conversation but it was not always favorable none of the wideeyed fervor here that came out in similar conversations in california just four weeks ago , no blizzard of bumper stickers for every perot supporter , there was a perot opponent where else to go \? the same was true of president bush he still has a base of support , especially in farm country but even many people sticking with him said they were doing so not because he is so strong , but because mr perot and gov bill clinton , the presumed democratic nominee , are so inexperienced , so phony i do n't know what else to do , said arthur kane , a 45yearold lawyer in st joseph , mo do n't make me out to be leading the bush bandwagon i'm not but i do n't see where else to go clinton and perot are just playing at it they 're not experienced leaders polls show mr clinton gaining support nationwide but there was little evidence of that during this journey people seemed accustomed to thinking in terms of a twocandidate race and in this part of the country , where the sentiment is often republican , it was mr clinton , not mr perot , who was perceived as the thirdparty candidate , eclipsed by an incumbent president and a give 'em hell billionaire even in some urban areas and among some people who voted democratic four years ago it s time for a change , but i do n't think mr clinton has the experience to go in there , said tim bredberg , a 38yearold race horse trainer in central illinois who voted last time for mr dukakis i'm leaning toward perot he 'll shake it up if he does n't come up with some concrete specifics , i 'll go to bush lemonade , not vitriol from town to town and state to state , the country flashed by in a series of nonstop portraits white farmhouses engulfed in a sea of green corn , contented town squares with the flag flying high , farmers rushing out the door to greet a visitor not out of fear but to offer a glass of lemonade for the most part , people were well informed about the campaign , quoting newspaper articles and radio and television interviews but being well informed does not necessarily mean they will vote mr perot is not so much a phenomenon here as just another candidate , and therefore not a reason for many nonvoters to change their ways i have n't registered to vote , and i do n't intend to , said kevin madlem , a 26yearold farmer in charleston , ill , who was more concerned about the lack of rain than the presidential campaign bush , clinton , they 're all the same , all talk asked about mr perot , he said everybody can talk everybody can say , 'heck i 'll go out and do all them things' he s no different than the rest of them talk i do n't care for any of them in some cases , not only is the race failing to rally nonvoters to vote , it is chasing away a few longtime voters i'm about as disenchanted as i can get , john chibnall , 30 , said as held 8monthold john jr outside abraham lincoln s tomb in springfield you could n't get three bigger dunderheads i voted for dukakis this time , i'm not going to vote a republican s out of the question clinton s just mediocre there s no reason to vote for him he s the consumate politician perot \? he s a skillful liar , very shrewd in iowa , in the winga cafe in washington , politics is as much a part of life as the corn , and not voting is unthinkable visitors are welcomed to town by being elected president of the coffee club , which meets promptly at 10 am , just as it has for 60 years , a mix of business leaders , farmers and retired people , all white men on a recent morning , the conversation was the bushites vs the perotists , with most of the older men supporting mr bush and the younger ones mr perot i do n't think perot is the paragon of virtue some people think he is , said rolly crandall i voted for dukakis , and i might vote for clinton then a shout rang out you voted for dukakis ! mr crandall hunched down in the booth i'm not sure who i 'll support i do n't put much stock in the marital infidelity stuff with clinton , he said but i'm just not sure he s up to the job 'all right' or not \? the 36 members of the breakfast club then interrupted politics to honor one of the members happy birthday , dear louis , happy birthday , to you no perot , rick hofer , 44 , said the second the singing stopped he 'll be a dictator there s a big difference between government and business it would n't work john winga jr , the owner of winga s , called mr perot probably all right , then added i think experience is what s most important i 'd prefer to go with bush the breakfast club then broke the bad news to its visitor the club s president gets stuck with he tab for coffee 832 but who s counting \?
dobbs ferry , ny the pressure was on as frank t perilli sat down last march to take the state civil service exam for police chiefs a test he had already failed twice this time , after scanning the first question , mr perilli said to himself , somebody upstairs likes me the question asked how to handle an abortion demonstration for the last 4 1 2 years , mr perilli , the acting chief of the village police , has done little else , trying to keep the peace as an abortion clinic in this small hudson river community has been overrun weekly by scores and sometimes hundreds of protesters so it was shocking for mr perilli , 60 years old , to learn last month that he had again failed the exam that failure , according to state regulations , will now cost him his job that his tenure as acting chief will be terminated because of a test score has incensed many of the 10 , 000 residents here , who credit mr perilli , a 34year veteran of the village police , with keeping the community safe as a steady stream of demonstrators made dobbs ferry a flash point of the region s antiabortion movement in sam s restaurant , reader s hardware and elsewhere on main street , they also recall that as the town youth officer , mr perilli , then a lieutenant , restored dozens of young lives tattered by substance abuse i do n't know how else i can prove i can be the chief , mr perilli said wanly during a recent interview in his small office as softrock songs drifted from the radio behind him marianna smith , a high school administrator who has counseled teenagers with mr perilli , said , this man should not have to leave his job because he failed a test i ca n't tell you the people he s helped , said ms smith , one of more than 200 people who signed a petition submitted to the town in mr perilli s defense everyone wants to do something , but what can we do \? not much , apparently four sergeants in the department passed the most recent chief s exam , said the village s mayor , donald p marra under state rules , mr perilli can remain acting chief only if none of the four want the job , county officials said all four are interested , said the mayor , who must , by law , name a new chief by middecember i'm disappointed for frank , said mr marra , who appointed mr perilli acting chief in 1990 a lot of people in dobbs ferry are sad but we 're following laws and rules that we have to follow , he said the exam , which is a requirement for all local police chiefs , includes multiplechoice and essay questions it is intended to test candidates' reading comprehension and knowledge of state criminal law candidates are also asked to respond to situations that the police may confront , including crimes and demonstrations mr perilli could have been removed as acting chief after failing the exam , which is given annually , in march 1991 but because it was his first exam as acting chief , three others in the department had to pass the test and want the job to unseat him , said edward brancati , the chief deputy personnel officer for westchester county that was not the case , and mr perilli stayed on mr perilli had also failed the test in march 1990 , three weeks after his predecessor , chief kevin costello , resigned but because he was not yet acting chief , the score did not count after successfully passing exams to reach the levels of sergeant and lieutenant , mr perilli is hardpressed to explain his failures on the chief s tests but he does say that the antiabortion protests which have kept him working from dawn to midnight virtually every saturday since 1988 , with hundreds of arrests have been an immense distraction the chief s test is graded by state officials on a scale of 1 to 100 a grade of 70 is required to pass mr perilli said he was told he received a grade of 60something on the test last march but , thinking that some of his answers were graded incorrectly , he has asked the county to review his test he said he has been told , though , that the review will not be completed before his successor is named i would like to say to myself , i really did n't fail the test , he said it would n't change anything , but it would give me satisfaction although he can continue to work here as a lieutenant , his previous rank , mr perilli is unsure what he will do the petitioners asked that a new title , commissioner , be created for him , but the mayor said the idea had been discussed by the village board of trustees and would apparently go no further you spend 34 years in the police business , what are you equipped to do \? mr perilli asked , surrounded by photographs of golf courses , where he plies his other passion i really do n't know what i want to do photo many residents of dobbs ferry , ny , are incensed that frank t perilli , above , acting police chief for the last four and onehalf years , is now losing his job because of his third failure on the state civil service exam \( jim estrin the new york times \) map of new york showing location of dobbs ferry
an amtrak passenger train traveling from boston to washington slammed into a car at a railroad crossing in wallingford , conn , yesterday morning , killing all three people in the car , but injuring none of the train s passengers or crew the collision occurred about 10 15 am , three hours after the sixcar train left boston s south station , at a crossing on a narrow deadend street in wallingford marked by only a single yellowandblack warning sign the train , which carried about 100 passengers , struck the car on a lane known as doolittle crossing , which leads to a cemetery , according to a statement by the police in wallingford the force of the impact hurled all three victims from the car , which came to rest on its side in a mangled wreck on an embankment about 50 feet from the crossing the police would not release the names of the victims , but relatives and neighbors identified one of them as adeline templeman , 67 years old , of grandview avenue in wallingford a trip made daily isabelle dabrowski , the victim s 85yearold aunt , said mrs templeman and two relatives from florida had just returned from visiting st casimir s cemetery , where mrs templeman s husband and parents are buried i'm in a fog , mrs dabrowski said i ca n't believe this has happened every blessed day , she went there she crossed those tracks every single day the accident has renewed fears in wallingford about the safety of the crossings in the small town , about 12 miles north of new haven last year , an amtrak train collided with a car at the toellers crossing , 200 yards south of the site of yesterday s fatal collision , killing a young woman we 're kind of familiar with train crossings and people being killed , minnie alex , another neighbor of mrs templeman s , said so i could n't understand how it could be happening here again more than half of the railroad crossings in the united states have no stop signs , lights , bells or gates , said an amtrak spokesman , howard w robertson doolittle crossing has a single sign on each side alerting drivers to the tracks engineers tried to stop in april , an amtrak train bound for new york collided with a dump truck and derailed in newport news , va , killing the truck driver and injuring 53 passengers that accident renewed longstanding worries about the safety of railroad crossings and prompted calls for some federal standards mr robertson said that the crossing was on private property and , thus , was not maintained by city or county authorities the police said they could not determine who owned the property , which abuts a sprawling chemical plant belonging to the american cyanamid company mr robertson said that the speed limit at the site of yesterday s accident , which is on the inland route , was 79 miles per hour , and there would be no reason why it was not going 79 miles per hour an amtrak official at the scene , patrick mead , told the associated press that the train s engineers saw the car and , blowing the horn , tried to brake , but were unable to stop the train in time she had no one' mrs templeman , a retired clerical worker for the state of connecticut whose husband , newman , died last year , lived alone on grandview avenue and sang at st casimir s church and another church in hartford she had no one , mrs dubrowski said she said that her niece and two relatives the sister and brotherinlaw of mrs templeman s husband , who arrived from florida on friday took her to st casimir s for the service at 8 am afterward , she said , they invited her to join them for breakfast and a visit to the cemetery , but she declined because she had already eaten friends and neighbors described mrs templeman , who had no children , as a friendly , quiet person , who attended church with devoted regularity she was in church this morning with the two other people who were killed , said maria krusienski , the wife of the pastor at st casimir s , a polish national catholic church a neighbor for more than 30 years , augustino dasilva , said , she was very sad when her husband died she put flowers on his grave every day photo three people were killed when the car in which they were riding was struck by an amtrak passenger train yesterday in wallingford , conn \( associated press \)
hartford , oct 30 gov lowell p weicker jr has stumped the state and urged residents in radio ads to elect a state legislature on tuesday that would be packed to the rafters with thirdparty candidates from mr weicker s own independent connecticut party but there s a significant caveat most of the candidates that his party has endorsed and that will appear on its ballot line , which reads a connecticut party , are not members of the party at all many say that if they win , they wo n't owe the governor anything so the question is , what s going on here \? is mr weicker really building a permanent third party in connecticut \? is he just endorsing candidates who may or may not need his help \? or is he really doing no more than building support for himself \? politics as usual , he says mr weicker , for his part , has said he is only keeping promises mostly , he has endorsed candidates who supported him last year in his efforts to impose an income tax but experts in connecticut s two major parties say the effort goes beyond that , and that mr weicker is in fact promoting himself , perhaps as a way of increasing his influence in the assembly this is about weicker , not the issues , said the republican party chairman , richard foley jr acp still means a cult of personality , he said mr foley and other politicians say that in most cases , mr weicker will probably be unable to prove that he helped elect anyone , since most of the democrats are listed on the democratic line as well as the connecticut party line but neither could the governor s claim that his support made the difference be disproved when the governor needs a favor or a vote that only helps mr weicker , who must govern without the traditional strings of party loyalty the connecticut party has endorsed and listed on its own line candidates in 108 races for the 187member general assembly , as the combined house and senate is known he 'll remind them at every opportunity he gets , said the senate president protem , john b larson , a democrat who was not endorsed by the governor s party the effect of that is hard to calculate , he said but the beneficiary is clearly the governor the party s radio ads , for example , sound almost exactly like the radio spots mr weicker used in running for governor in 1990 , right down to the schmaltzy theme song , a man stands up for connecticut mr weicker even points out in the ads , lest there be a misunderstanding , that s he not running and wo n't be on the ballot there is no disagreement , however , that the connecticut party is out there swinging and spending money with the big leagues in the three months from early july through midoctober , mr weicker s party spent 350 , 395 , more than the republican state central committee , which spent 241 , 180 , and only slightly less the democrats , who spent 393 , 776 contributors to the party range from some of mr weicker s own appointees in state government to business executives and outofstate residents , including more than a few in new york city the albert and mary lasker foundation , for example , a manhattanbased philanthropy that awarded mr weicker a public service award in 1988 for his work in the united states senate on medical and health issues , has continued to support him in hartford , with a 500 check this summer altogether , the party has endorsed or nominated outright 128 candidates , ranging from united states senator christopher j dodd , a democrat , through nine local registrars of voters in the six congressional races , the party endorsed three candidates and nominated two , both democrats who were not nominated by their party lynn h taborsak in the fifth congressional district , which includes waterbury , and al smith in the fourth district in fairfield county governor weicker , a former republican senator , has personally endorsed gov bill clinton for president , but his party does not have a presidential ballot line in the 36member senate , the governor s party has endorsed candidates in 27 races , including 4 who appear only on the connecticut party line in the house , 81 candidates received the acp backing mr weicker has said that the common theme of his party s endorsements , at least for incumbents running for reelection , is whether the legislator supported the budget overhaul and incometax law that mr weicker fought for and won last year those people stuck their necks out , the governor has said , and his endorsement is simply a means of returning the favor but within the universe of endorsements , the range of help given by mr weicker s group varies considerably , according to campaign documents filed with the secretary of state s office many candidates received no financial help at all , while some got 3 , 000 or more , about a fourth of the cost of a campaign in some house districts ms taborsak , the fifth congressional district candidate , got at least 3 , 000 , plus a mention in mr weicker s radio spots , while mr smith in fairfield county apparently got nothing , according to the filings one house candidate in simsbury , anita l mielert , a former democrat , got 3 , 750 outright and a personal appearance by the governor at a fundraiser in ms mielert s barn last month still , the state democratic chairman , edward l marcus , insists that none of his party members will ever be under mr weicker s thumb whoever may benefit , there s certainly no obligation whatsoever , he said the only obligation is to be a good legislator
white plains the photographers irving penn and richard avedon became famous for their shots of fashion and high society before turning their attention to real life but for gordon parks , artifice and reality have been intertwining themes from the beginning while making his first money as a photographer of fashionable women , in the chicago of the late 1930 s , mr parks was also at work on a project of his own life in the chicago slums it was this project , in fact , that got him his first big break a julius rosenwald fellowship and the chance to work for the farm security administration under roy stryker after that came a brief stint with the office of war information , followed by assignments from standard oil of new jersey , conde nast and , most important of all , life magazine mr parks , the first black photographer there , as at conde nast , rose to fame covering on the one hand haute couture and celebrities in paris and on the other the desperately poor in rio de janeiro , gangs in harlem and the black muslim movement later on , there were movies , the learning tree and shaft among them , which the photographer had already embarked on before leaving life at the end of the 1960 s the golden era has passed , but mr parks , now in his 80th year , is by no means out of gas recent accomplishments include the national medal of arts \( 1988 \) and a 12th autiobiography , voices in the mirror , together with the score and libretto for the ballet martin at the gallery in the white plains public library \( 4221480 \) , meanwhile , is moments without proper names , which remains on view through march 31 taking its title from an earlier autobiography , the exhibition draws from the archives bestowed by the photographer on kansas state university in 1973 , and it is supported by the city of white plains , where he lived for many years , and by other westchester bodies public and private one thing this survey of 20 or so years proves is that while mr parks has spent the better part of his life traveling in glamorous circles , very little of the glamour has rubbed off to judge from pictures taken of him , his own appearance is casual and a bit swashbuckling tweeds , a western hat , a handlebar moustache and a fullbent pipe as a photographer , he can do a mean fashion shot , like the one of the model beside a baroque chair , the light raking her face and the frilly petticoats she displays but it seems that beauty , whether contrived or innate , leaves him unmoved as for rank , exking carol of romania and magda lupescu , marooned among their memorabilia , might as well be running a momandpop store not that the photographer runs to the other extreme , although it happens that the only aristocrat in the show is an old woman posed on a porch in his hometown , fort scott , kan she sits in profile with the finely chiseled planes of her face heightened by carefully angled reflected light but while mr parks has plenty to say in his book about racial discrimination , his pictures are not polemical the suffering he depicts is human , and his gaze is laconic so are titles like poverty girl , harlem and poverty , mother and child , puerto rico still , in harlem , a boy sleeps on a bare mattress under a wall with a hole in it in rio de janeiro , there are four children to a bed in what looks like a large packing crate when published in life , the brazilian documentary , which focused on an ailing boy named flavio , elicited donations from countless readers and free treatment for the boy at a colorado hospital but the two most affecting shots in this selection are of flavio s father radiating despair and of an unnamed boy sitting with a gigantic spider splayed across his shirt , an animal companion , evidently some of these pictures have the look of film stills , especially that of a man bent over , tasting stew his room is a crate transformed into a barred cell by stripes of sunlight between the planks nevertheless , mr parks may have done his best work in his own country a profile of red jackson , a harlem gang leader silhouetted against a broken window a crowd of muslim women whose matched figures could be from a painting by the surrealist george tooker , and , last but not least , the great lawyer joseph welch , framed incongruously by a frilly window curtain that most of these black and whites are enlarged heightens their drama still , there are none so dramatic or so deeply felt as the images of muhammad ali , which include the famous one of the champion with his skin awash in sweat and his eyes lighted by the photographer s flash more significant , though , is the study of the fists that made the boxer famous the focus , seldom very deep in mr parks s pictures , is on the knuckles , which are a mass of swelling and contusions those looking for the photographer s heart will find it here , in the ali studies photos red jackson , harlem gang leader , 1949 , above , and muslim women , chicago , 1963 , from the gordon parks show in white plains
if ronald reagan can say he knew thomas jefferson , then it might be said that goose gossage knew connie mack and every great manager to come down the major league pike martin , weaver , howser , mauch , you name them , gossage has played for them or against them but never before , says the pitcher , has he played for one quite like tony la russa , manager of the american league west leading oakland athletics he s by far one of the best i 've ever seen or played for , gossage said yesterday at this point , gossage and other members of the oakland a s would probably lose la russa , but that s ok , as long as they lose him in conversation only and not as the head of this most unlikely pennant contender la russa never pats himself on the back and he turns all such talk back in the direction of the players who have played a part in building the fivegame lead the a s carried into yankee stadium last night but just as la russa has n't always gotten the winning votes in those manageroftheyear contests , he gets no vote here for his notion that his players have done it all and he s merely along for the ride and if la russa s players have a thing to say about it , la russa will run away not only with the straw vote taken on any given day in their clubhouse but also with the polls that give managers official awards at the end of the season why \? la russa , penalized in the past for merely managing great teams to even greater feats , has often lost out to managers who oversaw tremendous turnarounds but this year is different even though la russa is n't scripting one of those hollywood worst to first scenarios , he has had his adversity he has had to crosscheck the disabled list with his roster on a daily basis to see who s healthy enough to play right now , gossage and bob welch , both disabled , are not jose canseco is ailing , as is terry steinbach for us , that s healthy , said la russa , whose team has used the disabled list a clubrecord 20 times this season throw into that general hospital mix such strong personalities as rickey henderson and canseco , such thorny issues as the pending free agency of dave stewart , and the age factor of regulars such as the 37yearold willie wilson and the 35yearold carney lansford , and it s easy to see why la russa has had to be adapt it s also easy for his players to see that he has done what has been needed , resulting in oakland s very real threat to shock the defending world series champion minnesota twins this season by winning the western division for the fourth time in the last five years under la russa no doubt he s been challenged this year , to say the least , shortstop walt weiss said it seems that since 1988 , for one reason or another , we 've been hit with so many injuries and it seems we 've done the job playing through those injuries i think that s a reflection of the manager guys step into this atmosphere and do the job because they know they 're expected to , know that we 're expected to win that s the tone that tony sets sometimes , when a player looks at what the injuries have wrought , it s easy , said stewart , to wonder if it s possible to persevere but then stewart looks at la russa and sees only one thing confidence but that s not surprising , the pitcher added he s always told me one thing and i try to take it out to the mound with me 'if a captain looks shaky , how s the rest of the ship going to be \? ' now la russa will argue that his is the easy job because it involves nothing physical or taxing i 've done the same thing i always have , he said this has had a lot to do with the players showing up big they 've risen to the occasion but the players who 've known him the longest will have none if it what he does goes far beyond the ball park , stewart said to him , it s a 20houraday job , he prepares that intensely he 'll play the hunches , play the gut feeling he s got the knack of putting the right player in at the right spot at the right time when a game sometimes cries out for a dennis eckersley finish , la russa will instead let a ron darling finish , as he did recently against the white sox , building confidence in a starter no longer given to pitching complete games , resting a bullpen no longer used to having too many days off that , says stewart , is the sign of a manager who refuses to make the obvious move for the obvious reason to avoid being secondguessed and while it s one talent to handle the injuries , it s another to deal with the personalities he s the best when it comes to handling personalities and this team is close , if not right there , with the old yankees teams when it comes to personalities , said gossage , who watched managers in new york grow gray , if not older , handling firebrands the likes of reggie jackson , graig nettles and himself tony knows when to pat a guy on the back , he knows when to kick a guy in the rear the latter was witnessed on aug 9 , when la russa and henderson engaged in a verbal spar during batting practice before a game televised nationwide henderson , playing well before , has been playing inspired since , says stewart , just like someone s given him a million bucks maybe henderson just remembered that there are probably a million reasons to stick with the a s and la russa , and that every one of them has to do with winning and being a winner
kansas city , mo , sept 19 fresh troops arrived from class aaa columbus today to try to help the yankees wade their way through the final 14 games of the season maybe the new arms and legs can provide them with a spark that has been severely lacking lately more than likely , only one will get the chance four players from the clippers joined the yankees after completing one of the most successful seasons in columbus history by erupting for three runs in the bottom of the ninth friday to edge scranton wilkesbarre , 43 , and snatch the international league championship columbus won the best of five series , 32 , over the phillies' top affiliate and finished 10151 first baseman j t snow , third baseman hensley meulens , shortstop dave silvestri and pitcher jeff johnson were still giddy when they donned pinstripes for tonight s game against the royals , but none played , so those happy feelings might disappear the yankees lost their sixth straight as kansas city topped them , 74 , behind former yankee dennis rasmussen buck showalter is quite confused by the losing streak it s a puzzle to me , said showalter i do n't think anybody has an answer for it catcher not recalled whether the new players will actually be able to make contributions in the closing games remains doubtful the yankees only recalled four players because they already have twothirds of the columbus outfield in bernie williams and gerald williams and threefifths of the starting rotation in sam militello , bob wickman and russ springer brad ausmus , a strongarmed catcher who was often touted by showalter during the last two months , surprisingly was not recalled what will make it difficult for the newest players to acclimate is the paucity of playing time they are likely to receive only snow , who hit 313 to win the league s batting title , seems sure to receive times at bat he could wind up as a parttime first baseman , outfielder and designated hitter next season and will debut sunday i would think j t would be part of our club next year if things work out , said showalter meulens paced the league with 26 homers and 100 runs batted in , but the yanks do not seem to have room for him anywhere though the yankees will not admit it , they would not mind if meulens is one of the players they lose in the expansion draft because meulens had a solid minor league season after a rocky rookie season in the majors , they could be hesitant to play him and expose his limited range and penchant for striking out even the perceptive meulens knows his situation i would like to get a chance to move on and start a career , said meulens it s been kind of tough for me to do it here the same is true for johnson the lefthander might yet prove he is a major leaguer , but it is not likely to be with the yankees johnson was 21 with a 217 era at columbus after three stints in the majors , but he is not expected to start in the last 14 games silvestri is a shortstop with power as evidenced by his 13 homers and 73 runs batted in , but his defense is spotty , and the yankees do not appear confident in him with 14 rookies and secondyear players bouncing around the clubhouse , it is conceivable that the yanks could kiss off victories and losses while worrying about player growth but showalter does not embrace that theory that s no excuse for inconsistency , showalter said you look at the development side of it , but the bottom line is still winning inside pitch dennis rasmussen allowed four runs in seven and twothird innings to defeat his former team for the second time in six days and gain his second american league victory since 1987 , when he was 97 for the yanks george brett doubled and tripled in four atbats to increase his hit total to 2 , 987 he is tied with hall of famer sam rice for 18th on the career list melido perez struck out seven in seven innings to give him 201 for the season and make him the first yankee since ron guidry in 1979 to whiff more than 200 manager buck showalter will travel to tampa after sunday s game for an organizational meeting to discuss which 15 players the club might protect in the expansion draft and to discuss the fate of the coaching staff

washington , aug 4 after more than five years of work , the irancontra independent prosecutor has told ronald reagan in a letter that he is not under investigation for his role in the scandal that stained the final years of his presidency the letter strongly suggests that the prosecutors have concluded that the evidence does not warrant criminal charges against mr reagan it was sent to the former president s lawyers last thursday by lawrence e walsh , the irancontra prosecutor in it , mr walsh said in part , this office regards president reagan as simply a witness and not as a subject or target problems with prosecuting for prosecutors , who began their work in late 1986 , mr walsh s letter amounted to a final acknowledgement that the exhaustive inquiry had unearthed no clearcut evidence directly tying mr reagan to any wrongdoing some lawyers who have followed the investigation said that even if mr walsh had amassed evidence against mr reagan , he would have been extremely reluctant to charge a former president with a criminal offense unless he had compiled an airtight case , something that failed to materialize in other public inquiries into the affair moreover , even if prosecutors had obtained some evidence against mr reagan , they would have been dissuaded from charging him on other grounds , mostly because of the daunting legal complexities involved in prosecuting a former president for his conduct in carrying out his duties as a chief executive lawyer sought letter in addition , if mr walsh is troubled by mr reagan s actions , he has another vehicle , a final report to congress , that he can use to level his criticism that would avoid the trauma likely to be caused by the prosecution of a popular former president for acts that occurred six years ago and that have largely faded from public consciousness theodore b olson , who is a lawyer for mr reagan and who sought the letter from mr walsh , said the letter meant that the former president was out from under legal jeopardy it has been my understanding that president reagan is not being considered by the independent counsel s investigation as someone who is a candidate for indictment or as a potential defendant in any way , mr olson said in a telephone interview today prosecutors usually regard a witness as someone who may have information relevant to an investigation but is not likely to be charged with wrongdoing a subject is a person whose activities are under scrutiny a target is someone who may expect to be accused of a crime imminently reexamination of aides although the former president is not himself under scrutiny , there is no sign that mr walsh has abandoned his final investigative push into whether mr reagan s closest associates conspired to conceal his involvement in 1985 shipments of missiles to iran because they feared that the arms transfers might have been illegal in particular , the prosecutors , who have said they would complete their inquiry by summer s end , have reexamined the actions of mr reagan s principal advisers , among them edwin meese 3d , the former attorney general donald t regan , the former chief of staff , and george p shultz , the former secretary of state none of the three have been accused of any wrongdoing , and each has long denied engaging in an effort to cover up any aspect of the affair last week , mr regan said the prosecutors had told him that he was not under scrutiny but in recent days prosecutors have interviewed other senior officials like frank c carlucci , a former national security adviser and other reagan administration officials like charles cooper , an aide to mr meese , have testified to a federal grand jury mr cooper said in an interview today that he was scheduled to testify again on wednesday the focus of the inquiry emerged more clearly with the indictment of caspar w weinberger , the former defense secretary , who was accused on june 16 of perjury and improperly concealing private notes taken during his years at the pentagon the indictment against him said that his private notes revealed false statements to congress when he testified at the irancontra congressional hearings in 1987 the indictment did not charge mr weinberger with participating in a coverup but it did provide a descriptive account , in part relying on mr weinberger s notes , of the actions of high level officials at a series of white house meetings in november 1986 as the administration scrambled desperately to piece together a response to demands from congress and news organizations for an account of the affair the indictment implied that prosecutors strongly suspected that mr weinberger s efforts to conceal his knowledge of the affair were part of a pattern of actions by top reagan aides trying to cover up the president s role in the arms sales to iran mr reagan presided over each of the meetings , but his precise role remains blurred , in part because of the president says his own recollection of specific events is fragmentary and because the accounts of his aides are contradictory for example , on the issue of whether he authorized the arms shipments in 1985 , mr reagan first told a presidential review board in early 1987 that he did approve them but later he said he did not approve the shipments and finally said he simply could not remember his memory proved equally faulty in his only public testimony , a videotaped deposition in early 1990 , when he recalled few details of the events of the affair , but insisted he had repeatedly told his aides to obey the law the public inquiries created the impression of mr reagan presiding over his administration as a genial and paternal presence , who occasionally grappled with the intricacies of his policies , but who far more frequently gave subordinates wide latitude to carry out his directives in testimony in the irancontra congressional hearings , john m poindexter , the former national security adviser , said he kept from mr reagan his decision to divert millions of dollars in proceeds from the arms sales to the contra rebels in nicaragua that testimony underscored the widespread view that the affair was carried out by midlevel officials who bypassed officials and agencies responsible for foreign and national security affairs still , it was the president who set the policies that ultimately led to the affair mr reagan enthusiastically embraced the nicaragua rebels as a counterweight to the leftist sandinista government and it was to fulfill the president s desires to assist the contras that led oliver l north to circumvent congressional restrictions and supply them with arms on the iran side , the president almost daily prodded his aides about whether they had taken any action to help secure the release of american hostages held in lebanon that seemed to lead his subordinates to the arms shipments to iran , which mr reagan himself said in a rueful speech in march 1987 had deteriorated into trading arms for hostages photos former president ronald reagan was told by the irancontra prosecutors that he is not under investigation for criminal charges for his role in the scandal and would merely be a witness donald t regan , right , former white house chief of staff , said last week that the prosecutors had told him he was not under scrutiny \( associated press , the new york times \) \( pg a16 \)
limousine operators in westchester are up in arms over an attempt by the new york city taxi and limousine commission to levy a series of fees on suburbanbased taxis that pick up passengers in the city if they get away with it , i can say goodbye to a business that took me 15 years to build , said walter bell , owners of walter s personal car service in white plains it makes me very angry , especially because there s no real reason behind it it s only a scheme to raise money for new york city richard j guberti , president of the 187member limousine industry council of westchester , said that if new fees went into effect his group s members would be forced to raise their prices by more than 40 percent and that at least half of the smaller companies would be forced out of business the exorbitant amount the new york city taxi and limousine commission is proposing to license all suburban and taxi limousines is not justified , said mr guberti , who owns excell limousine service in mount vernon it s only another attempt to raise money for the city 'we do n't cruise for business' none of us do business in new york city , he said we do n't have 212 telephone numbers we do n't advertise for business there we do n't do 'pointtopoint' business there we do n't cruise for business like their gypsy cabs do all we do is pick up customers in westchester and drive them to and from airports , theaters , proms and restaurants in the city under the commission s most recent proposal , outoftown taxis that pick up passengers in the city would be charged the same 250 licensing fees as citybased cabs in addition , the proposal calls for a 50 fee for a license for each driver and a 100 fee for the radiodispatch base of each outoftown company originally , the new york city taxi and limousine commission had announced that on march 2 , 1992 , any suburban limousine not in compliance found in new york city would be seized and towed the deadline has been extended to june 1 mr guberti said that if westchester operators were forced to raise their rates by 40 percent to cover higher operating costs resulting from new york city licensing requirements , the average charge for a sedan holding up to three passengers going from white plains to la guardia airport would rise to 91 from 65 , not including tolls , parking fees or tip the average charge for a stretch limousine carrying up to six passengers from white plains to the manhattan theater district would rise from to 151 from 108 mr guberti also said that westchester operators were concerned that if they are licensed by the new york city taxi and limousine commission their insurance rates could be raised we 'll probably be treated by the insurance companies as vehicles operating within new york city and be charged much higher premiums , he said he estimated that insurance would likely increase by 1 , 500 a vehicle , and by imposing its requirements on suburban operators the city would open the operators to further business taxes county executive andrew p o'rourke is working with westchester s state legislative delegation to bar the city commission s attempt to impose fees on suburban limousine operators i 've already written to the county executives of nassau , putnam , rockland and suffolk counties , who are behind our efforts to bar the new york taxi and limousine commission from levying licensing fees on suburban operators , mr o'rourke said at the same time , our county attorney is researching the law to determine what retaliatory measures we can take , such as establishing our own taxi and limousine commission , the power to levy similar fees on taxis and limousines that do business in westchester but frankly , mr o'rourke added , i feel that s a tactic of last resort we do n't want to engage in a border war in which everyone loses a second try in albany a bill proposed by state senator norman levy to regulate fees equitably for all limousine companies , which was passed by the senate but defeated in the assembly , has been reintroduced to give the state legislature time to work on a solution , mr o'rourke has tried to get the taxi and limousine commission deadline extended to the end of the year although we were n't able to get the city of new york to agree to declare a sixmonth moratorium on the enforcement of the licensing provision on suburban taxis and limousines , i have been in constant contact with mayor dinkins , whom i have always found to be reasonable and fair , mr o'rourke said the mayor has agreed to continue our negotiations on a daytoday basis in hopes of resolving the matter amicably the county executive said that any additional fees would be disastrous for all the entrepreneurs who through hard work and on their own have established businesses livelihood in jeopardy mr bell is one of those entrepreneurs he capitalized his fleet of five latemodel lincoln town cars and one stretch limousine himself i 've

on july 31 , 1990 , on the morning after george steinbrenner was exiled from baseball , commissioner fay vincent had a phone call from an old friend bob strauss , known formally as robert s strauss , once the national chairman of the democratic party and now the united states ambassador to russia , was on the horn just remember , strauss told the commissioner , that george steinbrenner is like sinus he may not be bothering you today , but he 'll always be there and as 1992 arrived , sinus himself , alias george steinbrenner , was there permeating the commissioner s office , if not the passages of the commissioner s cranium he was scheming to return to yankee stadium as the managing general partner of the famous franchise that under his bumbling leadership had collapsed even before his exile when and if the scheme succeeds , sinus himself will bluster and brag that all s well with the yankees when in reality the yankees will only be worse off with the club now professing patience with young players , consider that steinbrenner is baseball s most impatient owner and if his return is supposed to lure expensive free agents , consider that his reputation for turmoil repulsed more players in recent years than it attracted but keep in mind that steinbrenner s scheme wo n't succeed until he surrenders to the commissioner s edict drop the two remaining lawsuits stemming from the principal owner s exile and pay 1 million in legal fees billed to the commissioner s office leonard kleinman , the yankee president , has sued baseball for 30 million steinbrenner has sued the company that transcribed his july 1990 hearing it s as simple as that when all the litigation disappears , as it might any day now , and when steinbrenner agrees to pay the 1 million in legal fees , vincent will listen until then , the commissioner is standing firm , a posture that steinbrenner is not accustomed to dealing with throughout his tyrannical yankee reign , steinbrenner bullied managers , sluggers , pitchers , secretaries and security guards just about everybody but yogi berra , the yankee folk hero who has kept his vow not to return to yankee stadium so long as steinbrenner is involved with the franchise but during the 1990 hearing , steinbrenner could n't bully fay vincent , and the commissioner is n't about to be bullied now typical of steinbrenner s bullying tactics , he reportedly is threatening to sue vincent for 100 million if he s not allowed to return but that does n't scare the commissioner , who knows that steinbrenner s threat contradicts the principal owner s signature on the july 30 , 1990 , agreement and resolution that exiled him in that ruling , steinbrenner recognizes , agrees and submits to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the commissioner mr steinbrenner , the agreement reads in part , further accepts the sanctions imposed on him by the commissioner and agrees not to challenge the sanctions in court or otherwise he also agrees he will not institute legal proceedings of any nature against the commissioner or any of his representatives , either major league or any majorleague club relating to this matter at the bottom of the sevenpage agreement is the signature of george m steinbrenner 3d , witnessed by the signature of stephen e kaufman , one of his many attorneys steinbrenner had agreed to cease and desist from daytoday operations of the yankees after having paid 40 , 000 to a bronx gambler , howard spira , for information discrediting dave winfield , then a yankee outfielder vincent originally proposed a twoyear suspension , but the principal owner , in his strange sense of semantics , preferred to be treated as if he were on the permanently ineligible list steinbrenner s behavior was ruled not in the best interests of baseball , a phrase that the principal owner does n't seem to understand he heard no internal warnings , the commissioner wrote in his decision , alluding to steinbrenner s conscience , because none went off judging by steinbrenner s reported threat to sue the commissioner for 100 million despite their signed agreement , the principal owner has not suddenly developed an internal warning system with that in mind , even if steinbrenner returns after surrendering to vincent s edict on lawsuits and legal fees , the commissioner is expected to keep the principal owner on probation the commissioner knows that sinus himself will always be there photo george steinbrenner \( james kamp \)
washington , july 27 four years ago george bush went to a republican convention in a hot , steamy city on the gulf coast and turned his political fortunes around with a wellwritten speech that included a memorable phrase something about reading his lips next month many of his aides are suggesting , as they read poll after poll showing him trailing bill clinton by 2to1 margins , that he will repeat his electoral escape act but the republicans are meeting in houston this year , not new orleans , and the political context is different the economy is far weaker , the democrats are far more united , mr bush s approval ratings are far lower than ronald reagan s were in 1988 he s in big trouble and we 're all very disturbed , but a great speech at the convention just wo n't do the trick for him , said senator john mccain of arizona , a conservative republican who faces a tough reelection fight of his own this fall he had a blank slate in 1988 , but now that blackboard has writing all over it , and you do n't erase that in the minds of the american people with one big speech or one convention he has to defend his record , emphasize his accomplishments and lay out a fresh program of positive action mr bush has done some of that , albeit episodically and often in a halfhearted fashion almost plaintively , he has said that americans should give him at least some of the credit for the end of the cold war , and he has spoken with pride of pushing through legislation to help the disabled , to improve education and to help protect the environment but there has been no boldness about the man , none of the spirit of harry truman in 1948 , daring the opposition to take their best shot , and none of the spirit of ronald reagan in 1984 , calling on the electorate to continue with him on the road to a nation reborn mr bush has seemed more like gerald r ford in 1976 , weighed down by the nixon pardon , or like jimmy carter in 1980 , burdened by the hostages in teheran for president bush , the albatross is the economy its poor performance , combined with the president s espousal of higher taxes despite his promise not to , combined with people s conclusion that the country is on the wrong track , has rendered him highly vulnerable and like mr ford and mr carter , mr bush has found it hard to get past the subject on which he is weakest a man of remarkable physical vigor , he has seemed intellectually and politically listless , somehow passive in the face of great danger sometimes he seems unwilling to take responsibility for his own acts and those of his administration if you want an outsider , choose me , he has improbably told the nation invoking the buzzword of the year , he casts himself as a spokesman for change , as if michael s dukakis had been president the last four years unable to do very much to change the course of the economy in the three months left before the election , mr bush has concentrated on influencing how people see its present state he acknowledged a week ago that a tremendous percentage , 60 percent , think the economy is getting worse , but insisted they were wrong because the overall national economy is growing he even tried to sugarcoat the figures showing that unemployment was up again by saying that that always happens in the early stages of a recovery the president has had little success as a spin doctor according to several polls , only a quarter to a third of the electorate believes the economy will get better in the year ahead inconveniently for mr bush , the pessimism is strongest on the west coast and in the northeast , two regions with weak economies and large numbers of electoral votes some republicans think the answer lies in changing the no 2 man on the ticket to send an unmistakable message that thigs are going to change , but vice president dan quayle insists that has been ruled out some think that secretary of state james a baker 3d will make things hum as soon as he makes his expected switch from diplomacy to politics next month some , finally , think that the answer lies in unrelenting attacks on mr clinton and his running mate , senator al gore but mr bush s two most successful attack coordinators , roger ailes and the late lee atwater , are absent from this year s campaign , and negative politics may not work so well in a year when voters seem to be more interested in substantive answers than in mudwrestling we cannot , in my view , go to the american people and simply attack democrats as big 'l' liberals and big spenders and big taxers without making our case that we would do things differently , housing secretary jack f kemp warned over the weekend no one expects mr clinton s lead to hold up until nov 3 but even the republicans , who only a few months ago were talking about their lock on the electoral college , now consider mr bush the underdog and it seems possible , if by no means yet probable , that 1992 may prove to be one of those pivotal years in american politics , like 1912 , when woodrow wilson won a threeway race , and 1932 , when franklin d roosevelt won the first of four terms , and 1952 , when dwight d eisenhower won the first of two each time , a long partisan reign came to an end in a landslide
the war over how to cover american baby bottoms has ended in a rout exhausted by their failure to convince parents that the nation s landfills have turned into reeking mountains of disposable diapers , many of the most zealous environmentalists have simply stopped trying the signs of surrender are everywhere three years ago 22 states considered taxing or banning disposables none have succeeded in 1990 , new york nearly passed a law requiring hospitals to distribute pamphlets about cotton diapers to all new parents this year a similar effort died in a day even the environmental protection agency seems to have run up the \( reusable \) white flag in its major new guide to reducing waste , the word diaper never even appears environmentalists' quandary you know freud was right about us , said allen hershkowitz , a solid waste expert at the natural resources defense council , and a man who has long been plagued by his own ambivalence over the diaper debate civilization has its costs clearly one of those costs is disposable diapers there has never been a more potent symbol of the national conflict between convenience and conservation more than 17 billion disposable diapers were sold in the united states last year , and every child who uses them goes through about 4 , 500 during infancy cotton diapers , by comparison , which have swaddled babies at least since alexander ruled macedonia , can be used hundreds of times then recycled for years environmentalists fumed about the waste caused by disposables arguing that each diaper tossed onto the rubbish heap furnished fresh evidence that americans would rather plunder nature than spend the effort necessary to preserve it let s deal with the bigticket items before we ask millions of mothers to torture themselves , said william rathje , an archeologist and director of the garbage project at the university of arizona there are so many ways we are wasteful in this country that are not at the absolute core of modern american behavior let s start there after all , convenience is something we should consider at first , the debate seemed one of stark contrasts disposable diapers waste trees , often include plastics that ca n't be broken down , and account for a numbing amount of unnecessary garbage each year cloth diapers , on the other hand , which now account for less than 15 percent of the american market , seemed environmentally benign but closer scrutiny suggests the facts are less onesided many of the trees used for disposables are planted just for that purpose excavations of representative landfills including fresh kills on staten island , the world s largest dump have revealed that discarded diapers take up from 05 to 18 percent of landfill space compared with old newspapers \( which can account for as much as 40 percent of space at landfills \) , construction debris or food waste , diapers are about as big a problem as used sheets and towels reusable diapers have their problems , too they can require large amounts of water and detergent to clean diaperservice delivery trucks burn gaswasting energy and cause pollution in some western states , like california and washington , where droughts have presented major problems in recent years and landfill space is relatively easy to find , disposable diapers not only seem to many people more convenient but better for the environment as well this is not a simple issue , said a senior epa official who insisted on anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the debate there are environmental consequences , health considerations , and issues of life style that all matter and the right answer is not always the same for everyone but it certainly is not something one should resolve based on ideology alone freedom at a cost it takes only a few brief conversations with harried parents to appreciate the overwhelming freedom that disposable diapers can offer even the most aggressively green parents seem to have ways to rationalize their use of such an obvious symbol of the throwaway society stricken by fear , guilt and conscience , some have even been caught hiding their pampers when friends come to visit i hate to admit what a chicken i was , writes a confessional patricia poore , editor of the quintessentially environmentally correct publication , garbage magazine ms poore came out of the closet as a user of disposables in the current issue i let myself be bullied by image , she wrote , explaining her initial view that cloth diapers were the only permissible route for someone in her position how else to explain that the disposables bought for travel days were locked in the glove compartment or hidden in my luggage \? yet , eventually , convenience had its way with her , as it has with millions of other parents disposable diapers are easy to find , easy to use and easy to get rid of they almost always cost more about 25 cents each compared with as little as 7 cents each for cloth diapers washed at home but the washing takes time that many people are not willing to spend the diapers of tomorrow
parsippanytroy hills , nj gustav stickley s sprawling log house here , which he called home from 1910 to 1916 , is once again filled with the weighty oak furniture and copper lamps in the arts and crafts style that he pioneered the partially restored residence , 20 miles west of newark , has been temporarily transformed for the run of gustav stickley his craft , the first comprehensive exhibition of the modernist innovator s works , through jan 17 dominated by examples of his most famous furniture designs the outsize sideboards , dropfront desks , ledgearmed sofas and reclining morris chairs the show also includes lesser known works a threefoottall copper dinner gong , a hefty newspaper rack and a small wovenwillow chair the stickley story comes alive in this house , which the designer originally conceived in 1908 as the clubhouse for a cooperative community , farm and crafts school on his 650acre property when that overly ambitious plan fell through , stickley redesigned the building as a home for his family it was completed in 1909 the interiors throughout incorporate important architectural elements of his design signature chestnut timbers , maple floors , builtin bookcases and stone fireplaces with copper hoods , each bearing such aphorisms in pseudoold english as the lyf so short , the craft so long to lerne although the exposed log walls were whitewashed after the stickleys vacated , the rest of the woodwork remains untouched , including the wide staircase with its sweeping scutouts carved into each baluster designated a national historic landmark in 1990 , the house was saved from developers a year earlier when its tract , now reduced to 26 acres , was purchased for 15 million by the township of parsippanytroy hills since then , restoration on the usually empty residence has proceeded slowly under the direction of the craftsman farms foundation , which operates the house and organized this show we wanted the exhibition to present the best of stickley , with as broad a spectrum as possible of the designs he produced , said a patricia bartinique , the guest curator and a professor of english at essex county college in newark there s been no attempt to show the rooms as they were when the stickleys lived here we have none of their furniture from this house on view , but we hope we soon may eventually , in fact , we intend to furnish it the way stickley did ms bartinique , a collector of stickley furniture and other arts and crafts objects , wrote the catalogue \( 18 \) in it , she sketches the life of stickley , who was born the son of a stone mason in 1858 in osceola , wis although trained to cut stone by age 12 , he switched from masonry to making chairs before he turned 20 after managing or coowning several furniture factories that produced victorian chairs and tables in binghampton and syracuse , n y , stickley went to europe in 1898 and became an instant convert to the arts and crafts style of william morris spurred by morris s concepts of severely plain furniture with exposed joints , stickley successfully translated the medieval mode and spanish renaissance styling into a robust american idiom , popularly known as the mission style more often than not , these nononsense , squarish designs in richly figured oak were upholstered in leather and embellished with bold hardware some of stickley s most admired chairs and cabinets boast inlaid images of trees and flowers , the work of harvey ellis , an architect who spent the last seven months of his life in 1904 in stickley s employ the ellis designs in the show are among the best proportioned and finished items on view between 1900 and 1918 , these and the more typical , chunkier works that stickley favored proved as much at home on a farm or ranch as in a suburban den when stickley went bankrupt in 1915 , he sold his house , fully furnished , to george farny , an engineer , and returned to syracuse , where he died in 1942 farny s descendants owned the property until 1989 although most of the stickley furniture from this house is in the colorado home of farny s heirs , 29 items were auctioned three years ago at christie s among them were a tall clock , which brought 50 , 600 , and a china cabinet , which was sold for 35 , 200 prices well above christie s expectations several pieces in christie s auction two kitchen cabinets and two brass and wroughtiron fireplace radiators were bought by the craftsman farms foundation and about a halfdozen other items , including an 80inch sofa , have since been acquired luckily for us , said david w lowden board chairman of the foundation , the rooms at the house were photographed and the stickley furniture was catalogued so , in time , we will be able to restore or replicate the look of these rooms most of the furniture in this show is signed by gustav stickley or carries his label none of the pieces were made by his brothers , charles , albert , leopold and john george , who became his competitors , producing less costly mission designs lent by 35 collectors and dealers from new york to california , the 150 items also include family photographs , drawings , catalogues and copies of the craftsman , the magazine stickley published monthly between 1901 and 1916 a few collectors have placed items , like the livingroom bookcases and a bed , on longterm loan there s a great deal of work to be done to bring the house back to its original condition , ms bartinique said next spring , we start on the roof coincidentally , the dining room furniture from stickley s 1902 house in syracuse is on view in another exhibition , the craftsman table , at hirschl adler galleries , 21 east 70th street in manhattan , through dec 23 the table , eight feet long and more than four feet wide , is shown with eight leathercovered oak chairs the 1908 clock displayed with the table was a gift to gustav from leopold and john george stickley the modernist outlook seen here , said stuart feld , owner of hirschl adler , was at the time as avantgarde and exciting as the development of cubism in france photos a reclining morris chair of oak is

ever since little shop of horrors proved to be a surprise success as a monster musical , people have been searching for a potential successor one might suppose that research has been done in the creature feature section in video stores eating raoul , which opened wednesday night at the union square theater , is the latest losing candidate in spite of the seeming outrageousness of the material , this adaptation of paul bartel s 1982 cult movie is over its head in a vat of whimsy the show tries so hard to be with it that it ends up being without it , that is , without anything except a shadow of what made the film funny in the first place the story , as you may remember , is a comedy of murder and cannibalism mary and paul bland , the squarest of married couples , become selfadvertising sexperts to kill swingers for profit dispatching their victims by striking them on the head with a frying pan , they eventually find themselves trapped by their partner , raoul , and are forced to take drastic action where the movie was matter of fact as well as macabre , the musical takes a frying pan approach , hitting everything over the head as adapted by mr bartel and as directed by toni kotite , the show is more garish than grotesque the blandness of the central couple is matched by jed feuer s score , while boyd graham s lyrics are furrowed with banalities , as in we 'll give it a try it s you and i do or die although eating raoul aims to spoof swingers , it deals with the subject in such an obvious way that sadomasochists might sue for defamation of character the real core of the show is not sexuality but murder , as the blands bop strangers with that longarmed cooking instrument the final song , one more bop , comes none too soon as mary , courtenay collins is peppy without the repressed sensuality that mary woronov projected in the role on screen in mr bartel s own role , eddie korbich is mired in the husband s wimpishness he lacks the musical opportunity he had as the baker s apprentice in the broadway revival of sweeney todd , a show that makes mincemeat out of eating raoul adrian zmed plays raoul with an indeterminate polynational accent at least he brings a certain flamboyance to his role , as does cindy benson as a publicaccess dominatrix who doubles as a caring mother m w reid plays a number of roles , including one flashy turn as a female impersonator , portraying ginger rogers waiting for a nonexistent fred astaire to enter her life eating raoul , the musical , succeeds only in cannibalizing its source directed at the return to the forbidden planet crowd , it offers the audience nothing special and no substitutions eating raoul book by paul bartel , based on the film eating raoul directed by toni kotite music by jed feuer lyrics by boyd graham choreography by lynne taylorcorbett set design by loren sherman costumes by franne lee lighting by peggy eisenhauer sound by peter j fitzgerald production stage manager , alan hall musical director , albert ahronheim orchestrations , joseph gianono vocal arrangements , mr feuer and mr ahronheim presented by max weitzenhoffer , stewart f lane , joan cullman and richard norton at the union square theater , 100 east 17th street , manhattan mary bland courtenay collins paul bland eddie korbich raoul adrian zmed with cindy benson , jonathan brody , lovette george , allen hidalgo , david masenheimer , m w reid and susan wood photo adrian zmed with lovette george , left , and susan wood in a scene from the musical eating raoul , which opened on wednesday night \( anita and steve shevett for the new york times \)
the number of children placed for adoption has sharply declined in the last 20 years , mainly because more and more unmarried white women are keeping their babies , according to a study made public yesterday by a familyplanning research organization the group also found that women were twice as likely to give up girls as boys the organization , the alan guttmacher institute , reported that 3 percent of unmarried white women gave up their babies for adoption from 1982 to 1988 , the latest period for which statistics are available in contrast , 19 percent of the babies born to unmarried white women were given up for adoption before 1973 , the year the united states supreme court ruled that states could not ban all abortions from 1973 to 1981 , 8 percent of unmarried white women gave up their babies , the institute said little change among blacks among unmarried black women there has been little change , with fewer than 2 percent of their children being given up for adoption both now and in the earlier periods none of the hispanic women in the sample reported placing a child for adoption we were very interested to see that relinquishment rates had continued to decline during the 1980 s , which cannot be explained by increasing access to abortion , as it could in the 1970 s , said christine a bachrach , an author of the study who is a statistician at the center for population research of the national institution of child health and human development so you have to speculate that it reflects an increased acceptance among whites of single parenting the new study does draw some conclusions about what kinds of women are likely to choose adoption the women who make the decision to relinquish a baby are those with the most to lose by prematurely becoming a parent , ms bachrach said they tend to be in school , and not to have much experience in the labor force they also tend to have mothers with some college education , which we think means they have higher aspirations we also found that girls were twice as likely to be relinquished as boys ms bachrach said she did not know of any previous studies finding that the likelihood of being put up for adoption depended on the baby s sex but she added that because the sample size was small , the finding could not be accepted as absolute unless it was replicated in other studies the study , published in the januaryfebruary issue of the alan guttmacher institute s magazine , perspectives , is based on data from the 1982 and 1988 cycles of the national survey of family growth , each covering about 8 , 000 women but despite the large sample size , each survey included only 62 reports of children placed for adoption the survey data , therefore , cannot be used to estimate the number of babies given up for adoption year by year , but they do show longterm trends a more popular choice relinquishing a baby for adoption really ceased to be a mainstream choice after abortion became legal , said debra kalmuss , a professor at the columbia university school of public health before the 1973 roe v wade decision , young white women , in essence , were hidden away during their pregnancy then they relinquished their babies and went back to their lives as though nothing had happened ms kalmuss said that if in the next few years the roe v wade decision is overturned and access to abortion becomes more difficult , giving up a child for adoption may become a more popular choice for women no one knows exactly how many babies are placed for adoption each year according to ms kalmuss and the authors of the study , such figures are generally underreported , since many women questioned about their fertility and childbearing do not report babies they have given up for adoption besides ms bachrach , the authors of the study were kathy shepherd stolley , a professor of sociology at old dominion university in norfolk , va , and kathryn a london , a statistician at the national center for health statistics
newark , may 8 it has been 25 years since newark experienced what los angeles just went through but unlike other riottorn cities of that era , newark found that its economic shoulders were not broad enough to sustain a recovery , and those five days in july 1967 became the city s defining moment and its unwanted legacy in the last 10 days , though , something seemed to change newark stood up to the specter that haunts it , stared back and did n't blink the threat of violence , which exerted a tidal pull that washed across the city s business district for several days , subsided the city was not remade , but neither was it undone newark was not simply lucky this time maintaining calm took effort , selfcontrol and a willingness to accept the view that ballots are ultimately better than bullets , that hope and pragmatism hold out greater potential benefits than arson and looting for the city s poorest , there was also little left to lose and a genuine need to keep what remains the hope was supplied in large doses by sharpe james , the mayor for six years and a man whose ebullience and ardent civic boosterism are local legend in this city of 275 , 000 his popularity generates a critical mass of support to help pragmatists like james wallace , a city firefighter , and his wife , caroline , who direct the international youth organization , a jobs and education program for young people 'we 're still paying for it' twenty five years ago i was standing on the corner of springfield avenue and broome street , mr wallace said i saw a lady standing in a window , calling her kids to come in she got shot in the head we do n't want to go through that again twenty five years we 're still paying for it 25 years later no jobs , no housing we stepped in blood in the 60 s we did n't want it to happen again we said to the kids , 'if you want to protest , do it with a pen and a vote' within 24 hours of the verdict april 29 that acquitted four white los angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist , rodney g king , mr wallace and others with close ties to newark s poor and tough neighborhoods had begun to gather together members of community groups and young people with influence among their peers to assess the extent of anger and how to work through it jim wallace and i started calling people to come up for an hour , said edna thomas , who runs a drugtreatment program called soul house and likes to say that she has been on loan to the city from god for 51 years they just needed somebody to call them , and they came and began to express their feelings , their concerns guest speaker at roll call the police director , william r celester , agreed to provide the community groups with an office at police headquarters , and on may 1 , he took the unusual step of allowing ms thomas to address the morning roll call i told them we needed a lot of sympathy in the street , and we 're there to help them , ms thomas said we 're not their adversaries i said , 'if you deal with us the way we want , the community will back you up' we felt the officers knew for the first time the community was behind them , she said they were n't alone she even got plainclothes officers to wear homemade buttons that said justice department investigate now can you understand what a mindbuster that was \? she said , laughing in newark , there is almost no place left to have a riot few of the stores that burned along springfield avenue in the '60 s were replaced , and vacant lots still dot the neighborhoods there and as caroline wallace pointed out , may 1 was welfarecheck day you 've got young mothers waiting since the 19th , and they need that check to make do for the next two weeks , she said they do n't have time to riot rumors , locks and sirens not that there were n't hours of uncertainty that friday , two days after the verdict , rumors of snipers , fires and violence swept through downtown newark none were true but one by one , in rapid succession , merchants locked their doors and pulled down security gates in a frightening few minutes , the city had shut down , county workers were sent home and the courts were adjourned police officers began to appear in clusters at major intersections and sirens echoed more frequently the commuters at prudential insurance , public service electric and gas , mutual benefit and first fidelity were in their cars by 2 30 , stuck in slowmoving chains of traffic on broad street , trying to escape to suburban safety by 6 pm the streets were empty , except for police officers and about 40 young people , most of them college students , who came striding south on broad street , past prudential , past the gates in front of woolworth s and on toward city hall they resembled an army platoon on its way to the rifle range , marching roughly in step and chanting the now familiar no justice , no peace and rodney king two mounted officers moved out from the police kiosk at broad and market streets and kept pace reaching the hall , the youths arranged themselves on the steps as if on bleachers at a ball game , and continued their chants two of their members stepped forward and reenacted the beating of rodney king in pantomime as the group counted aloud the number of blows one two three four fiftyfive fiftysix jittery but unscathed there was a real beating downtown that day , a jewelry store breakin later and more than two dozen arrests over the weekend in disruptions that had discernible ties to the unrest that had spread east across the country but the violence was isolated on monday and tuesday , a jittery business district survived two more demonstrations unscathed mayor james even joined one of them the evening news broadcast snippets of oratory , but there were no shootings or fires to film an uneasy week has passed newark is still without the jobs and businesses it needs to overcome the despair of its young people and the economic gulch it occupied even before the riots drove the middle class from the city but edna thomas says she thinks newark may finally have recovered something just as important its selfrespect credit has to go to the people , she said the people love this city , but they have never been called upon for the ultimate people have been called upon to vote for this candidate or that candidate this time the people were called upon to vote for themselves , and they did it they did it map of newark , indicating city hall
san diego , april 11 america s cup trial racing took on a life of its own this week as dennis conner struggled to hang on to an era he created in yachting nearly two decades ago and as the pressure mounted to win , so did his dread of loss stars stripes moved a step closer to the brink today after losing a fierce battle with bill koch s yacht america3 for a place in the defense finals the lead changed four times in today s match , which america3 finally won by 44 seconds conner has one more chance , in a sailoff monday against kanza america3 led at the start , but lost its edge to stars stripes as the conner boat sailed faster to leeward in an 8knot northwest breeze in the downwind leg , the lead changed twice more , but conner prevailed at the second mark , ahead by 17 seconds in the third leg , it was over for conner as buddy melges , america3 s skipper , drove past stars stripes on a port tack i do n't know what we could have done better , said conner in a voice relay to shore we just have to hope it lightens by monday at the third mark , america3 was 17 seconds ahead in a fresh 11knot breeze , and stayed ahead until the finish it was one more disappointment in an agonizing week for conner upset by controversial call upset over a controversial call by race umpires in his match against kanza on tuesday , conner was still smoldering about the episode two days later how would you feel if your daughter was hit by a car , and you had to go play baseball the next day \? asked conner during a day off at the stars stripes compound the controversial victory tuesday , decided on the umpires' decision to penalize stars stripes , went to kanza had conner won , he would have acquired another point in the standing , enough to have secured a less traumatic route into the finals , given his victory over kanza friday it was a crucial turning point in the series , making every race from tuesday on a case of do or die if it keeps us out of the cup , it will be a travesty , conner said the umpires will have our blood on their hands for the rest of their lives the incident stemmed from an attempt by stars stripes to sail inside of kanza at the seventh mark and round ahead kanza failed to give stars stripes the room it claimed as a boat with an established overlap , and the two yachts collided in the mayhem , stars stripes hit the mark , a violation of yachtracing rules the umpires , aboard two powerboats astern , ruled that conner had to take the prescribed penalty , a 270degree turn it cost him the race umpiring system draws fire the koch camp , which maintains that it was in the right during the tuesday confrontation , has few complaints about the umpiring system the method for resolving sailing disputes , new to the america s cup this time around , has drawn criticism from other boats , but none so vehement as from stars stripes coming from behind as he has throughout the trials here , against huge odds , has magnified conner s potential demise stars stripes was built before any of koch s boats , and is older than any of the yachts belonging to challenger semifinalists yet the yacht has remained competitive conner takes pride in knowing that he has stayed in the hunt against a far richer opponent sure does n't look like an 80 million difference , said conner , referring to the comparative performance of stars stripes with the boats representing koch s america3 syndicate which , conner insists , is spending close to 100 million the america3 camp says it has spent 55 million conner s budget is less than 20 million no full deck for conner it s a charade , said conner thursday about koch s twoboat edge i'm playing with 40 cards when they 've got a 52card deck in what he calls his probability tree , koch has switched his stable of four yachts , two at a time in each trial series , along the way with the trial races sailed among three defense yachts on a rotating basis , koch has had the opportunity to improve his boats' points standings by juggling their pairings for each defense series our goal is to be first , and our secondary goal is to be the second as well , said koch at the start of the semifinals march 27 the scoring also allows koch to throw a race but koch and his alternate helmsman , buddy melges , say they have resisted the temptation we 're still in a position where we 're trying to get our two boats in the goround , said melges recently i would n't go out and shoot a swan you throw one race and you 're a crook the rest of your life conner has known mostly success in his 18year tenure as an america s cup skipper on the 12meter courageous in 1974 freedom in 1980 stars stripes in 1987 and on the stars stripes catamaran in 1988 his year of defeat the loss of the america s cup in 1983 and with it , the 132year winning streak of the new york yacht club was a personal tragedy that surpassed a lifetime of victories i 've survived the worst , he said at the beginning of the trial races here as if already preparing himself for second worst photo stars and stripes , right , and kanza , during a race tuesday that ended in a controversial victory for kanza \( associated press \)
manjaca , bosnia and herzegovina omer filipovic , a muslim highschool teacher and political leader from the bosnian town of kljuc , died on july 28 , his death certificate says , in the solitaryconfinement stall of a prison camp run by the bosnian serb army at a cattle farm on this nearly treeless plateau his story , reconstructed from interviews with acquaintances and witnesses and buttressed by the death certificate , offers a rare look at the ordeal of one who died in a serbian camp 'natural causes , ' serbs say thousands of muslims have died as serbian forces have swept through bosnia and herzegovina , uprooting and destroying centuriesold muslim communities and herding into camps men suspected of resisting , or having the potential to resist , their takeover to the serbian authorities , the circumstances of mr filipovic s arrest and detention form a clear case of armed insurrection mr filipovic s acquaintances , in contrast , say he was an innocent civilian who initially sought to avoid an armed conflict by cooperating with local serbian officials and eventually found himself compelled to take up arms after being betrayed finally , they said , he fell victim to the brutality of the camps , from which the serbs continue to bar outside inspectors despite consistent accounts from witnesses and compelling circumstantial evidence of wholesale executions at the camps , including reports that about 130 prisoners died in a riot and shooting incident on july 23 and 24 in the town of prijedor , the bosnian serb authorities have confirmed the deaths of only five prisoners at manjaca and none at any of their other camps mr filipovic and the four others , they say , died of natural causes this is just one criminal who landed in a prison camp and ended up dead , said col milutin vukelic , a senior serbian military official here , who refused a request for mr filipovic s autopsy report after the request was rejected , serbian officials effectively expelled this reporter from serbiancontrolled territory in bosnia on aug 15 , saying safety at serbian checkpoints could not be assured serbian political leaders also did not respond to requests for the autopsy report a captain in the reserve tall , with curly darkbrown hair and a high forehead , mr filipovic , 39 years old , was married to a lawyer and had a daughter and a son , acquaintances said he was a captain in the old yugoslavia army reserve and head of the national guard unit in kljuc until he was dismissed when serbs usurped control of the town after the bosnian war began in march , they said mr filipovic s ancestors were ottoman feudal lords in kljuc he was also closely related to one of bosnia and herzegovina s most respected presentday political leaders , muhamed filipovic , cofounder of the bosnian muslim party the party broke with the republic s strongest muslim party , democratic action , about two months before the elections that brought to power nationalist leaders late in 1990 mr filipovic , a former communist party member , was clearly no muslim fundamentalist or extremist serbian leaders even considered his party a moderate alternative to the democratic action party and tried to coopt its leaders fighting flared in bosnia and herzegovina after the republic declared independence in march , becoming the third republic to leave the yugoslav federation by late may , serbian forces in the republic had forced hundreds of thousands of muslims from their homes in the drina and sava river basins and were laying siege to the cities of sarajevo and mostar largescale serbian attacks on the muslim population of northern bosnia had just begun , and the poorly armed and confused muslims retaliated by raising barricades and occasionally assaulting police stations and patrols just as serbs had done earlier in predominantly muslim areas a village is 'cleansed' mr filipovic , the leader of the bosnian muslim party in kljuc , first experienced the serbs' policy of ethnic cleansing late in may after the death of a serbian police officer near the muslim village of krasulje , a few miles from kljuc , muslims said former prisoners interviewed several weeks after being released from manjaca mostly juveniles and older prisoners gave further details on the events leading up to his imprisonment and inside the camp omer went to krasulje with the serbian police chief to investigate the killing and pick up the body , said a retiree and fellow prisoner who had known mr filipovic since childhood and asked to be identified as only a longtime acquaintance because he feared retaliation a 29yearold woman who witnessed his visit and later fled said omer came to krasulje and ordered the muslims to surrender their weapons he said the serbs would guarantee our peace and security if all the muslims handed in their weapons no one in krasulje put up a fight the serbs started cleansing operations a day after the muslims handed over their arms , she and other witnesses said about 150 serb soldiers came in three buses accompanied by an armored personnel carrier , the woman said the told us to put a white flag on the mosque they hauled the men away to kljuc in the buses there was no shooting at all from either side

by documenting that crack use is widespread among the homeless in new york city , a mayoral commission is betting that leveling with the public about just how bad the problem is will pay off in support for new programs to treat the addicted and to train unskilled young people who have turned to drugs the commission s report , which is to be released later this week , is a blistering indictment of the way the city has spent 2 billion over the last decade to shelter the homeless without confronting the deeper social problems that enmesh them but in releasing the results of the survey , based on random urine tests , the commission risks setting off a backlash against the homeless from a public that is increasingly weary of panhandlers and suspicious of promised solutions to a problem that never seems to go away in other fiscally strapped cities , including washington and philadelphia , the response to the intractability of the problem has been to slash spending on the homeless in recent years andrew cuomo , chairman of the commission , says he is confident that the new evidence about drug use , as well as a range of other problems the homeless face , will prove that society must do more , not less , to help them , and thus become the basis for a new consensus on the issue perhaps the commission s most important finding is the existence of a substantial subgroup within the shelter population , its report said this group essentially consists of poor young people who have grown up isolated from mainstream social and ecnomic life and who now find themselves without the basic social and economic skills necessary to survive independently the survey by the commission , appointed by mayor david n dinkins , found that twothirds of homeless single men and 30 percent of adults in families who live in city shelters tested positive for drugs or alcohol mr cuomo said he thought that the news would not surprise most new yorkers but instead would reassure them that government is finally facing facts advocates for the homeless eager to win public support for them have too long offered a sugarcoated version of reality , he contends 'a decade of denial' you have to be honest about a problem before you can do anything about it , said mr cuomo , who runs a nonprofit agency that serves homeless families there was a decade of denial in the 1980 s , an insistence on the simplistic 'housing , housing , housing' slogan but the problem was always deeper than that the commission , which sent its report to the mayor on saturday , argues that the vast majority of the homeless need much more than an apartment to make it on their own the city should use a new combination of carrots and sticks to help them , it says the shelter system was created in reaction to a series of lawsuits , with the city responding to requirements created by the courts the commission calls instead for the city to strike out on a new path of its own devising its report calls for the city to invest 280 million to move homeless men and women out of exorbitantly expensive , barracksstyle shelters into small , intensive socialservice programs that the commission says will actually cost less to operate that money will also help develop more permanent housing only when families and single adults have successfully completed the new treatment or training programs , depending on their individual needs , will the city provide them with that scarcest of urban commodities permanent , subsidized housing , the commission says so far , the plan appears to have generated a startling degree of agreement among the city s usually contentious political leaders highlights of the recommendations , disclosed by panel members , have won praise from city council speaker peter f vallone , council president andrew j stein and the borough presidents of queens , brooklyn , the bronx and staten island all those officials had been sharply critical of the mayor s plan for the city to build 24 small , serviceenriched shelters in residential neighborhoods mr vallone vowed to stop that plan , and had the power to do it these same officials , sensitive to constituents afraid that the city was about to plop drugusing homeless people next door to them , much prefer the panel s plan to let nonprofit groups pick sites and develop programs for the homeless , many of them not in residential neighborhoods at all a consent decree the origins of the city s current homeless system date to 1979 , when robert m hayes , a 26yearold lawyer who had never tried a case , sued the city in state court two years later , believing it would lose the case , the city signed a consent decree granting homeless men a right to shelter in the next few years , advocates won similar rights for women and families then , in the mid1980 s , crack , the cheap , smokable form of cocaine , went on sale all over the city and hooked thousands of poor people who were precariously positioned in society to begin with , helping tip many into homelessness many who would have found shelter in cheap , shabby singleroomoccupancy hotels had it been the 1960 s or even the 1970 s found themselves out of luck much of that housing had been torn down or gentrified they entered a shelter system with few rules and almost none that were enforced in the huge armories for single men , now notoriously druginfested , violent places , a crack addict could avoid paying for rent or food and spend what money he had on drugs the city had little to offer in the way of drug treatment , and the shelters became places where drugs were sold openly advocates for the homeless often emphasized a housing shortage as the root cause of homelessness mr hayes often repeated his comment that the problems of the homeless could be summed up in three words housing , housing , housing many advocates , including mr hayes , are now pushing much more openly for services to help the homeless he talks about not only the right of the homeless to shelter but also the need for a new contract between the city and the homeless , with the homeless agreeing to participate in rehabilitation programs in exchange for the promise of permanent housing that idea is very similar to what the mayor s panel has proposed
the two main democratic presidential candidates went on the donahue program yesterday for the most innovative media event of 1992 , a nationally televised debate without a moderator it was a revealing hour of television , although not quite as entertaining as their separate appearances on the programlast week , when former gov edmund g brown jr of california discussed his heterosexuality and gov bill clinton of arkansas finally explained why he had n't inhaled the candidates dealt with a wide range of questions on the programs , but unfortunately they did not address one that might have been in minds of viewers and media consultants who had been following the new york campaign why , when donahue was available , did the candidates bother doing anything else \? on the donahue programs and in the sound bites from them that later made the news they generally came across better than in any other campaign events they seemed sincere , affable , thoughtful , occasionally witty which is to say , essentially unrecognizable to viewers who had been watching clips of them confronting unintelligible accusations , hecklers and spectacles like that of the rev al sharpton advancing with a raised golf club so what was the point of all those rallies and neighborhood walks and press conferences and formal debates \? the traditional justification has been that these events provide crucial glimpses into the candidates' characters and thinking but it can be argued that voters got a much truer picture of the candidates from the donahue programs than from all the rest of the television coverage combined the programs left the specifics of most issues unresolved , but so did the rest of the television coverage the flatrate income tax proposed by mr brown made a case study of television s limitations it was an exceptionally specific proposal that was debated repeatedly , but the discussions were so inconclusive that both candidates ended up imploring viewers to look up newspaper articles to find the truth television is best at revealing candidates' personalities , how they reason , how they listen , how they deal with the unexpected turns in conversation political skills that are more meaningful today than being able to outshout hecklers at a rally and there may be no more useful television format than the talk show , because it gives viewers an uninterrupted look at candidates being examined by someone who knows the medium better than most journalists do the difference between a talkshow host like phil donahue looking for good television and a political journalist looking for the day s lead was nicely illustrated yesterday morning on the cable network cspan , which did a live broadcast of the donahue program as it was being taped afterward mr donahue got on the phone during another cspan program that included michael tomasky , a village voice columnist mr tomasky , who had not seen the debate , had a question about it for mr donahue it s probably a predictable journalist question , he said did someone win \? and if someone did n't win , who scored a nice point that they perhaps had n't scored before \? no , mr donahue answered , there were no dramatic triumphs or revelations but he suggested that viewers might have benefited from seeing what material the candidates chose to discuss , how they spoke , who interrupted the most what we got here , he said , was a chance to sort of examine the inner social graces of these people as they talk to each other this did not satisfy the reporters at the debate , who rushed up afterward for sound bites mr brown obliged with the gridlock in washington needs a real wakeup call mr clinton asked voters to pick the right change whatever the sound bites mean , both got on the air what did n't make the news was how the candidates handled themselves in a long discussion of the country s future mr brown was unexpectedly generous and relaxed for a man whose persona on newscasts seems to be borrowed from savonarola , the dominican friar who preached against the sins of 15th century florence when mr clinton whom he recently called on the evening news the personification of corruption discussed policies on aids , mr brown responded with , you make a very good point mr clinton was predictably poised , and he seemed so comfortable leading the discussion that you kept expecting him to gently interrupt mr brown , turn to the camera , and say , we 'll be right back after this message but viewers who had heard the constant criticism of his evasiveness and superficiality might have been surprised when he asked mr brown for the underlying difference between themselves and republican presidents of the last 12 years moment of agreement if you had to say in a sentence or two you try , then i 'll try what is it that they believed about the world that was wrong \? mr clinton asked why did they preside over the destruction of the middle class and the explosion of poverty \? because they obviously wanted to do well if for no other reason than to get reelected mr brown gave an answer that mr clinton agreed with i would say the fundamental error of the reaganbush era was the belief that the market , just the free market business , profit in and of itself could generate the good society it was not a bad summary of what might be the chief issue of this election whether to trust the market or the democrats' government programs the debate sometimes bogged down in politeness , and even viewers who are not fans of mr donahue s armwaving , bombastic style might have wished for him to interject a few questions but he did plenty of that on last week s programs , and it was useful to see how the candidates answered or evaded them after mr brown heard a lecture about his nonattachment and escape from the pain of living and above all from love , he grinned , fanned his face , and said , whew ! when it was mr clinton s turn last week , the studio audience booed mr donahue s unrelenting questions about his marital problems , but the treatment might have seemed fairer than what the candidates got on the evening news at least viewers had a chance to see them respond at length or simply say , as mr clinton did when asked if he and his wife had ever separated no , and it s none of your business if we did photo the most innovative television debate of the 1992 campaign , one that was broadcast on donahue without a moderator , met with a familiar denouement yesterday as news reporters pressed the candidates , gov bill clinton , left , and edmund g brown jr for more answers \( jim estrin the new york times \)
san diego economists say salvation for california s staggering economy lies in small entrepreneurial companies like the invitrogen corporation here a maker of geneisolation kits and other products for biomedical research , it has shrugged off recession , expanding from 20 employees in 1989 to 105 today in a 30 , 000 squarefoot plant amid tall pines in the la jolla area but now that invitrogen stands ready to expand even further , its brash young leaders may move all or part of the company to oregon or washington state and therein lies the major question facing oncebooming california home for one in eight americans as it struggles through its longest economic slump since world war ii is it too late to recapture the spirit that made california golden and prevent even the few bright spots like san diego s thriving biotechnology industry from going dim too \? much as they love san diego , with its splendid climate and proximity to top medical research units like the salk institute and the scripps research institute , invitrogen s owners say manufacturing has become almost prohibitive in california they cite uncertain water supplies , strict carpooling rules , growing crime , poor schools and the high costs of workers compensation and health insurance , waste disposal , taxes , housing and legal fees it is so expensive to dispose of radioactive waste here that the company has a scientist with a phd sort the garbage daily a costly life style the problem with southern california as we move from the research phase to manufacturing is that the cost of the life style here is prohibitive to the people we need to hire , said lyle c turner of invitrogen , who , with shoulderlength blond hair over a tennis shirt , hardly looks like the president of a company with 8 million in annual sales as national economic signs , holiday retail sales and new jobs point to recovery in most of the rest of the country , california finds itself in the odd company of new york and new england excluded from recovery , with little hope of improvement for at least a year indeed , even as the national unemployment rate dropped to 72 percent in november , california s rose , from 98 to 101 percent , for the highest rate of any industrial state in all , california has lost 808 , 000 jobs in the last 29 months , many of them highpaying aerospace and militaryrelated ones , according to the california department of finance and this when it would take a quarter of a million new jobs a year just to keep employment even the state has lost about 25 percent of its aerospacemanufacturing and construction jobs , with the heaviest losses in southern california forecasts are that employment in the aerospace and electronics industries will drop by an additional 8 percent or 10 percent during 1993 california smugness has turned into alarm , prompting a rare degree of cooperation between business and government to try to create new industries , like electric vehicles , to replace the declining military industry the speaker of the state assembly , willie l brown jr of san francisco , recently called for an economic conference of the state s business , political and academic leaders aides to gov pete wilson say the economy has become his chief priority , not least because he faces another 75 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months this is clearly one of the pivotal times in california s economic history , said lee a grissom , senior economic adviser to governor wilson , a republican i have traveled all around the state in the last few weeks there are economic summits all over they all ask the same thing what can we do locally to keep things from getting worse \? problems flaws masked by prosperity there are no ready answers for california is struggling to overcome deepseated problems that were masked by years of healthy economic growth , problems of deteriorating schools and roads and , at least in the opinion of many businessmen , environmental and other regulations that are oppressive a kind of economic vertigo has set in whereby the forces that drove the california boom in the last decade , like its sizzling real estate market and immigration , have turned into negative factors the california economy was like a beautiful house being undermined by termites , said raymond brady , research director at the association of bay area governments in san francisco , when an earthquake came , it began to collapse around us , and we could n't figure out why efforts to improve the economic climate have begun for example , the san diego city council , in rare unanimity , recently approved an economic development package cutting the time needed to acquire permits for new and expanding businesses in the troubled los angeles area , a venture called calstart has been mounted to achieve the conversion from military to peacetime industry , so far an elusive notion with the help of public agencies and major private companies , it is trying to create an electricvehicle industry in southern california to replace bomber manufacturing
little rock , ark , dec 15 presidentelect bill clinton s economic conference ended today with a consensus on the need to spur growth in the short term and reduce the deficit over the long haul , but with a welter of contradictory advice on how to achieve these goals the presidentelect took in all the comments from the economists , business executives and labor leaders gathered here but he refrained from tipping his hand over what approaches he intended to take at first toughest issue ahead participants at the conference proposed solutions ranging from spending a few million dollars to spending 60 billion on roads , bridges and education training to help create jobs and jolt the economy and they suggested various timetables for reducing the deficit some would start at once , others would phase in cuts starting several years from now but with all the give and take of the last two days , mr clinton has still not addressed the most difficult economic issue and perhaps the hardest political question he will face as president which government programs should be cut and which taxes should be raised to lower the deficit \? page a27 today s session at the robinson auditorium was a rare , although staged , glimpse of the presidentelect and his top economic advisers thinking aloud about their choices whereas on monday mr clinton and his advisers mostly listened , today they probed the specialists who offered their wisdom excerpts , page a26 the give and take disclosed how much the clinton team is still groping for answers , and how experts in basic agreement with mr clinton s general views could still disagree sharply at a news conference following the 19 hours of discussions over two days , mr clinton acknowledged that no two participants agreed on the details but at the same time , he insisted , there were several areas of agreement that he would take into account as he makes the tough choices in shaping his first budget for instance , mr clinton said there was an absolute consensus on the need to increase investment , not only in roads and bridges , but also in education and training , to improve the longterm productivity of the work force he said there was also accord that the clinton administration must increase access to bank loans and other capital so that small businesses and entreprenuers can flourish this could be done to some extent through deregulation finally , he said , there was a complete consensus that there is a huge undercapacity in the economy so that the threat of inflation from some increased government spending is minimal therefore , he added , the federal reserve should not raise interest rates as soon as growth picks up , but should wait instead until there are real signs of inflation these were the presidentelect s most pointed comments yet about federal reserve policy , and they were in line with the views of many of the bank s governors about the only policy issue on which mr clinton committed himself was his intention to make healthcare costs his top priority without controlling them , he told the gathering , none of the advice about deficit reduction or spending would be relevant pounding his fist we are kidding each other , he said , pounding his fist on the table we are all just sitting here making this up if we think we can fiddle around with the entitlements and all this other stuff and get control of this budget , if you do n't do something on health care it is a joke it s going to bankrupt the country mr clinton , who conducted the 10 hours of discussions on monday , sat at the helm for all nine hours today , dispensing with a flick of the wrist calls from his aides to cut off by 4 pm so his closing news conference would make the evening news if monday s session was economics 101 , today s often sounded like a postgraduate seminar for economists at one point , a political scientist interrupted to remind mr clinton and his advisers that they may have only a little time before the presidentelect s honeymoon expires there are two topics on the table shortterm stimulus and longterm deficit reduction , elaine kamarck , a political scientist from the progressive policy institute , a washingtonbased research center , told mr clinton the first one requires very little political capital the second one requires enormous amounts of political capital window of opportunity what we know historically is that presidents come in and they have a honeymoon , she added that honeymoon last six months , if they are lucky you have a window of opportunity to achieve real progress on the longterm problems that we have heard about in the last two days despite that caveat , deep and longstanding differences were manifest throughout the day isabel sawhill , senior fellow of the urban institute , said slow productivity growth was the cancer killing the economy , while economist henry aaron of the brookings institution said the soaring deficit was the slow , wasting disease sapping the economy james tobin , a nobel prizewinning economist who served on president john f kennedy s council of economic advisers , told mr clinton he should opt for tax cuts or spending programs totaling 50 billion to 60 billion for each of the next two years during the campaign mr clinton spoke about 20 billion in publicworks spending over four years but mr tobin contended that only an injection at the higher level would be able to create about nine million jobs that will be needed over the next four years to absorb new workers entering the marketplace , bring down the unemployment rate and lure back those workers who have simply dropped out almost every recovery since the second world war has been helped by fiscal stimulus , said mr tobin he said such prodding raises the deficit temporarily we 're fooling ourselves if you think there s a way of having a fiscal stimulus that does n't have that result , he said photo at the conference in little rock , ark ,

the newark museum opens its projects series with 11 paintings and drawings by elizabeth murray a specialist in the shaped canvas , ms murray has had 18 solo exhibitions in as many years , which is a formidable enough accomplishment but in the same period she has also participated in countless museum surveys , including half a dozen whitney biennials , as well as in gallery groups in the united states and abroad her career reached a climax in 1987 with a touring museum retrospective ms murray was not part of the new image movement , which took its name from the whitney show that started it , in the late 70 s but her art abounds in recognizable imagery nonetheless in this respect , she could be compared with joan mitchell and the other late abstract expressionists who seem always to be on the verge of representation in ms murray s case , however , there is more than a hint of surrealist playfulness that suggests a link with the chicago imagists she comes from chicago and attended its art institute before moving on to mills college in oakland , calif be that as it may , this painter pursues her own kind of automatism a convoluted stream of consciousness beginning with canvases that are triumphs of carpentry and stretching thus , specs is a tall , more or less convex shield with contours like those on a piece from a jigsaw puzzle its surface seems at first no more than a mass of yellow strapwork crisscrossing on a pinkpurple ground then , the viewer notices elements like the spindly green arms and the blue spectacles and realizes that the shield is a figure in fact , it is a portrait and , as explained to the reviewer by joseph jacobs , the museum s curator of painting and sculpture , its subject is none other than chuck close to see it in company with the portrait that mr close has done of ms murray would be instructive even more complicated is my own eyes , the canvas reproduced on this page , which is in effect an oversized jelly roll minus the jelly the skin of this extraordinary shape is ornamented with a predominantly yellow pattern , and it is pierced with a hole to reveal the forms within a ribbon form spirals around and disappears into the hole whether or not they are intended as autobiographical symbols , the paintings radiate anxiety and induce the same condition in the viewer to this eye , ms murray is at her best when she massages pastel and charcoal into paper and , cutting out the shapes , applies them as collage to a white ground most of the drawings have a pleasant cushiony quality , but the best , an untitled image displayed on the stairs to the gallery , suggests the flayed skin of an animal it is a blend of purplish black and silvery gray and is studded with small nipplelike forms in red more often than not , a murray show generates heated discussion between those who see her as one of the most important painters of the era and those who can take her art or leave it still , a middle way was admirably defined by david bourdon when , in a recent review in art in america magazine , he pronounced her paintings brilliant but added that they seldom elate because they are so visibly effortful the show runs through nov 16 the museum is at 49 washington street in newark , and its hours are noon to 5 pm wednesday through sunday
washington , march 23 the supreme court agreed today to resolve an escalating legal dispute over what requirements taxpayers who do some of their work at home must meet to qualify for a homeoffice deduction the question , which the justices will not decide until next year , pits the tax court against the internal revenue service the irs has long regarded homeoffice deductions with suspicion as an area of abuse two years ago , tax court judges rejected the irs s position and adopted a taxpayerfriendly interpretation of the relevant provision of the internal revenue code the tax court replaced a test , which said the home office had to be the focal point of the taxpayer s business , with a more elastic facts and circumstances test under which the individual situation would be considered a doctor s case applying the facts and circumstances test , the tax court permitted dr nader e soliman , a selfemployed anesthesiologist who practiced at several hospitals in the washington area , to take a homeoffice deduction for the room in his apartment in which he attended to his bills , patient records and other medical paperwork and telephone calls the irs appealed , arguing that an anesthesiologist s place of business is a hospital operating room , so the doctor s study did not qualify for a tax deduction but in june the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit in richmond affirmed the tax court s ruling , noting that none of the hospitals provided dr soliman an office and that paperwork was essential to medical practice the irs appealed to the supreme court , arguing in a brief filed by the solicitor general s office that the lower courts had vastly expanded the category of taxpayers eligible for the deduction by disregarding the statutory requirement that the home office must be the taxpayer s principal place of business congress added the principal place of business language to the internal revenue code in 1976 , explicitly to limit eligibility for the homeoffice deduction before then , the law required only that the home office be appropriate and helpful to the taxpayer s business , and many people who took work home at night claimed the deduction a crucial word but in narrowing the definition , congress neglected to define principal , leading inexorably to the current dispute in a sense , this entire case , commissioner of internal revenue v soliman , no 91998 , comes down to the meaning of the word principal in the government s view , it means the place where the taxpayer performs his most important , incomegenerating function for dr soliman , the practice of anesthesiology in hospital operating rooms by contrast , the fourth circuit found that the tax court s facts and circumstances test more accurately reflects the purpose behind the homeoffice deduction , permitting a determination of which location is the true headquarters of the business no matter where the income is generated another federal appeals court , the ninth circuit , based in san francisco , has upheld the irs position in another case to qualify for a homeoffice deduction an area must be used regularly and exclusively for business in such cases , a portion of utility bills , insurance and rent or mortgage payments , as well as depreciation , can be deducted in its supreme court appeal , the irs is contending that the tax court s approach might enable teachers to deduct the area of their home where they grade papers and plan lessons no court has yet issued such a ruling , however seizure of s l wo n't be reviewed the court , without comment , refused today to review the government s seizure of the franklin savings association , an 11 billion institution based in ottawa , kan , that the office of thrift supervision took over in february 1990 , saying it was about to become insolvent the franklin case gained wide notice after a federal district judge in topeka , kan , dale e saffels , conducted an 18day trial on the legality of the seizure and ordered the savings and loan restored to its original management , saying that the regulators had not established a factual basis for the takeover although the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit in denver later set aside judge saffels s ruling , questions remained about how much latitude the federal courts have to review the basis for regulators' actions under the financial institutions reform , recovery and enforcement act of 1989 franklin appealed to the supreme court , arguing that it was entitled under both the 1989 law and the constitution to a searching review of government seizures the savings and loan s appeal , franklin savings v director , office of thrift supervision , no 911139 , was supported by the american bankers association , representing commercial banks the bankers' group argued that financial institutions have liberty and property interests at stake that are as deserving of constitutional protection against unchecked government action as would be the interests of any other citizens
a group of former worldclass shooters is challenging the national rifle association as the governing body for sport shooting in the united states , contending that the nra has too much power , so much that all competitive shooters , including those who reach the olympics , must be nra members today in chicago , a twoyear fight for control of the sport will reach a critical point , when the nra plans to ask the united states olympic committee to approve a charter that defines the nra s role as the national governing body included in the proposal is an expanded role for athletes , coaches and others and the elimination of mandatory nra membership for athletes but the request is being challenged by four former shooters who are concerned that the nra , as an influential lobbying organization with a fixed political agenda , still has too much control , thus inhibiting the growth of the sport the four are supported by a petition signed by 342 other current and former shooters the four contend that even revised guidelines from the nra , which historically has served as the governing body , still leave the nra in violation of federal law the amateur sports act of 1978 requires that all national governing bodies be free of outside control and that athletes have no less than 20 percent representation in voting power we want them to be like every other national governing body , said p kent correll , a lawyer representing the four shooters we do n't want them distracted by political interests we want them solely focused on the development of the sport the possibility that the nra has not been complying with the amateur sports act of 1978 was first raised before the usoc membership committee in 1990 and brought to the attention of the nra over the next 18 months , an nra task force developed and refined a charter for its international competitions committee , the branch of the nra that serves as the governing body for shooting sports the nra is asking the usoc membership committee to approve that charter today we really feel we have satisfied their concerns , gary anderson , the icc executive director and a former olympic shooter , said yesterday possibility of greater success \? the united states has performed well in olympic shooting , which now includes seven events for men , four for women and two in which both compete since the modern olympics began in 1896 , only five other sports in the summer olympics track and field , swimming , diving , boxing and wrestling have produced more medals by american athletes but in recent years , a growing number of shooters have begun wondering if the level of success would improve if the nra s role were muted the nra is a politically conservative organization that opposes any form of gun control in the united states and actively lobbies for its position among the other 40 national governing bodies within the usoc , none has any direct affiliation with a political action committee , although such affiliations are not specifically prohibited the athletes are particularly concerned about the structure of the icc , which , in their view , keeps the nra in the position of power the proposed composition of the icc , approximately 31 people , includes 10 from athlete elections , 7 directly appointed by the nra leadership and the rest from other organizations , some of which are affiliated with the nra , like the amateur trap shooting association and the national skeet shooting association anderson pointed out that with the proposed composition , the nra has relaxed its hold on the icc until now , nearly all members , including the chairman , were nra appointments the new charter also amends the requirement that anyone who competes in a sanctioned event must first join the nra jay waldron , a 26yearold international level shooter as a shotgun specialist , said he joined the nra 13 years ago only because he wanted to compete as a junior if i did n't join , waldron said , i could n't shoot the new guidelines would give athletes the alternative to pay a registration fee , equal to the sum of membership dues but those who question the new charter still see the nra in control of the larger agendas , through the direct appointments to the icc and the appointments from the affiliated organizations also , skeptics do not feel the new means of selecting a chairman by vote from a list of three people recommended by the icc represents much change and they object to the fact that the nra board of directors would still control the icc budget the icc charter still does things we do n't want , said ernest vande zande of vancouver , wash , shooting s athlete representative to the usoc and one of the four shooters challenging the nra if they think we should be different from any other olympic sport , they 're wrong the athletes challenging the charter are also concerned about blurring of the lines between the nra s political activities and its olympic development programs , which funnel athletes from the grassroots level to the 26member olympic team for the summer games in barcelona , spain even senior nra officials acknowledge a diverse public perception of the nra speaking at an nra board of directors meeting in january , david boehm , a state judge in rochester who served as chairman of the task force to revise the icc charter , cited the importance of the nra serving as a governing body , saying , our involvement with the us olympic committee is probably the most positive public relations association that our organization has
washington , dec 2 in a sharp break from past practice , the health insurance industry called today for a new federal law that would require coverage for all americans , define a basic set of benefits and try to contain healthcare costs by limiting tax breaks for the purchase of insurance the board of directors of the health insurance association of america , representing 270 commercial insurers , adopted a policy statement today declaring that the insurance industry itself needs reform the industry has often been described as an obstacle to change in the nation s healthcare system but with the new proposal , to be announced thursday , the industry signals its willingness to accept sweeping changes , many of them similar to those proposed by presidentelect bill clinton details to be worked out details of the insurers' proposal remain to be worked out many of the unresolved issues are contentious but democrats and republicans as well as business executives and labor unions agree that the nation must do something to help the 35 million people who do not have health insurance in a separate action today , the association adopted a policy stating that the health insurance industry would treat aids like any other physical illness current practice varies some insurers have tried to avoid paying claims for aids and related illnesses carl j schramm , president of the association , said the health benefits proposal was in the longterm financial interest of insurance companies for more than a year , the insurers have been denouncing proposals for a governmentrun program of national health insurance that would minimize the role of private insurers 'enlightened selfinterest' this is probably the only way you preserve the private health insurance industry , mr schramm said it s plainout enlightened selfinterest the insurers , like mr clinton , endorsed the idea of universal coverage , mandated by federal law , along with new measures to control costs , including a larger role for the government in supervising fees charged by doctors and hospitals but the insurers did not support mr clinton s proposal for an annual limit on all health spending , public and private the health insurance association is one of many business groups that have offered to cooperate with mr clinton since his election many of these groups previously opposed overhauling the healthcare system but now say they see major changes as inevitable and want to help shape the results to their liking ian m rolland , chairman of the board of directors of the association and chief executive of the lincoln national corporation , in fort wayne , ind , said the new proposal was radically different from positions taken by the industry in the past in little rock , ark , judith feder , health policy coordinator for the clinton transition team , welcomed the new proposal and described it as a major turnaround for members of the health insurance industry it suggests they are willing to participate in the process of healthcare reform , she said they seem to be demonstrating a commitment to universal coverage and cost containment , which we 've not seen before the insurers' proposal may help break a logjam that has blocked congressional action on comprehensive health legislation for the last two years dozens of bills died earlier this year amid partisan squabbling in the election campaign in announcing his candidacy on oct 3 , 1991 , mr clinton said he would take on the big insurance companies in an effort to control health costs he repeated that vow hundreds of times in the campaign the insurers' new position , unlike the old one , would require health insurance coverage for all americans and limit the amount of taxfree health benefits that employees could get from their employers the proposal would require employees to pay a tax on the value of health insurance exceeding the standard package of benefits this proposal is noteworthy because companies rarely propose a new tax on their own goods and services revenue from the health insurance tax would be used to help finance additional coverage for poor people , fewer than half of whom are now covered by medicaid four main elements the industry s new proposal , set forth in a discussion paper adopted unanimously today by the board of the association , is incomplete but the proposal has these four main elements through unspecified tax incentives for employers and tax penalties for consumers who do not purchase insurance , the government would require all americans to buy an essential package of health benefits if the government fails to achieve universal coverage in this way , then it may become necessary to require employers to help finance such coverage , the insurance industry said most big companies already provide health benefits to employees , but 30 million workers and dependents have no coverage the government would help define the essential package of benefits the package , though not described in detail , would go beyond minimum benefits and would meet most of the needs of americans for doctors' services and hospital care private insurers would agree to provide the standard coverage , regardless of a person s medical history
early last week , after the islanders joined other national hockey league teams in voting to authorize a strike , a group of reporters followed ken baumgartner into the locker room after practice in nassau coliseum to discuss the matter not only is baumgartner the team s representative to the nhl players association , but he is also a member of the nineplayer bargaining committee that is seeking a new collective bargaining agreement bill torrey , the islanders' general manager who is also a member of the management bargaining committee , saw the group around baumgartner and made a joke knowing that baumgartner s wife had just given birth to their first child , torrey asked if the labor matters under discussion involved childbirth or union business things got serious again yesterday a day after torrey and baumgartner participated in a fruitless bargaining session with their committees in manhattan , torrey traded baumgartner to the toronto maple leafs as part of a fourman deal losing the touch also going to toronto was dave mcllwain , a veteran forward from the leafs , the islanders got claude loiselle , a veteran center , and daniel marois , a right wing whose scoring touch has vacated him this season none of the four players were among frontline performers for their teams , which are both in fifth place in their respective divisions , near the bottom of the league over all but when union leaders in sports are traded during sensitive negotiations , it raises a question did union activity prompt management to trade an outspoken worker \? in this case , the answer is no , according to both torrey and to baumgartner s agent bob murray , a massachusetts lawyer who represents baumgartner , said baumgartner requested a trade early this season because he was n't satisfied with his playing time as a parttime forward and parttime defenseman this trade of ken baumgartner had absolutely , positively nothing to do with his activity in the players association , murray said in a telephone interview a few months ago , kenny and i talked with bill torrey things were n't going as well for kenny in new york as kenny would like he did not demand to be traded , but asked bill , if the opportunity arose to move kenny to please do so at one point , bill said to me , 'geez , if i trade him right at the deadline , people are going to think of everything else that s going on' i told him , 'look , we both know that s not the case we will make sure that it gets out that the collective bargaining has nothing to do with it' popular and aggressive torrey confirmed that analysis , but not without another joke first i traded him because i'm sick and tired of facing him across the bargaining table , he said , before becoming serious torrey said he was concerned with how baumgatner s teammates would perceive the trade , adding that it had nothing to do with union business you never like to give up a player like bomber because he comes to play and he s popular and he s aggressive and he is entertaining to watch , torrey said as he cleaned out his locker before tuesday s game at the coliseum , baumgartner said i want this on the record this has nothing to do with the collective bargaining agreement i had a conversation with mr torrey six weeks ago for mcllwain , a utility forward , this will be his fourth team of the season he began the season with three games for winnipeg , five for buffalo and 54 for the islanders , a team he joined oct 25 as part of the sevenplayer deal that sent pat lafontaine to the sabres this season , mcllwain has 9 goals and 16 assists for 25 points baumgartner joined the islanders from los angeles in november of 1989 to play the hockey role of enforcer this season , he had no goals and one assist and 202 penalty minutes
washington , sept 13 the redskins admitted that they were pinned against the wall by the dallas cowboys last monday night and that a victory this afternoon against the atlanta falcons was crucial if they were to maintain respect and confidence so , washington held the falcons to seven first downs \( none rushing \) , got 24 first downs and controlled the ball for nearly 40 minutes despite that type of domination , the redskins still needed two late goalline stands and physical running on the inside by ricky ervins in the final 3 41 to preserve a 2417 victory before 54 , 343 fans at robert f kennedy stadium the game proved costly on both sides falcons receiver michael haynes separated his right shoulder and will be out for at least four weeks redskins cornerback darrell green broke his right arm and could be out for eight weeks both teams are 11 the falcons are now 09 at robert f kennedy stadium but before bowing , they made plenty of noise what atlanta could n't get in long drives it got in big plays deion sanders , in his first football game of 1992 , returned a kickoff 99 yards , and haynes made an 89yard scoring catch in the first half to close the redskins' lead at halftime to 2114 each team got a field goal in the second half to close out the scoring two missed field goals by chip lohmiller and a dropped punt by brian mitchell at the washington 22 kept the game in reach for atlanta late in the fourth quarter , the falcons were driving for the tying score , at the washington 9 , when middle linebacker kurt gouveia swiped a chris miller pass in the end zone meant for andre rison with 3 41 left ervins then ran seven straight times , picking up three straight first downs , and washington ran out the clock 'emotional game' miller rolled left and i dropped off right , gouveia explained my job was to wall the first receiver who made an inside break it was rison and i saw the ball and got it it was a very emotional game where our backs were against the wall , looking at starting 02 i had a lot to prove to myself and my teammates matt millen was a great middle linebacker here filling his shoes are big shoes to fill miller said he did not see gouveia he did a good job of hiding in there and breaking at the right time , said miller , who completed 11 of 25 passes for 242 yards but had little help from a rushing attack that managed only 28 yards per carry and a total of 34 yards for the game in the first quarter , earnest byner caught a 5pass from mark rypien \( 18 of 28 for 181 yards in the game \) to open the scoring then , desmond howard electrified the rfk crowd , taking a lateral from mitchell off a punt reception for a 55yard score , which gave washington a 140 lead mitchell , formerly a quarterback at southwestern louisiana , caught the punt near midfield , lateraled left across the field to howard , and the 1991 heisman trophy winner sped down the left sideline , nearly untouched i was just trying to execute the play properly , howard said it was exciting , my first pro score sanders took the ensuing kickoff and returned the favor he s the scariest guy we 've ever tried to cover , wayne sevier , the redskins' special teams coach , said of sanders on our play with desmond , we practiced that once on wednesday and once on thursday with the entire team together , he and brian practiced it a lot it was in the game plan and it would have stayed there through the season if we had n't used it the minute we drafted the guy , we knew that play was going into our book courage is what the redskins' defense exhibited all afternoon in atlanta s first four possessions , the falcons' average starting field position was the atlanta 14 while the redskins on their first four possessions averaged a start from their own 42 that s all we talked about at halftime , said falcons coach jerry glanville we said if we can cover and return kicks , we can win this game the falcons did in the second half in their last two possessions , they got to the washington 2 and 9 but they wound up with only a field goal and the interception by gouveia atlanta tried running and passing to reach the end zone , but each time the redskins' defense would not budge
tokyo with just about everything else failing , the japanese government is now pinning its hopes on the construction industry to winch the ailing economy and stock market out of their deepening ruts the idea is to pour tens of billions of dollars into public works , like roads , sewage plants and bridges , on the theory that the employment and orders from construction companies will give the economy a sorely needed lift for a while , that had made various constructionrelated shares the darlings of the stock market but in a sign of the depth of the market s malaise , even that sector is now looking worn out investors seem to find every piece of news just another excuse to run for the exits it is also a sign , some analysts say , that the market is not just out of steam , but out of ideas none of the old tricks , like finding theme stocks , seem to be working as of the end of last week , constructionindustry stocks had fallen about 38 percent over the last 52 weeks , compared with a 346 percent decline for the overall market in the same period , according to john baldwin , an analyst here with jardine fleming securities but over the last 26 weeks , construction stocks have dropped 36 percent , while the market has fallen 274 percent and over the last 13 weeks , construction stocks have tumbled 265 percent , while the market has lost 14 percent if anything , these stocks have held up longer than i would have expected , said hugh conaway , an analyst who follows the japanese construction industry at baring securities here these stocks may be near bottom , but they 're not ready to be bought yet , not for another six months the japanese government s budget for the current fiscal year had already been fattened with a heavy load of publicworks spending , in part to satisfy american trade negotiators the hope was that with some stimulus to demand at home , japanese exporters would be more inclined to sell their products domestically , thus moderating japan s huge trade surplus then , prime minister kiichi miyazawa had announced at the end of march that his government would be frontloading this year s publicworks spending by signing about 75 percent of the contracts in the first half , giving the economy a little extra jolt the market continued to slump so two weeks ago , the government said it was preparing a supplementary budget , to be formally announced in september , that would increase publicworks spending by as much as 55 billion the market s response \? stock prices on monday fell to their lowest levels since march 1986 , with the nikkei index of 225 issues temporarily cracking through the 15 , 000 level as peter sanborn , a construction industry analyst at jardine fleming securities , noted , the decline in the construction stocks may be in defiance of government plans , but it is not irrational in a recent report , he wrote that investors were responding to the trend in japanese publicworks spending , which typically soars at first , only to drop off sharply once the economy recovers profits decline with the loss of government contracts investors , he said , are just getting out in front of an expected lowering of government publicworks spending in coming years , especially when the economy begins to perk up there is a real danger that interest in publicworks stocks will shift abruptly with mounting confidence in an economic turnaround , mr sanborn wrote the economic signs these days augur ill , but most analysts expect an upturn sometime next year and that has provided investors yet another excuse to shed the socalled countercyclical stocks that were supposed to hold up when everything else looked gloomy shares in kajima , for instance , a leading construction company , have fallen 126 percent since july 1 , to 750 yen on monday shimizu , another big construction concern , has tumbled 106 percent since july 1 , to 805 yen nippon hodo , japan s largest road builder , has seen its shares plummet 287 percent in the same period , to 1 , 790 yen on monday even obayashi road , another top road builder whose shares mr sanborn recommends , has seen its stock price tumble more than 14 percent over the last six weeks , to 1 , 840 yen on monday mr conaway of baring securities attributed much of the misery in the construction sector to the fact that private orders have collapsed because of a plunge in corporate investment while government contracts once made up half of the industry s orders , they now make up only about 30 percent this shift is a result of the private construction boom over the last six years , he said as a result , investors are looking at the promise of tens of billions of dollars more in government publicworks spending not as a boon , but as the minimum necessary to keep the industry from suffering an even deeper recession the problem now is that if we do n't get 6 or 7 trillion yen in extra publicworks spending this year , you 'll see a real drop , mr conaway said that s the minimum we need just to keep the sector going really
an administrative law judge has removed one of the final hurdles to building a trash incinerator in the brooklyn navy yard , recommending that the state department of environmental conservation grant the necessary permits without holding any more hearings on the plant s environmental impact in a lengthy decision , signed on wednesday but not released until yesterday , the judge , robert p o'connor , ruled that none of the issues raised by environmentalists , elected officials and residents who have for years fought the 450 million incinerator warranted further study i do not find their arguments to be meritorious , he concluded , clearing the way for the department s commissioner , thomas c jorling , to give the city the permits it needs to begin building the plant in the navy yard , just south of williamsburg the incinerator s opponents reacted angrily to the decision and pledged to continue to fight its construction , possibly by challenging it in court they said the decision failed to consider the potential for air pollution from the plant and concerns about of the city s plan to dispose of the ashes from the incinerated waste all the questions we 've raised remain and should at least be the subject of hearings , said larry shapiro , a lawyer for the new york public interest research group , which has been one of the leading opponents of the incinerator judge o'connor , the administrative judge for the department of environmental conservation , gave the plant s opponents until jan 15 to appeal his recommendation , and several said yesterday that they would a spokesman for the department , benjamin a marvin , said the commissioner would make a final decision whether to grant the city the air and solidwaste permits shortly after the appeals process is completed 28 , 000 tons of trash a day the city council voted to approve construction of the incinerator , as well as a plan to increase recycling significantly , in august after a long and bitter fight over the future of waste disposal in the city , which produces 28 , 000 tons of trash each day mayor david n dinkins , who had promised during his mayoral campaign to postpone building new incinerators , now maintains that the city must undertake incineration to cope with the enormous amount of trash it creates , even as its landfill space dwindles the incinerator , to be built starting in 1996 by wheelabrator inc , would eventually convert 3 , 000 tons of waste into energy each day but residents of williamsburg and fort greene , two neighborhoods adjacent to the plant , have vehemently opposed it , as have many elected officials , including the city comptroller , elizabeth holtzman , the brooklyn borough president , howard golden , and the brooklyn members of the city council they have said that more should be done to reduce garbage and increase recycling before building a plant that would further pollute the air and pose a cancer risk mr shapiro said his primary objection to judge o'connor s decision was that he failed to consider whether new , more stringent requirements under the federal clean air act that took effect in november should apply to the incinerator if the state permits are granted , the city would still need to obtain federal permits before construction could begin and opponents pledged to fight the incinerator every step along the way the fight is not over yet , mr golden said in a statement
hong kong , nov 11 after 17 years in which more than 15 million vietnamese fled their homeland , the exodus appears to have ended , and refugee experts say they believe that the long catastrophe of the boat people is finally winding to a close the exodus was one of the tragedies of the latter part of this century tens of thousands of vietnamese were drowned at sea or killed by pirates while trying to escape , and nearby countries sometimes tried to deter the boat people from landing by firing on them as they approached the shore or by towing their rickety boats back out to sea 12 this year , 20 , 000 last year even for those who landed safely in places like hong kong , there has been no quick deliverance about 48 , 000 vietnamese are still living in bleak camps in this british territory , with some having waited for a decade to be resettled in the west recent statistics suggest that the huge migration may finally have ended only nine vietnamese arrived in hong kong in the first nine months of this year , and only three since then , compared to more than 20 , 000 in the similar period last year new arrivals have also slowed to a trickle elsewhere in southeast asia in the first eight months of this year , only 18 vietnamese landed in indonesia , 9 in thailand , 1 in malaysia and none in singapore , macao or the philippines everything points to the fact that this is a problem that is passing into the pages of history , said brian j bresnihan , refugee coordinator for the hong kong government the decline in the exodus is one of the most important elements of this , and the other is the increased willingness of people in the camps to return to vietnam no one entirely rules out the possibility of a resumption in the exodus a lull in the early 1980 s was followed by another surge of migrants chasing rumors of relaxed resettlement policies but most experts believe that a resumption is quite unlikely , in part because the returning vietnamese are now carrying with them the message that flight is a dead end just a year or two ago , the problem of the boat people was regularly modified by the adjective insoluble last year , 21 , 900 vietnamese arrivals were reported by southeast asian countries , on top of 32 , 100 in 1990 and 70 , 000 in 1989 until recently , the number of vietnamese born in the camps in hong kong exceeded the number returning to vietnam some young children have no memories of anything but life behind the barbedwire fences , locked in a world that is virtually a prison except that it is run by gangs more than by guards there is a repressive regime of unimaginable ghastliness inside these concentration camps here , said michael t darwyne , a hong kong lawyer and advocate for the vietnamese hong kong has persecuted the asylum seekers to a degree less than they are persecuted in vietnam , but it has persecuted them nonetheless we are imposing on them a psychological torture and physical deprivation of unparalleled proportions under the stress of that , they are moving back away from the countries where they have sought asylum , and particularly from hong kong in that sense , what hong kong perceives as its problem is being solved mostly off limits hong kong officials acknowledge that the camps are grim but note that there are vietnameselanguage schools and other facilities , and they say conditions are not as bad as critics like mr darwyne suggest one reason why conditions are difficult to gauge is that journalists are allowed in the camps only occasionally , on supervised tours arranged by the authorities only a tiny proportion of the boat people are deemed to be political refugees eligible for resettlement in the west the rest are locked up in the camps and told that their only way out is to return to vietnam in the past , most stuck it out , hoping against hope that the united states would change its policies and take them in since autumn 1991 , however , the number agreeing to return to vietnam has picked up sharply , to an average of about 1 , 000 a month a record 1 , 400 are expected to return this month while hong kong has as many vietnamese as all other countries in the region combined , the numbers are also going down in indonesia , malaysia and other countries 'realities' are tough the exodus of the boat people began with a specific event , the collapse of south vietnam in 1975 its apparent end is the result of a complex web of factors that help to explain why the vietnamese are no longer fleeing their homeland and those abroad are beginning to go back while the phrase boat people is often used as shorthand for the vietnamese , some arrive by other means in recent years , many were bus people who traveled by land through china before taking a boat for the final hop to hong kong the vietnamese government initially encouraged the flight , seeing it as an opportunity to confiscate the wealth of the emigrants and to rid the country of its ethnic chinese minority now hanoi , eager to improve ties with the west , seems to want to curb the outflow and take back those who fled
an ambitious program to rebuild kennedy international airport as the nation s premier international gateway into the next century ended up wasting at least 100 million before it was scrapped , the head of the port authority of new york and new jersey acknowledged yesterday the plan , which was intended to ready the airport for half again as many passengers and which had at its center a 1 billion glassdomed central terminal building the size of shea stadium , was excessively optimistic and based on questionable assumptions , the head of the authority , stanley brezenoff , said in a report sent to gov mario m cuomo in the report , which the governor received earlier this week , mr brezenoff charged his predecessors with a series of miscalculations that led to the illfated program major errors of judgmentxx he said the 32 billion rebuilding plan failed as a result of three major errors of judgment first , authority planners wrongly forecast that 10 million additional passengers would be using the airport by the mid1990 s second , they pursued the plan without persuading the airlines to pay half the cost and third , they failed to take into account the effects of airline deregulation , believing that the weakened principal carriers at kennedy would either recover or be replaced mr brezenoff s predecessor and the implied target of the criticism , stephen berger , defended the plan as one that was sound and would eventually be proven valid when the governor reacted with alarm to the first reports of the waste , which appeared in newsday , mr berger called it the art of political deflection and recalled that mr cuomo had approved the plan when it was adopted in 1987 on sunday , mr cuomo called on the port authority to deliver a second report by june 15 detailing how to avoid waste in the future governor cuomo released the preliminary report yesterday without comment bluesky optimism depicted the report to the governor from mr brezenoff draws a picture of an airport planning staff caught in the grip of the bluesky business optimism that characterized the mid80 s but instead of growing , passenger loads at kennedy began to decline of the three airlines that accounted for nearly half kennedy s flights when the plan was adopted , pan american and eastern have collapsed and trans world airlines is operating under bankruptcy protection only one domestic airline , american , has significantly enlarged its operations at the airport the work performed and then abandoned on the jfk 2000 program , as it was called , includes a useless 700foot 21 million tunnel , the razing of three chapels at a cost of 23 million to make way for a new central terminal building , a 60 million parking deck that is rarely used and a 13 million redesign of the new control tower that could have been anticipated and avoided although mr brezenoff s report speaks only of bad choices made by unnamed port authority planners and staff , it was mr berger , an investment banker , who was the executive director at the authority from the time of the plan s adoption in 1987 through its demise in may 1990 mr berger said mr brezenoff had shown him the report before sending it to the governor , and had asked for his comment mr berger said he had had none but in an interview , he said passenger growth at kennedy international would have eventually justified the rebuilding plan , and that the city would either have to build it later or lose out to other cities with newer airports no accusation of wrongdoing mr berger and the port authority were also defended by peter c goldmark jr , mr berger s predecessor as executive director and now president of the rockefeller foundation he said the agency s failures were dwarfed by its successes this is the silly season , mr goldmark said of the reaction to the failed airport plan in his report to the governor , mr brezenoff never directly accused the port authority staff of wrongdoing , and only in the last sentence of the review did he raise the possibility that the authority s staff members might have failed in their duties in hindsight , that sentence says , it is clear that not all of the risks played out to the benefit of the project , and that is to be expected but whether and when the planners of the project made the risks explicit enough to policymakers is unclear plan born amid expansion mr brezenoff s report to mr cuomo says the plan for a new airport was developed during rapidly expanding passenger loads at kennedy international , leaving the airport with nearly twice the 15 million passengers it was designed to handle at the same time , airline deregulation had opened up lucrative international routes from other american cities , which were investing heavily in new airports to meet the demand for space chicago , atlanta and dallasforth worth each spent 1 billion on airport expansions during the decade , and denver was about to break ground on one costing 2 billion their spending helped erode kennedy s share of overseas air travel , which dropped from 60 percent of international flights in the 1960 s to 35 percent in 1984 , when planning for major rebuilding began at the port authority kennedy s share of international flights has since declined to about 25 percent of such flights from all united states airports at the same time other cities were improving their airports , even the port authority s conservative forecasts estimated that the number of passengers landing and taking off from kennedy would grow from 30 million annually in 1984 to 40 million in 1994 other estimates put kennedy s mid90 s passenger load as high as 50 million tunnels and peoplemovers factors that mr brezenoff detailed as leading to the failure of the j f k 2000 program include the plan for a huge central terminal , through which most passengers would be dispatched to the eight existing airline terminals in automated peoplemovers traveling through tunnels one of those tunnels is already built besides objecting to the new terminal s cost , the airlines were loath to make it easier for passengers to change airlines in new york , mr brezenoff wrote in his report and the plan was financially hampered because 45 percent of kennedy s traffic came from pan am , t w a and eastern , three carriers that had been weakened by the pricecutting that followed airline deregulation in 1978 mr brezenoff wrote that a major element in the failure of the plan was the decision to proceed without convincing the airlines to shoulder their share of the cost it was the airlines' intensifying resistance to that cost that ultimately forced mr berger to kill the plan in may 1990 but toward the end of his 22page report to the governor , mr brezenoff said that the changing air travel market might have doomed the plan even if the airlines had approved it mr brezenoff s report was also sent to gov jim florio of new jersey , who shares control over the port authority s actions with the new york governor mr florio has not commented on the report in the past , new jersey has demanded and received compensation from the port authority for investments in new york that failed in this case , however , new jersey officials have generally regarded the uproar over the j f k 2000 program as a new york problem , having satisfied themselves that the port authority has given newark international a fair share of airport redevelopment funds photos a program to rebuild kennedy international airport wasted at least 100 million before it was scrapped , the port authority acknowledged yesterday this parking deck , which is rarely used , cost 60 million \( michael shavel for the new york times \) stanley brezenoff , the head of the port

the major planting season has gone by , but gardeners are far from finished vacation planning is under way and there are many other summer activities on the family s priority list just to be sure the gardening essentials are met , here is a brief review to get everyone up to speed for the long haul through the summer days ahead mulch there is nothing like a good cover on the soil s surface to keep moisture in and weeds out thus far the northeast has had abundant rainfall and the ground is wet , but it may not stay so through the summer months weeds will have a tough time getting enough light and root hold if they have a layer of mulch to push through there is no hard rule as to the best mulch to use the two things that should dictate are price and availability an ample supply of bark chips \( the small ones \) make an excellent mulch so do grass clippings if not piled too thickly and the lawn has not been treated with an herbicide herbicide residue could be damaging to certain plants , particularly sensitive vegetables like tomatoes other good mulches are spoiled hay \( sometimes farmers give this away \) , shredded leaves , even compost but not peat moss , which looks great for a time but acts like a sponge and absorbs moisture from the soil to be effective , the mulch layer should be kept at least two inches thick weeds since these unwanted plants will usurp valuable soil moisture and nutrients , pull them out they are flowering now and setting seed less seed means less trouble next year stakes some perennials become floppy just by their weight and height , especially on windy days if some of the perennials flop over , tie them up to a stake the english gardeners have a special way of placing brush stakes among young perennials the stems grow around these supports and the visitor is none the wiser roses just to keep spirits up while these chores are under way , cut a few blooms to add a magnificent fragrance to the house when cutting rosebushes remember to count the leaves carefully rosebushes have compound leaves with three or five leaflets always remember to cut each flower above a fiveleaf eye these leaves produce the next flowering stems and are important to the vitality of the bush itself ideally there should be two fiveleaf leaves left on each stem when a rose is cut and do n't forget to keep the rosebushes clean that is , spray them every week to 10 days with a fungicide to keep black spot under control also , one more feeding this season would be just about right to keep the bushes vital and productive for the summer and into the fall iris if the planting of tall bearded iris has been in the garden for about five years , now is the time to dig up the bed , replenish the soil and divide the rhizomes keep the double fans , which form a y , and then plant them in groups of three to make a good display for next year the old center can be pulled or cut off so the stronger rhizomes are left for planting remember that iris need sun to bloom properly and if there are ample roots left over , share them with another gardener , but be sure to label them or at least keep the colors separate vegetables resow the rows with beans , carrots , swiss chard and maybe some seedling onions these will be productive during the late summer months and into fall and plan where the fall crops will go broccoli , kohlrabi , brussels sprouts , cabbage and kale deadhead when seed pods are allowed to form , the strength of the plant goes into the seedpod formation and not into the floral display for next year with great care , snap off or use shears to cut off the faded flowers from rhododendrons , lilacs , tree peonies and mountain laurel prune this is the time of year to cut back hard those overgrown foundation shrubs that have got out of control especially in need of discipline are huge azaleas , lilacs , forsythias , among other springflowering shrubs cut back many perennials that bloomed can also be cut back now so that they either bloom again in early fall or form strong root systems two that surely need this sort of attention are the evergreen candytufts \( iberis \) and many of the spreading alpine plants , particularly creeping phlox bulbs if the daffodils did not bloom as spectacularly as they have in past springs , it may mean that the bulbs are crowded like sardines underground now while the foliage indicates where the bulbs are is a good time to dig up the clumps and divide them replant the daffodils , allowing the foliage to remain to ripen naturally the bulbs will form new roots and complete their cycle house plants they should be outdoors now , especially the foliage plants exceptions would be those plants with soft leaves , such as african violets and gloxinias , which seem to survive better in their usual indoor shelter these chores should put the garden in good order for the sultry months ahead drawing
in the next three months , something like the old hip hooray and ballyhoo are coming back to broadway twentytwo shows will have opened , almost as many as opened in the entire 199091 season some of them will probably have the life span of a mayfly still , better a brief run than none at all , and besides , who knows \? among the nine musicals are revivals of the most happy fella \( already here \) , guys and dolls and man of la mancha , none of which employ armies , crashing chandeliers or hovering helicopters they do n't need them when a show s got standin' on the corner , say , or fugue for tinhorns , scenery recedes several of the plays feature big screen stars , some of whom may twinkle very faintly , if at all , on stage even so , those names are going to look very good on broadway marquees and broadway is going to look very good on their resumes that s because broadway is embedded in countless songs , countless books and the memories of countless americans for a century tourists coming home from a visit to new york have been greeted with , did you take in any broadway shows \? broadway by now is sometimes as much myth as reality ticket receipts are way down ticket prices are still way up half a million fewer people have shown up so far for this season s offerings than through the same period last year maybe one ca n't fight a recession with singing , dancing and a new neil simon play never mind it s optimism that counts , and that will now radiate from 22 marquees
one of the mosttalkedabout topics in advertising is the state of the relationships between agencies and their clients and an annual survey on the subject found that agencies might think about subscribing to the ladies' home journal to study its monthly installments of can this marriage be saved \? a preview of the 1992 salz survey of advertiseragency relations showed some surprising disparities in attitudes between parties that are ostensibly partners for instance , 63 percent of the advertisers surveyed said they thought there was more teamwork in their relationships by contrast , only 28 percent of the agencies gave the same response asked if money has become more of an issue in their relationships , 46 percent of the advertisers said yes while 90 percent of the agencies did and asked whether changes in their relationships are related to pressures and frustrations brought on by the recession , almost four times as many agencies as advertisers said yes among agencies , 38 percent said yes and 60 percent said no among advertisers , the division was far sharper 10 percent yes , 87 percent no by virtue of the fact they hold the pursestrings , the advertisers set the tone of their relationships , said nancy l salz , president of nancy l salz consulting , a new york company whose clients include apple computer , the advertising council , the association of national advertisers , kraft general foods , pepsico and philip morris salz consulting will soon issue its seventh annual survey on the vagaries of the often fractious interaction between agencies and their clients if they say what s happening is not related to the recession , she added , they 're sending a message that more agencies than i 'd expect have n't heard in other words , agencies that say their problems with clients are temporary in nature , products of a sour economy , could be rudely surprised by clients who consider those problems far more substantial or systemic of course , agencies and advertisers did find common ground on some issues , but none that would give agencies reason to celebrate asked if their relationships are more tense than before , 40 percent of the advertisers said yes , a response given by 55 percent of the agencies and when 43 percent of advertisers replied that when troubled with the quality of their agencies' creative work they ask for assistance from other agencies more readily than in the past , 40 percent of the agencies said they had noticed their clients' growing impatience the responses by clients to the survey , which canvassed the nation s top 200 advertisers \( and all but 1 of the 100 largest agencies \) , indicate they are coming to regard their advertising as more of a commodity , ms salz said , a trend that portends ill for agencies if they are relegated to the status of vendors or suppliers rather than partners agencies need to feel they are in partnerships , she added , as evidenced by what she called a startling response to one important question agencies were 40 percent more likely to report that they were able to do their best work for clients when there was more teamwork in their relationships than when there was not and it could only benefit advertisers to encourage such partnerships , ms salz continued , rather than continually change agencies , for a bottomline reason the better the agency knows the business , the better the chances of getting outstanding advertising
she thought she had saved enough , but the money went fast after her husband died and his pension shriveled pretty soon , eleanor f had to sell off some of her furniture then one day she found herself in the pawnshop , handing over the engagement ring he slipped on her finger in 1948 a little less than a carat she got 400 i cried in the store , said eleanor , who is 68 years old it is that way for many widows because women tend to outlive their husbands , after decades of marriage they can find themselves grappling not only with sudden loneliness but also with a deep cut in their incomes , as their social security benefits are reduced or they discover they are entitled only to some , or sometimes none , of their husbands' pensions but eleanor was lucky she found an apartment she could afford in a building for older people in flushing , queens the building is run by selfhelp community services , which receives money from united jewish appealfederation of jewish philanthropies of new york uja is one of seven charities aided by the new york times neediest cases fund thank god for this building , she said i could be a shoppingbag lady while only 14 percent of men 65 and older were widowers in 1990 , according to census statistics , almost half of elderly women were widows , a proportion that increases with age when eleanor s husband died in 1984 , his pension shrank after paying her rent , she found herself with only 13 a month for food , phone and other expenses that was when her savings began to disappear and she began knocking on neighbors' doors for a little food or money a university of michigan survey found that women s incomes dropped an average of 37 percent after their husbands died , a reduction that the researchers estimated resulted in a 20 percent drop in their standard of living , said professor greg j duncan , the project director that result understated the women s financial loss , he said , because , as in eleanor s case , their incomes declined even before their husbands died , as the medical bills mounted and the women stopped working to care for their ailing spouses the proportion of women living in poverty climbed almost 50 percent after their husbands died , from 11 percent to 16 percent , mr duncan said other researchers have found that widows are more likely to enter nursing homes there s an increased instance of institutionalization for widows , because their support network is loosened and somewhat destroyed , said richard suzman , director of the office of demography of the national institute on aging , part of the national institutes of health rather than the decline in income , it is the loneliness that seems to take the greatest toll most of all i miss my husband , eleanor said sometimes i cry , but what can i do \? while time in many ways has been brutal to eleanor , it has left her her memories as she sat in her apartment recently she returned time and again to the story of how at 22 she began dating her brother s old pal asa , acey as she still calls him , after he returned from the war and showed up one day in her family s bronx home so when i came down the stairs i had long hair , strawberry blond he said , 'are you the little brat that used to run around here with a glass of milk and jam on her face \? ' she recalled , smiling i said , 'who are you \? ' he said , 'i'm the guy you 're going to go out with tonight' it was at about that moment , she said , that she thought to herself i'm going to marry this man later came the ring , and then the photo , faded now , that sits on one of her shelves , above the flag that was draped over her husband s coffin it shows the couple in the bronx four months after they were married , he in a trench coat , she in a broadbrimmed hat , neither , to judge by their smiles , with a care in the world when i was in my 20 s , i thought 30 was ancient , she said i 'd give anything to be 30 years old to have my husband back , you know the good old days not that eleanor ever had it too easy her husband was a handyman , but rheumatoid arthritis that his doctor thought he developed while sleeping in damp foxholes made it impossible for him to work by 1956 eleanor took a job as a file clerk , making 32 a week , and they lived frugally other than a trip to hartford during the war , eleanor has never left new york city she took care of her husband as the disease slowly twisted his fingers and toes , confining him to a wheelchair eventually , he stopped leaving the house , passing the time playing marches on the record player that eleanor would later have to sell but asa also began to receive a generous pension from the veterans administration after eleanor was mugged returning to their bronx apartment in 1974 , the couple moved to flushing , where they felt safer later , when they moved into a fourroom apartment , they could easily afford the 876 monthly rent but after her husband died , she exhausted her savings within five years she had nothing left when a social worker referred her to selfhelp , and she got an apartment in the martin lande home , which houses 340 people 62 and over it is one of four such buildings run by selfhelp for years , the neediest cases has given money to programs like selfhelp this year s neediest appeal ends on feb 28 all contributions go directly to the charities because the times pays for the fund s overhead at the martin lande home , eleanor is the youngest person on her floor , as she proudly points out , and she has made friends she pays 327 a month for her studio apartment since she has moved in , selfhelp has helped her in other ways the organization gave her 500 to help pay for the 32 pills she takes each day for her hernia , ulcer , arthritis , asthma and diabetes selfhelp gave her another 110 to fix her dentures , so she can now eat while wearing them above all , she said , she is grateful for her home , where she can live out her life without the fear of being turned out onto the streets this is the last stop , she said after this , i go join my husband drawing
the new york city ballet s recent diamond project sounded like something of a yawn when it was originally announced by peter martins , the company s artistic director eleven choreographers , including guests who were unknown and company members whose past efforts had been more respectable than distinctive , would create new works for an intensive fiveday series surprise ! it was a great idea new ballets are food for dancers , as was once noted by lincoln kirstein , cofounder of the city ballet with george balanchine , and this menu , it turns out , was clearly well chosen mr martins , who thought up the project and selected the participants , took an obvious risk what the city ballet does not need is more of the mediocre works that were created by secondary inhouse choreographers for past festivals some of the company s staples by balanchine , jerome robbins and mr martins may have derived from these events , but the rest have not survived in large measure , the reason was that bad balanchine was served up slavishly by his imitators this is exactly what the diamond project \( named after its prime patron , the aaron diamond foundation \) did not do rarely have so many premieres in the classical idiom looked so fresh theatrical trappings were avoided , and yet the choreographers went beyond the simplicities of mere music visualization , offering new , even fanciful ideas the selfproclaimed grandiose purpose of the event , which ended last sunday , was to stimulate creativity in classical technique as a whole the event s real success was as a huge workshop among the participants , david allan was a find , miriam mahdaviani and richard tanner , both familiar , made great leaps forward all 11 choreographers handled their material with sophistication , although few could sustain their inventiveness through an entire ballet the hallmark of the project was the choreographers' originality in pattern , imagery and exploitation of classical steps although most of these pieces will be performed throughout the remainder of the city ballet season this month , the focus on 11 premieres in five days was not business as usual there was novelty for the public , stimulation for the dancers , firstclass exposure for the choreographers the youngest company members were brought to the fore ethan steifel , appearing in several premieres , epitomized the dancing s excellence among the choreographers , mr martins was to be taken most seriously despite the fact that his treatment of stravinsky s jeu de cartes went wrong if he failed in some respects , he worked on a level higher than the one on which others succeeded none of mr martins s colleagues matched his treatment of complex material or his invention of detail within the classical vocabulary nonetheless , stravinsky s music , with its constant shifts , is virtually undanceable moreover , mr martins chooses to ignore the playfulness that the score derives from its numerous quotations from other composers opting for puredance abstraction , he discards stravinsky s conceit of an allegorical poker game in which the joker , who can masquerade as any card , goes down to defeat but the choreographer provides a surrogate a ballerina who , like the joker , changes costumes to match the colors of three separate ensembles darci kistler , the ballerina , has three partners albert evans , damian woetzel and nilas martins the dancers in each unit fan out like cards , occasionally standing with one foot to the side and shifting their weight for all the intricacy of the choreography , the three sections have a symmetrical predictability there is a formality that smothers the score s zest structures infused with a creative spirit , on the other hand , marked the project s two gems reunions by mr allan , the artistic director of the riverside ballet theater in california , and images by ms mahdaviani , a corps member in the city ballet ernest bloch s concerto grosso no 1 impelled mr allan s six dancers into dynamic outbursts the suddenness was as sharp as a slap on both cheeks emotionally , the music s range made for choreographic extremes todd williams s melancholy matched the dirge in the score the final fugue was embodied in a thrilling climactic solo by mr stiefel soaring heroically reunions is not intricate , but it is extraordinarily vivid images delights in a different way ms mahdaviani s inspiration was la danse , matisse s painting of nude women moving in a ring circle patterns are dominant in the choreography yet the ballet evokes not only matisse but other artistic achievement selections from debussy \( gigues from images , nuages and fetes \) are used with a lyrical sensitivity to recall nijinsky s faun and his rite of spring ms mahdaviani s female quintet , wearing fleshcolored leotards , is seen against a hilly green horizon five men in bright red spring in for ritual abduction games with the women that are actually classical duets at the end , a lone woman paws the earth images is an apt name for a richly imaginative ballet
happily , there were no telephones , faxes , telexes or computer printouts during the revolutionary and civil war eras otherwise we would n't have the handwritten , penandink documents signed and sometimes sealed by historic figures in american history , documents that give the signatories personality and the modern onlooker a momentary rush of reality this is well illustrated by the making of america highlights from the gilder lehrman collection , an exhibition of 25 rare letters and documents now on view in the rotunda of the pierpont morgan library in manhattan among them are letters by presidents george washington , john adams , thomas jefferson , james madison , john quincy adams , abraham lincoln and ulysses s grant other informative documents bear the signatures of benjamin franklin , john hancock , john jay , alexander hamilton , david g farragut , harriet beecher stowe , julia ward howe and robert e lee at high points in their lives and in the life of the nation the last item on display is a signed copy of president gerald r ford s 1974 pardon of richard m nixon the exhibition is divided into four parts , founding a nation revolution and the new constitution the business of governing the early years of the republic the civil war and abolition , and presidential pardons walking from case to case and reading the scholarly captions that accompany the documents , a visitor can feel closer to the dream of liberty and freedom expressed by the framers , the warriors , the presidents and other statesmen it s possible to envision the way these letter writers struggled to put their goal of a more perfect union into precise and lasting words some issues covered in the documents equal rights , due process , education , the costs of a standing army , election procedures , the conduct of foreign relations echo those of current times the possibility has been raised , for instance , that in a threeway contest involving president george bush , gov bill clinton and ross perot , none would emerge with an electoral majority , throwing the decision into the house of representatives a letter dated dec 23 , 1800 , from alexander hamilton to harrison gray otis , a massachusetts representative , concerns the same issue realizing the likelihood of an electoral college tie between jefferson and aaron burr , hamilton urged his friends in the house to support jefferson because he said he considered burr too ambitious and powerhungry hamilton s letter states my opinion is , after mature reflection , that if jefferson and burr come with equal votes to the house of representatives to support jefferson , the former ought to be preferred by the federalists mr jefferson is yet a lover of liberty mr burr loves nothing but himself in a choice of evils , let them take the least jefferson is in my view less dangerous than burr the electoral vote was jefferson , 73 burr , 73 john adams , 65 after 36 ballots in the house , jefferson won , carrying 10 states against burr s 4 jefferson was declared president , burr vice president burr , who blamed hamilton for his political difficulties , grew increasingly resentful their feud ended violently in 1804 when burr killed hamilton in a duel , reads the caption next to the letter 'the mighty nation' in a page from the first draft of his first inaugural address , written in april 1789 , george washington addressed american defense policy and the militia as to any invasion that might be meditated by foreigners against us on the land , i will only say , that , if the mighty nation with which we lately contended could not bring us under the yoke , no nation on the face of the earth can ever effect it while we shall remain united faithful to ourselves , he wrote a wellorganized militia would constitute a strong defence of course , your most serious attention will be turned to such an establishment when he arrived in new york to take the oath of office , washington decided to scrap the 73page first draft that included such detailed material instead , wrote james thomas flexner , washington s biographer , he perfected an inaugural address so short that when he read it on april 30 , 1789 , it took less than 20 minutes in a revealing letter about his character , dated dec 19 , 1859 , \( between the lincolndouglas debates in 1858 and his nomination and election in 1860 \) , lincoln wrote to samuel galloway , an ohio lawyer , who sought permission to publish the debates after having copies of the debates delivered by his friend george nicolay , a printer and editor , lincoln emphasized impartiality during a time when papers were outspoken partisans of the political parties \( the chicago times favored douglas , the democrat the chicago tribune , lincoln , the republican \) lincoln wrote mr nicolay will furnish you another double set of the joint debates , so that douglas' speeches can be taken from the paper friendly to him and mine from that friendly to me of course i wish the whole to be accurately done but especially let there be no color of complaint that a word , or letter , in douglas' speeches , has been changed one civil war letter , written on june 15 , 1864 , showed lincoln exercising his constitutional role of commander in chief and closely watching the military situation general grant had sent him a plan to surprise general lee by crossing the james river and mounting a rear attack that would lead his forces to richmond lincoln replied have just read your despatch of 1 pm yesterday i begin to see it you will succeed god bless you all blueprint for victory the most colorful manuscript on display was written by farragut , the navy commander , on april 21 , 1862 it shows his battle plan for the union s victory at new orleans the squadron are anchored principally now , on the left shore of the river after we have succeeded in passing the barricade we all keep along attack fort jackson the first division leads , then the 2nd division of ships , is to follow the dotted line , and attack fort st philip , until the gunboats all get past both forts , then the whole fleet are to proceed on their way up in his plan , farragut designated the mississippi as the river and noted the disposition of northern and southern forces his victory was the first step toward control of what lincoln called the father of waters for opening up the mississippi to vicksburg , lincoln appointed him to the newly created rank of rear admiral later , while under fire in the battle of mobile bay , admiral farragut memorably exclaimed , damn the torpedoes ! the exhibition is based on one of the strongest private collections of american historical manuscripts , said charles e pierce jr , director of the pierpont morgan library the 2 , 000piece

washington , april 1 the leaders of seven major industrial nations announced a 24 billion , oneyear program today to help propel russia toward democracy , including a contribution from the united states of nearly 45 billion in announcements in washington and bonn , president bush and chancellor helmut kohl presented the program as a way for the united states and its allies to prevent economic collapse in russia and stop a new authoritarianism from rising from the rubble of the former soviet union the two leaders stressed that russia must follow an approved economic reform program to get the aid , and so must any other former soviet republics that get similar assistance in the future billions for peace , bush says mr bush also said he was going to ask congress to authorize him to funnel as much as 15 billion to international lending institutions for interestbearing loans to the former republics in coming years trying to sell the program to a recessionweary nation , he said he was not asking for new tax dollars this year , and his top aides initially tried to avoid saying precisely how much money the united states was spending no country other than the united states said today how much it would contribute mr bush said americans stood at a moment as important to 20th century history as the end of the two world wars , and had the chance to turn political chaos into lasting peace by adding a few billion dollars to the trillions it cost to wage the cold war the stakes are as high for us now as any that we have faced in this century , mr bush said at a white house news conference this morning our adversary for 45 years , the one nation that posed a worldwide threat to freedom and peace , is now seeking to join the community of free nations he continued if this democratic revolution is defeated , it could plunge us into a world more dangerous in some respects than the dark years of the cold war excerpts , page a11 one step behind , critics say in bonn , mr kohl said , we have agreed to send a decisive signal of political and economic support to president yeltsin and the forces of reform in russia and the other republics the offer is also an incentive to successfully implement this brave reform program , especially in russia a senior german finance ministry official , horst kohler , said at a news conference that american support for the aid program was late , but welcome but mr bush sought to make the case that he had been working for months toward this package , which goes substantially beyond existing united states programs , and he heatedly denied that his announcement was motivated by election politics despite his soaring oratory today , however , mr bush has consistently lagged behind the european allies in responding to the upheaval in eastern europe just two weeks ago , he dismissed criticism along these lines from former president richard m nixon by saying he could not write a blank check for russia response by clinton the timing of his announcement today was clearly intended to create maximum political benefit the white house delayed a presidential address on governmental reform to make room in mr bush s schedule for the aid announcement and he spoke just moments before gov bill clinton , campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination , delivered a major speech on foreign policy in new york like democratic leaders in congress , mr clinton applauded mr bush s announcement but he renewed criticism of mr bush s hesitancy , first to embrace the opposition forces in the soviet union and then to put the full power of the united states and its treasury behind president boris n yeltsin the president has kept america largely on the sidelines in the democratic revolutions that toppled the soviet empire and are transforming the face of world politics , mr clinton said time and again , this administration has sided with stability over democratic change the political aspects were also evident in the care that mr bush , secretary of state james a baker 3d and other top officials took to argue that taxpayers would not have to spend more money to finance the aid for the russians in this election year mr bush himself went so far as to refuse to include any specific amounts in his presentation , and mr baker and treasury secretary nicholas f brady also avoided specifics but the treasury said the united states would contribute 435 billion , all of it from existing , previously authorized or already committed funds of the american share , 1 billion is in loan guarantees that do not involve cash outlays but the rest came originally from taxes , some of it last year , some in previous decades asked how he would explain the aid to americans worried about their jobs , their schools , their crumbling cities and their deteriorating roads and bridges , mr bush replied simply make the case that to do nothing would be irresponsible , that the united states must continue to lead and that we have an enormous stake , a personal stake for every american , in the success of these democracies

fort worth over the last five years , federal , state and city governments have invested nearly 200 million in cash and tax breaks for an airport in the heart of an extraordinary private real estate development spanning more than 17 , 000 acres of land owned by ross perot s family interests here where the chisholm trail once led cattle drives north , and longhorns still graze , lies alliance airport , paid for by taxpayers thanks to the kind of behindthescenes tactics and political favors that mr perot now decries hiring former government officials as consultants and deploying lobbyists to win over politicians whose campaigns he enriched the campaign to win government money for an airport that enhanced his land s value began in 1987 , when mr perot and his son , ross perot jr , asked the federal aviation administration to finance their 25 million proposal for a runway and control tower to be owned by the city outflanked bureaucracy the faa , which had envisioned an airstrip at about a fifth the cost , backed off and concluded that mr perot should compete fairly against other important projects in texas and the nation , government records show instead , the perots outflanked the bureaucracy they turned to representative jim wright , the powerful texas democrat from fort worth who was then speaker of the house after touring the site in a perot helicopter , mr wright returned to washington and in three weeks pushed through a bill that dedicated the money for alliance , calling it essential to the continued economic development of the area last year , mr perot s lawyer , the former texas republican gubernatorial candidate thomas w luce 3d , led the lobbying of the texas legislature that set the stage for a package of tax breaks that could be worth millions of dollars to mr perot s project an examination of the alliance project , including a review of internal faa records , reveals deep reservations that faa analysts had for this project , one of the most expensive new airports of the 1980 s , and provides new details of how the perot family got around this reluctance through close ties to federal and city officials in a broader sense , the airport project shows how mr perot gets things done , often by applying welltimed applications of money and pressure , two timehonored ways of washington in all the controversy over the project , no one has accused the perots of doing anything illegal yet harsh criticism of the influence of lobbyists caricatured by mr perot as these guys with their alligator shoes has become a refrain of mr perot s public appearances , in which he has sought to portray himself as the ultimate outsider who does not play washington s power games when ross perot influences an issue , it is not lobbying , said the acting faa administrator , barry harris , a president bush appointee whose agency has already spent 51 million on alliance when somebody else does it , it is perot has influenced legislators and lobbied as much as anybody else indeed , mr perot , his family , and their business interests have used several lobbyists in texas and washington on the alliance project alone , they employed one of the most prominent lobbyists in texas , as well as two washington firms , bayless , boland , bates madigan , and lipsen , whitten diamond the airport many expect a boom in texas the alliance airport project is the one of the perot family s first big real estate ventures , an attempt to get in on the ground floor of what many believe will be the next boom area in texas the perots bought thousands of acres of fort worth land using some of their windfall from the 1984 sale of the electronic data systems corporation , the computer services company that the senior mr perot sold to the general motors corporation the perots are promoting alliance as the industrial complex of fort worth s future , a stateoftheart development that will revolutionize airports and attract imitators around the country they believe that the airport located on 418 acres the perots donated to the city will lure manufacturers that want to airlift parts and products these companies , attracted by the airport s location in the middle of the united states , will then buy some of the 17 , 000 acres owned by the perots for their plants some will even ship finished goods on the nearby rail lines surrounding this complex will be housing , shopping and schools for thousands of workers all of it , again , built on perot land in a lengthy interview , the younger perot said that he had already sold about 660 houses in the subdivisions the family is developing , and that they were planning thousands more in the 80 , 000 to 90 , 000 price range the key to all the plans is the airport one perot company executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , estimated that tens of millions of dollarsof perot land doubled in value when the airstrip was approved moreover , other tracts of perot land nearby also rose in value , the executive said , by an average of 50 percent
atlanta , feb 29 in theory , the battle for southern voters revolves around the stereotypical white southerner , usually known as bubba , who is partial to country music and conservative politics but as presidential politics move into the states of the confederacy , the biggest question about bubba may not be how he will vote but how to find him because of the importance of black voters , an influx of newcomers to the south , a moderating influence on many whites from growing economic strength and modest electoral participation by workingclass whites , primary voting in the south no longer lives up to the stereotypes the main thing about bubba is that bubba has n't been voting much in the democratic primary or the republican primary , said prof earl black , a political scientist at the university of south carolina to the extent he s been voting , it s mostly been in the general election south takes center stage still , conservative bluecollar whites could be important this year as swing voters who may help decide the course of both the republican and democratic races their votes could be particularly important to patrick j buchanan on the republican side and gov bill clinton of arkansas on the democratic beginning with the primary here in georgia on tuesday and the south carolina primary saturday , the south dominates the political calendar for the next 10 days it culminates with super tuesday on march 10 , when 11 states will vote , including texas , florida , louisiana , mississippi and tennessee in the south , and the border states oklahoma and missouri until the last two decades , only one party primary mattered in the south it was democratic , and largely reflected the conservative tendencies of the region but several factors , including the rising importance of black voters , have changed that professor black s book , the vital south , \( harvard university press , 1992 \) , which he wrote with his brother , merle black , a political science professor at emory university , notes that as late as 1960 there were no black delegates from the south at the democratic national convention in 1968 , blacks made up 10 percent of the southern delegates by 1988 blacks were a third of southern delegates , exceeding their share of the total population and reflecting their importance in the primary electorate stereotype is void polls of voters leaving the polling places after the 1988 presidential primaries in the south indicated how much democratic primary voters now differ from the stereotypical southerner in the states with primaries in the next two weeks , only in tennessee did whites raised in the south account for half of the democratic primary voters in mississippi and alabama , blacks made up almost half the electorate in texas , blacks were 23 percent of the voters and hispanic people accounted for 11 percent only in florida and tennessee did minorities make up less than a third of the electorate , but the dominant group of voters in florida is one of whites raised outside the south , who accounted for 56 percent of the voters the minority vote was inflated somewhat in 1988 , when the rev jesse jackson was in the race , but the basic trends were clear , professor earl black said the democratic vote was dominated by blacks and moderatetoliberal whites widening the electorate on the republican side , party primaries have long been the preserve of the suburban whitecollar conservatives , although professor black says that mr buchanan has the potential to bring out some bluecollar voters the potential is particularly strong in states like georgia , where voters can cast ballots for candidates of either party pat buchanan is the ideal candidate to bring them out , professor black said he s throwing out a lot of red meat louisiana and florida are the only two of the seven southern states holding primaries in the next two weeks that limit voting by party registration but demographic factors , as well as political ones , will determine the electorate in florida , the least typically southern state in the region , blacks are likely to make up about 15 percent to 25 percent of the democratic electorate , with hispanic people probably accounting for another 5 to 10 percent , said george oster , political director of the florida democratic party florida s such as diverse state , he said there is less of a tendency in florida for the automatic vote for the southern candidate than in the rest of the south republicans near parity the growth has made florida , along with south carolina , one of two southern states where the republican party is nearing parity with the democrats in 1988 , 901 , 000 voters turned out for the republican primary in florida and 12 million voted in the democratic one stan smith , spokesman for the florida republican party , said the people moving from other regions are the backbone of the republican primary there are communities that will turn out heavily in this primary that literally did n't exist in the last presidential election , he said presidential primaries have different histories in different states , so it is hard to generalize about turnout
washington , sept 15 as opposing sides intensified their lobbying on a bill to regulate cable television prices and accused each other of deception , a leading house democrat charged today that it would cost consumers heavily and vowed to fight it final votes are scheduled in the house and senate in the coming days , and the bill is virtually assured of passage in both , by wide margins but an alliance between cable television companies and hollywood producers has been trying to generate enough opposition to sustain a veto by president bush since he took office mr bush has vetoed 31 bills , and none of the vetoes have been overridden opposition from a texan the new opposition to the cable regulation bill came from representative jack brooks , democrat of texas and chairman of the house judiciary committee , who charged that the bill would cost consumers billions of dollars mr brooks has long sided with hollywood studios in opposing a provision that would require cable companies to pay royalties to overtheair television stations for the right to carry their signals with electionseason sensitivities running high , supporters and opponents of the measure are cloaking themselves in the garb of consumer advocates mr brooks , a senior house democrat who is frequently an opponent of bigbusiness groups , may provide enough wavering lawmakers with the rationale to change their earlier votes in favor of cable regulation the measure s supporters consider it a major consumer initiative that will attract middleclass voters who are angry about soaring cable television prices and indifferent service , but president bush has long threatened to veto it , arguing that it represents excessive regulation it is going to pass by a very large majority , i think , in the house and senate , house speaker thomas s foley , democrat of washington , predicted today he said he expected the house to vote on thursday the real battles are primarily between cable television operators and overtheair broadcasters the cable industry has been running ads on cable channels charging that the bill is loaded with concessions to special interest groups that will raise prices rather than lower them cable companies have also spawned a flood of mail to congress by stuffing bills to their customers with leaflets charging that the legislation could increase prices by 23 to 51 a year the companies argue that television station owners , for example , will be able to tack on extra fees that will drive up the prices but supporters of the legislation argue that the leaflets distort the truth by attributing their calculations to the commerce department when the data came from the cable industry itself supporters of the bill have called for an investigation of the ads by the federal trade commission station owners fight back meanwhile , the national association of broadcasters has been urging owners of television stations to counter the cable industry by telling their news departments to tell it like it is , generate the news stories and expose the alleged distortion the internal association memo , obtained last week by senator tim wirth , democrat of colorado , prompted several house republicans to demand their own congressional investigation to see whether television stations were violating the terms of the broadcast licenses by serving as their owners' propaganda outlet the reality is probably less dramatic than either side portrays it representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , the bill s sponsor in the house , said today that rates would merely go up less than they would have if there was no legislation he has said that rate regulation is merely an interim measure , and that what is really needed to bring prices down is more competition in the cable industry the bill is intended to address that problem eventually through licensing requirements designed to encourage the development of rival companies the house and senate passed separate but similar versions of the bill by overwhelming margins earlier this year , and a conference committee worked out differences between the two measures last wednesday commission would set guidelines the final version would require the federal communications commission to set guidelines for regulating the price of basic service that consists primarily of retransmitting the signals of local overtheair stations in addition , the fcc would have to establish procedures to resolve complaints of unreasonable prices charged for premium services like home box office or the disney channel mr brooks , along with hollywood producers who have been heavy democratic contributors , are fighting a provision that would allow local television stations to demand that cable companies pay royalties for the right to retransmit their broadcasts currently , cable systems receive an automatic license to do that the hollywood producers are afraid the provision will cut them out of royalties that should be coming to them mr brooks argued that the bill now before the congress would leave the broadcasters free to charge whatever they wanted the limit is the sky , he said , vowing that his goal was now to beat the bill if at all possible

los angeles , april 24 california s insurance commissioner today named the pacific mutual life insurance company as the winner in the bidding for the first capital life insurance company , the junkbondladen insurer that was seized by regulators last year the commissioner , john garamendi , said he had chosen pacific mutual over three other bidders , including shearson lehman brothers , because its offer gives policyholders the best guarantee of security and the highest dollar value for their investment pacific mutual , which is based in newport beach , calif , is one of the largest life insurers on the west coast , with nearly 50 billion in assets the decision came after a threemonth bidding process shearson lehman , which owns 28 percent of first capital life s parent company , the first capital holdings corporation , submitted an initial offer in february all bids were raised pacific mutual and two other bidders , the transamerica life companies and a group consisting of the leucadia national corporation and creditors of first capital holdings , submitted offers earlier this month each of the bidders' offers were increased at least once in the last few weeks mr garamendi s decision is not final , since it is technically a recommendation to the california state court overseeing the conservation of first capital life , which is based in san diego the other bidders could sweeten their bids or challenge mr garamendi s choice before the court , although his recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight none of the losing bidders gave any immediate indication as to what steps they would take at a hearing in california superior court in los angeles on monday the commissioner s announcement is not the definitive word , said james w dederer , executive vice president and general counsel of transamerica this is just one step in the process it s not over until it s over victim of junk bonds mr garamendi seized first capital life nearly a year ago he took over the insurer after it was battered by losses in its junk bond portfolio and by a resulting surge in requests by customers to cash in their policies at the time of first capital life s seizure on may 15 , it had 45 billion in assets , 190 , 000 life insurance policyholders nationwide and 60 , 000 customers holding annuities the selection of pacific mutual was a particular blow to shearson , which had initially seemed to be the leading bidder in addition to being an investor in first capital holdings , shearson sold first capital policies to its brokerage customers shearson s offer had been intended in part as a way to shield its customers from potential losses on its policies as well as to shield itself from lawsuits filed by disgruntled policyholders a spokesman for shearson declined to comment on mr garamendi s choice pacific mutual s bid calls for it to inject 50 million into first capital policyholders will be given the option of cashing out their policies immediately for 90 percent of their value if they choose not to cash in their policies immediately , they will be guaranteed 100 percent of their account values five years from now , including interest of at least 4 percent a year the interest rate could potentially be higher and policyholders could potentially be awarded bonus payments if pacific mutual s profits on its investment exceed a certain rate the spirited bidding for first capital life reflected the rebound in the market for highyield , highrisk junk bonds nearly 40 percent of the insurer s assets had been invested in junk bonds at the time of the seizure mr garamendi said the insurance department has since reduced the junk bonds in the portfolio to 20 percent , and that pacific mutual had said it would reduce the percentage to less than 5 percent in five years
garden city , li , april 3 a distemper virus that swept through the seal population in europe several years ago , killing more than 17 , 000 harbor seals in the north sea , has been linked to an increase in the number of dead and dying seals stranded along the east coast so far there is no proof that the disease has spread widely acute clinical symptoms of the virus have been recorded in eight animals , and the virus was first isolated this week in a harbor seal found stranded on a long island beach all nine seals have died but officials at federal marine fisheries , troubled by the rising number of strandings and concerned that the disease might spread , have issued an advisory recommending that all seals found stranded along the coast be tested for the disease before they are released into the wild in the european outbreak , which killed about 40 percent of the seal population , primarily in the north sea , the disease did not peak until early summer we have no indication yet that it will be a bigger event , said dean m wilkerson , a federal official who coordinates efforts to rescue stranded sea mammals i 'll keep my fingers crossed federal officials said that distemper is not communicable to humans , though it can be transmitted to pets but they urged people to avoid contact with dead or diseased seals , out of a fear that the seals could transmit pinkeye the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has scheduled aircraft surveys to count the seal population and to search for seal carcasses at sea , and a panel of marinemammal experts has been convened to monitor the situation mr wilkerson said stations set up along the coast to rescue stranded sea animals , mainly sea turtles , seals and dolphins , have reported a doubling of the number of stranded seals , mainly on long island and in new england , far fewer than would suggest an epizootic , or animal epidemic , but enough to cause concern on long island , the okeanos ocean research foundation has already picked up about 75 distressed seals since they began migrating southward last fall from november through may last year , the local sealstranding season , 39 seals were counted in the last few days , an average of one seal a day has been found stranded on long island beaches , and volunteers and foundation employees were struggling , using antibiotics and intravenous feedings , to save seven seals held in small tanks in the foundation s converted beach house in hampton bays so far , the survival this year has been close to zero , said samuel s sadove , the foundation s research director the virus , isolated from tissue samples taken from a yearold female harbor seal stranded off long island on feb 25 , was identified as phocine distemper , a virus similar to canine distemper , a lethal virus in dogs , wolves and foxes the seal died four days after it was found distemper is a communicable virus that impairs animal immune systems and generally leads to death the disease has been reported in harbor , hooded and gray seals , which usually range from nova scotia to long island and occasionally as far south as cape hatteras , nc until the latest laboratory findings , the increasing number of deaths detected first on long island and later by a team at the new england aquarium in boston were something of a mammalian mystery even now , mr wilkerson said , it was not yet clear whether the virus was a new event or has been present in the seal population for some time some of the increasing number of deaths , he said , may simply be a result of a growing seal population here and changes in migratory patterns it is possible , he said , that the virus that was so lethal in europe may have mutated into a less harmful form , or that seals here are more resistant to the virus other researchers have theorized that manmade pollution , particularly pcb s , may have contributed to the increasing number of deaths here as well as to the devastating effect of the virus in europe pcb s , or polychlorinated biphenyls , which have been found in some samples of seal blubber , are highly toxic chemicals that have been shown to weaken the immune response in some laboratory animals mr wilkerson said the isolation of the seal virus did not rule out the pcb theory he noted that the federal environmental protection agency is now testing a series of seal tissue samples taken over the last decade or so to measure the level of pcb contamination virus isolated in canada the first signs of the virus appeared in december , when the new england aquarium reported that a blood sample from a seal one of many diagnosed as having influenza contained antibodies to distemper followup tests on samples from 47 animals found 14 with antibodies none of the animals had acute symptoms of the disease on thursday , dr joseph geraci , a veterinary pathologist at the university of guelph , in guelph , ontario , told federal officials that he had isolated the virus in tissue samples from the lungs , lymph nodes and spleen of the female harbor seal found stranded off long island , and that it matched the virus found in the european outbreak the european outbreak was first reported in april 1988 , in the kattegat channel off the danish coast , and spread quickly across the north sea and around the british isles , striking almost all harbor seals in european waters thousands of seals hauled themselves onto beaches and rocks and were found dead on the shore in most areas , the outbreak lasted about two months
the murder of albert einstein by todd gitlin 297 pages farrar , straus giroux 25 in his critically acclaimed book the sixties , todd gitlin recounted the rise and fall of the new left using reminiscences about his role in students for a democratic society in inside prime time and in the anthology watching television \( which he edited \) , he explored the cultural and ideological implications of television now , in his first novel , the murder of albert einstein , he combines those two seemingly unrelated interests , television and radical politics , to produce a lucid if somewhat emotionally attenuated philosophical thriller mr gitlin s heroine and narrator is a diane sawyer knockoff an attractive 40ish broadcaster who works for a television show called in depth that bears more than a passing resemblance to 60 minutes or prime time live margo ross , as she s called , has done stories on everything from designer drugs to arms merchants to oil spills she s just finishing a profile on an aging pop star named billy neill when she receives an urgent message on her answering machine it is a voice from the past , the voice of harry kramer , her onetime mentor and idol , a man she has n't laid eyes on in decades back in the days when margo was working for an underground magazine called eight million stories , harry was celebrated in radical circles as the brilliant author of fix , a novel about an intelligence agency which runs drugs out of vietnam and schemes to assassinate a newly elected liberal president while pinning the plot on a combine of bolivian neonazis and sicilians cheated of their 99year leases on cuban casinos this time , harry claims , he s uncovered a reallife conspiracy he tells margo he s learned that albert einstein did not die a natural death in 1955 he was murdered it seems a friend of harry s has been working in a laboratory where tests are being performed on tissue from einstein s brain the tests reveal that there was enough methamphetamine in his system to kill him forget the usual motives , says harry forget private gain , personal venom , revenge suppose we remember , he adds , that people kill for ideas this is the 20th century , after all then we 've got motives coming out our ears this sweet old guy is a pacifist , he s a socialist , he s a jew , and it s 1955 remember , in the 30 s there were nazi agents trying to kill him margo s instincts as a reporter are immediately engaged she wants to break the einstein story on in depth she and harry start tracking down the people who saw einstein during the last days of his life two primary suspects emerge a colleague at the institute for advanced study named gustav janousek , who is known for his rightwing politics and hawkish views on the bomb and an eccentric if idealistic poet named norman gottehrer , whom einstein befriended toward the end of his life both men , margo and harry speculate , had possible motives janousek could have been enraged by einstein s decision to sign an open letter calling on the great powers to renounce war gottehrer could have been scared that einstein was near completing a unified field theory , a theory that could hypothetically result in some awful new doomsday weapon as margo and harry close in on their suspects , there are menacing developments margo starts receiving threatening phone calls , and her boss , burke gilman , abruptly informs her that higherups at the station have killed her story margo , meanwhile , finds herself falling in love with harry , a development that both alarms her she knows only too well harry s disastrous history with women and fills her with longings to trade in her highpowered career for a family and a home thanks perhaps to mr gitlin s earlier work on inside prime time , the descriptions of margo s television show are funny and well observed , as are the descriptions of margo and harry s radical past there is never the sense that mr gitlin is simply regurgitating old research for all the expository material contained in this book \( concerning everything from nuclear physics to television technology \) , the murder of albert einstein never feels particularly didactic mr gitlin knows how to dramatize his ideas , and he knows how to create a compelling plot what is missing from this novel is a real sense of character and psychology elements that might turn the murder of albert einstein from a cerebral thriller into a fullfledged literary novel with emotional chiaroscuro margo s attraction to harry , her regrets about her life and harry s own feelings about women , political commitments and work none of these issues are really addressed , and the reader consequently cares little about margo or harry s fates or the effects that the einstein story has on their lives no doubt mr gitlin will improve this aspect of his writing in his next novel photo todd gitlin \( ruth rosen \)
kenosha , wis , april 5 in this land of angry dairy farmers , hardbitten union backers and voters who love an underdog , edmund g brown jr would seem to have found the perfect soil for his we the people campaign the former california governor arrived here last month on the night of the michigan primaries with his outrage and union jackets and overtook bill clinton in the polls as the arkansas governor fought off new character questions in new york but a week before the primaries on tuesday in new york and wisconsin , mr clinton pulled himself from new york just long enough to shore up support here he got respected midwestern liberals like senator tom harkin of iowa , many wisconsinites' first choice for the democratic nomination , and senator paul simon of illinois to campaign for him and he has gained in the polls , leading mr brown , 46 percent to 41 percent among voters who say they have made up their minds , in a poll published today in the milwaukee journal the poll , with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points , showed 13 percent undecided it is a very volatile situation here , said jeff neubauer , the wisconsin democratic party chairman neither one of these guys has a majority of voters deeply committed to them indirect attacks the campaign here has been as civil and understated as new york s has been fractious and ugly in their advertisements here neither candidate even tries to score a direct hit mr brown touts his integrity in a notsoveiled suggestion that his opponent has none , while mr clinton says he is the true agent for change in public appearances , there is none of the heckling or jeering that greeted the candidates in new york , only approving crowds who want to see them up close and snap their picture indeed , there is a forgotten stepchild feeling in wisconsin this primary season it has had to make do with sound bites from new york while the issues dear to it , like farm policy , evaporate into the east coast agenda we 've had to spend so much time listening to the noise from new york , mr neubauer said what s going on out there is disgusting and offensive people do n't show up here and scream and yell obscenities and accuse candidates of high treason in the last minute rush to squeeze wisconsin into their schedules , the candidates have scoured for votes on college campuses in madison and kenosha , factories in eau claire , union halls in racine and churches in milwaukee mr clinton has gained ground by attacking the idea of mr brown s flatrate income tax in a state that pioneered the graduated income tax and is skeptical of mr brown s proposal and he has used surrogates to get his message across while representative david r obey , a wisconsin democrat , worked the state s rural north and west , senators harkin and simon campaigned in the cities mr clinton has also oddly benefited from what to wisconsinites seem to be brutish attacks on him i think people have gotten bored with the accusations , said dennis dresang , chairman of political science at the university of wisconsin at madison the message has gotten across that bill clinton should not run for pope on the streets of kenosha s nearly deserted downtown , residents seemed fed up with the campaign , especially the accusations about mr clinton the press has got us confused , said joe torcaso , owner of a shoe repair shop in kenosha instead of talking about what the candidates are going to do , they 're talking about a guy smoking marijuana or a guy skipping class that s got nothing to do with our problems still , wisconsin is the cradle of progressivism , a place where the campaigns of insurgents and outsiders have flourished george wallace did well here in 1968 morris k udall came close to an upset victory over jimmy carter in 1976 and gary hart beat walter f mondale here in 1984 not surprisingly , mr brown has drawn huge crowds of people looking for an antipolitician it s finally sinking in to people that what he says make sense , said ed oertel , a heatingventilation mechanic , who showed up friday at a brown rally in milwaukee but there has been criticism that mr brown is a candidate with no political core and many major unions and the state s leading newspapers to endorse mr clinton over mr brown the choice , the milwaukee journal said today in endorsing mr clinton , boils down to a talented but politically wounded moderate and a new age demagogue the wisconsin state journal , in madison , found neither man acceptable and instead endorsed former senator paul e tsongas of massachusetts just days before the primary , many were seeing wisconsin as a sleeper of a primary that is crucial to mr brown this is the kind of place where brown could do well , should do well and needs to do well , mr neubauer said if he ca n't win here , he ca n't make the case that he could be the party nominee

camouflage uniforms , military vehicles and boxes of canned food that included everything from pork and macaroni to apple sauce , green beans , pears , tomatoes and orange juice less than an hour after the first plane landed early this morning , army trucks and personnel carriers were rumbling through the streets , on their way to the sites where relief centers were being established military kitchens at campbell drive middle school , just off the florida turnpike , an army supply and logistics unit of about 30 soldiers began setting up the first of what will soon be 20 mobile field kitchens here at around 9 30 this morning by early afternoon , after a delay due to a missing generator , the first meals , of ham and stuffing , were ready they were quickly snapped up by about 300 people who had gathered in line by nightfall , the menu had switched to spaghetti and meatballs , and there were four kitchens operating , two in homestead and two in florida city , an adjacent , smaller town that was also devastated each of the field kitchens will be capable of serving 300 hot meals every two hours transportation secretary andrew card , the head of president bush s disaster relief task force , said that military units will soon begin building two tent cities in the homestead area that will provide shelter for at least 2 , 500 people each transport planes unloaded 1 , 250 20person tents , 25 , 000 cots , 50 , 000 blankets , 50 30kilowatt generators and 2 , 500 5gallon water cans local officials have estimated that as many as 250 , 000 people lost their homes in the storm , although many of them have been able to find shelter with friends or relatives years of work lie ahead even with the emergency assistance starting to arrive , rebuilding dade county , whose 2 million people live in miami and about 30 other municipalities , remains a daunting task that will require years of work and investment federal officials raised their estimate today of the damage inflicted on florida by the hurricane to 30 billion the military mobilization was greeted warmly by local officials who only yesterday were angrily accusing the federal government of responding sluggishly to the vast storm damage it looks as though we are going to get the resources we need , finally , kate hale , director of emergency management for dade county , said this morning they clearly understand that we need the help now the most enthusiastic response to the army s arrival came from the 25 , 000 residents of homestead , a vast majority of whom are homeless as a result of the storm it makes us feel better , because we know we are going to have food , said 15yearold maria lluvia resendez , who along with her sister yasmin , 17 years old , and five other teenagers was cleaning up the grounds of a farmworkers' camp just south of homestead air force base this morning we 're not going to starve started too late' that sense of relief , however , was tempered by an awareness of the ordeal that this town s citizens have endured the deadly hurricane that president bush said might be the worst natural disaster in american history it s heartwarming to see them here , greg zawyer , principal of campbell drive middle school , said of the troops but i think they should have been here three or four days ago everything has started too late there are so many homeless people without food , water , ice or gasoline this is a crisis , and it should have been treated as such from the beginning in washington , president bush and two pentagon generals loosed a fusillade

officer , said the help was being sent without regard to the cost , for which the pentagon will be reimbursed by the federal emergency management agency president bush sidestepped questions about whether the mobilization should have come sooner , declaring i am satisfied that we responded properly , and i am very confident that the military have conducted their mission so far with beautiful planning and now excellent execution trained on foreign soil
chepakundi , kenya , may 1 for the first time since independence from britain nearly 30 years ago , fierce ethnic fighting has raised the specter of civil war in kenya , one of africa s most stable and prosperous countries hundreds , if not thousands , of people have been killed since the tribalrelated outbursts began in october the violence has intensified over the last 10 days for the most part , it has involved attacks by armed and wellorganized members of the minority kalenjin president daniel arap moi s tribe , which over his time in power has become the nation s ruling elite against largely defenseless members of bigger ethnic groups in the lush farmlands of the rift valley on thursday , a delegation of church leaders became the latest to blame mr moi s government for a role in the violence many kenyans say they believe that elements in his government have helped organize the fighting , perhaps as a way of showing that multiparty politics , which mr moi agreed to in december only after intense international pressure , would result in bloodshed bodies were still being found today in bushes , under tea plants and in houses after a wave of killings , burnings and terror by kalenjin warriors seeking to root out members of other tribes in the region early in the week some who ventured back to retrieve belongings from their looted homes said today that they had escaped death only by following orders to dump their possessions , lie down on the grass and chant an oath in support of the kalenjindominated government estimates are problematic the roman catholic church , which has been evacuating the wounded and homeless from this remote region , estimated that about 20 , 000 people had been evicted in the last 10 days the number of dead is virtually impossible to estimate with any accuracy , various officials said while the government has said that just over 200 have died since october , western diplomats and church leaders believe that 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 had been killed about 50 , 000 people have been made homeless kenya , a country of more than 25 million , with a mix of cities and towns , rich farmland and barren desert , has been regarded as one of africa s success stories in the 1970 s and 1980 s , in part because of its prowestern outlook and position on the indian ocean , kenya received large infusions of western aid in recent months , though , much assistance has been suspended because of official corruption and suppression of opposition voices concern over the possibility of an ethnically based civil war was expressed this week by the united states embassy , senior clerics and a new opposition party here in chepakundi , a catholic priest said a government truck was overturned by angry , homeless kikuyu tribespeople , and the driver , who happened to be kalenjin , was burned to death kalenjin homes , distinctive for the foothigh ochercolored band painted above their foundations , had been burned in revenge , he said a united states embassy official said what we are looking at here is a civil war based on ethnicity that would be real tragedy for kenya , which has n't had this before and which has so many ethnic groups an african conflict with an ethnic basis was the biafra war that is a possibility here , and we do n't want to see that repeated the fighting to which he referred took place in the secessionist eastern region of nigeria in the late 1960 s in that area , which called itself biafra , the dominant ibo tribe , a relatively prosperous and welleducated people who have been compared to the kikuyu , kenya s biggest and previously dominant group , fought other nigerian ethnic groups over three extraordinarily violent years hundreds of thousands died in the conflict , which took on an international aspect as it evoked support for both sides in other lands 'a cemetery for thousands' the kenyan church delegation that met with president moi on thursday night issued a statement referring to mr moi s political party , the kenya african national union , or kanu unless you change the present policies , the clerics said , kenya will not be kanu , but a cemetery for thousands of its sons and daughters the newly formed democratic party , headed by a kikuyu , former vice president mwai kibaki , warned that kenya could be heading for a catastrophic civil war tension between the kalenjin , one of the country s smaller tribes , and the kikuyu has simmered since mr moi , the nation s vice president , succeeded president jomo kenyatta on his death in 1978 mr , moi s ascent to power essentially meant the end of kikuyu dominance mr kenyatta , independent kenya s founder , was a kikuyu , and under his rule , his people ran the government and prospered the ethnic divisions overlap with political divisions one prominent case is that of oginga odinga , leader of the most prominent opposition party , the forum for the restoration of democracy mr odinga , a major leader in independent kenya s early years , is a luo who served for a time as mr kenyatta s vice president more important , perhaps , is the status of the kikuyu former moi colleagues say he harbors strong fears that they will eventually regain their former dominance according to the theory of some here , officials organized the arming of kalenjin to strike at members of large tribes the kikuyu , the luo and the luyha a usually progovernment magazine , the weekly review , reported that none of the hundreds of people the government said it had arrested in connection with the violence had been charged in court
the other , a more or less new ballet by agnes de mille for american ballet theater , starts out just fine the music is by schubert , as it has been in earlier versions of the work , and consists chiefly of the composer s art songs , although the ballet begins with an impromptu on the piano the last composition , death and the maiden , indicates the work s allegorical theme the new york premiere of the other on friday night at the metropolitan opera house opened with amanda mckerrow , dressed in a rich red cloak and robe , breaking her initial stillness as she raised her arms the gesture has the grandeur of isadora duncan photographed while dancing the marseillaise , and miss de mille , with the eye of a sculptor , has utterly remolded her ballerina s usual stage persona there is none of the delicacy miss mckerrow often projects as one of ballet theater s purest classical dancers instead , she becomes a weighted figure of potent drama dramatically , the maturity embodied in the heroine s draped robe and posture dissolves abruptly as 10 girlish dancers rush in santo loquasto has costumed them in gorgeous red ruffled frocks and bows miss mckerrow , who exits briefly , returns in a tyrolean dirndl affair to relive the maiden s youth like dabs of paint , the ensemble washes across a stage canvas that brightens immediately through the ingenuity of miss de mille s spatial composition skipping steps and chain dances evoke happiness , as does the first song \( to be sung on the water \) peter rowe is the fine vocalist in the pit and william wolfram obliges sensitively as the pianist unfortunately , the beauty and emotional power of these opening images are never matched again the other is the most recent of the choreographer s schubert ballets to deal with a death figure stealing a bride from her lover summer \( 1975 \) , later called death and the maiden \( 1977 \) , was created for the boston ballet a bridegroom called death \( 1978 \) for the joffrey ballet was less abstract but succeeded through its strong ritualistic metaphors for springtime and autumnal withering although drawn in large part from that last work , the other has more set pieces and formulas than conviction surprisingly , the story now looks murky roger van fleteren is the rakish stranger , the other , who takes miss mckerrow , the maiden , from the lover , victor barbee , a local lad among other locals lads in makebelieve lederhosen but a duel along the way also suggests that the death figure is after the lover rather than the maiden helped enormously by jennifer tipton s lighting , which creates an emotional atmosphere for the deadpan dancers , the ballet finally rises above the specific into a more allegorical resonance miss mckerrow accepts her fate , clings to mr van fleteren s back and mr barbee sinks in despair yet the sum is a patchwork of familiar devices flashback , folk steps incorporated into the classical idiom , the usual romantic triangle the stylistic language swings widely , with neoclassical virtuosity \( especially in the duets \) and simplified body language \( cringing , pointing , falling \) used as symbols of an emotional state one admires miss de mille for continually revising her own work yet in stripping down what she may have considered an overblown idea , she has delivered a blownup miniature the company s revival of glen tetley s 1974 treatment of the rite of spring on this program was also problematic the performance featured some of the season s most outstanding dancing in johan renvall s magnificently shaped solos , poured out with as much commitment as energy charles barker s conducting of the stravinsky score , despite some odd pauses , kept the tempo and rhythms up impressively timothy hunter s icecold lighting strikingly created the aura of a merciless killing ground but mr tetley s conceit of a male victim \( rather than the usual sacrificial maiden \) stomped to death in the middle of the ballet and then reborn on trapeze can get lost amid his flying male ensembles and tense female friezes the excitement was there but perfect contour in mr tetley s hybrid idiom , atypically overwrought here , was not mats ek , the director of the cullberg ballet in sweden , makes no pretense of keeping to a dance inspiration he thinks like a stage director rather than a choreographer grass , his recent ballet , \( also on the program \) could be a distilled sillytime counterpart to ingmar bergman s anatomies of marriage a new pair keith roberts , extraordinary in his power and timing , and gabrielle brown , also expressive embodied frustration to the hilt henrietta stern and mr wolfram played the rachmaninoff preludes photo roger van fleteren and amanda mckerrow of american ballet theater in the other , by agnes de mille \( michael shavel for the new york times \)
hollywood , nov 11 studio executives , producers and agents , who overwhelmingly supported presidentelect bill clinton and deplored republican attacks on the town , are developing an array of movies with a trendy theme it s called family values not that hollywood is suddenly rejecting violent or sexually explicit movies or that it is embracing precisely those family values espoused by the gop during the party s nominating convention last summer but there is a new wave of films , having to do far less with politics than profits , that are familyoriented , generally happy or tearful \( or both \) , and rated pg or pg13 several of these films will appear over the thanksgivingchristmas season , and two of them are viewed by exhibitors as the only surefire successes of this important season they are disney s aladdin , which opened today in new york and los angeles and will open in the rest of the country on nov 25 , and home alone 2 lost in new york , opening on nov 20 many more of them will flood into theaters in 1993 the most obvious reason for the plethora of warmhearted movies is the uncertain national economy , which has led studios to look for scripts meant to lure the widest possible audience , meaning families , who need an alternative at the local mall to basic instinct or lethal weapon 3 when it s your children the studios and financiers are very concerned that there s a very big family market to be tapped , and they 're looking aggressively now to get film makers to make this material , said jack rapke , cohead of the motion picture department at the creative artists agency , the largest in town some have also suggested that the growing number of yuppie studio executives who now have children of their own may have something to do with the feelgood flood too when it s your children who are going to see basic instinct , maybe the whole business looks different although hollywood executives are fond of pointing out this latest trend , the phrase family values hardly carries the same meaning here as that expressed by vice president dan quayle , his wife , marilyn , patrick j buchanan and others before and during the republican convention there , it was generally viewed as a phrase that implicity criticized alternative life styles , and was even seen as rebuking working mothers in hollywood , the term translates into far more predictable themes beauty , love and tears to movie executives , a film like beauty and the beast , for example , espouses the notveryprovocative notion that beauty is only skin deep the message of a new mel gibson romance , forever young , rated pg and opening dec 18 , is that love transcends time and age the film has left preview audiences in tears every bit as important as the theme , of course , is the track record relatively inexpensive films like home alone and honey , i shrunk the kids , as well as the more costly beauty and the beast were major hits , in part because children returned several times to see them the lowbudget sister act , which may not exactly have a familyoriented plot \( it s about a zesty night club singer who hides in a convent after she views a gang rubout \) but could be said to espouse family values , was a surprise hit , luring children as well as their parents in recent weeks , a film that has done much better than expected is robert redford s pgrated drama a river runs through it , about two brothers and their father , and their love of fly fishing , which is drawing a big family crowd not automatic moneymakers joe roth , who is leaving as chairman of 20th century fox and setting up an independent production outfit at the disney studios , cautions that family movies are not instant moneymakers , however a number of them have collapsed on their first weekend these include such duds as newsies , a disney musical ferngully , an animated film with an environmental theme , and wild hearts ca n't be broken , a family film about a blind girl who learns to rides horses some of these movies are n't worth a plug nickel , he said the trick is to come up with movies that actually are n't too soft , that play through the spectrum of the family nor is the response to the family film boomlet all positive , especially among some directors and writers who are plainly anxious about the trend and the direction in which hollywood seems to be moving ron shelton , the screenwriter and director of such hits as bull durham and white men ca n't jump , said in an interview it s discouraging studios are going the way of television networks what 'mainstream' really means is the lowest common denominator the reason for this is that television people are now running a lot of the studios you sit with these people and they do n't know what a movie is it s television on a large screen people who used to run studios were different sure , you could n't talk about life experiences because they did n't have any but you could talk in terms of movies you could say , 'i have an idea that s a cross between sunset boulevard' and straw dogs , ' and they 'd know what you 're talking about these people today have never heard of billy wilder or sam peckinpah they do n't know movies ! so many trends' paul mazursky , whose many credits include down and out in beverly hills , and enemies , a love story , is more philosophical with a sigh he said the word 'mainstream' is what i hear a lot will it last \? i doubt it none of these cycles last the mindless pictures just seem to make more money in the 20 years i 've been making movies , there have been so many trends today , it s this one two years from now it 'll be something else but for now , studios seem to be adding to their list of family films , either in development or production , almost daily next year s releases from warner brothers include dennis the menace , which is inspired by the hank ketchum comic strip free willy , about a boy who forms a close relationship with a whale the secret garden , based on the children s classic about an orphan girl who lives with her uncle in a forbidding manor house mr magoo , a liveaction steven spielberg feature about the myopic comic character , and the nutcracker , starring macaulay culkin and the new york city ballet universal s list includes cop and a half , about a detective and an 8yearold boy for love or money , about an ambitious hotel concierge in new york the air up there , with kevin bacon as a basketball coach who goes to africa to find a player , and jurassic park , a superexpensive spielberg extravaganza about dinosaurs from columbia and disney columbia s list includes groundhog day , about a selfish television weatherman with one day to live amos and andrew , a satire about race calendar girl , about a group of teenagers in 1962 who want to meet marilyn monroe josh and sam , a fantasy adventure , and i 'll do anything , a musical written and directed by james l brooks as might be expected , the disney list is considerable , with such classics as the adventures of huck finn and the three musketeers , as well as a bette midler comedy about witches , called hocus pocus the number of these family films is unusual , said rick nicita , cohead of creative artists' motion picture department but i do n't think studios have created a mandate that says , 'let s make family films' with rising costs , they want to appeal to the broadest possible audience the higher the rating , the fewer people are excluded it s really economic rather than conceptual dollars and cents a desirable grated film has got to make more money than a desirable nc17
tarrytown the patient is sick and the prognosis for a quick recovery is not good that was the assessment of the economic health of the new york city region that rosemary scanlon , the chief economist for the port authority of new york and new jersey , gave to 125 westchester business leaders at the seventh yearly fall economic symposium late last month at the westchester marriott hotel here on the regional level , this is the strongest , deepest recession we have experienced since world war ii of two years and three months' duration in westchester , ms scanlon said to date , 700 , 000 jobs have been lost in the metropolitan area the only section of the country that is worse off than we are is new england what s more , ms scanlon continued , the plight of the region has been aggravated by unrealized expectations we were expecting to see signs of recovery in 1992 , but it has n't happened , she said we are exactly at the same point as we were a year ago and there has been no lift at the national level to help even though interest rates are low , the money supply is slow , and there have been no salestax revenue gains in our area , which shows that retail sales have n't picked up either more capital programs urged in order to see the economy rebound from the long , painful , dangerous recession , she said , not only is more lift from the national economy needed but state and local governments also have to move on capital programs and get started on publicworks projects on the positive side , we 're seeing the beginning of a turnaround on wall street , she said corporate profits are staying up , which gives a boost to lending in leading industries and should account for some employment gains low interest rates and the dollar exchange rates are good for longterm business investments , but manhattan has to turn around first , then westchester will benefit from the spillover in activity saying that there is more vacant office space in the region than anywhere else in the country , ms scanlon added maybe we should think now how to use space differently we should also be asking ourselves if we have enough support systems such as infrastructure and housing for the amount of office space we have the answer is , no , we do n't , which means that we should be investing heavily right now in public works such as transportation systems the symposium , sponsored by the westchester county association and the westchester county bankers association , was cosponsored by the westchester business partnership and the westchester chapter of the new york state society of certified public accountants four executives on panel westchester s role in the regional and global economies was examined by a panel of executives from four westchester companies paul e konney , senior vice president of tamprands , the newest fortune 500 company in the county , described the tampon manufacturer s move to white plains from long island the headquarters office lease for the former ams building was the largest in 1990 , he said the key to our move was accessibility to new york city we were also attracted by the hospitable business environment in westchester and the real estate stock here , also the transportation system , which is better than long island s although tamprands is national in scope , with 45 percent of sales outside the united states , mr konney said that the company employs 150 people in westchester and has brought substantial new tax revenues into the county frank j fee 3d , the third member of his family to head his family s business , the reliable automatic sprinkler company in mount vernon , said the company is one of the few in westchester that still makes products mr fee noted that the manufacturing base in westchester has steadily deteriorated 'our strength lies in mount vernon' we have been in mount vernon since 1937 , mr fee said , and we employ 499 people there , 250 of them as hourly workers our strength lies in mount vernon where we have access to a labor force that ca n't be duplicated anywhere else in the county for the 75 years our company has been in business , one immigrant group of workers has replaced another on the factory floor nynex , with 6 , 500 employees , is one of the largest employers in the region , said jeffrey s rubin , nynex chief financial officer , another panel member some new jobs have opened up in parts of nynex s operations , mr rubin said , adding that employment opportunities there would remain flat for both the near and the far term although the panelists were not optimistic about the prospect for economic recovery soon , none were as pessimistic as former lieut gov alfred b delbello in decrying the practice of wooing companies from other areas and inducing local companies to remain in westchester as a solution to economic problems , mr delbello said , what we 're doing is cannibalizing ourselves a more effective method , he said , would be for leaders in the new york , new jersey and connecticut area to work together for economic development for the entire region on such projects as airport planning , cleanup of long island sound , transportation systems and waste disposal mr delbello also suggested that westchester join with long island and new york city to demand state assistance programs for service industries smallbusiness loans endorsed we must make ourselves a political force , he said all the state incentive programs are geared to manufacturing in other areas of the state we have a servicebased economy in westchester , and we need help if we 're going to keep business in the county , we need programs for service industries citing erie county , mr delbello said , they are doing good up there , thanks to the dollars the state of new york has poured in to keep their manufacturing base from eroding when asked how banks could aid the economy s recovery , derrick d cephas , the state superintendent of banking , acknowledged that recovery efforts would be speeded up if banks made more business loans to small businesses we believe there is a shortage in the availability of smallbusiness loans , mr cephas said there are several reasons for it the loans tend to be costly to originate , costly to administer and inherently risky but we believe a consortium of banks sharing the risk , capitalized by the banks and professionally staffed and managed could engage in smallbusiness lending on behalf of member banks and would substantially increase the availability of credit to small businesses and this is something we are working on now photo alfred delbello speaking at the fall economic symposium \( alan zale for the new york times \)
the nation s purchasing managers said yesterday that the overall economy expanded sharply in february , pushed by surges in both production and the level of new orders it was the first time since november that the purchasing managers' index of economic activity showed the economy was expanding the national association of purchasing management s index climbed to 524 percent , from 474 percent in january the fivepercentagepoint gain was the largest since a similar increase in june 1991 and ended a string of monthtomonth declines stretching back to october , when the index fell 11 percentage points , to 532 percent the monthly index is compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers representing a wide range of industrial companies and is the first significant indicator of the previous month s activity a reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting , while a reading above 50 percent indicates expansion the purchasing managers' report came as the commerce department announced that construction spending rose 13 percent in january , to its highest level in nine months but those optimistic signs for the economy contrasted with other economic news yesterday the government also reported that consumer spending posted its smallest rise in three months , while personal income registered its first drop since november the prices of treasury securities fell sharply yesterday , as the unexpectedly strong results reported by the purchasing managers surprised the credit markets page d19 several economists interviewed yesterday said the purchasing managers' report demonstrated that the economy was beginning to pick up steam , but none would predict that a quick or bold recovery was imminent they noted , however , that the weaker economic figures released by the government reflected activity in january and were therefore consistent with the purchasing managers' lackluster reading for that month the numbers suggest that manufacturing activity firmed up quite well in february , said edward e yardeni , chief economist with c j lawrence inc it is clear that lots more purchasing managers saw a modest improvement than was the case in january mr yardeni attributed the improvement in part to stronger activity on the part of the automobile industry , which had a bleak month in january but saw sales gain through the first three weeks of february the auto industry hit a low in january , and there was some improvement from that low level in february , mr yardeni said and that had a positive effect on manufacturing activity the level of new orders for everything from hydraulic pumps and photographic film to polyester coatings and lumber rose sharply , according to the purchasing managers their index of new orders rose to 575 percent , from 503 in january the association said the rebound in new orders in february strongly suggests continued growth in the economy for at least the immediate future the largest gain , however , came in the association s production index , which climbed to 586 percent , from 506 percent in january it was the highest reading since october , when the production index stood at 603 percent because of the gains in new orders , the association said , production was likely to continue growing this month after stabilizing in january , the economy regained most of the momentum it began losing in october , said robert j bretz , chairman of the association s survey committee and director of corporate purchasing for pitney bowes inc the growth in production was vigorous enough to significantly slow the decline in manufacturing employment , and the robust growth in new orders suggests the economy will enter and exit march unlike the proverbial lion
seeking a compromise in a debate that has pitted the mayor against much of the police force , council speaker peter f vallone is proposing to give the police union some influence in the makeup of an allcivilian review board to investigate police misconduct , lawmakers said yesterday because the speaker controls the majority of the 51 votes in the council , his bill has a better chance of success than any other mr vallone would not discuss the details of his proposal yesterday , but he said that he had come to the conclusion that police expertise is absolutely essential in order for the board to have credibility a bitter debate the speaker has been trying to calm the bitter and racially divisive debate that erupted around the issue last week when thousands of officers swarmed in front of city hall to protest mayor david n dinkins s proposed legislation on the review board mr dinkins s bill would establish an allcivilian agency that would be independent of the police department and would have subpoena powers the 13 members of that board would be appointed by the mayor with the consent of the council the unruly demonstration last wednesday by the police union has overshadowed that proposal , sparking a racially charged , threeway fight among the mayor the union president , phil caruso , and rudolph w giuliani , who is expected to try to oppose mr dinkins in the next election newspapers subpoenaed the manhattan district attorney s office said yesterday that it had subpoenaed news photographs taken at the demonstration the new york times , the daily news and the new york post said they had received subpoenas new york newsday said it was not aware of one while the daily news said it had referred the matter to its lawyers , the times and the post said they planned to turn over only what had been published it would be wholly inappropriate for us to share with the government any unpublished materials , said nancy nielsen , a spokeswoman for the times two efforts to make peace between the dinkins administration and the police on the issue of the review board fell apart yesterday as both the mayor and mr caruso refused to apologize in one effort , the heads of the new york civil liberties union and the new york civil rights coalition sought a meeting between mr dinkins , mr caruso and mr giuliani in the other , police union officials said john cardinal o'connor and the developer lew rudin had sought a meeting with mr caruso the archdiocese declined to comment on the union s report the political fallout from the demonstration has also affected the search for a new police commissioner , city officials said mr dinkins has asked his search committee to conduct a second round of interviews with the four finalists for the job the new interviews are aimed at finding out how the candidates would have handled the demonstration and how they would address problems of morale , discipline and racial antagonisms in the police department mr vallone s proposal for the review board was labeled unacceptable by the mayor yesterday the police unions should n't be able to pick any of them , mayor dinkins said in san juan , puerto rico , where he was traveling with nydia m velazquez , who last week won the primary for the 12th congressional district why should they \? that s ridiculous mr caruso did not react immediately to the plan , saying through a spokesman , joseph mancini , that he needed more time to study it mr vallone s proposal adopts much of the mayor s bill , marking a significant change in the speaker s position before the demonstration , mr vallone had insisted that the current 12member board , which is part of the police department , could work but the political momentum for a change has built in the wake of the demonstration , the speaker said several staff members and lawmakers said that his proposal consists of a 13member board , with 5 members appointed by the mayor , 5 by the council and 3 appointed by the police commissioner from a list of names provided by the patrolmen s benevolent association and three other police unions none of the members of the board could currently be working for the department , but they could be former officers or department officials as with the mayor s proposal , the board would be a separate agency with a civilian staff and subpoena power the proposal was given to the heads of the borough delegations , who are sounding out members the bill could change significantly before the speaker introduces it sometime next week supporters of the mayor s bill also reacted coolly to the speaker s plan councilwoman ronnie m eldridge of manhattan , a sponsor of the mayor s bill , said , i do n't think we would ever accept police unions' nominating members to the board
squeaky , wobbly stairs are irritating if allowed to deteriorate , they can sometimes become a safety hazard most stair problems are easy to repair in their early stages but because the construction of stairs generally is complex , major problems are often best handled by an experienced carpenter to fix squeaks , their sources have to be found remove carpet or other covering from the stairs have a helper step on each tread while listening for noise if there is a noise , have the helper rock back and forth on the stair while examining it closely for loose parts rubbing together that is what causes squeaks minor squeaks can sometimes be temporarily silenced by applying powdered graphite , silicone lubricant or talcum powder for a permanent cure stair parts have to be strengthened so that they do not move when possible , repair stairs from underneath instead of from above the results will be less noticeable and usually stronger admittedly , deciding whether to remove wallboard or other material from beneath a staircase to repair it is difficult but if more than a third of the treads squeak loudly or are very loose and if the material covering the underside of the stairs is relatively easy to remove and replace , removing the material is usually worthwhile underneath the stairs , look first for wedges supporting the ends of the treads and risers the risers are the vertical boards that link the treads not all staircases have wedges if they are present , tightening them will often cure the squeaks to tighten wedges , strike them with a hammer on some stairs , the vertical wedges behind the risers and the horizontal wedges beneath the treads are equally accessible on others , the horizontal wedges overlap the bottoms of the vertical ones and have to be removed before the vertical wedges can be tightened do not overtighten wedges that can force the treads and risers apart , causing new squeaks after tightening , if the procedure seems to work , use the stairs for a week or two before reinstalling the wallboard or paneling if the squeaks return , one or more of the wedges has loosened find the loose wedges and coat each with woodworking glue then reinstall them many risers and treads rest on notches cut in the tops of the stringers , the long , slanting boards that support the staircase driving wood shims into the seams between the stair parts and the stringers will usually cure looseness the best shims to use are woodshingle scraps it is also common to find wood blocks fastened where the treads and risers meet if any blocks are loose , knock them off completely with a hammer then sand them smooth and reglue them to fasten , rub the freshly glued block back and forth against the surfaces to which it has to adhere it will soon stick by itself , without the aid of clamps avoid standing on the stair until the glue dries , in about 12 hours you can also supplement the glue blocks beneath the stairs or add them beneath stair joints that have none often better than glue blocks , particularly if the stairs are warped and gaps exist between the treads and risers , is to fill the seams with construction adhesive it is sold in cartridges and is applied with a caulking gun cut the tip off the cartridge , creating just a hole nor larger than a quarterinch in diameter then , with the gun , force adhesive between the pieces , as well as along the seam where they join stay off the stairs until the adhesive hardens construction adhesive not only glues loose parts together , but , when properly applied , it also prevents parts from rubbing together despite repair if the base of a riser rubs against the rear edge of the tread below , install screws through the riser and into the tread to fasten the pieces securely use screws at least two inches long drill pilot holes for them first , to avoid splitting the wood if repairs from underneath the stairs are not possible , you will have to do so from above instead of tightening wedges to add support beneath the ends of treads and risers , install screws or spriralshank flooring nails through them into the stringers when boring pilot holes for screws , use a profile bit that matches the screw size they widen the entrance to the screw hole , so that the head of the screw can be sunk below the surface and the hole can then filled with putty or a wooden plug when using nails they are easier to hide than screws drive a pair angled toward each other into the squeaky spot drill pilot holes for them first , using an ordinary straightdrill bit slightly smaller in diameter than the nails drive the nail heads below the surface with a nail set , and then fill the depressions with wood putty to remedy a squeak along the seam where a tread and riser meet , try driving shims vertically into the joint between the two pieces at the front of the tread apply glue to the tip of the shim when dry , trim the shim against the underside of the tread with a utility knife so that it does not show a problem that may begin as a squeak is a crack in the nosing , the part of the tread that projects beyond the front of the riser cracked nosings are unsightly and unsafe replacing the tread , a major task , is usually required if the nosing breaks off to repair a cracked nosing , gently spread the crack and work glue into it by flexing the loose piece or by using a playing card or a finger as an applicator if using a finger , beware of splinters squeeze the crack together until an even line of excess glue oozes from the seam then drill holes and drive nails at angles into the edge of the nosing to hold the repair together wipe away excess glue with a damp cloth diagrams
sekret kukaj s epitaph is emblazoned on a sprawling mural covering an entire wall , with rest in peace written flamboyantly on one side and a bloodred albanian flag flanking the other by themselves , the words and images speak to ethnic pride and perhaps hint at the nation s struggle against communism but sekret died at the age of 15 this wall is not in eastern europe , but in the central bronx and its message for some is as much a declaration of turf as a tribute to a fallen friend avoiding hangouts sekret s memorial on the corner of lydig and barnes avenues also bears the name of the albanian boys , a group that until two recent bias attacks on bronx schoolchildren held no significance for most new yorkers in both attacks , the police said , the assailants said they were members of the albanian boys inc or the albanian bad boys , looseknit groups of teenagers who often gathered by the mural or at a pizzeria in the williamsbridge neighborhood to the north these days , the spraypainted signature on the mural is perhaps the only sign of the group s existence , since the youths have avoided their favorite haunts perhaps in hopes of evading the police the police have increased patrols around schools and streets and sent sound trucks cruising through busy commercial strips urging witnesses to step forward so far none has done so , and without any arrests , the role of the albanian boys remains unclear local teenagers , police officers and neighborbood residents describe the groups as comprising perhaps several dozen youths mostly under 18 who hang out in their nooks of the bronx , sometimes raising cain and eagerly taking on all they perceive as interlopers among the city s neighborhoods , where territory and race are often intertwined , it can be difficult to sort out just which broken rule triggers a confrontation the albanian boys protect their neighborhood from like getting taken over by blacks and hispanics , said joe capalbi , a 15yearold 10th grader at columbus high school they usually just walk around with their friends 'not a representation' the police said that until the two recent bias attacks , the group s name had not been linked to such incidents they 're not a representation of the albanian community they 're just a bunch of knuckleheads who hang out in the neighborhood , said detective sgt frank viggiano , of the 49 precinct detective squad , adding that there are several groups of friends who have adopted variations on the albanian name , just like other groups that take on distinctive names all groups of kids give themselves different names the attacks changed that this is not neighborhood stuff , he said this was a small kid and that is totally out of the question this was a kid who was a deliberate victim mark shabanaj cringed when he heard of the second bias attack and how the assailants warned their victim , a schoolboy , not to mess with the albanian bad boys until a year and a half ago , the 20yearold said he and his brother hung out with the albanian boys by the mural to sekret , whom he knew he did not remember how he died mark shabanaj joined when he was 15 , and said the group was not so much a gang as a group of young people sharing neighborhood and family ties , and a desire to earn a reputation a lot of the kids liked to fight to make a name for themselves , he said we used to get into fights with anybody it was n't a prejudice thing it was anybody he said he and his friends got into trouble like other kids , but that sometimes things got out of hand once , police caught him in a cadillac that one of his friends stole when the driver left the keys in the ignition he was put on probation , but he later spent a week in jail for smashing a bus window after the driver ejected him for fighting with a passenger who jostled him that was enough to make him decide to leave the group he wondered if perhaps the youths who took his place on the street corner got the wrong message they heard about what we used to do and they want to be like us , he said i can say in a way it s my fault for doing what i used to do sure , he said , there were plenty of fights , but race was not a factor a typical path one police officer in the area remembered first encountering some of the albanian boys six years ago when he walked a beat he said many teenagers of whatever stripe have followed mr shabanaj s path from worrying about street corner turf to figuring out how to pay the rent and get on with life younger ones have followed their brothers are out there now , the officer said , speaking on condition of anonymity the ones who are out there now were little pipsqueaks when i first saw them they 're feeling their oats and at that age , nobody can tell them what to do malik , who works in the candy store by the mural , said that when he painted it over , the youths repainted it and warned him not to whitewash it since then , he said , some of the youths have stolen candy and sodas from the store they think they 're big shots , he said they 're punks several police officers noted that some of the cliques predominated by albanian youths also include some black , hispanic and other white teenagers as well , often friends they met in elementary school albanian immigration to this country began with political refugees during the 1960 s , followed by a second wave from kosovo , a province in yugoslavia in the early 70 s estimates of their numbers in the new york city region range from 75 , 000 to 150 , 000 , with about a fifth of those in the bronx many of them started in bluecollar jobs , with a sizable number attaining success in residential real estate and small businesses the albanians in the neighborhood stress that the police have yet to arrest anyone and prove the assailants were indeed albanian many are aghast at the bias attacks , but are also wary that their community will be sullied by the vicious actions of a handful of youths talk of the attacks has dominated many of the conversations the rev rock mirdita has had with his parishioners at our lady of shkodra , the only albanian catholic church in the region last sunday , he condemned the attacks from the pulpit and last night he convened gathering of cleancut young people from the area , urging them to show their community s true colors many scoffed at the notion of the albanian boys , saying that they never heard of any such group but they complained that since the attacks , they have been stopped and questioned by the police not everybody is guilty , said christina lekocaj , 13 those who did , should get jail father mirdita said the attacks went against tradition nobody would expect that being peaceful people and coming from a country where they were

dallas , oct 26 while saying he wanted to put the issue behind him , ross perot kept alive his story of republican campaign skulduggery today , and the white house spokesman suggested the independent candidate was paranoid other presidential aides later tried to soften that tone in a surprise appearance at a press briefing that was being conducted by some of his aides , mr perot first said he accepted the denials from the bush camp of a plot to embarrass his daughter but he then suggested that he did not believe the denials , since they had not been made until he had disclosed his suspicions in a television interview mr perot said on the cbs news program 60 minutes on sunday that he had dropped out of the presidential race in july because he had been informed of a republican plan to smear his daughter carolyn with a doctored photograph depicting her in a lewd manner , and to disrupt her aug 23 wedding 'would n't you respond \? he said today that on two occasions before he reentered the race he had discussed the matter with bush aides , including james a baker 3d , the white house chief of staff , and that no one had issued a denial until the day of the 60 minutes broadcast let s assume that somebody that you knew well , accused you i never accused anybody , i just said i was told this would happen of something this bizarre , mr perot said today would n't you respond \? would n't you , particularly if you wanted the millions of people who support that man to support you would n't you at least go back and say , we 've looked into this we did n't do it we do n't know anybody who did \? mr perot s comments prompted a tart rejoinder from marlin fitzwater , the president s press secretary it s so crazy that he seems to have latched onto this theory , much like other people latch onto ufo theories , and he seems to believe it , said mr fitzwater , with the president s campaign in denver 'delusions' are suggested i think the news media needs to take a look at this because they 're the only ones left who can investigate it and prevent us from electing a paranoid person who has delusions , mr fitzwater added this man simply cannot see the truth other republican officials sought to soften some of mr fitzwater s remarks not long after they had been made asked by reporters later in the day if he thought mr perot was paranoid , mr baker said , not in my view , no but he added , when someone makes this kind of charge , they ought to provide some little scintilla of evidence mr baker also disputed mr perot s account , saying that a number of top republicans , including barbara bush , had spoken with mr perot and had told him the dirtytricks reports were untrue about 25 minutes into press briefing by his aides , mr perot appeared , he said , to set the record straight he told reporters i watched the early part of this on cnn let s get a few things straight he then began a lengthy , often testy , explanation of events that came to light from the interview he gave on 60 minutes meanwhile , top advisers to gov bill clinton , quietly gleeful , stayed carefully above the fray never interrupt your opponent when he s making a fool of himself , said paul begala , a senior clinton strategist gaining in the polls mr perot s accusations came at a time when public opinion polls were showing that his strong performance in the presidential debates and his heavy advertising on television and radio had produced gains for him with the voters but the new accusations have once again allowed his critics to portray the texan as someone who shoots from the hip on the slimmest of evidence and they are pointing out that the reasons he gave on 60 minutes for dropping out of the race are not the reasons he gave when he announced his decision on july 16 at that time , mr perot said he was dropping out because the democratic party had been rejuvenated and because he did not want to throw the election into the house of representatives and perhaps contribute to a constitutional crisis since mr perot reentered the race on oct 1 , the bush campaign has been careful about criticizing him , fearing that attacking the dallas businessman would alienate his supporters and realizing that mr perot was drawing votes away from mr clinton but mr fitzwater said today that the republicans had decided to become more aggressive about mr perot because they feared voters were beginning to believe his accusations , even though they had been greeted with skepticism by news reporters the press saw it that way , but i'm not sure america did , mr fitzwater said of doubts about mr perot s accusations baker tells of denials mr baker said mr perot had been given direct denials of any plot against his daughter marlin fitzwater , bob teeter , barbara bush and george bush have all said there is nothing to this , mr baker told reporters at a bush campaign stop today george bush told you last night , and barbara bush told perot and margot perot at the debates when they were up there on the stage there was nothing to this mr perot is about to begin broadcasting a new set of nine 60second and 30second television commercials , as well as the new 30minute paid program he broadcast tonight in that presentation , on abc , mr perot spent little time discussing his proposals for the nation s economy , instead providing what was in essence a seminar on how to create and build a small business producers of the cbs program said today they had investigated the reports and had been unable to substantiate them don hewitt , executive prodcuer of 60 minutes , said he doubted if the accusations would have been put on the air if mr perot had not discussed them in an interview conducted he had last week with the 60 minutes correspondent , leslie stahl as he has done often throughout his campaign , mr perot today angrily accused reporters of distortions that make him look bad he singled out morton dean of abc news for a report last week that raised doubts about mr perot s story that five armed black panthers had been discovered crossing the lawn of his north dallas home in the early 1970 s bent on doing him or his family harm mr perot has said that the gunmen were chased away by a guard dog mr perot said he had told mr dean that a number of people , including his son ross jr , could verify the story the younger perot , who was a boy at the time of the incident , told reporters in the briefing today that he had not actually seen the terrorists , but had been told about them by his father officials of the dallas police and the federal bureau of investigation said they had no report in their records of any such incident the police did say that mr perot has often notified them of minor incidents occurred outside his home when a reporter asked why the press could not talk to the security guard who had spotted the attackers , mr perot snapped because it s none of your business it has nothing to do with the campaign but harold birkhead , a retired marine who was one of mr perot s security guards at the time , said in a telephone interview today that the incident never occurred he said mr perot did not have guard dogs on his property at that time this is just a figment of his imagination , mr birkhead said photos reporters surrounded james a baker 3d , chief of staff , on a denver street yesterday while torie clarke , a bush campaign aide , stood by \( jose r lopez the new york times \) ross perot at a briefing in dallas , where he continued his charges of republican dirty

first licks on dessert the comedian alan king , who lives nearby , loves them restaurant critics have praised them unanimously they are the desserts at the commonly owned navona in great neck and il tulipano in huntington but none of the cascade of desserts offered at the two restaurants are made by their talented chefs they are all created by the people escorting diners to their tables georgio meriggi , pasquale cervera and antonio d'arcarngelo , the partners , who own the two eating places and act as hosts , also serve as their bakers and dessert makers each morning about 9 30 , the three restaurateurs busy themselves for two or three hours making eight desserts for each of the two restaurants the three men started working in european restaurants in their early teens they had already absorbed a lot of baking and cooking experience when they met dieter schoener , a legendary pastry chef , who made his mark at le cirque in manhattan mr schoener , who also worked at chantilly in new york and now owns dieter s pastry shop in washington , became their friend and teacher while his influence is apparent in navona and il tulipano desserts like napoleons and fruit tarts , other dishes come from the accumulated personal and professional lives of the restaurateurs mr meriggi was given the recipe for the moist chocolate cake served at the two restaurants by a famous swiss hotel chef with whom he had worked , and mr cervera s sister contributed an italian family recipe for tiramisu other desserts often found on their menus include creme brulee , cheesecake , chocolatecovered strawberries and towering , featherlight chocolate and raspberry soufflees among the seasonal specialties is an autumn chestnut cake made with fresh chestnuts the poachedpear dish served in the winter is changed to poached peach in the summer mr d'arcarngelo makes the restaurant s italian biscuits three times a week mountains of the biscotti , or twicebaked biscuits , perfect for dipping into coffee or dessert wine , are served daily at navona and il tulipano many italian restaurants offer biscotti , but relatively few bake these intensely crunchy cookielike creations themselves nor do any but a handful of dedicated pastry chefs have their own icecream machines , like the one at navona , from a famous milan gelato maker the efforts of the three partners result in an abundance of sweets unknown at restaurants that buy their desserts or pay others to make them we can be generous , mr meriggi said our only expense is for ingredients we give away all our leftovers to our dishwashers and

sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , aug 2 after two orphans were killed in a sniper attack on a bus bound for germany on saturday night , the surviving young refugees resumed their journey today and immediately fell afoul of the ethnic cleansing policies of the serbian nationalists besieging this city the children , many of them infants and all younger than 4 years old , were secured to the bench seats of an old intercity bus with torn sheets when automatic rifle fire burst out at dusk as the bus traveled a stretch known to sarajevans as sniper alley the shock of the fusillades that killed a 14monthold boy and a mentally handicapped girl who was nearly 3 years old had hardly sunk in before serbian officials added to the misery by halting the bus this morning and dividing the children by ethnic group nine of the 48 survivors were prevented from traveling on after their names were identified as being serbian , according to vera zoric , the director of the ljubica ivezic orphanage , from which the children had departed at a loss for words is there anything to say \? said mrs zoric , a 51yearold psychologist we have used up all the words there are to describe the savagery and inhumanity to which we have been subjected these are people who have attacked a maternity hospital full of newborn babies , and fired on ambulances , and used snipers to kill mothers with babies in their arms , so why should anything like this surprise us \? since early april , serbian nationalists have used a policy they call ethnic cleansing to drive muslims and croats from wide areas of this newly independent country with the orphans , the policy was effectively turned around children that serbian officials deemed to be serbs were forced to stay in the suburb of ilidza , an area controlled by serbs people here said they saw the incident as proof of the extremes to which serbian nationalists will go to destroy a society in which serbs , muslims and croats have lived sidebyside for generations , mostly in relative harmony when dusk fell tonight , supervisors at the ljubica ivezic orphanage , in an old convent building high on a sarajevo hillside , said they had no knowledge of what had become of the children who had been identified as serbs the other children , who slept saturday night on the floor of a restaurant near the site of the attack , spent the second night of their journey in a hotel in fojnica , a croatianheld town about 35 miles west of here none of the children on the bus were orphaned as a result of the war the entire incident seemed to capture the desperation that increasingly characterizes sarajevo by tonight , those involved in the evacuation of the children and those who had somehow failed to involve themselves were seeking to avoid blame the orphanage director , mrs zoric , who said she had agreed to allow the children to leave despite strong apprehensions about the dangers , struggled for words as she watched the evening news , which showed pictures of the two dead children , roki sulejmanovic , a muslim boy , and vedrana glavas , a croatian girl , lying on a steeltopped table in a bosnian government health clinic a doctor said that the boy had died instantly of a bullet wound to the head , and the girl had died at the clinic of a bullet wound to her chest according to accounts pieced together from interviews with mrs zoric , paramilitary policemen who went to the children s rescue , and doctors , the sniper fire erupted about 10 minutes after the bus set out from the orphanage in the district of bjelave it was headed westward toward a point where the serbian siege lines are interrupted by a croatianheld district , stup , which has been used frequently by humanitarian organizations as a corridor out of the city the whitepainted bus was not marked in any way to indicate its mission as the bus neared stup , automatic rifle fire struck it from a serbianheld district near the sarajevo airport zoran bosnjak , 21 , a croatian policeman , said the driver told him that the snipers fired first at the tires , causing the bus to stop , then fired through the windows at the children , many of whom were so small that they were hardly visible whether the snipers were aware of their target is not known , but many snipers are equipped with highpowered rifles with telescopic sights 'completely terrified' mr bosnjak said a croatian militia unit allied to the bosnian forces took the children to stup there , the children were laid on blankets on the floor , and police officers and medical workers sought to calm them , he said they were screaming , he said they were completely terrified , but of course none of them could understand what had happened mrs zoric said she first heard of the attack was on television news this morning , without transport to reach the children , she awaited word that they had passed safely through ilidza en route to a trappist monastery at magdeburg , in eastern germany about an hour after the bus had set off again today , mrs zoric s daughter called to tell her that the children had been taken off the bus at ilidza

miami clad entirely in black leather , bono came down from the stage on the second night of u2 s twomonth zoo tv tour to a long runway , where he twirled suggestively around a belly dancer as he sang mysterious ways moments later , as his bandmates pounded out until the end of the world , the singer approached a video camera filming the performance , kissed its lens and then yanked it down to his crotch an audience of 15 , 000 in the miami arena watched on a dozen video screens and roared its approval for the first time since the 1987 rattle and hum tour that resulted in the movie and album of the same name , the group is back on the road in the united states the irish quartet played at the nassau coliseum last week and will perform at the brendan byrne arena in new jersey and madison square garden in soldout shows this week but the band , which during the 1980 s came to personify a certain lofty idealism and spirituality , has returned in the 90 s decidedly more downtoearth we 've always aimed for the shining moment , and i love the liftoff that comes from that , bono , exhausted but exhilarated , said later backstage here , after greeting an assortment of celebrity guests ranging from the singer grace jones to eunice shriver but this show is much more about crawling around on your hands and knees we used to call ourselves the politburo , we were so uptight but we 're a lot looser now , and we 're not looking back the zoo tv tour , which the band s management says will probably be followed by a stadium tour , takes its name from and attempts to reproduce the mood of zoo station , the song that opens both u2 s live show and its latest record , achtung baby zoo station is the main subway stop in berlin , where bono \( born paul hewson \) lived for a time in a communist guesthouse once used by leonid brezhnev it was also in a berlin studio , once a nazi ballroom , that the group recorded the bulk of achtung baby in that environment , members of the band now say , it was hardly surprising that achtung baby ended up marking a radical departure from the joshua tree , the album that made u2 one of the most popular rock groups in the world during the late 80 s instead of the ringing guitars that had been the u2 trademark , the sound on record and on stage is murky and distorted , recalling much of the industrial dance music being produced these days in europe and just as the band had hoped , many of the berlin songs turned out to be not the anthems or exhortations that initially established the group s reputation but dark meditations on sex and decay and loss the record has sold 3 million copies in the united states and another 4 million abroad we were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing u2 and starting all over again , said the edge \( dave evans \) , the group s guitarist i just think that when you have the kind of profile we had during 'joshua tree' and 'rattle and hum' it s inevitable that you end up becoming a flat caricature of yourself i'm not saying we had no part in that , because we did we wrote those songs we gave those concerts it represented part of what we were about , but it was not the full picture adam clayton , the bass player , added people liked to pick up on the idealism within the band and amplify it sure , you like to go toward the light but within the context of the band , a piece of idealism was suddenly becoming the main headline we just felt we had to redress the balance , and that meant we had to be prepared to expose the doubts , failings and weaknesses within seen from another perspective , the songs that u2 recorded on achtung baby and are now performing on tour also reflect the band s newfound ability to find humor in the world around them and mock their own reputation for seriousness and high purpose a song like until the end of the world may well be , as bono describes it , a conversation between judas and jesus but the achtung baby title is a bit of a joke , really it expropriates one of mel brooks s crazier lines from the 1968 movie the producers , in which a musical about the life of hitler becomes an unlikely broadway hit we spent a lot of the 80 s ducking and bobbing and weaving , running from the ghosts of things that really were n't so scary after all , bono said we were scared the business would overtake us we were scared of the nonsense i think we held on to the music too tightly but now we 've learned to laugh at it all and find fun in everything , because there is a ridiculous side to rockandroll , and you just have to learn to live with it in retrospect , a lot of u2 s initial insecurity and rigidity was simply a result of coming out of dublin when you 're 17 and having to walk on stage in london feeling very inadequate because you 're not wearing the right clothes , the edge said eventually you get a record deal , and you feel like every inch of progress is a huge struggle finally you realize that 'this is what we do , ' and you get more relaxed about it mr clayton added getting into our 30 s , we are aware that we actually have a choice
los angeles , oct 23 the subject is still so forbidding that mike price , the coach of undefeated washington state , would n't dare speak the words rose bowl when he conversed with reporters the other day the best he could do was use initials nobody around here is talking rb , price said all we 're doing is thinking about usc that s all we have on our minds we 're definitely not looking ahead to oregon no advantage just yet three games into the pacific10 conference season , washington state \( 60 over all \) is one of five teams contending for the championship and an automatic berth in the jan 1 rose bowl but none of them necessarily has an advantage now washington , 60 and 40 in the pac10 , leads the conference race , followed by washington state \( 30 \) stanford , southern california and arizona are each 21 the huskies are ranked no 1 in the country in both the associated press poll and the new york times computer ranking the cougars , ranked 13th this week in the associated press poll and no 10 in the times s ranking , play southern cal on saturday afternoon at the coliseum the loser is very likely to be eliminated from bowl contention also on saturday , two other undefeated teams , alabama \( 70 \) and miami \( 60 \) have games that could be tough the crimson tide plays mississippi \( 42 \) and the hurricanes travel to blacksburg to play virginia tech \( 231 \) as for washington state , a combined 715 the last two seasons , the cougars are 60 for the first time since 1930 , the same season they went 90 before losing to alabama in the rose bowl that was the last time a washington state team has been to the rose bowl it s been jumping around here , price said from pullman , wash , this week our students are so close to the team that if we win , they feel like they win when we lose , no one feels like partying they have n't partied like this in some time the last time a cougar team was ranked as high in the weekly polls was 1958 the last time they won more than six games and were invited to a bowl game was 1988 but their road to pasadena is n't easy after southern cal \( 311 over all \) , they play oregon , arizona state , stanford and washington the huskies , who face a nonconference opponent , pacific , on saturday , meet stanford , arizona , oregon state and washington state washington has won 20 consecutive games farther back in the race are california and arizona state , with two losses each junior quarterback is star washington state is led by quarterback drew bledsoe , who has thrown for 1 , 576 yards and 11 touchdowns this season bledsoe , a junior , leads the conference in total offense with 2642 yards a game , although he was held to a seasonlow 108 yards passing last week in a 3017 victory over ucla the defense , though , has played an important role , too after allowing 4415 yards a game last season , it is now giving up 2803 this season , 13th nationally in total defense but it is bledsoe who is inspiring rhapsody in opposing coaches he s just a beautiful player , said larry smith , the southern cal coach if you could draw how you 'd want a quarterback to throw the football , he is picture perfect
bonn , feb 12 when the german fourman bobsled team starts its run down the icy course at la plagne , france , on feb 21 , the man driving the sled will be a former secret police informer who once spied on his three teammates the driver , harald czudaj \( pronounced shoodye \) , recently admitted that he was one of the hundreds of thousands of people in the former east germany who worked as an informer for the hated and feared secret police , the stasi i was no hero , czudaj admitted in an interview this week i know that i am morally guilty practically every important institution in germany , including churches , universities and political parties , has already been shaken by such admissions many germans have been expecting the scandal to spread into the world of sports , and the czudaj case suggests that it has i knew this was going to happen sooner or later , said walther troger , secretary of the german olympic committee a lot is going to be dug up first olympian to confess in recent weeks , several sports stars from eastern germany have admitted that they were stasi informers czudaj , however , is the first member of the olympic team to confess he did so after being identified by a dresden newspaper few germans are surprised to learn that the stasi spied on athletes it was widely understood here that east german teams rarely if ever traveled abroad without stasi informers still , many are shocked when they learn that the informers included some of their country s most prominent sports heroes like many former informers , czudaj has said he was pressured into collaborating with the stasi according to his account , he was stopped by the police while driving drunk one day in 1988 and was later told that he would be prosecuted and banned from future competition unless he agreed to become an informer soon afterward , he said , he began to prepare and submit reports on his teammates and coaches he said the reports included information about their private lives as well as their political opinions like nearly everyone who has been unmasked as a former stasi informer , czudaj has insisted that none of his reports ever resulted in harm being done to anyone as an informer , however , he had no direct knowledge of how his reports were used soon after the shock of czudaj s confession wore off , the three men with whom he rides in his bobsled announced that they supported him others on the olympic team also expressed sympathy the system was so brutal , said one of the bobsled coaches , wilfried scholz it used all kinds of pressure against people the speed skater uwejens mey said that czudaj s confession came as a great shock , but said he was trying to put it out of his mind right now , i do n't have time to worry about these things , mey said i'm focusing only on the competition showing the strain czudaj , who turns 28 on friday , is a world champion in his sport and had been considered a possible gold medalist at albertville whether the strain he has faced during the last week has shaken his concentration may become clear during the competition harald is completely wiped out , reported gunter gscheidlinger , an official of the german bobsled and luge federation it would be a miracle if he brings home a medal some prominent athletes in east germany , not including czudaj , were widely perceived as strong supporters of the communist government and have become highly unpopular among eastern germans perhaps the best known among them is the former figureskating champion katarina witt she has denied working for the stasi , but was known as an enthusiastic member of the communist party who regularly appeared with senior government leaders and praised their policies witt was selected by the communist youth organization to introduce the rock star bryan adams at a concert in east berlin in june 1988 , and the crowd greeted her with a deafening chorus of boos last summer she was chosen to toss a coin at the beginning of an exhibition game between two visiting american football teams , and the mere mention of her name over the publicaddress system triggered another wave of boos some senior olympic officials have expressed concern about the effect of recent revelations on sports in germany juan antonio samaranch , president of the international olympic committee , reacted to the news about czudaj by advising germans to look ahead instead of back more revelations about stasi connections to sport are likely to come , and some german athletes appear to be uncomfortable at the prospect the spreading stasi scandal is especially disruptive because it comes at the same time that several prominent athletes , including the champion sprinter katrin krabbe , are under suspicion of having used banned drugs to improve their performance did katrin krabbe dope herself to make her beautiful legs faster \? asked the berlin newspaper tagezeitung in a whimsical editorial saturday did katarina witt hide microphones in her teammates' skates \? only willi daume , head of the german olympic committee , knows for sure if this keeps up , we can forget the olympics the only thing that will help is for willi to go to the chancellor and beg him 'helmut , make the files disappear ! '
the storm buffeting europe is a strong one , but it has not yet uprooted a government or tossed a leader aside the leaders on the continent all are buttoning up , however , as the vote on european union approaches jacques delors european community leader jacques delors , the head of the european community s executive commission , is often referred to as mr europe after taking office in 1985 , he breathed life into the flagging community , committing it to create a single regional market by jan 1 , 1992 , then promoting the idea of a single currency it is not surprising , then , that he considers eight years of campaigning for closer integration in the balance french rejection of the treaty on sunday would require a fundamental rethinking of community policy , which he believes could be better managed by a successor if they say no , mr delors warns , he will resign in december his premature departure would strike a severe psychological blow at faith in european unity none of his predecessors since the community was formed in 1957 enjoyed his power or displayed his vision a stocky intense former finance minister , mr delors fervently believes the treaty , which commits the community to closer political as well as economic ties , is essential to withstand competition from the united states and japan he even sees it as a step toward creation of a federal europe but he has been thrown on the defensive by attacks on his executive commission , which critics say exercises too much power over national governments this week s crisis in european currency markets , mr delors has insisted , came as no surprise rather , he said , it was further proof of the community s need for tighter monetary union and a single currency photo jacques delors
long before he had ever heard of community policing , officer pete mulroy s job on the lower east side of manhattan had become a nightly chore drive down 10th street head south pop out of the car to make an arrest pop back in after 18 years in the ninth precinct , he felt he was running on automatic now as a prototype of the police department s vision of the future , he can point to dozens of buildings , apartments and storefronts he has cleared of addicts and dealers he has mapped a year of arrests on his office computer and with the help of residents , led prosecutors to valuable seizures of property and drugs in officer mulroy s view he has done more in the last one year on the job than i did in the first 18 but across town , in the east bronx , neighbors grumble about community police officers who barely learn the job when they are yanked back into their old roles , ricocheting in their squad cars from crisis to crisis in some brooklyn communities , residents complain that many of the officers are too young to understand the depth of neighborhood concerns and in queens , fledgling community police officers find themselves deluged with cases , as the department tries to mold them into experts on everything promise and pitfalls the opposing accounts sum up the promise and pitfalls of a program that has become the soul of the new york city police department the sudden resignation last week of the guiding force behind the drive toward locally based and problemsolving police work , commissioner lee p brown , has thrown the effort into uncertainty , in the view of many specialists from outside of the department the sudden change at the top has also focused new scrutiny on the degree to which commissioner brown has been able to impose his philosophy on new york s police force , the nation s largest and in some ways , the most tradition minded and it lays out the challenge that will confront the next commissioner to take mr brown s vision and see it through whoever is chosen , commissioner brown said in an interview last week , the mayor would pick someone who is committed to community policing it s the cornerstone of safe streets , safe city , he said , in a referring to the billiondollar program to build the department to an unprecedented level of nearly 32 , 000 officers by 1996 it s no longer a process it s how we do business more than 400 cities throughout the country have moved to a community policing system , but none with a department nearly as large as new york s in a field where smaller cities usually serve as models for the rest of the country , new york now fills an unlikely role it is the ultimate test case for community policing while it has a kind of ephemeral , even nostalgic ring to it , conjuring up a time when everyone knew the officer walking the beat , textbook community policing is a comprehensive program that depends on several layers operating in sync it seeks to take officers whose first reflex is to make an arrest , write a summons and be on to the next emergency radio call and turn them into problem solvers who have a stake in staying with and curing a particular community ailment michael clark , president of the nonprofit citizens committee for new york , which aids neighborhood groups and trains officers in community policing , said that the process was hampered by misconceptions you have to get past the shallower definition of community policing as foot patrol or community relations or greater sensitivity to community needs , he said they 're all nice , but not the heart of the matter the heart is collaborative steps to a goal to make community policing work , the department is taking a number of steps , including these it is creating a new system to reward and promote officers , not only for heroism , but also for the less glamorous tasks of building links to the community every rookie coming out of the police academy starts as a community police officer on foot patrol the department is changing the way it recruits advertisements for a police career used to speak to the adventure of the job now they say that an applicant should be caring , serviceoriented and communityminded beat officers from most precincts meet regularly with community groups and in town meetings but it is not a simple matter to gauge how the grand ideas of community policing have taken hold arrests for serious crimes are down , but some experts say that at least in part , this is because community policing calls for less emphasis on arrests and more on problem solving and because community policing asks officers to be social worker , psychologist and politician , it takes time for officers to grow into such a complex role we 're walking down the yellow brick road , but it does n't mean we 're going to get there , said thomas a reppetto , president of the citizens crime commission , a nongovernmental watchdog group the program is in jeopardy it will take a tremendous effort to make it work under the best of circumstances experts and even some department officials say that some parts of the department s vast network are lagging in the change to community policing , including the screening of applicants
islamabad , pakistan , feb 17 faced with an embargo on virtually all american aid and a cutoff of major military sales because of its nuclear weapons program , pakistan has embarked on the precarious process of recovering its friendship with the united states in the last few weeks , prime minister nawaz sharif has moved with some decisiveness to persuade washington that it should not abandon pakistan , now that its role as a gateway to china and , more important , as a frontline adversary of the soviet union is no longer needed in rapid succession , pakistan publicly admitted the extent of its nuclear weapons program , withdrew its military support for afghan rebels while endorsing a united nations peace plan and violently halted a march by kashmiri secessionists toward the indiancontrolled part of kashmir these steps , western diplomats here say , reflect an emerging pragmatism in foreign affairs intended both to blunt india s efforts to dominate south asia and to lay claim to being the rightful partner of the newly independent central asian republics of the former soviet union none of this will be possible , pakistani officials say , if relations with washington deteriorate further 'chastened and chastised' some sense has been shaken in with no aid coming in , said a senior military officer , who insisted on anonymity there is the feeling that we have to get our act together as a nation i think we have been generally chastened and chastised yet mr sharif is finding that domestic political dangers and newly emerging regional interests are conditioning both the pace and nature of his overtures to washington the reversal of the government s afghanistan policy and the suppression of the kashmir march , in particular , have drawn the wrath of the fundamentalist jamateislami party the party s leader , qazi hussain , insists that the only legitimate government possible in afghanistan is one led by the fundamentalist rebels , who deserve to rule because , in his view , they drove out the soviet army but many of the central asian republics , wary of the encroachment of fundamentalism in their domains , are encouraging a moderate government in kabul and have told pakistan that they will not tolerate a rebel triumph among the more moderate members of the national assembly here , pakistan s larger regional interests are now seen as vastly outweighing any emotional commitment to the spread of militant islam in afghanistan unless we have a good relationship with afghanistan , we have no chance of establishing social , cultural , economic and geographical links with the newly independent muslim central asian countries , kunwar khalid yunus , a national assembly member , wrote recently if we lose this chance again , as we did in the late 70 s , and last year just because of zealots' pressure , god may not give us another opportunity march is brutally halted mr sharif also decided that he could afford no more confrontations with india over the disputed territory of kashmir in the face of criticism from the religious right and the emotions of kashmiris in pakistan , he had a potentially incendiary march by the jammu and kashmir liberation front , the separatist group with the widest support in the indiancontrolled vale of kashmir , brutally halted but it was in washington that pakistan took its most risky step when the foreign secretary , shahrya m khan , disclosed that islamabad had the ability to make nuclear weapons that acknowledgment , while confirming what the administration had known all along , accomplished two things , in the view of western diplomats first , it told the bush administration , which has invoked a law , the socalled pressler amendment , to ban aid to pakistan because of its nuclear program , that the country wanted to put its cards on the table and begin the process of removing sanctions second , it renewed pressure on india to respond to pakistan s call for talks on nuclear proliferation in south asia pakistan has suggested that the united states , russia , china , india and itself discuss ways to reduce the threat of a nuclear exchange and hopefully lead to the banning of nuclear weapons in the region the pakistanis want to get out of pressler , said a western diplomat here they are serious about the fivepower talks in itself they are not a way out of pressler , but they provide a way forward at the same time , the united states is clearly eager not to alienate the pakistanis despite the ban on military sales , the bush administration has not only permitted , but , western diplomats here say , assisted pakistan in buying spare parts for its fleet of f16 jets , purchases that state department lawyers have determined to be permissible under the law and last month pakistan s chief of staff , gen asif nawaz , visited washington , where he was treated much like a visiting head of state following the middle path prime minister sharif , with the cooperation of president ghulam ishaq khan , a major force in the power structure , has moved to eliminate opposition to the new policies in the army , which had become more sympathetic to fundamentalism in recent years most visible was his decision to retire a hardcore fundamentalist general , hammed gul , and to install as army chief general nawaz , who has repeatedly stressed the need for the army to stay out of politics as far as fundamentalism is concerned , the senior military officer said , we want to be practicing muslims we want to be moderates this is what our religion teaches , moderation , tolerance , the middle path at the same time , pakistani officials regard with some amusement washington s seeming frenzied concern about the spread of fundamentalism in central asia , fears they hope to exploit by presenting themselves as sober pragmatists who just happen to be muslims because they see central asia as their natural ally , the pakistanis are encouraging washington to regard islamabad as a partner in cementing links with the central asian republics , and in the process limiting the influence of iran whether this strategy will be effective is difficult to say at this point , but western diplomats here are not immune to its appeal a senior diplomat said , there is a competition to see what is going on there
the real name of janacek s opera jenufa , which received its first performance of the season on saturday night at the metropolitan opera , is her stepdaughter it is not a title likely to stir an audience s passions , but it properly shifts the emphasis from the young girl jenufa to the imposing figure of kostelnicka and to the troubled relations between the two characters at this particular performance , the original title seemed even more appropriate , for with the czechoslovak soprano gabriela benackova singing jenufa and leonie rysanek creating the role of her stepmother , the second act became a masterfully executed chamber opera , a psychological portrait of suffering and determination the daughter , disappointed in love , bears an illegitimate child the stepmother , disappointed in life , thinks she is protecting the girl by killing the newborn baby the two singers had sung these roles together before in a new york concert performance in 1988 and had also appeared in the opposing female roles of katya kabanova in striking performances at the met in 1991 so they seemed closely attuned to each other s vastly different styles and characters despite occasional vocal flaws , ms rysanek turned the stepmother , struggling for family honor , into a sympathetic matriarch whose murder of the baby became an act of controlled desperation her meditative soliloquy was tender and haunting ms rysanek may have slid up to some notes , but her now darkened voice has lost little suppleness and power when the character later feels the chill of retribution , ms rysanek left behind any attempt to create the cry with mere notes the invocation of death was gasped , with horror , deep in her throat ms benackova made a compelling contrast with ms rysanek when kostelnicka cried out the name of steva , the father of the illegitimate child , the offstage call of jenufa for her mother seemed to emerge out of the same sounds while ms rysanek was dark and musky with passion , ms benackova was fluid , clear and sure of pitch throughout her own secondact aria as she searches for her missing baby had a hushed melancholy the men in this performance were less satisfying jacque trussel , making his debut with the company , was too strained as steva , the callow man who refuses even to look at his child or the woman he was once prepared to marry his tenor had the right size , but it became tight and inexpressive in its upper register ben heppner was his stepbrother and rival , laca his voice has none of those flaws , but he acted as if he were constantly bewildered by the events unfolding around him the production itself , by gunther schneidersiemssen , dates from 1974 it is elemental and strong , particularly in creating the interior of jenufa s house with its thick timber supports and simple furnishings the new staging by lesley koenig was effective , and the use of czech , for the first time at the met in this work , was appropriate , although it was often impossible , in the singing of much of the cast , to hear the idiomatic melodic character of the language james conlon s conducting was animated and appropriately unsettled , but he tended to let the orchestra become raw at climaxes janacek makes the effort unnecessary the ensemble work of the penultimate scene , as revelation follows shock , was so well executed that the final alliance between jenufa and laca took on a tragic calm in which the folk life of the village seemed transformed other czechoslovak composers , like smetena and dvorak , treat folk material as signs of innocence bartok later found tragedy in the overturning of folk harmonies with the strains of modernism but janacek saw , in the world of the premodern village , a world to be neither yearned for nor reviled it is a world he treats as almost inherently tragic any attempt to transcend its narrowness and provinciality is bound to participate in it as well kostelnicka knows too much not to try and is , by opera s end , trapped her stepdaughter was too innocent to try and seems , by opera s end , to escape jenufa opera in three acts by leos janacek , libretto by the composer , based on a play by gabriela preissova conductor , james conlon staged by lesley koenig sets and costumes by gunther schneidersiemssen lighting by gil wechsler associate designer , david reppa at the metropolitan opera jenufa gabriela benackova kostelnicka leonie rysanek laca ben heppner steva jacque trussel barena heidi skok jano joyce guyer karolka korliss uecker old shepherdess sondra kelly mayor s wife joyce castle grandmother buryja judith christin aunt loretta di franco foreman jeffrey wells mayor james courtney photo ben heppner performing in jenufa at the metropolitan opera \( winnie klotz metropolitan opera \)
steak frites fourmonthold steak frites , a clamorous , nofrills bistro near union square that produces better than average food , often has the appearance of a place that is nearly out of control the impression begins with your arrival on two of four visits , no one was at the reception desk we lingered a short time later , a woman lunged back to her post and looked up at the growing backlog of patrons with a startled expression befitting a tax delinquent confronted by a team of internal revenue service agents on a preliminary visit to steak frites three weeks after it opened , i must have been served by the best waiter in the place , for more recent experiences bordered on the chaotic the staff mixed up drink orders or never brought them at all , served dishes to the wrong parties and allowed meals to drag on , especially at lunch , when the pace should be prompt at lunch one day , to my amazement , a table of three was served two wrong appetizers one of our orders , we learned almost 30 minutes after ordering , was not even available that day this three stooges service is unfortunate , for the bargainpriced french food at steak frites deserves better the restaurant is owned by andrew silverman , who had a mediocre bistro called espace in this location before , and terrance brennan , a solid chef who also owns prix fixe on west 18th street in manhattan perhaps it is no coincidence that prix fixe is the only restaurant i have walked out of in the last year because of intolerable service steak frites' big , open , highceilinged room with a long antique bar will not win any interior design awards it has a makeshift look , a gritty charm , with its garagegray walls \( enlivened by cartoonlike parisian murals \) , a worn wooden floor , exposed heating ducts overhead and columns crowned with weirdlooking felt fabric mr brennan s menu features many bistro standards frisee aux lardons , or chicory salad with bacon , is vitalized with roquefort a summery terrine of grilled vegetables and faintly tart goat cheese is a splendid combination brandade de morue , a puree of salt cod , potatoes , olive oil and garlic , is exceptionally creamy , infused with garlic and nicely gratineed and angel hair pasta , which is so often overcooked in restaurants , is pleasantly al dente and tossed in a stout sauce of green olives , tomato , artichokes , potatoes and olive oil steak frites has a slender wine list that is supplemented by inexpensive beaujolais , cotesdurhones and other regional selections given the reasonable food prices dinner entrees from 12 to 17 it would be nice to see a wider selection of wines in the 25 and under category the house namesake dish , steak frites , is an unqualified winner , a crusty black angus rib eye nearly buried by a stack of golden french fries roast chicken is good , too , accompanied by the same potatoes chicken also is a good bet in the towering couscous royal , a highly seasoned assembly that also includes spicy merguez \( a moroccan sausage \) , lamb shank , chickpeas and raisins paillard of veal , which is hard to find well prepared in new york city , is one of the best around , amply seasoned , well seared and paired with an arugula salad among seafood dishes , grilled shrimp served with asparagus and mixed greens along with a sweet mango relish is satisfying but not stimulating on a second sampling , the shrimp were nearly raw better choices are the wellseasoned roast cod set over a bright ratatouille with shredded basil and cloves of roasted garlic , or the brittleskinned and buttery salmon with a fennel and walnut salad for dessert , do n't bother with the pallid watermelon sorbet or the overinflated grand marnier souffle go instead for the pot de creme , which is sort of chocolate pudding on steroids , or the nicely mottled creme brulee despite the maladroit service , steak frites is packed nightly this speaks volumes , either about mr brennan s cooking or the public s hunger for a bargain the box tree the 15yearold box tree is a resolutely patrician , theatrically romantic and astoundingly expensive restaurant in midtown manhattan that serves what might be described as ambitious countryclub cuisine it s the kind of place where cocktails are served on a showy silver tray that resembles the frame of a bird cage , where ladies' menus omit prices and where stiff , tuxedoclad captains strut around the dining room as if they have yardsticks down the backs of their shirts all of this could be fun if the food were anywhere close to the pretensions of the setting unfortunately , what you get is fussy , bloodless continental cuisine for more than 100 a person \( including wine , tax and tip \) the box tree , in an east side brownstone , has two ornate

against the background of a stubborn recession and mounting financial distress in the country , the federal government continues to create or expand domestic spending programs with little or no review of the financial burdens they will place on state and local governments , public policy analysts say in 1990 alone , the year the recession began , president bush signed 20 bills into law , ordering programs that the national conference of state legislatures says will cost state and local governments billions of extra dollars , primarily for health care , the environment and social security payments for public employees some mandates , like the americans with disabilities act , were enacted without any reliable estimates of the cost to state and local governments the legislation , which requires businesses and state and local governments to provide the disabled with equal access to services , employment , buildings and transportation systems , is now expected to cost them millions of dollars annually to comply health and environment the most expensive regulations for any state involve medicaid , the federally subsidized healthcare program for lowincome people that will cost 383 billion for the states to finance this year the next most expensive mandates involve environmental laws , primarily water purification , which will cost state and local governments 32 billion a year by 1995 and three new studies show that despite the publicized efforts of president ronald reagan and president bush to decentralize government , both contributed to a proliferation of regulations that meant enormous costs to states and cities in the 1980 s no one can reliably estimate the cost of complying with many such programs , and congress is required to make only preliminary estimates on some of the bills it considers but analysts say no federal law provides for complete reimbursement of any mandated program , and some legislative analysts estimate the burden to local governments of such spending at scores of billions of dollars a year 'rock and a hard place' we are between a rock and a hard place , said gov robert p casey of pennsylvania , a democrat as part of a plan to pay for newly mandated federal health benefits for children , pregnant women and the elderly , governor casey has proposed eliminating some medical benefits for disabled men who currently receive state welfare grants the state raised taxes by a record 33 billion this fiscal year and still must reduce spending by 800 million to balance a 142 billion budget pessimism is widespread threequarters of the states and more than a third of the nation s cities report worsening fiscal problems this year , and many governors and mayors are saying the problems will linger or worsen over several years even if the economy recovers quickly i think we 're headed for a showdown , gov john engler of michigan , a republican , said in a recent interview in which he blamed congress for wrecking state budgets but analysts and other governors blame mr bush last month , when the president met with the national governors association , their meeting turned into an arguing match at that meeting , on feb 3 in washington , two democratic governors , roy romer of colorado and george sinner of north dakota , attacked the president , asserting that too much money was going to the military and too little to the states what bases do you want to close \? mr bush asked testily only a month earlier , mr bush seemed sympathetic to the plight of the state and local governments in january , in mr bush s state of the union message , he sought to lay responsibility for mandates on congress and advocated curbs on spending bush on mandates we must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates , mr bush said these are the requirements congress puts on our cities , counties and states without supplying the money and if congress passes a mandate , it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere in an earlier effort to give the states more flexibility in administering federal programs , mr bush last year proposed to consolidate 15 billion in block grants and to leave the decision on how to spend the money up to the states but many cities opposed the legislation and it died in congress mr bush said last week that he planned to revive the proposal nevertheless , analysts say the president has done little to curb the flow of federal mandates nor , they assert , has he acted to provide more financing for those bills he has signed into law 'zero leadership' president bush has provided zero leadership in this area of nationstate relationships , said joseph f zimmerman , professor of political science at the state university of new york in albany and the author of two new studies on the relationship between the states and the federal government you ca n't point to a single bill where he took leadership to give states more freedom of action , or for that matter , where he sought to impose mandates on states , he said in a sense , it is as though president bush has just been oblivious to this whole area until he mentioned it in the state of the union message

dallas , nov 11 two entrepreneurs , barney f kogen and gordon a cain , announced today that they would start a small houstonbased airline early next year in an attempt to lure business travelers from continental airlines mr kogen , a former accountant who amassed a fortune while building a large travel agency in the 1980 s , thinks the timing is right for a businessclass , nodiscount airline ferrying passengers between houston and three destinations los angeles , new york and washington the new airline , ultrair , aims to lure profitable business travelers from continental with roomier planes , better food and especially an absence of families , vacationers and other bargainfare customers , whose presence he said had caused airline service to plunge steadily wall street analysts have seen similar attempts , like air one in st louis , fail and they doubt that mr kogen and mr cain can make it continental agreed to merge this week with air canada , a deal that will give it 450 million in new financing a tough competitor kevin c murphy , airline analyst at morgan stanley company , said startups like midwest express in milwaukee and reno air in nevada had succeeded because they had little competition or none at all but picking a fight against continental on profitable routes is a far different gamble , he said mr cain and mr kogen each contributed 5 million to capitalize ultrair mr cain , who is 80 years old , earned more than 100 million in a 1988 leveragedbuyout deal in the chemicals business he has also been majority owner for a year of united express , a commuter airline based at dulles international airport mr kogen s lifeco travel services was the biggest customer of continental airlines until mr kogen and his partners sold the agency to american express last december for 100 million mr kogen controlled 70 percent of the company mr kogen said that ultrair s operating costs would be minuscule and that the airline could break even with an average of 35 passengers on boeing 727 aircraft designed for 101 passengers he said each flight would carry 60 people within a few months of the airline s startup on jan 10 hard times in the airline industry , which lost 6 billion in the last two years , have sharply reduced operating costs , he said for instance , ultrair will lease a gate at newark international airport for three hours a day for 1 , 600 , mr kogen said many planes available the company will lease 10 727 aircraft at a time that 1 , 000 aircraft are available from leasing companies and other owners , and employ 250 fulltime workers in houston other workers will be hired through amr services , a ground services unit owned by the parent company of american airlines , on parttime schedules in other cities mr kogen plans three daily flights beginning jan 10 to los angeles , and two to newark international airport two flights will be added to washington national airport in march , and two to la guardia airport in new york in may ultrair will charge one price for all flights that in most cases will match unrestricted coach fares at continental the oneway fare between houston and new york is 570 if we are n't making money within a few months , we 'll know we made the wrong decision , mr cain said
while the latest job figures are raising the prospect of a triple dip recession for the rest of the nation , economists say that the new york region has yet to emerge from the first phase of the downturn , and that the continuing loss of service jobs makes prospects for recovery here even bleaker across new york , connecticut and new jersey , the businesses that fueled the region s growth do not appear to have hit bottom law and accounting firms are laying off junior and senior executives alike advertising agencies , management consulting concerns and public relations companies are carving deeply into their employment , and architecture firms and realestate brokerage houses are reeling under their worst financial losses in decades new york is at the center of the storm , said samuel m ehrenhalt , new york regional commissioner of the federal bureau of labor statistics , which reported that national unemployment jumped threetenths of a percentage point in june , to 78 percent , and that joblessness was far more acute in the new york region this is not just another dip , he added it s a story of ongoing decline 'unprecedented change' economists and business executives say the region s recession is being prolonged by the very same industries that have proved resilient to previous downturns , and made new york and its suburbs a showplace in the 1980 s when business and professional services were thought to be replacing manufacturing as the key to the nation s economic growth service companies have awakened to an unprecedented period of structural change and competitive forces , said stephen s roach , senior economist for morgan stanley to be sure , experts have long described the nation s current recession as one affecting service industries more than previous downturns but the extent of the damage , a growing consensus that it will be prolonged or permanent , and its brutal impact on those highly paid service professionals in the new york region are proving worse than anticipated the new york region has always been a center of law , financial consulting and other service professions but in the robust 1980 s , the region s manufacturing base declined and its core of corporate headquarters and other centers of international business decisionmaking attained a more dominant place in its economy regions that depend on services are going to have to find alternatives , mr roach said , and none is more dependent than new york nationally , the jump was attributed to a host of problems , including a downturn in consumer spending and home building , and economists have engaged in a fervent debate made no less urgent by electionyear politics that the nation , which began a slow economic recovery late last year , may now be dipping back into recession unemployment jumps but for new york city and its suburbs , any hopes that a belated recovery was at hand were dashed by the same federal report on june employment it said the new york city unemployment rate jumped a full percentage point to 115 percent the rate in new york state leaped to 92 percent from 79 percent and the rate in new jersey increased to 92 percent from 9 percent june figures are not yet available for connecticut employment cuts in the service industries have thrown a very painful wrench into the region s prospects for a recovery soon , mr ehrenhalt said the fallout is palpable among many of the region s professionals at the new york city bar association , monthly emotional support meetings , offering guidance from a psychologist , have been attracting 60 to 100 lawyers , most of whom have lost their jobs other support groups have been organized to counsel bar association members on resume writing and other jobhunting skills lawyers who have attended say that , for the first time in any of their memories , partners at new york area firms are being forced out , even if that means that the ownership interests that they have acquired have to be purchased from them layoffs among associates are far more commonplace , they said , and a new term in the legal profession portable business is being invoked frequently by major firms to make clear that they expect job candidates to bring in billpaying clients , as well as their legal skills public relations firms hit we are dealing with lawyers who worked in banking , real estate , mergers and acquisitions , across the board , said madeline stoller , chairman of the bar association committee that is conducting the support groups also hit hard by the recession is public relations , which grew rapidly during the freespending , imageconscious 1980 s over the last two years , the number of employees of new yorkarea public relations companies has been cut by at least 10 percent , said howard j rubenstein , owner of howard j rubenstein associates , one of the largest , with 128 employees the problem , he said , is that most of the clients of public relations firms are the same professional service executives that are themselves struggling with layoffs and shrinking profits , adding that the only area of growth for public relations practitioners now is in crisis management we are handling a lot of economic collapse , mr rubenstein said to be sure , business and professional service companies are not the only only ones that continue to feel the bite of the region s long recession one industry decimated by the slump has been retail sales , in which a string of departmentstore closings in new york city and the suburbs have prompted huge employment cuts manufacturing shrinks manufacturing , a weak link in the regional economy for decades , has continued to shrink the fallout was illustrated friday when stroehmann bakeries closed its taystee bakery plant in flushing , queens government studies show that manufacturing employment in new york city declined to slightly below 300 , 000 jobs in 1991 for the first time since world war ii , with unremitting losses that totaled over 200 , 000 jobs since 1979 amid the bleak government data , the region shows some glimmers of economic hope wall street , after 18 months of surging profits and stock trading volume , appears to have ended a deep wave of job cuts , although new hiring is slow and anemic with the democratic national convention convening in manhattan this week , and with the city still basking in the success of its op sail extravaganza , hotels , restaurants and other businesses that depend on tourism promise improved earnings , at least for the summer
the tucson electric power company sold a block of 38 million shares of foothill group inc yesterday to a number of institutional and individual investors for about 193 million , foothill announced foothill , an industrial loan company , did not identify any of the buyers , but said none of them owned more than a 99 percent stake for 18 months , tuscon electric has made public its intention to sell its 38 percent stake in foothill a cashflow crisis at tuscon electric last year led creditors to petition for its involuntary bankruptcy , but a federal bankruptcy court dismissed such efforts on dec 31 jay gonzales , a tuscon electric spokesman , said the stock sale produced a 105 million loss , since the company had acquired the shares for 298 million he said the loss was covered by a general reserve fund set up in mid1990 when the company decided to liquidate its stakes in several companies
how does a man who has held elective office for nearly 27 years win when women are in and incumbents are out \? that formidable challenge facing robert abrams , new york state s attorney general , illustrates how national trends are shaping the race for the democratic senate nomination in new york yet the state s quirky dynamics may also skew the political equation that produced a stunning surge by women in democratic primaries for the senate in illinois and pennsylvania mr abrams has been struggling to remind voters of his record as a defender of abortion rights and as an advocate for other issues vital to feminist groups his campaign is even debating whether it wants the designation of the democratic state committee later this month an endorsement that could further cast mr abrams as the establishment candidate each of the three major candidates , trying hard not to seem in their own words just one of the boys , is promising voters a delicate blend of experience and change but in contrast to the contestants in the illinois and pennsylvania races , the three major candidates in new york include two women , not one the man describes himself as a feminist , and none of the three is exactly a political newcomer in a year when deepseated antipathy toward incumbents has defined the mood of the electorate in the battle for the nomination , each camp is trying to convince the voters that its candidate has the most legitimate claim to this elusive piece of political ground 2 women , 2 traditions that there are two women makes the picture less clear , said andrea bernstein , the campaign spokeswoman for the new york city comptroller , elizabeth holtzman but they come out of very different traditions liz is more grass roots , from the civil rights movement and has always been perceived as someone who does n't play ball with the boys ferraro has worked much more closely within the democratic party the spokesman for geraldine a ferraro , frank wilkinson , described his candidate as a woman who got in the house by knocking down the door , who did n't get to be the vice presidential candidate by being one of the boys in contrast , he said , liz has been in office for an awfully long time and people do n't associate her with a fresh wind mr abrams , said his adviser , ethan geto , is a feminist man with an unrivaled record on behalf of abortion rights we understand the impression that women candidates are more outsiders , mr geto said we think that when this campaign gets close to the end there 'll be questions in the voters' minds about bob s principal opponent on other issues it s our assessment that democratic voters see bob abrams as more experienced , with more senatorial stature , and can identify him with a whole host of important policy issues and as a more effective fighter for new york capitalizing on her national renown and touting herself as the only nonincumbent , ms ferraro , the former queens congresswoman who was the democratic nominee for vice president in 1984 , has advanced in determination to tie mr abrams in fundraising and in early public opinion polls if the democratic state committee endorses ms ferraro , its designation might bestow added credibility to her comeback campaign a risk that mr abrams is weighing as he continues to corral support from party officials result of '80 primary ms ferraro s ascent prompted mr abrams to pare his campaign staff by nearly onethird last month and to invest limited resources more heavily in television advertising ms holtzman won the democratic nomination in 1980 by defeating , among others , another icon , bess myerson , who failed to transform her celebrity into political support ms holtzman , who has never lost a primary , may draw as many black , jewish and liberal voters from mr abrams as women from ms ferraro the rev al sharpton , the civil rights protest leader , is also seeking the democratic nomination a fifth candidate , representative robert j mrazek of long island , had staked a convincing claim to the title of political newcomer but quit the race last month after it was revealed that he was the secondworst abuser of house bank overdrafts the only outsider in people s minds , said the liberal party leader , raymond harding , who is supporting mr abrams , was a guy who started with three points and ended with two points in two or more ballots at the state committee meeting late this month , democratic party leaders intend to provide each of the four candidates with 25 percent or more of the state committee vote , which would qualify them for the sept 15 primary without having to collect thousands of petition signatures the democratic nominee will challenge the republican incumbent , alfonse m d'amato , who , after two terms in the senate , hopes to distinguish himself from other vulnerable incumbents by playing the atypical maverick who has turned government inside out on behalf of his constituents i'm not afraid of taking the establishment on , he said , echoing the message of his wouldbe democratic rivals in this race , i'm the only one who s not a career politician , said ms ferraro , who frequently recalls that she spent more time as a homemaker than in politics the race is between me and bob , ms ferraro said , hopefully i can understand liz s frustration she s so far behind she sees me as the barrier to her being in the senate 'quite a dilemma'

in the space of three city blocks , she roamed through myriad subjects , from quitting tennis to campaigning for gay rights to trying out the new hockey skates she received from rangers coach roger neilson in exchange for a racquet martina navratilova , like a shark , is never in repose she still turned heads on blase madison avenue as she strolled away from the penthouse she borrowed to house herself and her dog through the virginia slims championships this week , an event she has won eight times on her own and 10 times alongside pam shriver , her soontobeformer doubles partner last night , the fourthseeded navratilova opened her singles campaign with an athletic flourish , blasting manuela maleevafragniere off the blue carpet at madison square garden , 62 , 62 there are times , the loser said later , when navaratilova can still play the tennis of a no 1 at age 36 , and ranked fifth on the computer , navratilova may not be on the rise , but she surely does n't go unnoticed , not even on the very avenue that has been the bane of her existence in the matter of winning endorsements yuppies in control the bottom line is that madison avenue is run by white male yuppies , said navratilova , who feels her forthrightness about her sexual preference long ago scared the advertisers off but i 'd rather have it like this than pretend to be miss heterosexual america , said the player who has added her name and clout to the class action suit filed by the american civil liberties union in colorado , where an amendment removing antidiscrimination legislation was passed two weeks ago navratilova , an aspen resident , said she would fight first , but switch states if the amendment was not found unconstitutional i like aspen but i wo n't pay taxes to a state that does n't recognize me as a human being , she said , before turning her attention to lunch in a bistro where the other patrons beamed their approval without interrupting her luncheon , navratilova s prepractice pasta was prepared to bland pefection the garlic sundried tomatoes and tiramisu , although tempting , were sacrificed to the greater good of a robust practice session but she wo n't be making this particular sacrifice much longer between soothing sips of minestrone soup on a crisp autumn day recently , navratilova was talking about being at a crossroads yet another crossroads this time tennis , where she has begun to measure her future with an hourglass , and trust , a personally and politically pertinent topic , were giving her pause doubting mankind nothing ever happens to me gradually , she said the judy nelson thing was enough to put anybody in a mental institution , and through it all i had to keep playing tennis , too , navratilova said , referring to the courtroom wrangle with an excompanion that left navratilova with her sanity but cost her a house , several million dollars , and her gullibility it s enough to make you doubt mankind or maybe i can still trust mankind , but not with my money , she said wryly , which is how she says most things these days always a little perplexed with herself , and forever curious about what s going to happen next in the open book that is her life , navratilova thinks she will probably quit competitive tennis after next year my gut feeling is that this coming year will be my last year , said navratilova , who has n't won a grand slam event in two years but continues to fasten her sights on a record 10th wimbledon title or a fifth united states open crown navratilova had won four kraft tour events and was 357 heading into last night s openinground match against manuela maleeva , the player who bounced her from the fourth round of the 1991 open and whose younger sister , magdalena , did the same in this year s second round i think of retirement as an ugly word , like being put out to pasture , said navratilova , but i think it s time to start making a transition it s difficult to win at this age when one little thing goes wrong , it seems to affect everything and the few minutes of glory i get from winning a regular tournament are n't really worth it anymore but i still think i can win a big one , and it cannot happen if i quit now so i 'll be trying again in 1993 navratilova has already begun the transition process by trimming down her schedule at the expense of a fulltime doubles commitment this slims event , she said , will probably be her last with shriver , with whom she has won 79 titles , 19 of them in grand slams the pair prolonged their partnership for at least one more match by defeating mary joe

said and the fact that losses still cause sleepless nights is another reason navratilova will be around next year i asked chris evert how she knew she was ready to retire , and she said it was because sometimes she did n't care if she lost , navratilova said well , i still care it s just that now that i'm losing more often , it s not quite as devastating but it still keeps me up at night match

there is no sure solution to the bosnian horror , short of massive western military intervention even that might not work , or work soon enough so my quarrel with president bush , and especially with european leaders and un officials , is not their failure to find a magic formula it is their unwillingness to do what they can that might lessen , or perhaps even end the bloodshed within a week or two , they could and should take all or most of the following steps go beyond insisting on immediate inspection of all detention camps \( serbian , croatian and muslim \) and back up red cross efforts with concrete warnings to all parties if the parties delay or deny full access or the camps turn out to be torture pits , the un should authorize nato to dispatch commando teams to rescue the prisoners and ferry them to safety provide arms to bosnian muslims this would give them a better chance to defend themselves station troops outside serbia s borders to enforce un economic sanctions against serbia this embattled country still carries on at least 50 percent of its prewar trade threaten air strikes against military targets in serbia itself this will put at immediate risk serbia s one remaining national asset its military superiority in heavy arms , aircraft and arms factories if the serbs show no compromise , start by hitting bridges and roads from serbia to bosnia , thereby interrupting vital supplies to bosnian serbs call upon the un to establish a special commission right away to investigate war crimes under world war ii nuremberg rules the evolving un security council resolution on this seems to lack specificity and urgency the commission should be empowered to hear evidence and issue arrest warrants war criminals should know that from that day on they will never be able to step foot outside their countries without fear of trial move up the starting date for the european communityun peace conference in london set for late august and keep the negotiators at the table as of now , they will meet for just three days , and surely accomplish nothing the conferees should focus not on a ceasefire , which would only perpetuate serb conquests , but on establishing the territorial boundaries of bosnia , serbia and croatia , the creation of semiautonomous ethnic regions within bosnia and the full return of refugees to bosnia instead of showing imagination and political courage along these lines , the leaders of the western world have been staging a kabuki play of illusions they endlessly rehearse the history and intractability of balkan bloodlettings , as if this justified virtual inaction today they continually stress their humanitarian relief efforts both to quiet public outrage and to hide the fact that they are simply feeding the victims and doing little to prevent their being driven from their homes or killed they publicly warn the serbs , but in fact maneuver for surrender by bosnian muslims , hoping the whole problem will then fade away un relief forces in sarajevo now admit they knew of the detention centers a month ago , but did not think it was their job to report the matter to higherups un refugee officials in new york say they did nothing with their knowledge of the camps because that was the red cross s job mr bush pretends he s doing something , as he did again on saturday , and dismisses constructive ideas on the use of force as politics he speaks of the horror of the camps , but makes no commitment to eliminate them he is willing to use force to protect the un relief effort in bosnia , but west european leaders reject even that none of them will yet consider protecting the bosnian muslims doing so , they insist , will lead only to a quagmire as if they would lose all control over their actions once they dropped bombs on a serbian airfield or sent commandos to rescue death camp victims these are dodges and excuses , not deeds and arguments worthy of leaders struggling with human catastrophe these world leaders are telling us they might send an armored car to guard a loaf of bread , but will take no risks to stop a slaughter right outside their bedroom windows have they no humanity , no sense of all they might do short of massive military intervention , no vision of the international consequences \?
bob lurie , eager to get approval for his 110 million sale of the san francisco giants , has agreed to support the effort of a group of owners to oust commissioner fay vincent in exchange for their support of the giants' move to st petersburg , fla , some owners said yesterday in the guerrilla warfare being waged against vincent by a group of owners led by jerry reinsdorf of the chicago white sox and peter o'malley of the los angeles dodgers , lurie had been among the group of owners supporting the commissioner but now , lurie is said to have joined vincent s opponents , who have challenged the commissioner on a variety of issues , including his role in labor relations , his realignment of the national league and his allocation of expansion money between the two leagues lurie , through a spokesman , denied that he had made any kind of deal linking vincent s status and the giants' proposed move , but three owners said they had been told by other owners that lurie had agreed to sign a letter making a halfdozen charges against vincent and calling for his resignation if he does n't resign , the owners suggest in the letter , he could face dismissal vincent declined to comment on the developments but said that no signed letter has been presented to him none of the owners who acknowledged having seen a copy of the letter would disclose the specific charges but others who had heard about the letter said two points raised dealt with vincent s credibility and his failure to maintain good relationships with the televsion networks two owners who said they had seen the letter said the accusations it contains are false lurie , who has maintained a low profile since reaching an agreement in principle on aug 7 to sell the giants to a florida group , refused to be interviewed duffy jennings , the giants' vice president for public relations , said that the owner would not respond to questions about private business between owners jennings said he asked lurie about the report that he had made a deal with the antivincent faction he said he s made no such agreement with any owners , jennings said one owner , who said he had heard that lurie had made an agreement , expressed hope that the report would turn out to be incorrect i 've heard he s now joined , said the owner , who spoke on condition of anonymity it was suggested that he did it to gain favor but i do n't want to believe it it would be sad to strike deals like that two other owners said that their information on lurie s entering into the agreement meshed with what they called a noticeable change in the view of some american league owners to the proposed move of the giants initially , the two owners said , the move faced adamant opposition from al owners , primarily because the league did n't want to concede the entire state of florida to the national league the florida marlins , one of two expansion franchises , are scheduled to join the national league next season as the state s first major league franchise but more recently , the two owners said , american league owners who had at first been opposed to the move altered their position they decided to give up florida if they could get rid of the commissioner , one of them said the same owner said reinsdorf and bud selig , owner of the milwaukee brewers and another ardent member of the group trying to oust vincent , were believed to be influential in getting some american league owners to change their minds reinsdorf and selig did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the letter or lurie s involvement the numbers lurie needs the giants' move to st petersburg requires the approval of the commissioner , 11 of 14 national league clubs and 8 of 14 american league clubs although vincent two months ago gave lurie permission to explore all of his options , he has not indicated whether he would approve the move it is possible there are enough national league owners not aligned with the antivincent faction to block the giants' move , without any concern over the commissioner s status there is a growing feeling that the owners should wait to see if the city of san francisco could come up with an alternative to an outoftown sale lurie has said he would not entertain other offers while the st petersburg deal is awaiting approval but if someone steps forward in san francisco and identifies himself as a willing purchaser , the nl owners who do n't like the proposed move could block it and force lurie to sell the team to the local buyer at a meeting in chicago yesterday , al owners held a general discussion of the giants' sale and possible transfer and what it could mean to the league the owners took no position on the giants' sale but , in an unofficial vote , unanimously approved the sale of the detroit tigers to mike ilitch vincent has worked to help the giants in their effort to get a new stadium in the san francisco area he joined lurie in campaigning for the passage of ballot questions aimed at providing funds for a park that would replace the muchcriticized candlestick park perhaps because of vincent s efforts on lurie s behalf , the giants' owner had supported the commissioner in an earlier effort by the dissidents to induce him to resign in late june and early july , several owners said , the reinsdorf group circulated a fax soliciting colleagues to sign a letter that was intended to get vincent to resign vincent said he had been told of the fax s existence , but he had not seen it he also said his opponents were wasting their time and energy i told them if they came to me with 25 signatures i would n't quit , he said at the time vincent s term expires in april 1994 the number of owners involved in the july initiative varied , depending on who was counting one antivincent owner told another owner that the fax had drawn 20 signatures the next day , another owner said , the same owner told him it had 16 signatures yet another owner said 22 owners opposed vincent and wanted him to resign the group never presented that letter to vincent photo giants' owner , bob lurie , denied making any deal with other club owners \(

suzi oppenheimer , the fourterm democratic state senator from the sound shore area , has long taken pride in what she felt was a high level of name recognition in her district we took a poll once and found that 56 percent of my constituents said they had actually met me , she said this year , redistricting came to mrs oppenheimer , as it must to all incumbents , and like other officeholders , she found that she has to seek out many new voters to solicit their support an aide to the senator said that perhaps onethird of the voters in the redesigned 36th senate district are new to mrs oppenheimer in the redistricting , which redraws political borders every 10 years to conform to population shifts , mrs oppenheimer lost a solid democratic bloc in mount vernon as well as the republican village of eastchester she absorbed mount pleasant and north castle , which vote republican , as well as ossining , which has a slight democratic edge the result , she said , is a district with a 6 , 000to7 , 000 democratic edge and a lot of new issues i got the general motors plant in north tarrytown , scheduled for closure in 1995 , and i also find that i represent four prisons , including the sing sing correctional facility in ossining , she added her challenger , robert weininger , is a newcomer to politics a trial lawyer for 13 years and a harrison resident for 8 , he grew up in queens , attended the university of wisconsin and the washington university school of law he said his interest in seeking office followed his being asked last year to represent philip marracini , the republican candidate for town supervisor , in a highprofile first amendment case the town of harrison was attempting to enforce a local ordinance against campaign signs , mr weininger said we got a restraining order barring the town from enforcing the ordinance against homeowners displaying the challenger s campaign signs mr marracini lost by 11 votes , but mr weininger was bitten by the political bug a number of people pointed up the need to have fresh blood infused into the political arena , he said i adopted their premise , which was that part of the problem we 're facing today is that we 're leaving our state legislature to a political class mr weininger says mrs oppenheimer lacks influence in the state senate , and he said that one bill she was able to get passed would have raised new rochelle s sales tax by 1 percent if it had not been blocked in the assembly by ron tocci , a reference to ronald c tocci , a fourterm democrat from new rochelle that bill would have killed what remains of new rochelle s retail trade , mr weininger said , prompting mrs oppenheimer to note that the mayor and city council had begged for this 1 percent addition to the city sales tax , to help pay for police and firefighters the alternative , raising property taxes , is coming under increasing resistance from homeowners on the matter of legislative effectiveness , mrs oppenheimer said she gets all of the local bills through , those relating to the county or communities within her district on larger issues , such as the environment protecting habitats for endangered species , for example the problem is a philosophical difference with the republican leadership in some cases , rankandfile republicans do no better than we democrats do in getting approval disagreement on public housing mr weininger and mrs oppenheimer disagree sharply over the need for public housing he has declared in a published statement that the socalled affordable housing problem is a figment of the imagination of outoftouch incumbents like suzi oppenheimer and of developers like andrew cuomo who , he said , create problems where none exist and then rush to solve them with government subsidies mr weininger was referring to a proposed affordablehousing project in harrison , backed by members of the town board but opposed by some neighborhood groups he said that during this year s second quarter , 10 percent of 1 , 382 residential units sold for less than 100 , 000 and another 25 percent sold for less than 200 , 000 mrs oppenheimer said mr weininger does not address the problem of supply and demand in harrison , she said , there are 150 residents of the town on a list to buy 14 proposed units and 54 others residents , all of harrison , who want to rent another 14 proposed units the average purchase price , countywide , is 287 , 000 , and who can afford that \? she said mr weininger has conservative party support and is also running on the independent taxpayers party the righttolife candidate is daniel j gough the westchester coalition for legal abortion has endorsed mrs oppenheimer , saying that while mr weininger favors continuing medicaid financing for abortions , he also supports mandatory parental involvement 'i'm sick of campaigning' while mrs oppenheimer is still considered the favorite in her race , despite the apparently reduced support in registration , two other state senate races in the county appear safer for republicans , even though one of them is all but certain to mark the end of a 14year republican incumbency
pittsburgh , oct 9 his distinction entering the national league championship series was his 324 average for 1992 his distinction since then had been that he was a good quote the job at hand for andy van slyke in the seventh inning tonight was to at last do and not merely say something significant the pirates had gained their first lead in 46 consecutive championship series innings only to see it vanish in the seventh but now they had men on second and third with one out another failure by the heart of the order would threaten to extinguish the remaining pulse of the pirates van slyke , who could n't manage a hit , nonetheless got the job done he fought atlanta reliever mike stanton hard and then he nailed a pitch deep enough to right field to score gary redus with the run that lifted the pirates to a 32 triumph over the braves and sudden life at two games to one we 're out of the emergency room , van slyke said now we have to see about our longterm prognosis van slyke had come into his third straight nlcs with an unparalleled personal season he 'd conquered chronic back problems and a historic inability to hit lefthanders to fight for the batting title until the season s final week he finished with 199 hits and a 297 average against lefthanders but the playoffs had degenerated into another odyssey of failure and frustration his career postseason averages of 091 , 208 and 160 were n't destined to be forgotten as van slyke lurched and lunged his way to a 111 mark as the pirates fell behind two games to none to the braves in a cruel twist his hardest shots had been foul balls , certain home runs in game 1 that had hooked into irrelevancy he 'd been the picture of embarrassment as he struck out looking against john smoltz in that opening game , and then he 'd been the bat that killed the only legitimate inning of offense the pirates had mustered van slyke grounded out in the seventh inning of game 2 after four runs had crossed the plate , an 80 deficit had been sliced in half and two men were aboard comfortable each time up i have said over and over that we 've won as 25 men , and we 've lost as 25 men , van slyke said and tonight was the best metaphor for the season we could offer we got lots of contributions the early donations were given by the braves van slyke grounded out to first in the opening inning with redus , who had hit a leadoff triple , perched on third barry bonds then followed with another out , and three rivers stadium had every right to suspect it would be another one of those nights for the pirates , the minidynasty of major disappointment i felt good about every atbat tonight , but i suppose because i hit the ball hard at somebody the first two times it was stupid hitting all the same , van slyke said but van slyke yanked a double into the corner in right to start the sixth against tom glavine he scored on jeff king s subsequent double and suddenly there was hope in pittsburgh after the game , though , van slyke s mind returned to the seventh the score had been leveled at 22 , and the moment of truth had arrived after a redus single and a jay bell double atlanta manager bobby cox opted to remove glavine and bring in stanton , a nasty lefthander who had smothered the minnesota twins in last season s world series i was n't exactly happy to see stanton , said van slyke , who had struck out against him in the ninth inning of game 1 he s fresh , he throws 95 miles an hour , and he s got that slider , that terrible , terrible slider i do n't know too many guys that would have felt comfortable van slyke could have been forgiven for quickly feeling overmatched he looked at a strike he swung and missed for another three rivers stadium breathed deeply he then took a pitch outside the strike zone and then he took perhaps his worst but most most effective swing of the night when he barely fouled off a stanton slider i thought i was dead , he said the ekg went straight but i got another chance i was glad for it his next swing then wrought a real chance for the pirates to get back into the series photo pirates' andy van slyle doubling in the sixth his sac fly in the seventh scored gary redus with the winning run \( barton silverman the new york times \)
seattle , sept 16 outsiders , many of them women , have leaped to the forefront this year in american politics , but tuesday s primary election in washington state has produced perhaps the most powerful variation yet in sexual politics a candidate for the united states senate running as just a mom in tennis shoes casting herself as a working mother with suburban concerns , the democratic candidate , patty murray , running in an open primary , outpolled all her opponents in both parties , including two betterknown male politicians she and the no 2 votegetter , representative rod chandler , a fiveterm republican congressman from the seattle suburb of bellevue , will face off in the general election ms murray s victory raised the number of majorparty female nominees for the senate to 11 a record , by one six of those candidates , including ms murray , are given a strong chance of winning in november there are now only two women in the senate the tide of women in national politics is even more evident in races for the united states house of representatives fifteen women candidates , including three from this state , were nominated for house seats on tuesday , bringing the total to 105 a 50 percent increase over the previous high of 70 women but particularly after the unsuccessful effort by geraldine a ferraro in new york , it was ms murray s victory that had many women leaders cheering today her campaign , sneered at by many political insiders in seattle , succeeded by playing on a nonpartisan image of a harried mom caring for two children and aging parents , while holding a job and making dinner several nights a week 'most perfect symbol' starting the campaign last fall against senator brock adams , who later withdrew after a newspaper published accusations of sexual misconduct against him , mrs murray stayed with her single theme by shunning labels like feminist or liberal , although she says she is philosophically close to both definitions , ms murray was able to win impressively in both rural and urban counties , among men and women patty murray may be the most perfect symbol we 've had to date of what the year of the woman is all about , said harriett woods , president of the national women s poltical caucus , and a former candidate for senate from missouri here is a woman who has none of the lofty credentials , but she represents just what voters are looking for an outsider , who is close to them and understands their lives the mom in tennis shoe line was based on an incident , 12 years ago , that propelled ms murray into politics , she said when ms murray went to the washington state capital in olympia to protest budget cuts at community colleges , a male legislator replied , you ca n't do anything you 're just a mom in tennis shoes , ms murray recalled she has used the line in virtually every campaign appearance one of her television advertisements featured a reenactment of the encounter with an unnamed state legislator even before male audiences , ms murray has railed against all the guys in grey suits and red ties who control the congress 'a different role model' next january i'm going to take my tennis shoes back to the united states senate , ms murray told a cheering crowd last night , though she was wearing red pumps i 've watched women come into politics thinking they had to become a man to succeed , ms murray said in an interview what i am is a different role model this mom in tennis shoes is what i really am i did n't see anything like me during the clarence thomas hearings at age 41 and a mother of two children , ms murray is not as much the political novice as she casts herself a teacher at a community college , she is near the end of her first term as a state senator , has been elected to a local school board and is active in neighborhood political groups she lives in the seattle suburb of shoreline she favors abortion rights and strong environmentalist policies and has promoted a number of family and educational issues for campaign funds , she relied heavily on donations from emily s list , a group that has been raising money for female candidates but ms murray was outspent by a better than 21 ratio by mr chandler , who was considered the frontrunner the results tuesday had ms murray with just under 30 percent of the total vote , mr chandler with 20 percent and a former democratic congressman , don bonker , with 18 percent two other republicans split the remaining vote chandler attack planned mr chandler said sexual issues would not affect the race he said the year of the woman is a creation of the press and said he would portray ms murray as another farleft liberal to hear patty murray talk , you 'd think the only issue of the campaign is footwear , said mr chandler he also made a strong appeal for women voters , running ads that featured his wife talking about cancer on the environment and health care , he has much more conservative positions than ms murray , though he does favor the right to abortion ms murray is part of a new wave of female candidates who do not have to talk tough and act like men to get elected , said cathy allen , a consultant for campaigns and issues related to women the backlash has come , ms allen said , and woman like patty murray are showing they can stand on their own two feet without changing who they are in addition to ms murray , the other women nominated by major parties for senate races who are doing well in polls in their states are five democrats in california , representative barbara boxer and former mayor dianne feinstein of san francisco in illinois , carol mosely braun in pennsylvania , lynn yeakel , and in maryland , senator barbara mikulski , who is seeking a second term photo after declaring victory in the democratic primary for a senate seat from washington , the candidate who portrayed herself as just a mom in tennis shoes , patty murray , accepted congratulations from a supporter only after shedding her more formal footwear she was the state s top votegetter \( theresa fare for the new york times \)
woodbourne , n , y , dec 9 among the ways of retribution inside the winered walls of the state prison here , none is felt as dearly as the simple breezes from the outside world that regularly tease john massey , dean of the lifers , as he attends to his duties near the exit of the departure center and says goodbye to fellow convicts whose prison time is done i'm looking at that door and i'm getting that breeze every time the door is opened , says mr massey , a 48yearold convicted murderer , kidnapper and robber now in the third decade of a sentence of 25 years to life and there i am , with the door constantly being shut in my face , he says , talking evenly , patiently with eight other longterm convicts about surviving atop the glacier of time they have amassed for themselves mindful of how indulging rage and ennui can simply compound the experience of prison , the nine men have organized as the longtermers committee at the woodbourne correctional facility they busily search for the best ways of fulfilling their sentences and convincing authorities that despite current sentencing and parole practices , they deserve a fresh chance sooner rather than later a hopehungry fraternity the men are part of a lifers' network scattered across the 67prison state system , a hopehungry fraternity of some of society s more horrific criminals who nevertheless , prison officials say , are probably the most rehabilitationminded convicts and the strongest leaders i find in my experience murderers are the best bet , the state commissioner of corrections , thomas a coughlin 3d , flatly attests , supporting a legislative proposal he and others have made it would allow such prisoners time off for good behavior , giving them a chance of parole before they finish serving their minimum sentences the proposal might not go down easily in a society more inclined to crack down on violent criminals it is intended to provide prisoners , particularly those with terms of 15 years and more , with some outside , reliable incentive for early rehabilitation , and to create a distinction between the prisoner who advances in education and behavior and the one who lounges at the television set or card table a lot of time , people do n't want to hear this sort of talk about murderers , said commissioner coughlin his goodbehavior proposal would essentially restore an approach that had been in effect until 1965 when tighter power was accorded to parole officials twentyfive other states have similar plans 'not going to kill again' after they get their head together , these people are not going to kill again , said mr coughlin it s interesting in the first seven or eight years inside they can be the biggest pains of all , but then they 're no trouble they become introspective , go to college , join organizations and from maybe years 12 to 25 , they are very productive they 're the ones , if i got a problem inside , i talk to them even so , the proposal for mercy would seem to have little chance before a legislature well committed to increased incarceration as the chief method of meeting the modern wave of violent crime that method , which includes making it harder to be paroled , has seen the prison population triple to more than 60 , 000 in the last 20 years the proposal would let prisoners who behave well become eligible for their first parole hearing up to onethird sooner after 10 years for the 15yearsto life prisoner and after 16 years and eight months for the 25yearstolifer it s time to inject a healthy dose of realism into our sentencing policies , declared state senator joseph l galiber , the bronx democrat who is a chief proponent of the change some prisoners are incorrigible , but it is equally true that others are able to turn their lives around one reason for change , he argues , is that the prison budget is excessively swollen by a crackdown strategy and has begun eating up scarce state money for education and other needs snows and sugarplum dreams such a proposal is the stuff of sugarplum dreams for lifers here inside woodbourne prison , where holiday snows in the catskills can be contemplated from the barred windows , dusting the cow pastures that stretch toward the open horizon the prisoners have their hopes up , as well , for a shift in the criminal justice mood once presidentelect bill clinton takes office they speculate that since mr clinton supported capital punishment as governor of arkansas and thereby avoided being labeled as soft on crime , he might be freer to speak up now for other prison revisions this would reverse what prisoners and some professionals say is new york s paradox gov mario m cuomo is known for staunchly opposing capital punishment but also for avoiding executive clemency and for upholding rigorous life sentences as his demonstrated alternative to the death penalty as spokesman for the longtermers , mr massey was recently let out for a few hours to testify at sing sing prison at an unusual legislative hearing held by mr galiber there , lifers and several wardens and prison administrators from around the state complained of the openended vagueness of current procedures that allow parole officials to simply extend sentences indefinitely in twoyear intervals once the lifers have passed 15 or 25year minimums raul russi , chairman of the state board of parale , has said that officials must heed the vibes of the community in focusing more on the original crime than on a prisoner s progress in rehabilitation 'man can change if he wants'

east side decorated with colorful impressionist prints and soft leather chairs once a week , though , dr sanders walks a few blocks to a cramped , dimly lighted building to treat patients whose broken lives reveal another side of her wealthy neighborhood the building houses the neighborhood coalition for shelter , a group home for mentally ill homeless people , many of whom have wandered the streets for years suffering from untreated diseases like schizophrenia and depression dr sanders volunteers at the home because it cannot afford a psychiatrist to conduct evaluations and prescribe often strikingly effective medication she is one of 40 or so volunteers at the project for psychiatric outreach to the homeless , a group of psychiatrists trying to ease a chronic shortage of care for the estimated 20 , 000 mentally ill homeless people in new york city the psychiatrists have treated more than 2 , 000 people since the project s founding in 1986 , plying their trade in small shelters and group homes that would otherwise have to send their patients to overburdened public hospitals and clinics an anchor for a drifting life the project matches volunteers like dr jack hirschowitz , chief of psychiatry at the veterans administration hospital in the bronx , with patients like 65yearold claude trahan , whose story is a typical one at frederic fleming house , a group home for the mentally ill homeless at 443 west 22d street in chelsea mr trahan said that after his wife died , leaving no one to care for him , he lost his apartment and drifted for years from the street into shelters , hospitals and clinics and back again the doctors he saw , he said , were so overwhelmed with patients that they had little time to focus on him , and none was able to successfully treat his schizophrenia , which is thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and leaves its victims with difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy mr trahan s life has improved at fleming house , which is financed in part by the city and by trinity episcopal church encouraged by dr hirschowitz , who volunteers three hours a week at fleming house , mr trahan takes his medication and that controls the worst symptoms survival before medication it makes me feel much better to talk to him , he said of dr hirschowitz it s helped me a lot the project s psychiatrists say that perhaps the most difficult aspect of their work is convincing mentally ill homeless people that they need care many suffer from depression , paranoia and hallucinations , but unless they are a danger to themselves or others , they cannot be forced into treatment dr katherine falk , the project s founder , said that it was difficult to help these people on the street , explaining that many do not understand that they are sick the basics of survival food and shelter often seem more important to them than seeing a doctor and taking medication , she said dr sanders described a patient at the neighborhood coalition , at 211 east 81st street , who had been homeless for years and suffered from severe depression , but neglected to take his medication he had a pharmacy s worth of pills in his room dr sanders said after we had been together for a while he was willing to let me into his room and wade through the medications , many of which had expired years ago that was a turning point in his treatment he s taking his medicine now and he s much better a bonus for the staff the project , which has a budget of nearly 100 , 000 and is financed by grants and donations , has been struggling to pay its bills , which mostly cover administrative costs the city s department of mental health says it is trying to cobble together some aid the doctors are doing a very worthwhile service , there s no question about that , said norman d katz , a spokesman for the department directors of some of the 15 programs served by the project said that the volunteers have lessened the burden on their staffs , which are trying to help patients overcome obstacles to recovery besides mental illness , including alcohol and drug addictions , financial difficulties and social problems carl siciliano ,

hartford , aug 18 putting cocaine into a baby s bloodstream an hour after birth would be a parental act under connecticut law and would bring down the full weight of the state s childwelfare authority but one hour before birth , it would be none of the state s business the harsh logic of that position was probably inherent in connecticut s laws covering the unborn and the rights of women to abortions on demand , legal experts say the state has one of the strongest abortionrights laws in the nation but the state supreme court has now stripped away any illusion the court said in a decision on monday that if an individual s legal rights only begin at the moment of birth , then the state was wrong to have taken a child from a mother who had injected drugs into her system and thus her baby s only hours before the delivery not yet a 'parent' the fetus was not a child under the law , the court said therefore the mother was not yet a parent , and her actions , however egregious , in the words of the court , did not constitute child abuse although courts in other states , including florida and south carolina , have thrown out criminal prosecutions of mothers based on prebirth drug use , the connecticut high court is the first in the nation , lawyers say , to go further and say that taking the child away for protective purposes is illegal because it assumes rights of the unborn that do not exist even among the staunchest advocates of abortion rights , seeing their philosophy writ so large , with all the implications exposed , has evoked some discomfort i do n't think any of us feels any pleasure in it , said susan l yolen , a spokeswoman for planned parenthood of connecticut but ms yolen said the decision was still right because the alternative would be a treacherous road that could eventually erode abortion rights she and other abortionrights advocates also expressed concern that the very stark nature of the case could lead to a legal backlash by the state legislature addicted since age of 11 the mother in the case , who was not identified , had already had one older child permanently taken away because of her drug addiction , and she had shot up with cocaine even after her water had broken and she was waiting to go the hospital , according to the court decision she had been addicted since the age of 11 it makes no sense , said one state lawmaker , representative robert farr , who said he would push for a change in the law in the next legislative session mr farr , a lawyer who has represented children in childabuse cases , said he believed that if the state could not intervene based on a mother s actions before birth , the end result would be more injured children because more babies would be sent home with mothers who could not or would not care for them this decision is saying , yes , you have to send the child home with the mother even if it endangers the child , ' mr farr said the rights we 're dealing with here are not the rights of the unborn but the rights of the born the decision has also exposed what legal experts say is a double standard in many courtrooms around the nation judges have been reluctant to actually jail mothers who use drugs during pregnancy and in the more than 17 cases appealed by the american civil liberties union on behalf of arrested mothers , every charge has been thrown out , according to figures from the organization but the record is different where such cases have been presented as civil intervention to protect children in those actions , judges have been much more willing to take away babies based on prenatal actions in new york over the last three years , for example , at least two judges one on long island and one in new york city allowed the removal of a child at birth based on a positive drug test , said lynn paltrow , litigation director for the center for reproductive law and policy , an abortionrights advocacy group based in manhattan in both cases , she said , the mothers eventually got their babies back and the decisions were thus not appealed but new york also has a policy that was apparently lacking in the connecticut case two years ago , the state s social services department issued an interpretation of state law telling childwelfare workers that a test indicating drugs were taken before a child s birth was not grounds for removing the child a spokesman for the department , terrance mcgrath , said that since the opinion was distributed , there have been far fewer instances of women having children taken away based on maternityward toxicology reports sandy cooney , a spokesman for the new jersey human services department , said drug tests at birth were evaluated on a casebycase basis , but no figures were available , he said , showing any pattern to how those cases were decided for justice david m borden , who wrote the connecticut decision on behalf of a unanimous fivemember court panel , each road offered to the court seemed perilous this argument has emotional appeal , he said regarding the state s efforts to take the child but that argument would have us 'look back' throughout the entire period of the pregnancy for the causes of the child s postnatal injuries , he said we disagree with it as the appropriate reading

democratic candidates labored furiously yesterday to capitalize on the strong victory they expect gov bill clinton to capture today in new york state , while republicans in a variety of races worked just as hard to avoid being swept away in a local democratic landslide from a united states senate race that has become the costliest and possibly the nastiest in the nation , to the struggle for control of the state legislature in albany , the democrats' expected strong showing at the top of the ticket was having a marked impact on campaigns all the way down the ballot state attorney general robert abrams , the democratic candidate for the senate , and his republican opponent , senator alfonse m d'amato , both stumped the state in lastminute drives for votes articles , page b1 mr abrams cast himself as an inexorable part of the clintongore team that he believes should go to washington mr d'amato played down the effects on his campaign of a possible clinton victory in new york and assured voters that it was fine to vote for the democratic presidential nominee and then for him in recent days , he has even put a democrat , former mayor edward i koch of new york city , on radio commercials to say , i'm voting for bill clinton and al d'amato the republican flight from the bushquayle ticket was also evident in a new york city race for congress , where representative bill green , a manhattan republican , ran television commercials that flash a newspaper endorsement of mr clinton and mr abrams , both democrats , and then of himself legislative races and democrats were hoping that their strength at the top of the ticket might extend to state legislative races , where they are looking for the five victories they need to take back control of the 61member state senate several democratic senate candidates , aiming for a long stretch of mr clinton s coattails , have distributed literature linking themselves to the clintongore ticket the democrats swept to control of the state assembly in the antirepublican , watergateinspired year of 1974 , but they still face an uphill climb in the state senate this year the republicans , who have controlled that chamber for the last 27 years , drew districts to their advantage during this year s reapportionment and have poured money and workers into races where their incumbents , including the senate majority leader , ralph j marino of oyster bay , li , are seen as at all vulnerable at an upstate airport campaign stop in broome county , mr d'amato was asked whether a clinton victory in new york today would help mr abrams win the race for senate i do n't think so , mr d'amato replied here in new york , we have some sophisticated voters who are not afraid to split the ticket we 're going to win it in upstate new york after years of relatively low voter turnout , intense interest in the presidential race has fueled a surge in voter registration in new york , although few analysts expect it to result in a turnout rivaling the modernday record of 75 percent in the 1960 presidential election won by john f kennedy the state board of elections announced yesterday that 9 , 193 , 391 new yorkers were registered to vote , just 14 , 000 below the record set in 1972 , the year after 18yearolds where first allowed to register more than a million new yorkers have signed up to vote in the last four months , clearly one of the largest shortterm increases in state history , the board said it could not provide a breakdown at this point of how many of the new registrants were democrats , who have long outnumbered republicans by roughly three to two in new york , but it noted that more than 50 percent of the new registrants were in heavily democratic new york city still , it is far simpler to register to vote than to actually go to the polls , and many analysts said it was difficult to provide a reliable estimate of the number of voters who will turn out today showers in forecast one of the classic vagaries behind voting patterns , of course , is the weather , and it is not expected to be nice , at least in the early part of the day forecasters predicted some showers and temperatures in the low 50 s across most of new york state and even as politicians were predicting a heavy democratic turnout for the presidential race , there were some indications in polls and interviews with voters in recent days that voter disgust with the tenor of the united states senate campaign in new york could cause more than the usual dropoff in voting from the top of the ticket typically , 6 or 7 percent of the electorate cast a presidential vote and then skip a senate race or other statewide contest on the ballot , said lee m miringoff , director of the marist college institute for public opinion but he said that this year his polling indicated the dropoff could be larger as if to dramatize the potential closeness of the senate race , mr abrams plans to continue campaigning on election day , driving to port washington , li , at 6 am and taking a commuter train back he then planned to continue campaigning in the city throughout the day we want to get every last vote , he said cuomo

like super bowl sunday , election night is one of those seminational holidays when many americans have a reason to celebrate while many others sometimes even the majority are plunged into mourning when will you know what group you belong to \? this , of course , depends in large part on how close the vote is but there are certain signs that are available early to help canny voters get a jump on the competition this year , all the networks are subscribing to the same exit polls , surveys of voters as they leave the voting booth , so the networks will all be predicting the outcome of the election using the same information because of this , there will be none of the usual scrambling to call the statebystate results early , and viewers will get the same predictions at pretty much the same time on all the major networks this is a guide to what to look for while watching tonight s coverage 6 pm the polls close in indiana and kentucky if the exit polls show one candidate far ahead , the networks may predict the winner of each of these states on the basis of the polls but if exit polls show the races to be close , the networks will wait to see the results from key voting precincts for doityourself punditry , indiana could provide the first important clue of the evening indiana is a state that usually goes republican , said bill wheatley , who directs the political coverage for nbc news it s the home of dan quayle if that state is too close to call , that will not be a hopeful sign for the president cnn begins its election coverage at 4 30 pm abc , cbs and nbc will not begin until 7 pm , but will issue reports on their evening newscasts as they come in 7 pm polls begin to close in six states , florida , georgia , new hampshire , south carolina , vermont and virginia these states are a potential windfall for election night prognosticators normally , new hampshire votes republican , but recent polls suggest gov bill clinton could win it if he does , it could be another ominous signal for president bush florida , with its 25 electoral votes , is the first big state to report results ross perot is expected to be a significant factor in this state but according to virtually all practical scenarios , mr bush must win florida if he is to win the election if bush carries florida , he s alive and well for another hour , said hal bruno , the political director of abc news if not , his comeback is not going to happen 7 30 pm the precincts close in three more states , north carolina , ohio and west virginia the clinton and bush camps each view ohio , with 21 electoral votes , as crucial if the president wins ohio and florida , it could be a long night if mr clinton wins ohio , expect the election to be called earlier 8 pm the polls close in 18 more states , including illinois , michigan , texas , new jersey and connecticut if the shape of the race has not already become clear , it will at this point if mr bush and mr clinton are splitting the big states if , for example , mr clinton is winning michigan and illinois and mr bush is taking new jersey and texas then it is fairly certain that the result of the election will not be known until the west coast returns come in if one is winning most or all of the key states , the race is likely to be over before the voting ends in california , at 11 pm eastern time altogether , the states whose polls close at or before 8 pm have 331 electoral votes \( a state has as many electoral votes as the number of its representatives and senators combined \) to win , a candidate must assemble 270 electoral votes in theory , then , the networks could call the election by 9 pm , the time the polls close in new york \( in 1980 , nbc predicted ronald reagan would be the next president at 8 15 pm \) but few political analysts expect this to happen tonight in the 1988 election , an electoral landslide for mr bush , cbs called the race at 9 15 , while nbc waited more conservatively until 10 pm because most states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis , a candidate can lose the popular vote and still win the electoral vote but the last time that happened was long before television , in 1888

fort worth , dec 5 he has , with a mixture of paranoia and apologia , banned the friendly fort worth public from his practice sessions he has refused to open his mouth , a mouth that is usually loquacious if not always gracious , to the news media for fear of being hounded about his domestic doldrums instead of his davis cup desires his discomfort at the event he had looked forward to all year is tangible , and he has welcomed the protective cocoon the united states tennis association has woven around him in deference to his wishes and to his dozen years of davis cup patriotics today , john mcenroe competed , as planned , alongside pete sampras in a davis cup final round that could be his last whether married to the actress tatum o'neal , spurned by her , separated or somewhere in between , mcenroe made it clear that recapturing the davis cup his nation surrendered to france without his help in last year s final is of utmost personal and professional significance you always want to go out on a high , he said after helping his team beat sweden in the semifinal , and for me , davis cup has always been the ultimate the pure side of tennis the other side here this weekend has been the unsettling drama of mcenroe s attempt to cope , in the glare of a very public international event , with what ought to be a very private problem a marriage that is , according to the unsympathetic eagleeye of some of the press , in the throes of its own final round that scenario has turned a tense situation tenser mcenroe in different spotlight several television camera crews , none of them in town to cover the actual tennis competition , have set up shop on street corners hoping to catch mcenroe in an emotive moment so far , he has acknowledged them only by tugging down the brim of his black cowboy hat and turning his back already hailed by sampras as my father figure on the court , mcenroe has devoted himself to that role in triplicate off the court in fort worth , he has been a solitary figure in notsosolitary confinement his three children , along with his brother , patrick , accompanied him here his parents , who cut short a trip to italy when news of the split reached them , arrived in fort worth on friday to provide further moral support he goes nowhere without his two sons , whose cheery banter has been his best buffer against pessimism kevin , 6 years old , and sean , 5 , are his nearest helpmates as he not only contemplates the end of his career , which he anticipated , but also the end of his marriage , which he did not three years ago , they were the reason he fretted over attempting a serious comeback i did n't want to have a couple of kids and not be with them , he mused during an interview in 1990 about his mixed emotions , and i did n't want to say i had to come back to tennis regardless of what happened to my marriage but mcenroe was n't shy about admitting that the demands inherent in a topeschelon tennis career caused periodic contretemps in his 1986 marriage to o'neal he compared himself to a broadway star who gears himself to peak during his performances i found you ca n't live your life that way , you ca n't be a very pleasant person , and tatum made me very aware of that , he said mcenroe said that he would prefer to forsake tennis than have a pretend marriage , and he indicated that he did n't expect o'neal not to resume her acting just because the end of his own career was in sight we both had success at an early age , but we 're not old people , and i know she wants to do some things on her own , he said since then , the couple added a daughter , emily , to their family when she was born in 1991 , mcenroe was ecstatic she s the first girl grandchild in the family it s been a big hit with the inlaws , he said mcenroe has left most of emily s daily outings here to a nanny whenever he takes the helm of the stroller as they navigate the block around this downtown hotel , photographers loom in and zoom in he has eschewed bodyguards , preferring to have no strangers in proximity , but his good friend and longtime agent , sergio palmieri , is often at his elbow living in limbo like a man in purgatory , he has trudged wordlessly from the hotel suite , where he is sequestered with his children and a fax machine , across the brick courtyard to the practice court there , with sampras on his side and andre agassi and varying partners across the net , he has been able to immerse himself in tennis , pausing only to wave to his sons on the sidelines in the heat of competition , he has been his old self slamming his racquet to the ground after shots that do n't answer his bent for perfection , berating himself , scowling at agassi s returns on wednesday evening , after twice being seared by agassi ground strokes , mcenroe snatched up a tennis ball and , in mock fury , winged it at agassi mcenroe has poured all of his animation into his play this week , whether with his real kids or the youngsters who are on his team right now , he does n't think he 'll ever be happy again , but maybe the tennis is a little break from those thoughts , said one davis cup official as he watched mcenroe putting his all into practice mcenroe s teammates , all of them a decade younger and unmarried , have refused to say anything about his frame of mind , but they have been adamant about his indispensable presence here whether in the role of player or benchwarmer , there is no davis cup contender more ardent than mcenroe mcenroe has remained the consummate inspiration to them , said

is it somebody s excuse \? i really do n't know kwamain dixon , who is 16 years old and lives in the hartley houses , one of city s three public housing projects , seems to know exactly what happened he said he felt exhilarated as he and other youths smashed windows and chased a police car from the project s parking lot on may 1 we felt good because we had the cops on the run , he said they were running from us we were n't running from them , for once the teenager said he felt angry about everything , not just the king verdict , as he threw rocks at motorists and shouted , no justice , no peace ! he said he was the subject himself of a police search for selling drugs when he had none it was worth it , he said of the may 1 disturbance we 're just tired of being pushed around it made me feel good to get all of my frustration out the anger that boiled to the surface may 1 has caused many residents here to question what has happened to the community that they thought they had created , a harmonious suburban way of life that the nation saw in the home of rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show for decades , the city , which is 18 percent black , has peacefully integrated its neighborhoods the new rochelle school system was the site of the north s first courtordered desegregation in 1961 , when a federal judge ordered the closing of lincoln elementary school , which was 94 percent black the next two years were marked by racial tension as the school board resisted the court order but in 1963 , the incoming board ordered the school razed and its students were bused to other schools without incident we used to have meetings in our homes to see what could be done to close the school so that the children were not deprived of their education , said miriam jackson , the 81yearold former chairwoman of the county s democratic party it worked out beautifully the city manager , matthew iarocci , who remembers growing up in a neighborhood that he describes as a league of nations , said people do get along quite well it gives you a more sophisticated and more tolerant perspective when you grow up with other people when many northeastern cities were touched by racial strife in the 1960 s and 1970 s , black civil rights leaders here formed youth groups called police partners that patrolled the streets and were credited with helping the city stay calm government money also pumped life into programs that provided job training and other services for the poor money for education there was plenty of funding back then , said napoleon holmes , the longtime president of new rochelle s branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people when you had these types of funding , you did n't have joblessness like you have today you did n't have hungry people like today you did n't have people filled with despair there was something for everybody who wanted something , especially education and training as the money has dried up , so has mr holmes s hope for change i'm trying to retire from everything , said mr holmes , an 61yearold nightclub owner i 've been frustrated for some time calvin walton , a black political scientist who has lived for 22 years in a mixed , middleclass neighborhood in central new rochelle , said he was not surprised by the violence rather he thought it was sadly inevitable in a city that he suggests lives in a fantasy about its real attitudes about race mr walton , who has six children , still remembers with anger when his youngest son was ordered into a police squad car last year while on his way to work because someone had reported that a black male had stolen a car once a black person is stopped by a racist police officer , he will all of a sudden discover he is a black man , said mr walton , who teaches at touro college in manhattan

london , dec 21 when margaret thatcher became prime minister in 1979 , the top personal income tax rate was 83 percent , a level that she said sapped incentives to work harder and create more wealth in a policy shift foreshadowing similar though less drastic moves across the atlantic , britain drove down the top rate over several years to 40 percent , where it remains today but reductions for people in the middleincome brackets were considerably less , and for all taxpayers , loopholes were tightened or eliminated and as income tax rates fell , the government was raising other taxes , most notably the valueadded tax , a form of sales tax on goods at the retail , wholesale and producer levels that levy , which stood at 8 percent in 1979 , is now 175 percent the result a continued increase in overall taxation even during the heyday of a taxcutter as fervent as mrs thatcher upward pattern holds true as the world s other major industrial democracies have struggled to find tax policies that balance deficit reduction , economic stimulus , porkbarrel politics and social welfare concerns , much the same pattern has held true the public image of what s happened in many countries is that there have been reasonably significant and in some cases dramatic reductions in tax rates , said jonathan i leape , a lecturer in economics at the london school of economics but , mr leape said , the amount of taxes people pay has not changed much in some cases , it has actually increased in most countries , public resistance to higher or new taxes has been relatively muted , particularly in comparison with the united states , where the political sensitivity to raising taxes in any form has remained extremely high taxpayers in the united states continue to pay less on a relative basis than their counterparts in almost any other industrialized country and while nations from spain to japan have significantly expanded their use of consumption taxes such as a valueadded tax or levies on specific products like gasoline , the united states has remained largely dependent on levies on income and profits economists say it is difficult to isolate the effect of taxpolicy changes on economic growth and a nation s fiscal condition , since other factors , including reductions in government spending , play key roles as well but they said the rising tax burdens in many nations had helped bring deficits down over the last decade a choice for clinton in the united states , by contrast , the federal budget deficit has continued rising over the last decade and although consumption taxes such as a valueadded tax have problems they risk putting a higher proportional burden on less affluent taxpayers economists said the incoming clinton administration might have no choice but to consider them if it was serious about eventually reducing the deficit it would seem that in the us there is not really a lot of room to increase personal or corporate taxes , said gary hufbauer , a senior fellow at the institute for international economics in washington there is hardly any way clinton can achieve his targets for deficit reduction unless he goes with a vat or a broadbased energy tax among the 24 industrialized nations that are members of the organization for economic cooperation and development , an international research center based in paris , total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from an average of 352 percent in 1980 to 388 percent in 1990 , despite widespread cuts in top personal income tax rates and some reductions in corporate rates even excluding social security taxes , which are rising rapidly in many nations to finance retirement and unemployment programs , tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from 269 percent in 1980 to 295 percent a decade later , the oecd said in the united states , tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product increased only to 299 percent in 1990 from 295 percent in 1980 excluding social security , the figure actually fell to 211 percent from 218 percent over that period true picture masked but the general trends mask to some degree the widely varying policies enacted in individual nations , each coping with its own political and economic circumstances and the gross figures mask essential differences between the united states and most other industrialized countries , where , for instance , national health programs are paid for with tax money and gasoline taxes help pay for mass transit gas taxes in the united states as high as those in europe which can be as high as 200 percent would be impracticable and even unwise , economists argue , because of the vast distances that must be traveled in areas with sparse populations germany had been cutting rates over the last decade , dropping the maximum rate on personal income to 50 percent from 53 percent in 1990 but the staggering costs of reunification with east germany forced an increase last year in taxes on cigarettes and gasoline , among other goods and services , and a oneyear solidarity tax a 75 percent surcharge on gross personal income that expired in july in spain , taxes have been rising as the government scrambles under a taxandspend policy to modernize the country and bring its economy into line with the richer european community nations still , most nations have been generally guided by the notion that rates should be reduced , but that taxes should be levied more broadly and more fairly
peering far away and deeper in time , the hubble space telescope has caught a clear glimpse of more than 300 galaxies clustered four billion lightyears away , giving astronomers their first detailed view of galactic structure at a time when the solar system was just beginning the new observations , described yesterday by astronomers , showed that starforming activity was much more prevalent in galaxies then than it is now analysis of the pictures also revealed that diskshaped spiral galaxies were much more common then , but that the giant conglomerations of stars were undergoing major structural change through collisions with each other , galactic merging and other turbulent forces astronomers said the findings had important implications for theories of how galaxies have evolved and are continuing to evolve at an apparently rapid rate what the astronomers think they have seen but are not yet sure could be an even more impressive achievement in some of the hubble images they think they have detected the most distant cluster of galaxies yet seen the cluster may be as far as 10 billion lightyears away , or twothirds of the way back to the time of the presumed origin of the universe in the big bang a lightyear is the distance light travels in a year , or 588 trillion miles if this is indeed a cluster of galaxies that far away and early in time , the discovery will be the first opportunity for direct observations to learn how galaxies are formed , dr alan dressler , an astronomer of the carnegie institution s observatories in pasadena , calif , announced at a briefing at the national aeronautics and space administration in washington dr dressler said bright spots in the cluster do not resemble either the spiral or bulbous elliptical galaxies of today he speculated that these might not be separate galaxies but rather hot spots in galaxies whose full , extended forms are too faint to be seen at this distance these spots could be sites of vigorous star formation calculations that the cluster might be 10 billion lightyears away were based on the apparent presence in its vicinity of a quasar , one of those unusually brilliant but mystifying objects often associated with galactic cores dr dressler said in an interview that the odds are good that further observations , including spectrographic studies by the most powerful groundbased telescopes , would confirm that the cluster was as distant as the quasar other astronomers praised the new findings as a demonstration that the hubble telescope , though its optics are flawed , is a magnificent time machine previously , galactic clusters a few billion lightyears away appeared as nothing more than tiny smudges of light , and there could be no thought of seeing such structure at 10 billion years dr bruce margon , an astronomer at the university of washington in seattle , said , if this is star formation occurring 10 billion years ago , none of us expected it would be possible to see anything like that with hubble proof of galactic evolution until the fourbillionyear pictures were analyzed , astronomers could only speculate on the rate and nature of galactic evolution the new observations , dr margon said , validate 20 or 30 years of headscratching over questions of whether or not galaxies do change formation over time the hubble pictures showed that four billion years ago , at least a third of the galaxies in the clusters were spirals , the classification that includes the milky way galaxy of which earth is a member in the observable universe today , only 5 percent of the galaxies remain spirals photo dr alan dressler , an astronomer at the carnegie institution s observatories in pasadena , speaking about the discovery of what astronomers think are the most distant cluster of galaxies yet seen \( associated press \)
on thursday , as i was walking into a meeting in midtown manhattan , i stopped to talk with two volunteers collecting signatures to put ross perot on the new york state ballot they gave me an amateurish , crudely printed brochure and seemed puzzled and disappointed when i declined to sign their petition do n't you understand that ross is our only hope \? one said two hours later , when i came back out to the sidewalk , mr perot s candidacy had vanished and so had his volunteers where they are going is a question in which both major parties have a large stake the collapse of the perot movement , even more than its emergence , has the potential to create a genuine political realignment a redefinition of party loyalties that could transform the fortunes of the democrats and republicans , not just in 1992 but beyond some perot supporters will drift back to the parties they left , as many would have done anyway but what of the true believers the people to whom ross was our only hope , the people to whom mainstream politics has become anathema \? mr perot and some of his followers talk wistfully of keeping the movement alive , using it to press the major parties to respond to their demands but such efforts will certainly fail it was mr perot himself who gave the movement whatever unity it had his supporters have no concrete program to thrust upon the major parties all they had was a candidate , and he has now deserted them and yet while mr perot clearly meant very different things to different people , he did come to symbolize two large concerns that most of his followers apparently embraced evidence that other candidates share those concerns is what perot s supporter will be looking for as they consider the appeals bill clinton and george bush are beginning to make to them one was the illusion mr perot created that the people the volunteers who put him on the ballot were the real decisionmakers in his campaign and would be in his administration it is clear now that mr perot really listens to only one person , himself , as his abrupt withdrawal from the race made clear but one reason his withdrawal shocked his followers was that he had persuaded them to believe otherwise mr perot managed to revive the belief that an active , engaged citizenry can seize control of the political system and make it work he convinced previously disaffected voters that it was possible to make government into a direct expression of popular will he restored to politics something of the joy of participation that has been largely missing from national campaigns for generations if the allegiances of his supporters depend on their finding a similar sense of engagement and empowerment in one of the major parties , they almost certainly will be disappointed national politics does n't work that way anymore , if it ever did and neither party is likely to be able to create even the illusion , let alone the reality , of genuine popular participation in its national deliberations but mr perot s popularity was also a sign of another feature of contemporary politics the impatience among much of the middle class with the way both major parties seem to have defined the role of government the democrats have suffered for years from the popular \( and in many respects false \) impression that they are committed to using government to transfer wealth and power from the middle class to minorities and the poor but the republicans , having succeeded perhaps too well in exploiting the democrats' weaknesses , are suffering from an equally damaging \( and also not entirely accurate \) popular impression that they will not use government at all the result is a major political vacuum in the center that mr perot moved to fill he avoided both the redistributive image of the democrats and the antistatist image of the republicans and promised instead to make politics work better to serve the interests of the middle class he allowed his followers to imagine an active , effective government that would revive the economy and provide them with the services they have come to expect and demand unlike the illusion of direct democracy , this is a vision that the major parties can appropriate as they scramble to pick up the pieces of the perot movement the bush campaign , which believes the core of mr perot s support consisted of disaffected republicans , expects many of those people to support the president almost reflexively but the history of earlier third party and independent movements does little to support their optimism the antimasons of the 1830 s , knownothings of the 1850 s , populists of the 1890 s and followers of george wallace in the 1960 s all profited , briefly , like the perot movement , from a gulf between the ideological positions of the major parties and the sentiments of much of the public none of those movements prevailed , but all served as vehicles by which people severed existing party affiliations and created new ones the wallace movement in 1968 , for example , attracted large numbers of traditional democrats when george wallace left the scene , many , perhaps most , of his supporters began voting republican there is no guarantee mr perot s republican supporters will switch to the democrats in 1992 \( although early polls suggest many are leaning in that direction for the moment \) but the rise and fall of the perot movement has helped create the conditions for the kind of party realignment that transformed politics in the 1850 s , 1890 s , 1930 s and 1960 s the clinton campaign is already working skillfully to push that realignment along it is not trying to persuade these frustrated middle class voters that government does not and cannot work , as the republicans of the 1980 s did nor is it arguing that government s principal task is to help the dispossessed , as many democrats did in the 1960 s and 1970 s it is trying to persuade them that government can be made to work for them the challenge facing the republicans as they try to win back perot voters a formidable challenge given the antistatist posture of the party for 12 years is to do the same

as the new york shakespeare festival , for years the preeminent nonprofit theater in the united states , begins its first full season without its founder , joseph papp , who died on oct 31 last year , it is significantly different from the institution mr papp presided over with ebullience in its glory days in the last two years the staff has been cut in half , to 60 from 120 , and the budget has been reduced by more than a third , to just under 10 million from 15 million the festival s stages at the joseph papp public theater on lafayette street , which in the theater s heyday saw the first performances of such celebrated works as a chorus line , the normal heart and that championship season , are increasingly being filled with a mix of films , literary readings , solo performances and community events while plenty of plays are still being presented , a majority of the productions in the new season originated at regional theaters instead of at the public in his 31 years of running the festival he founded , the legendary mr papp produced more than 400 plays and musical works , which won 28 tony awards , 3 pulitzer prizes and nearly 100 obies though anyone replacing him would doubtless become the focus of unflattering comparison , joanne akalaitis , whom mr papp named as his successor as artistic director in august 1991 , has become a lightning rod for controversy she has alienated some artists who have said she is difficult to work with , and she has made slighting remarks about subscription audiences , though the festival greatly needs to expand its subscriber base , currently 2 , 000 , down from 3 , 500 two years ago in comparison , the roundabout theater company has 22 , 000 subscribers , and the manhattan theater club has 15 , 000 ms akalaitis appears to be risking further wrath by omitting any work by shakespeare in the coming season at the public theater , the first time in memory that he will not be represented there a strong defense for all of this , however , the shakespeare festival is strongly defended by partisans , both inside and out , who feel it is unfair to make judgments on the basis of one year without mr papp they say that ms akalaitis , who is 55 years old , did well to mount a season at all in the face of severe budget cuts and the sense of drift that had pervaded the institution during mr papp s long illness furthermore , even mr papp had his good years and his bad years , and many theater people are suspending judgment on ms akalaitis until she has had several seasons to a develop a record \( ms akalaitis has a threeyear contract that expires in the spring of 1994 \) they also point out that the festival won enthusiastic reviews for several productions last season and that ms akalaitis tried to keep the building active with readings , film series , concerts and community events ms akalaitis commissioned 21 new plays in late august and two weeks later expanded the festival s group of theater artists in residence to 21 from 3 and if the new season at the public includes no work of shakespeare , they say , there are such eagerly anticipated productions as tony kushner s aids drama angels in america a gay fantasia on national themes and jose rivera s dark urban play , marisol robin wagner , the scenic designer of crazy for you , who has been on the festival s 25member board since last year , said there was dissension on the board about the status of the festival , but that s always what happens when a parent dies and the heir apparent takes over whatever disagreement there is , he said , the feeling is that we must get behind joanne and this institution , and that the public theater must sail on several theater executives praised ms akalaitis s efforts rocco landesman , the president of jujamcyn theaters , said of her work last season , i would definitely give joanne an a minus because she was not afraid to make the bold choice but others , while agreeing that mr papp s shoes may be impossible to fill , assert that , as the playwright larry kramer said , this does n't mean you just have to settle for so much less mr kramer , the author of the normal heart , the longestrunning production at the public , is among the most vocal of the festival s critics and one of the few writers , directors , producers and other theater people interviewed for this article who were willing to be quoted by name although the public s stages have been alive this month with work and soldout audiences in the puppetry at the public series , this was hardly the case for much of last season i live in the neighborhood , mr kramer said , and you only had to walk by that empty building this season to feel a great sadness that all the vitality that joe spent so many years creating there is completely dissipated the place has been a ghost town the finances staff and budget have been slashed while new york city owns the shakespeare festival s landmark theater complex , which last spring was renamed in honor of mr papp , the city contributes less than 10 percent of the institution s budget its other public and private support has eroded so sharply that in july the festival was forced to let seven more people go and , three months earlier , requested an emergency donation of 200 , 000 from the city to put on its summer shakespeare productions at the delacorte theater in central park , says barbara j fife , new york city s deputy mayor for planning and development the city came through with the money
rochester , march 9 for five years , all that existed of this city s longawaited hyatt regency hotel was a 27story skeleton of girders and concrete that marred the downtown skyline and embarrassed city hall last week , though , the 47 million , 350room hotel finally opened but only after 10 locally based corporations , including the eastman kodak company , wilmorite inc and bausch lomb , provided 10 million in startup funds and virtually built it themselves every day , i used to look out my window and see this shell of a building , said daniel e gill , chairman and chief executive officer of bausch lomb it became important to take what had become a negative symbol of rochester and turn it into a positive one 'a business initiative' partnerships between government and business may not be unusual , but for a consortium of companies to provide all the initial equity for a hotel is almost unheard of , particularly if none of them are in the hotel industry this was a business initiative , said thomas t mooney , president of the greater rochester metro chamber of commerce business solved the mayor s problem thomas p ryan jr , the democratic mayor here for 18 years , first announced the project in the summer of 1983 as an important link with the adjacent rochester riverside convention center , which opened two years later his administration used 112 million to acquire and clear the site it also hired a buffalo developer , paul snyder , to build the project but the project ran into problems later in 1983 when federal grants were unexpectedly cut , and mr snyder could not get additional financing after a year s delay , groundbreaking took place in 1986 and hyatt , which was hired to manage the hotel , began to accept reservations , with the opening scheduled for september 1987 construction stopped , though , in early 1987 , when the building was halffinished , because of a dispute between mr snyder and the general contractor over cost overruns and late payments later in 1987 , after being unable to secure additional financing , mr snyder abandoned the project and by 1990 , when it became clear that no developer would be able to obtain the financing to complete the hotel , city officials were left with few options other than tearing down the halfbuilt structure this was the most significant embarrassment to the city for four or five years , mr mooney said the failed hotel that sat there was an image of what the city was later in 1990 , an informal breakfast meeting of local business leaders and city officials led to a breakthrough the 10 corporations agreed to invest 10 million to restart the project and obtain financing wilmorite , a nationwide shoppingmall builder , agreed to resume construction the hotel , which has created 400 jobs and is expected to provide 88 million in annual tax revenue to the city , opened on march 3 it was designed by the architectural firm of gruzen samton steinglass of new york city , which was also involved with the renovation of the royalton hotel in midtown manhattan the 10 companies , which include the xerox corporation , wegman s food markets inc , rochester gas and electric , rochester telephone , chase lincoln first bank , central trust company and gleason memorial fund , hope to sell the hotel in about seven years and expect to have annual returns of only about 5 to 7 percent 'a civic reason' the intention is to get it on its feet and then find a buyer , said thomas c wilmot , president of wilmorite people did this for a civic reason more than anything else karen noble hanson , president of corh associates , the organization formed by the 10 companies to build the hotel , said the group s members were so pleased with the outcome of the hyatt that they were now considering other projects in which to merge their investments she cited an article in the harvard business review last summer that mentioned the hotel and called rochester an experiment in communitybased economic renewal with the spirit of oldfashioned barnraisings it s really been a terrific experience in publicprivate partnership , ms hanson said photo the longawaited hyatt regency hotel in rochester opened last week after local companies provided the money to finish it on a balcony of the 27story hotel were , from left , norman j canfield jr , general manager mayor thomas p ryan jr , and karen noble hanson , president of the organization formed by the companies \( phil matt for the new york times \)
since the moment bill clinton won election , gay groups have been pressing the presidentelect to move quickly on his campaign pledge to improve gay rights but little did they know just how quickly he would move in his first specific policy decision , mr clinton focused on a gay issue , affirming his commitment to reverse the ban on homosexuals in the military his decision , which touched off a cry of protest from military leaders , presents the first clash between his campaign promises and the reality of running government it also shows how especially difficult steps on gay rights will be for the presidentelect , who supported gay rights as the democratic candidate and who received wide support , both financially and in votes , from gay americans the gay vote , some poll takers said , accounted for at least 4 percent of the ballots cast nationwide , making it equal to the jewish vote mr clinton has said little in the last few days about his decision on the military , but in an interview on gay issues on aug 20 as he was being attacked at the republican national convention for his support of gay rights , he chatted at length about his reasons for wanting the ban reversed citing costs of discharges in the aftermath of the gulf war , mr clinton said , was a study saying there was no real evidence that homosexual status , per se , disabled people from distinguished service in the military and dick cheney , the defense secretary , who i think basically has done a good job , in a remarkable burst of candor said , 'it s just a quaint little rule , but we 're not going to change it' mr clinton , who seemed knowledgeable about the issue , rattling off dates and statistics , then went on to cite the cost of discharging homosexuals from the military 500 million in the decade of the 80 s to discharge 16 , 800 , more or less , gay people from the service the difficulty , it seems to me , he said , is to get people to focus on what i believe the real issue is , to say that we do n't have a person to waste but mr clinton , who said he had been consulting on the issue with senator sam nunn , the georgia democrat who is the chairman of the armed services committee , did hint at some reservations 'not a totally simple issue' by the way , it s not as simple a question as it seems , he said , because the sexes are segregated in the services to guarantee a certain level of privacy , a certain level of security against sexual overtures , a certain level of cohesion , you know so it s not a simple issue but what i think the rule ought to be is in the absence of some inappropriate behavior , if someone has been in the service and they 're serving well , that alone should not be grounds for dismissal i want to be very clear about this , because it is not a totally simple issue there would have to be something besides the simple statement of status but i think everybody understands that any kind of inappropriate behavior would be grounds for dismissal mr clinton said he would take political heat for his stand i knew that when i decided to deal with this , he said , adding that he would win over the public many gayrights leaders can only smile at what they see as the presidentelect s naivete while it is true that mr clinton is an advocate of gay rights , he has generally tried to avoid confronting the issue head on , instead usually incorporating it into broad statements about civil rights for all americans concern about perceptions in a campaign appearance in oregon , he criticized a referendum , which was later voted down , that would have restricted gay rights and called homosexuality perverse but he did so only when he was asked about it mr clinton talks passionately and often about aids but gayrights groups are not sure he understands that the public s attitude toward aids , which often invokes strong strains of compassion is altogether different from that toward gay rights about 80 percent of americans say they believe homosexuals should have equal rights to job opportunities , the new york times cbs news poll conducted after the republican national convention in august found but that number begins to fall when people are asked about specific job categories fiftyseven percent percent support the idea of homosexuals in the military only 38 percent think homosexuality is an acceptable alternative life style i think the clinton administration , said david mixner , a gay friend of the presidentelect , is just beginning to get an idea of what i live every day , of the depth of anger and discrimination that we face in some ways it is remarkable that it is the military issue that mr clinton is tackling first it has become a central gayrights issue only in the last five years or so nation s largest employer the defense department s regulation requiring the dismissal of gay men and lesbians was officially promulgated in 1949 in the mccarthy years , efforts to oust homosexuals heated up perverts called government peril , read a headline in the new york times on april 19 , 1950 but when the gayrights movement began in the late 1960 s , there was little interest in the military , in part because gayrights leaders tended to be opponents of the vietnam war that began to change in the mid1980 s as gayrights leaders realized that the military was the nation s largest employer and its policy a bad symbol the change accelerated as lesbians became more active in the gayrights movement lee michaelson , a former air force chaplain who works with the lambda legal defense fund on gay military issues , calculates that lesbians are especially hard hit by the military policy of all discharges from the marine corps , for example , a women is seven times more likely than a man to have been removed for homosexuality now that they have settled on it as a main issue , gay groups , like lambda , have become adept at picking the test cases , choosing only those who are telegenic and have nearperfect records mr clinton , in the interview , seemed especially moved by one such case he talked of margarethe cammermeyer , a national guard colonel who won the bronze star in vietnam and was dismissed this year after disclosing her sexual orientation she came to my town meeting in seattle , he said proudly , adding a very impressive woman for now , the clinton camp and the gay camp seem to be a little wary of each other expectations are high gay groups worry that by naming a panel to study the issue of homosexuals in the military , mr clinton may be looking for a way to water down his campaign pledge they worry that no one openly homosexual was named to his transition team the clinton camp , meanwhile , finds itself with what may become a growing problem there is no one leader of the gayrights movement , meaning that there is no central figure for the clinton people to deal with little rock has received drafts of an executive order on the military from half a dozen gay groups and individuals , all of whom seem to think they were asked to draft the final order in fact , the clinton people say , none of them were photos margarethe cammermeyer , left , a national

the pale pink , trellised and mirrored prettiness of the dining rooms and the classic french menu at le chambord in westport make one think of the 1950 s the menu in particular seems caught in a time warp , with offerings like escalope de veau bercy , filet mignon with bearnaise , chateaubriand bouquetiere , coq au vin de bourgogne and cervelle de veau beurre noire we first reviewed le chambord in 1978 in subsequent years food tastes have evolved from the simplicity of nouvelle cuisine to indigenous regional spinoffs like trendy californian , cajun and others perhaps now , after a flurry of goat cheese , pesto and sundried everythings , we are ready once again for the serenity of traditional french cuisine if things seem comfortably familiar at le chambord , there are a few surprises , mostly pleasant one is the staff members , some of whom in the past performed their duties with the arrogance of we 're a french restaurant and know more than you do attitude whether because of

higginsville , mo , oct 24 with military honors and the smoke of powder and musket balls , a smattering of remains of the civil war s most notorious bushwhacker were given a confederate warrior s burial today after a macabre dispersal , a grim odyssey and long years of exile in the land of his enemies , five bones and a vial of hair of william clarke quantrill found a final resting place in a sprawling confederate cemetery here among the green hills he haunted 130 years ago but not even these final rites could lay to rest all vestiges of the horror and controversy spawned by quantrill hero to supporters but , to millions of others , monster of the lawrence massacre in kansas in 1863 , when 150 civilians were slain and traces of tensions 130 years old prevented complete satisfaction among partisans who had also wanted to bury quantrill s skull with the bones and would have done so but for the adamant owners in quantrill s birthplace , dover , ohio we do not wish him buried where people are ashamed of him , where no one remembers or cares to recall the brutality of a partisan warfare that created men like captain quantrill and those who rode with him , said robert l hawkins 3d of jefferson city , delivering a eulogy in a roman catholic ceremony 'he belongs here' he belongs here , mr hawkins continued , addressing an audience laced with civil war buffs in gray uniforms that packed a small chapel , here with those who were truly his people here in a chapel where men worshiped , who revered his memory as the symbol of an unrepentant resistance to military occupation of this state which was brutally harsh in all its aspects as the ceremony ended , pallbearers , who included descendants of quantrill s men , bore a small wooden casket containing the bones to a grave waiting in a cemetery where row on row of confederate flags stood beside headstones he did what he had to do , said one pallbearer , don yoder , a descendant of a quantrill lieutenant , shortly before a salute of musket balls shattered the solemn air and the casket was lowered into the grave but , he added , i believe he should be buried solid , with all his bones right there failure to reunite all relics mr hawkins said in an interview that he was disappointed that all the relics had not been reunited they were dispersed to sites from kentucky to ohio to kansas we made a written request to the dover historical society , which owns the skull , he said , but the hometown group showed no interest in cooperating we are not ashamed of quantrill , said mr hawkins , a jefferson city lawyer who is commander of the sons of confederate veterans , which organized today s ceremonies he does n't wear the mantle of gentlemanly warfare of a robert e lee , but we view these people in the context of their time and circumstances in dover , however , earl p olmstead , a trustee of the tuscarawas county historical society , said , they treat quantrill as a hero , and of course we do n't and les williams , chairman of the dover historical society , which owns the skull , added i think they are going overboard in missouri , with 200 people and a big ceremony over a hank of hair and five bones i think all the bones should be buried in one place , and the largest part of the quantrill bones are here 300 in attendance actually , more than 300 people attended today s rites , including the burial in the confederate memorial state park here , organized by the confederate sons group among others attending were members of the quantrill society , many of them descendants of quantrill followers mr hawkins s remarks recalled one of the most brutal periods and places in american history , when abolitionists from the east struggled with slavery supporters from missouri before the civil war to keep the kansas territory free they fought so bitterly that bleeding kansas became a byword when the war erupted , they fought with added ferocity jayhawkers , as abolitionist raiders were called , attacked from kansas and pillaged the border communities of missouri near kansas city , and proslavery raiders struck kansas towns when union forces suppressed rebellion in missouri , many proslavers took to the brush as guerrillas and became known as bushwhackers the border warfare spawned fearsome names bloody bill anderson , frank james and cole younger rode as guerrillas with quantrill in the lawrence massacre , and jesse james later rode with anderson but none of the names sowed such fear as that of quantrill , a young man who left his ohio home in 1857 to move to kansas , where , some historians say , he was turned against his own heritage by what he regarded as excesses committed by jayhawkers and abolitionists in his most fearsome act , quantrill led about 350 raiders on aug 21 , 1863 , in the lawrence massacre , one of the most savage acts of the war at dawn , the raiders stormed into the town of 3 , 000 people and began to slaughter , pillage and burn quantrill himself became one of the last victims of the war he was wounded on may 10 , 1865 , a month after gen robert e lee had surrendered , and died on june 6 he was 27 years old still more controversy was soon to come , this time over quantrill s remains his body was buried in an unmarked grave in louisville , ky , but in 1887 a newspaperman from dover by the name of w w scott arrived to dig up the bones at the behest of quantrill s mother a local legend though some historical society members dispute it , local legend holds that some of quantrill s remains are buried in the family plot in dover s fourth street cemetery a grave marker was placed on the supposed site about 10 years ago the legend is supported by edward leslie of massillon , ohio , the author of a forthcoming quantrill biography for documentation he cites notes left by scott about a funeral in the family plot in 1888 or 1889 but scott kept some of the bones , including the skull , and in 1888 , apparently in need of money , he began trying to peddle them the kansas historical society wound up first with two shinbones and later , after scott s death in 1902 , with three more bones , all of which it has now given up for today s burial but scott was never able to sell the skull now it is to be buried in the family plot , but society members refuse to disclose when our intention is just to get it over with , said jim nixon , the society s president some like me could not care less it s way down my list of priorities photo an honor guard from the 5th missouri infantry in confederate uniform firing a

the amy fisher case , which has dominated the news of long island since the spring , has repeatedly taken unexpected twists and turns the case has received major attention in the newspapers and on television , spawned movie deals , spurred judicial and political commentary and figures prominently in the conversations of ordinary long islanders the long island weekly asked several individuals to comment on the implications of the case and what it says about long island and the people who live there the statements were compiled by linda saslow , cathy singer and thomas clavin barbara ehrenreich writer and commentator , syosset in some ways it brings us face to face with the worst stereotypes of long islanders joseph buttafuoco is a guidotype of person , pardon the obnoxious ethnic reference , who puts a lot of effort into appearance such as working out his body and working on his cars amy fisher is a princess stereotype , the spoiled child who appears to have been given whatever she has wanted this story is the collision of two stereotypes everything negative about long island culture comes together in this case i do not mean to pass judgment on either party because i do not know them but they appear shallow and superficial and very selfcentered , and this is all unfortunately part of the long island stereotype this story seems to be holding up a mirror to us is this what we 're like \? but then we do n't ask enough questions about ourselves after that point when black youths were involved in the central park jogger case , we asked all sorts of sociological questions we wanted to know what that case said about innercity life and values but in this situation we do not ask probing questions it is treated in a sui generis way in the case of amy fisher we do not wonder how are we raising our children and in the case of joseph buttafuoco , we do not ask whether we are producing adult men who prey upon children we participate in a culture that produces these kinds of people and situations that can potentially lead to murder , but we tend to think that because the people involved are white and middle class , they are normal obviously there is an awful lot of social pathology here , yet we do not ask the hard questions about what it says about how we live here james l larocca president , long island association , business group people are fixated on this case because the media are fixated the media have the assumption that the public shares this fixation , but the public did not initiate the demand for information on this story it was the media that went immediately into a frenzy on this , and frankly i am mystified as to why i do n't think that the case says anything about long island it is not a metaphor for life here it is almost an absurdist lowbrow drama that could happen anywhere it is a multidimensional tragedy , but it is absurd to see it as representing anything beyond the immediate players amy fisher is not a prototype long island teenager , and joseph buttafuoco is not a prototype long island married man what is particularly unsavory in this drama is that every player except mrs buttafuoco everybody and their lawyers and their lawyers' lawyers have worked fulltime to be in front of those cameras i think that we are in a fairly crude period in our history in what is considered newsworthy there seem to be very few heroes in this drama and i lament that the long island stories that get national attention are ones like this one and those of jessica hahn , the garbage barge and the nurse a few years ago who killed patients with lethal injections abby kenigsberg executive director , long island coalition for fair broadcasting i do n't think the public is as obsessed with this case as the media is sometimes i wonder which is the horse and which is the driver the public has inherited the media s obsession like some sort of genetic disease i think the real story here is how a young woman ended up standing a few feet from another woman and shooting her this is a haunting story about a brokendown human spirit it s a story of failed youth , one that leads to important questions about the absence of values and a lacking sense of humanity in youth today unfortunately the story has been presented more as a contest of wills and strategies between the attorneys electronic media is immediate , right there to show you events as they happen while the lawyers stand before microphones exchanging insults , the media runs back and forth as handmaidens , and the real story becomes irrelevant the story of amy fisher is somewhere in the corner of the universe , entirely removed from this mad exchange the sensationalism of electronic media makes print media more crucial print media is better able to give you the dimensions and background of the story it can take you back to amy fisher s childhood and explore how somebody seemingly so blessed could be so alone and become so destructive rabbi charles klein merrick jewish center

as a ninth victim died from injuries suffered in the fatal crush at a city college charity basketball game on saturday , the new york official leading the city s investigation suggested yesterday that the college itself was ultimately responsible for the calamity the official , deputy mayor milton mollen , said he had seen no evidence that the police acted improperly the college had a responsibility if not legal then certainly as heads of a public institution to see that security was appropriate , mr mollen said the security was not appropriate as the toll from the tragedy rises , the circle of blame with all those involved aware that immense legal and liability issues rest behind almost every accusation has now hardened mr mollen has increasingly edged toward accusing the college of neglect college officials said the student organization that sponsored the event was responsible and the promoters , through lawyers , have tried from the beginning to implicate the city agencies the police , fire and emergency medical service for failing to intervene to prevent the carnage lifesupport removed the victims died in a press of fans in a stairwell leading to the entrance of the city college gym the toll rose to nine yesterday evening when dawn mccaine , 20 years old , died at st luke s hospital she was removed from lifesupport equipment with her family s agreement , said a hospital spokeswoman , sandra salisbury ms mccaine had been unconscious and unresponsive since saturday night when she was suffocated in the crush of bodies , ms salisbury said some of the initially mystifying details of the investigation now appear to have been resolved the money the promoters say they received from ticket sales nearly 25 , 000 has been turned over to mr mollen until the investigation has been concluded the aids charity to which the promoters said they intended to give the money turned out to be an arm of the city s health department that could not accept such funds , city officials said and it now appears that while the crowd inside the gym was not overflowing , those planning to enter would have far exceeded the capacity answers to larger questions will be harder to find it will be a long time , for instance , before anyone can determine just how such a preventable tragedy could have happened , and how it might be avoided in the future as the facts come more clearly into view , investigators , college officials and lawyers have begun to suggest that the incident looks like a result of poor planning and not a conscious attempt to sell too many tickets or to cut corners on protection it is also clear that there will be pressure from the city and from city university officials for changes in the way studentsponsored events are governed none of our colleges have any right to abrogate their duty to protect their physical plants , said david fields , special counsel to the chancellor of the city university police role defended some survivors of the crush said they believed the police had not done all they could to help , and questioned whether the victims were neglected because the crowd was predominantly black mr mollen said yesterday that he could find no racial component to the police role where you have a private institution especially an event where police presence might be considered provocative and lead to violence police are reluctant to enter unless it is clearly indicated , he said here it was not there was no problem in the gym that we could see and there was no violence or crime on the street that assertion would bolster the administration s position that police officers appearing at the gym were justified in remaining outside even after glass windows surrounding the entrance had been shattered by unruly patrons , he said mr mollen is scheduled to interview the chief student organizer of the event , cassaundra kirnon , this morning a 40yearold night school student and president of the evening student government committee that helped sponsor the event , miss kirnon has declined to comment since saturday she may be able to shed light on the issues of who arranged security and why there was so little of it city college and police officials have contended that 100 members of fruit of islam , a security group affiliated with the nation of islam , appeared at the game saturday , but that after a disagreement with the student leaders over money , more than 80 departed if a full complement from the fruit of islam had been there , nothing like this would have happened , said jon schecter , editor of the source , a monthly magazine about hiphop music , culture and politics they are the best and they command the most respect from this kind of audience they do it all the time and , believe me , they know how to impose order at least one promoter of the event , sean combs , a 21yearold new jersey man also known as puff daddy , is scheduled to meet with mr mollen today city officials are still trying to schedule a meeting with the other , betterknown promoter , the rap impresario heavy d mr combs has not been available for comment , but on monday he retained martin garbus , a new york

detroit , april 12 no one has called the yankees amazing , because they really are not no one has called them contenders , because they probably will not be when september arrives but call them surprising , call them refreshing and , most important , call them one of the two remaining undefeated teams in the major leagues after one memorable week this afternoon , the yankees maintained this status by pounding the tigers , 51 , at tiger stadium and boosting their record to 50 only the 1933 yankees , featuring babe ruth and lou gehrig , started their season with a longer winning streak it seems ludicrous to summon those famous names six decades later because more modest names like scott sanderson and mel hall helped the yankees today in continuing to approach the ancient 70 start from the days of baggy uniforms and yankee dominance sanderson controlled the tigers on one run into the seventh and hall knocked in three runs as the yankees ambushed 23yearold scott aldred for five runs in the first two innings and then coasted they made it look simple again and have now outscored opponents , 2710 , have not allowed more than three runs in any game and swept their first series in detroit since may 1983 none of the feats fazed the yankees' rookie manager , buck showalter you 're supposed to win , showalter said simply that s what we are supposed to do you 're supposed to come in and win the ball game with a fourgame series against firstplace toronto the only other undefeated team beginning monday , the yankees have quickly injected the sort of excitement into the season that was absent for most of last year their longest winning streak last year was six games can a series with the firstplace blue jays in april be pivotal \? probably not , but when a club like the yanks is rebounding from 186 losses in the last two years , they need all the hype and hysteria their play creates they need to keep building confidence not only can you see a change , you can feel a change , said sanderson feeling it is more important anyone can see it feeling it is real having the players feel it is important tigers go opposite way if the yankees wanted a reality check , all they had to do was saunter across the stadium and into the home clubhouse , where the tigers were mired in a funk they have been picked to finish ahead of the yankees , but have started the season atrociously , with six losses in a row they have yet to lead in a game new york knows what a sinking feeling is like and maybe that is why the team remains calm but what about this series with toronto , 60 after beating baltimore today \? the yankees are half a game behind the blue jays is it correct to get excited \? according to most players , who have been lectured on humility by showalter , the answer is a resounding no i think it s too early to call it a big series , said don mattingly it does n't matter who we are playing big or not , there are so many facets of the yankees that have been surprising from starting pitching to solid defense to timely hitting , they approached the year in a businesslike manner and their business is thriving the starters are 40 with a 232 earned run average , the bullpen has given up one earned run in 14 innings and the yankees have made one error in five games ask the pitchers how important stingy defense like that is and refreshing is the proper word to describe showalter and the attitude that has filtered down to his players and staff finding a player or coach who will admit to being thrilled about the superb start is like finding someone who neglected to collect his meal money there is humility floating throughout the clubhouse , a good sign for a team with weaknesses waiting to be exposed but the positives have helped transform an april series in toronto into a quick barometer for the yankees the skydome will be filled and the blue jays will toss four formidable pitchers at new york it will be an important test and , no matter what the yankees admit to publicly , it will be exciting i guarantee you , showalter said , our guys will be looking forward to the challenge inside pitch pat kelly had a deep bruise on his left elbow after being hit by john doherty s pitch in the seventh and it will not be known until monday if he can play in the first game in toronto andy stankiewicz would start at second base if kelly sits out kevin maas is the only position player on the yanks , other than stankiewicz , who has not started a game john habyanpitched two and onethird scoreless innings and was impressive again photo don mattingly advancing to third base on single by roberto kelly in the first inning travis fryman of the tigers took the late throw \( associated press \) \( pg c7 \)

albany , may 19 of the more than 200 finalists in a research contest who came here today to display their solutions to the world s energy problems , none had ever waited in a gasoline line , except maybe while in a child safety seat but maybe science students are born with an interest in the subject maybe they think an energy crisis will come back in a country that imports half its oil or maybe they worry that global energy use may set off catastrophic climate change whatever the reason , more than 1 , 200 students responded to the invitation of the new york state energy research and development authority by coming up with energysaving technology on the cutting edge there was , for example , the generadoor , a revolving door of the kind used in office buildings and department stores , modified to make electricity from the force of people pushing it around that idea , which came from three students at great neck south high school on long island , won an award plan for smart' window so did a project of the three students from ward melville high school , in setauket , li , who took an ordinary refrigerator and immersed its cooling coil in water water draws off heat better than air , so the refrigerator did the same work using less electricity , and when the water was reused , it gave the water heater a free headstart in its own work there were other plans for making energy from waves , sunlight and wind , for using mutant strains of yeast to produce ethanol fuel , for using bacteria to take the sulfur out of coal , and for improving the energy efficiency of everything from light bulbs to windows to toasters there was a working model of a machine that raises window shades on sunny days in winter , and lowers them on sunny days in summer , and a plan for a smart window that would change color with the time of day and season for more efficient heating and cooling these are offshoots of existing knowledge , ventures into littleknown areas , said murray d perl , a biology and research teacher at john f kennedy high school in the bronx , and , as an adviser to student competitors , a veteran of the annual contest since 1985 feuding between regions that is in some ways similar to what the authority pays adult researchers to do , said mary jean frank , a spokeswoman for the authority budget constraints are another parallel between the contest and real life , although they are stricter for the high school students , who received grants of 500 at most and , in an albany tradition , the contest carries on an upstatedownstate feud to the upstate science teachers , the contest seems to be in large part an intramural battle among three new york city schools bronx science , john f kennedy and stuyvesant the state energy research authority , in an effort to broaden the competition , recently changed the rules to establish five slots for high schools that have not previously taken part a gift to the smallest schools upstate students feel the tension , but it is their teachers who suffer the most they are not allowed in the convention hall while the projects are judged , and the judges are forbidden to ask the students which school they attend while the teachers pace outside the hall like expectant fathers in the maternity ward , the authority tries to break the tension by sending them on a tour of historic sites in albany 'nasty for a minute' there is almost animosity , said mary p colvard , a biology teacher from cobleskill in schoharie county it felt nasty for a minute or two , she said of this year s meeting mr perl , of john f kennedy in the bronx , had some awkward praise for entries from rural schools the upstate schools are oriented toward industrial arts , he said their projects are beautiful his school s projects , he said , tend more toward scientific explanation by his count , his school was far in the lead , earning 30 plaquesover the last 10 years today , kennedy won one more for a study of shipfuel efficiency by dmitriy rogozhnikov , for whom mr perl was one of two advisers magnetic levitation the schools get plaques for winning entries , the students who submit those entries receive savings bonds , and all contestants receive certificates for taking part the young scientists , like their older counterparts , encountered setbacks as well as triumphs for example , the magnetic levitation train built by two 14yearolds , benjamin lubin and ken fujiuchi , turned into the hubble telescope of the competition the two ninth graders said it worked fine back at manhasset

when 60 minutes established itself as television s innovator in vigorous investigative journalism , a joke started to make the rounds what are the six words someone would least like to hear \? the answer mike wallace is on the line there are people in the business and financial world who are giving a new answer to the old joke bryan burrough is on the line mr burrough , an investigative reporter at the wall street journal , wrote the bestselling book , barbarians at the gate \( harper row \) about the rjr nabisco takeover , with a journal colleague , john heylar he has just come out with a new book , vendetta american express and the smearing of edmond safra \( harpercollins \) , which details the organized attempt by the american express company to discredit a former colleague and competitor american express has acknowledged that it set out covertly to ruin mr safra s reputation as a banker by spreading false reports to newspapers and magazines that he was involved in money laundering and drug trafficking after making a public apology , the company paid 8 million to mr safra and charities chosen by him as compensation mr burrough , who is 30 years old , received a 1 million advance from harpercollins for the book , which grew out of a 10 , 000word article he wrote for the wall street journal in september 1990 one of the main characters in the article and the book , harry freeman , a former executive at american express who now owns his own trade policy consulting firm in washington , is suing mr burrough and dow jones company , the journal s parent , for 50 million , claiming that the article falsely described his role in the campaign against mr safra in an unusual twist to a libel suit , mr freeman and his lawyer , john j walsh of cadwalader , wickersham taft in new york , are charging that in an effort to get a more lucrative book contract , mr burrough recklessly disregarded and distorted the truth in the journal article to try to prove their case , they have issued wideranging document requests and subpoenas to the wall street journal , harpercollins , mr burrough and his agent , andrew wylie we are going to be examining whether interest in money clouded his judgment , mr walsh said we believe it did none of this frightens mr burrough this is the fourth time the journal has been sued because of articles he wrote in two cases , he prevailed and one case has not been resolved a spokesman for the journal , roger may , said the freeman suit was without merit and the company was confident it would win price for journalists although many business people might think he is seeking targets , mr burrough said his recent success had made him a target , too it s the potential price that every journalist has to pay , mr burrough said these aggressive intimidation tactics and big lawsuits and threats are very popular these days , especially if you 're someone with a name i know this might sound high and mighty , but i'm not going to let that threat stand in the way of getting at the truth mr freeman , who did not talk to mr burrough for the journal article but was interviewed at length for the book , said he decided to sue only after he read press reports about mr burrough s advance and harpercollins s plans to publish some 250 , 000 copies of the book and promote it heavily he said that given mr burrough s previous success , this book was likely to become a best seller , which would then become a paperback best seller then possibly a movie there s no way i could sit still and survive that , he said questioning the ethics mr freeman questioned the ethics of reporters' writing books about subjects they are in the midst of covering , saying the temptation would be great to create scandals to get better book contracts it shows an arrogance and an abuse of power , he said mr burrough dismisses the notion that he became involved in the american express project with his eye on a big book deal he said the idea for the article came not from him but from a journal editor american express stymied me every step of the way , mr burrough said in fact , i was pretty convinced i could n't do it as a book because they would n't cooperate with me but then i came upon this structure , to set it up as a mystery , and i only got the book contract after the article ran frankly , he added , it was too compelling not to go forward and learn more about it and turn it into a book at one point , someone at american express said to me , 'this story is a complex mosaic you can never hope to totally figure out' well , that s a red flag to any journalist worth his salt american express laid down a challenge and i went after it finding things out is what i do for a living photos bryan burrough , who is facing a libel suit in the wake of the publication of his book vendetta american express and the smearing of edmond safra \( elena seibert harper collins \)
minneapolis while clytemnestra turns up in a handful of greek tragedies , no trilogy was ever devoted to her ill fortunes none that we know of , at any rate ancient greek drama having come down to us in a terribly fragmented state picking among the splendid ruins of what has survived , however , the director garland wright has pieced together a forceful version of her saga for the guthrie theater he s repaired to euripides' iphigenia in aulis for the first part of his twopart endeavor , which is being performed through aug 30 the second part is made up of aeschylus' agamemnon , followed by sophocles' electra all three have been drastically pruned \( agamemnon , the shortest , now runs a scant 57 minutes iphigenia is the longest at 90 minutes \) mr wright wants no distractions , no digressions this is to be primarily a story of women clytemnestra \( isabell monk \) and the three daughters , iphigenia , electra and chrysothemis , who figure in her destruction you can easily accuse the venturesome director of taking liberties he is , after all , using three sets of blueprints to build one edifice what makes sophocles different from euripides , and euripides unlike aeschylus , is being conveniently downplayed even more , there is a strong ideological bent to the productions that says as much about late20thcentury civilization as it does about values in fifthcentury bc greece still , the edifice is a grand one , and its lean and elegant spaces house some stunning displays of fury the gods do not come off well , but that s to be expected they 've always taken particular delight in maneuvering helpless mortals into impossible situations and then watching them wriggle the revelation of what you could call the clytemnestra trilogy , although mr wright does n't , is how badly the men fare they 're patronizing , arrogant , cowardly , headstrong and , for all their ringing appeals to might and right , amazingly ineffectual what s more , they 're definitely the supporting players their recklessness may help determine the course of the drama , but within the drama , the positions of theatrical prominence are occupied by women , who must deal with the messy consequences of male barbarism and ego the feminist overtones are unavoidable clytemnestra may be a queen , a mother , a lover and a murderer at the guthrie , she is , above all , a woman who refuses to be victimized the choral interludes are kept to a minimum , and when the members of the chorus speak , they tend to do so as individuals , straggling voices in the crowd the enormity of the drama eludes them for the most part , they watch from the sidelines with the dazed brow and fretful eye of the humbly born susan hilferty s masks give them that hollow , dumbfounded look you often find on the pedestrians scurrying across german expressionist canvases singing and dancing , although integral parts of greek tragedy , are similarly limited instead , it falls to the composer michael sommers , who is tucked away in the gridwork high above the stage , to punctuate the action with music of his own devising he s concocted an eerie assortment of noises twangs , thumps , rumbles and microphone squawks none of which augur well for the characters the pleasantest sound , i suppose , is the light shimmer of wind chimes , but even that has an ironic edge , since wind or the lack of it is at the root of clytemnestra s agonies when we first meet her in euripides' play , she is a proud , doting mother , summoned by her husband , agamemnon , to the seacoast town of aulis presumably , their daughter iphigenia \( kristin flanders \) is to marry achilles before the greeks set sail for troy and the 10year siege agamemnon has a secret agenda , though he plans to sacrifice iphigenia to the goddess artemis , who has decreed that if he does not , she will hold the winds in check and prevent the army from embarking while agamemnon experiences some second thoughts even he senses the war is being waged over nothing more than a coquette , helen his pride as a warrior and his vanity as a leader of men win out over any paternal affections accepting the inevitable , iphigenia persuades herself that by dying she will contribute to the eventual defeat of troy , greece will remain free and my name will be blessed ms flanders undergoes impressive transformations in the role from the giggling bridetobe , filled with flirtatious delight to the wan rag doll , stunned by destiny to the exalted sacrificial victim , flush with religious ecstasy and trembling with newfound purpose ms monk , an imposing actress with a grave , almost subterranean voice , is no less mutable but clytemnestra s transformation is essentially a regression to a more primitive self the noble queen , supplanted by the pleading mother , who gives way to the raging beast defending her offspring her futile efforts leave her spent and prostrate then , as the winds begin to stir , indicating that artemis has been appeased , ms monk lets loose with a protracted noooooo that rises from her bowels and rips savagely through the air she is not only protesting a daughter s death but a universe that seems without a moral center
portland , ore , june 11 the chicago bulls were angry today they felt they could have already won another national basketball association title at the very least , the bulls believed they should have led , 31 , in the fourofsevengame nba finals instead , the bulls and the portland trail blazers are tied , 22 , because the bulls failed to protect lategame leads in game 2 and game 4 so when it was suggested to chicago coach phil jackson that the bulls are no longer in control of the series , the frustration he felt within boiled to the surface by all rights , this series should be over , except for the closing four minutes of a couple of games , jackson said , as the bulls prepared for game 5 friday night at memorial coliseum it s very dangerous i'm angry now the raging bulls are faced with the challenge of channeling their emotions into producing a solid effort in game 5 but in the aftermath of wednesday s comefrombehind 9388 victory , the trail blazers had momentum and confidence , and they did n't care how the bulls felt portland trailed for all but the final 3 minutes 35 seconds of game 4 but when the pressure was at its greatest , portland played with more poise than the defending nba champions the trail blazers did the same thing in game 2 , erasing a 10point deficit with less than five minutes to play to win in overtime , 115104 each game , unless they 've changed the rules , is 48 minutes , said portland coach rick adelman after 42 minutes , they led but if you lose a game , you lose a game the reality is , it s 22 the bulls lost game 4 because they did n't execute offensively in the closing minutes michael jordan was held scoreless for the final 10 23 scottie pippen \( 17 points \) was in foul trouble throughout the game , and none of the other bulls scored in double figures chicago was outscored , 198 , in the final 7 30 'given them two gifts' we looked at the films , and the way we executed down the stretch was ridiculous , said bulls forward horace grant we 're the world champions , but we 've basically given them two gifts' are the bulls on the brink of being dethroned , or will they find a way to overcome another determined opponent , as chicago has done throughout the playoffs \? the bulls' fate may depend on how well they handle the unique challenges that the trail blazers present clyde drexler had a scintillating allround performance in game 4 \( 21 points , 9 assists , 8 rebounds , 3 blocked shots , 2 steals \) and his matchup with jordan is pivotal to the series because drexler is so versatile and active , he makes jordan work defensively , perhaps more successfully than any other player in the league and because jordan has expended so much energy on defense , his offense has suffered in both of the bulls' losses , jordan was unable to carry the bulls' offense down the stretch i got a little winded , jordan said i had to play a lot of minutes when scottie was in foul trouble i really did n't have the legs to make the shots they say when you 're tired , your legs are the first to go someone else must step up offensively for chicago to win the series pippen , an allstar , is the player expected to lead the bulls when jordan ca n't , but pippen has been inconsistent throughout the playoffs small tactic , big result jackson also wants the bulls to exploit matchups when portland uses its small lineup adelman made a key tactical move in game 4 , using a threeguard lineup of drexler , terry porter and danny ainge during the final 10 26 jerome kersey and cliff robinson completed the finishing five what that lineup lacked in size was more than compensated for with quickness , defensive energy and offensive firepower look for both bill cartwright and pippen to become more aggressive offensively if adelman uses the small lineup again pippen has a threeinch height advantage over ainge , while cartwright \( 7 feet 1 inch , 245 pounds \) has a height and weight advantage over robinson \( 611 , 225 \) of course i would have liked more opportunities , said cartwright , who attempted only 8 shots and finished with 9 points i think we 're going to go inside more but that s not what cost us the game we had numerous opportunities to make shots down the stretch and did n't we usually finish games much better this game friday is very pivotal for us i certainly would n't want to come back to chicago needing two games rebounds game 4 on wednesday night chalked up a 160 nielsen rating , the highest in the national basketball association final series , which now has a cumulative 142 rating the fourgame average is down 5 percent from the 149 for the comparable period in last year s bullslakers final series , which was led by the los angeles market , the secondlargest in the country although chicago is the thirdlargest market , portland ranks 27th
atlanta just do n't say it not around me , not around anybody who knows baseball do n't call the pittsburgh pirates losers do n't say they could n't win the big one there are too many people who feel sad that jim leyland and the pirates of this generation could n't quite make it to the world series , that they have lost three straight league series maybe anybody of a certain age who grew up worshiping the brooklyn dodgers , who grew up waiting for next year , can appreciate the pirates but their appeal is beyond age , beyond region the pirates have skill and glitter and some pretty bright voices in the clubhouse , too andy van slyke , for example , can catch a ball and turn a quip with the best of them now there will be the first international world series , between atlanta and toronto i pick the blue jays because of roberto alomar and the pirates are dispersed , in a way , forever they will be remembered as the team that carried a 20 lead into the ninth inning of the seventh game of the national league playoff series on wednesday night , the team that was crushed by francisco cabrera s single and sid bream s cloppetyclop milkhorse rumble home this was one of the epic rallies in any big game , and it reminded us all why baseball , without a clock , is the best team sport of all the pirates could n't kneel down like some weasel quarterback in the final minutes of a football game they had to get three outs , and they could n't do it the only justice in this game was playing right field for the braves , and his first name was david the braves understood that one of the classiest sights in the clubhouse aside from the women and children sharing the moment , with minimal champagnespraying was otis nixon praising the pirates into every microphone stuck in his face a year ago , nixon was in an addiction treatment center , but on wednesday he did n't want to talk about his joy at finally being in the world series at the age of 33 the pirates never folded , nixon repeated it could have been them going to the world series i respect them so much the braves' manager , bobby cox , needed no prodding to say i feel terrible it happened to them a year ago i just saw jim leyland outside and he wished us well if he s not the best manager in baseball , i do n't know who is they deserve a better fate and stan kasten , the president of the braves , has talked about the tragedy that the pirates may not be able to keep their top free agents bobby bonilla is with the mets john smiley was unloaded and barry bonds and doug drabek may have played their last inning for the pirates the club owners in the network cities do not want to share their local television revenue , so the pirates may be picked clean by the buzzards , without winning a pennant there was no weakness of character , none of that football fallonyourswords gibberish that follows teams that lose the super bowl leyland had never played a major league game , but he was a big leaguer the day he pulled on the pirates jersey and greeted the world with his hoarse smoker s voice jim leyland is this kind of man on the last day of the 1986 season , a wild rookie named hipolito pena unintentionally decked a couple of mets in the first inning , leyland promptly gave him the hook , waving apologetically to his pal dave johnson he did not want any mets injured before their postseason adventure , what would turn out to be the yellow brick road to the fabled arches of bucknerland the pirates have seemed to be on the road to the world series the last three years , but things happened even as bonds and drabek enter free agency , they were not labeled as potential traitors by their manager hey , we have a system , leyland said if we can come up with it , or somebody else , fine i'm going to manage next year with or without barry bonds and doug drabek hopefully , they 'll be here but in the meantime , hey , do n't be negative drabek , the surprisingly wiry franchise pitcher , was treated the way bob gibson was handled by johnny keane on the final day of the 1964 season asked why he kept his armweary ace in the game so long , the cardinals' manager said , because i had a commitment to his heart leyland had a commitment to the heart of these pirates when they lost , he wept , but he had the character to talk i'm still in shock , he said i felt like the game was ours it s tough , but it s life you learn to handle both winning and losing it s the toughest loss i 've ever had to handle , and i'm not sure how i 'll handle it leyland s team fell short of a pennant , but it never fell short of heart photo jim leyland \( vic delucia \)
three days into training camp , stephane richer said there were problems with his left knee and his contract , but he was never specific about either richer s left knee has been ruled sound by the devils' doctors and no one is arguing that the 825 , 000 richer earns a year is not a healthy amount but something is still apparently wrong somewhere the 26yearold richer , who has averaged nearly 33 goals a season during his sevenyear career , was benched by coach herb brooks in wednesday night s 61 loss to the rangers at madison square garden it was only the team s fifth game of the season brooks said he had decided to bench richer because his physical condition was not in line with that of the rest of the devils but there were suspicions that he was sending his right wing a message brooks oozes sarcasm he s such a gifted softball player , brooks said of richer , who was traded to the devils by the montreal canadiens last year for kirk muller i think he was the canadian mvp in slowpitch softball i guess he spent a lot of time on that instead of conditioning himself for hockey we 'll just have to get his legs going richer seemed to agree i understand the coach s position , he said of his benching maybe my condition is not there in the four games he has played this season , richer showed none of his explosiveness despite being given huge chunks of ice time by brooks , who employed richer on the first unit on the power play , as well as his regular shift richer s speed is supposed to fit well into the hightempo system that brooks is instituting in his first season as coach of the devils , but , in the eyes of brooks , richer has failed to use his skills he has the ability for allstar numbers year after year , brooks said , obviously mindful of the 50 and 51 goal seasons richer had with the canadiens we 'd like to see his game get up to another tempo richer had trouble keeping up with his teammates in the first four games he has been so ineffective , especially in his defensive duties , that he is the player who was called upon to serve the team s two minor bench penalties thus far a glut of forwards brooks and his staff are using these early games as a means of evaluating players the devils have at least six forwards competing for ice time , and brooks offered that as another reason to sit richer down he pointed to doug brown , bill guerin and jarrod skalde , the three other forwards who were also benched for the ranger game in that game , the rangers were effective in every facet in gaining revenge for the 42 loss to the devils in new jersey last saturday they even scored two goals while short a skater , with darren turcotte and mark messier getting them john vanbiesbrouck , who made 27 saves and evened his record to 110 , gave messier the bulk of the credit for the excellent performance by the rangers when a leader shows grit and determination , everyone else wants to do the same , the ranger goaltender said messier also scored a powerplay goal and assisted on brian leetch s second goal of the season slap shots the devils practiced yesterday at south mountain arena in west orange , nj , in preparation for tomorrow s visit by the philadelphia flyers and eric lindros the rangers worked at playland in rye , ny , in preparation for their homeandhome series with the islanders tomorrow and sunday the devils reduced their roster to 23 players by assigning bill guerin and myles o'connor to the club s top minor league affiliate in utica , ny , and jarrod skalde to cincinnati o'connor was the only player on the roster who had not seen action in any of the five games , and his assignment to utica is primarily for conditioning skalde s assignment to cincinnati may also be temporary the devils chose to send him to cincinnati directly rather than assign him to utica and have another forward go from utica to cincinnati the only player move by the rangers in the last two days was the assignment of david archibald to the club s farm team in binghamton , ny , for conditioning

that story is just unfolding , mr vallone said , so it is inappropriate to pass judgment on that alert holdings , founded by mr welch in 1985 , is in the business of electronically monitoring the security alarm systems installed in homes and businesses around the country and calling the appropriate emergency services when necessary under mr welch s chairmanship , alert raised more than 250 million through the sale of limited partnerships and used the money to finance the purchase of new business accounts from smaller rivals across the company alert would identify an acquisition and the partnerships would buy it , with alert getting a hefty upfront fee for arranging the deal alert would also collect continuing fees from the partnerships for providing security monitoring services to the new accounts the revenue left over went to the partnership investors , who had been promised annual returns as high as 15 percent but despite those handsome promises , some of the leading figures in the partnership marketplace avoided the alert holdings deals we never liked what we saw there , said brent donaldson , president of the liquidity fund in emeryville , calif , which invests in limited partnerships across the country we just had fundamental problems with the underlying economics we could never figure out how they could be sustained longterm as it happened , longterm did n't last very long with the company s business faltering and both the rocky mountain news in denver and forbes magazine poking into its problems , a major investor forced mr welch out last summer in november , a new management informed alert s limited partners that quarterly payments due in september would not be made since then , a host of investor lawsuits have been filed against the company and its former management , charging mismanagement and fraud in the sale of the limited partnerships there are literally thousands of investors affected , said david j bershad , the new york lawyer who is heading the legal team representing the plaintiffs in those lawsuits the defendants include mr welch and most of his management team , including roy a webley , who is now listed as executive vice president at cleanair dana woodbury , the vice president for compliance at multifinancial securities corporation in englewood , colo , was an early critic of the alert partnerships and refused to approve them for his firm s clients why \? the management , mr woodbury said last week larry welch was very key when we looked at his prior business dealings , we found that several of the firms for whom he raised money , and for whom he was a director , had gone bankrupt that reflects poorly on his judgment and his management before the alert saga began , mr welch s previous experience had been in consumer homeelectronics stores in the early 1980 s , he built up one chain , sold it at a considerable premium and was promptly fired by the new owner he sued for wrongful dismissal and lost the case in 1984 in 1985 , he landed in yet another legal squabble arising from his investment in schaak electronics , an electronics retailing chain in st paul he served briefly as schaak s chairman , promising to find new capital for the struggling company the financing never materialized , and he was ousted by the chain s founder more lawsuits followed , and schaak wound up in bankruptcy court as did connecting point , another electronics retailing chain he founded and attempted to merge with schaak during his brief tenure there but mr vallone in santa barbara said that mr welch s background has so far not been a problem for cleanair transit investors who are looking at putting money into the company , or who had already put money in , have asked those questions and have had their questions answered , he said it simply is not an issue chart a checkered past some of larry welch s ventures connecting point inc founder and director resigned from board when company filed for chapter 11 after failed merger bid in 1985 company emerged from bankruptcy in 1987 and was acquired in 1989 schaak electronics became chairman in 1985 was ousted after failed merger with connecting point two months later bankrupt company was liquidated in 1986 alert holdings founded company in 1985 was ousted and sued by investors in 1991 company filed for chapter 11 in middecember cleanair transit helped set up company in july 1991

wauchula , fla in a state that produces half the country s winter fruits and vegetables , one of the biggest cucumber farmers in florida has no crop we have 1 , 150 acres that s not worth a damn to anybody , said the farmer , ronald moye , who used to produce bushel after bushel of perfectly shaped cucumbers , cabbages , melons and peppers on his farm here in south central florida now , he has a wasteland where even the weeds will not grow cucumber seeds will not germinate broccoli plants wither and die and he is afraid that the very water that flows through his land is contaminated the invisible killer is benlate , a du pont fungicide that had been the farmer s best friend in a hot , steamy land where molds and fungi grow faster than mosquitoes for two decades it was the secret to the unblemished fruits and spotless leaves of florida s 62 billion a year in food crops and ornamental plants but now growers are cursing the chemical its manufacturer , ei du pont de nemours company , of wilmington , del , with total 1991 sales of 387 billion , has already paid more than 205 million to settle damage claims , most of them from florida , but others coming from across the country annual sales of benlate were 100 million to my knowledge , this sort of situation has never occurred with any other agricultural chemical ever , said morris bailey , the company s manager of benlate products it s the biggest that s ever occurred in terms of cost but one year after the company pulled benlate \( pronounced benlate \) off the market , du pont executives say they still have no idea what caused the problems and although du pont says that the worst is over and it is safe to replant fields where millions of plants have died , many farmers say their biggest fear is that the damage could last for many seasons independent researchers say the most likely explanation is that the granular form of benlate used on the affected plants acts in combination with heat , humidity and other factors and somehow turns poisonous the real test of how deep the problem is will come in late march , when the hot , humid season begins here another form of benlate , a powder , is still used on fruits and vegetables and has not been linked to any damage florida strawberry farmers , who produce 20 percent of the nation s crop and who were among the hardest hit , say they are optimistic but at least one grower has seen signs of continued trouble i 've had a lot of deformed berries the last few days , since the humidity went up , and the production is way down , said steve schmidt , who farms 25 acres near plant city du pont promises to pay for any recurring damages , but the company also insists that there are none because so little is known about how the damage occurs , farmers face difficulty in trying to prove that a flaw in a single chemical is the cause for the same reason , there is no way to test soil or fruit or vegetables for residue to my knowledge there is absolutely no food safety problem , said martha roberts , the state s deputy commissioner for food safety but i could not give the specific analytic proof of that pledge of silence as is routine in many legal settlements , when du pont pays a damage claim it obtains a pledge of silence from a farmer associations of growers have also encouraged members to be silent because they do not want customers to start questioning the tomatoes on the table or the poinsettia that died over christmas the company continues to insist that newly planted crops can grow this year on soil that was treated with benlate last year we do not have scientific evidence that there is a recropping problem , mr bailey told growers at a meeting in fort lauderdale when moye farms filed a claim in 1991 saying that the chemical had contaminated the soil and was preventing new growth , du pont said that benlate was not the cause mr moye sued and the case is pending unsuspected culprit beyond the legal fingerpointing , many experts and farmers say that the mystery of benlate highlights a deeper problem in american agriculture chemical producers and users know very little about how some of their most important , and most dangerous , products actually work the nightmare started two and a half years ago , but nobody blamed benlate the first symptoms resemble downy mildew , little pink spots in the center of the leaves , said tom smyth , the manager and now the sole employee of moye farms , where 300 once worked the fields usually you spray on benlate as a preventative , and then you spray again at the first sign of a problem , he said , driving by an abandoned field then the spot does n't go away , so you figure you got a bad case so instead of a quarter of a pound an acre , you hit it with half a pound the roots shriveled up , the plants flopped over , the few vegetables that grew were deformed but the farmers did not suspect that the poison was in their sprayers mr moye has cleared and planted 200 new acres never treated with benlate his crop is not coming in well , and he worries about his irrigation system the water that runs through the old fields may be contaminating the new ones , he said widespread damage
summit at the new jersey center for visual arts here , hirohito , the late emperor of japan , holds court together with the empress , nagako georgia o'keeffe sits heraldically on a tree stump flanked by her chows , and bishop tutu , in sunglasses , presides over all with his crozier , his body a box painted red these are some of the sculptures attesting to the eerie talent of marisol escobar , known as marisol as deadpan a performer as andy warhol , marisol is usually labeled pop but sometimes she is regarded as a naive , and currently there is a move to conscript her into the feminist army still , the best estimation of the sculptor s production is lawrence campbell s writing in an artnews of the late 1960 s , he likened it to houses where the clocks continue to tick , the bathwater has been running , the electric lights all turned on and all the people are out of town or , as this writer suspects , lying embalmed in the cellar this macabre quality is nothing you can put your finger on at best , her images reflect a dreadful acuity , the kind some children possess at worst , they bespeak the narcissism of the jetsetting fashion world either way , their mysteriousness is hard to equate with a background that includes studying at such unexotic institutions as the art students league , the new school and the academy directed by the late hans hofmann no doubt some of the strangeness comes from a childhood spent traveling marisol was born in paris , of venezuelan parents , and upon the death of her mother 11 years later accompanied her father , a businessman in oil , to los angeles , where she received her early education but much of the quality seems related to spain a marisol portrait invariably has overtones of goya or bunuel as to the japanese royalty \( shown at right \) , their bodies are boxes painted with clothes and imperial decorations the heads , however , are carved , and diabolically well hirohito s face is haughty , and his eyes are nothing but patties slit to reveal light shining within the more benign empress has a head carved in wood with a figure that mimics wrinkles with their hands afterthoughts variously cut out of plywood and modeled in clay , the pair stand serenely on a lavendercovered dais the artist s skill as a modeler is harder to gauge since , apart from some early bronzes involving tiny figures scrambling over freestanding structures and reliefboxes , most of the works in this medium , clay and plaster , involve casts of her own handsome face unfortunately , the effect is somewhat vogueish , even in the mask crushed by a footprint and that fitted with dracula teeth a third is festooned with objects a light bulb , a bottle of blue nail polish , the indiana state seal and is inscribed with autobiographical information essays in narcissism and selfflagellation , respectively , these faces are not among the artist s best efforts working in wood , marisol gives new meaning to the term direct carving , for she seems never to hesitate in the 196162 figure of a latinlooking man in a homburg , she carves the broad forms of the head and hat but draws on the face , placing the block on a vertical beam , simulating his clothes in paint and adding a hand holding an umbrella but with o'keeffe and bishop tutu , she gets in with her chisel , explaining every form , staining the artist s flesh as brown as the prelate s but leaving the hands and part of the neck pale to show that the color was acquired twentyfive pieces spanning as many years do n't tell the whole story , but they are enough to show the workings of a very interesting mind and a technique that is intimidatingly skillful the show closes june 6 the center , at 68 elm street , is open from noon to 4 pm monday through friday and 2 to 4 pm saturday and sunday works on paper also in summit is a new gallery , the st lifer art exchange hanging here are works on paper by arie galles , a teacher at the madison branch of fairleigh dickinson university and exdirector of its shortlived phyllis rothman gallery as a painter , he has shown all over but principally at ok harris in manhattan and arizona also , he has spent a lot of time in the air and wasted none of it jasper johns made maps of the country with each state labeled o'keeffe has depicted cloud cover at 35 , 000 feet in a way , mr galles combines the two approaches his states are unlabeled , too , but no crosscountry flier can fail to recognize the one in the west that contains irrigated circles of green within brown rectangles \( other color combinations are available \) his oblong clouds , virtually solid bodies casting shadows , combine perfectly with the grids below , which are often textured according to their crops whether working in oil , acrylic or pencil , mr galles treads a fine line between abstraction and realism , sometimes hinting at map projections , as in the sphere over which clouds hang like chubby snowflakes he also contemplates the anatomy of a watershed so far , these images \( those in pencil are particularly beautiful \) have taken second place to the canvases covered with vertical rods painted with fluorescent colors on their sides , for which the artist is best known perhaps he should now give them precedence the show closes may 31 st lifer , at 48 maple street , is open from noon to 7 pm thursday and noon to 5 pm friday and saturday

caltanissetta , sicily , nov 23 since he and his colleagues ordered the biggest roundup of mafiosi in eight years last week , paolo giordano has been expecting a reaction from the mob but that , he said , is part of his job tracking down the men of honor , as mafiosi are called here in sicily , reaction usually means killing , as it did earlier this year when italy s most senior antimafia crusaders , giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino , were murdered in huge bomb attacks in palermo that left no doubt about the mob s resolve mr giordano is an investigating magistrate since the killings , he and his five colleagues who play a role similar to that of american district attorneys have used this bleak provincial town in sicily s raw uplands as a base for their inquiries it has proven to be a precarious life surge in mafia turncoats it s not so much the telephoned death threats or the threatening letters that arrive in the office , said carmelo antonio petralia , one of mr giordano s colleagues it s when you interview an informer and he tells you they had you or one of your friends in their sights six months ago , but never quite got round to it these men and other investigators have come to represent the forward edge of italy s recently energized fight against organized crime and it is one of the paradoxes of their work , they say , that they have found unexpected allies among a recent surge of mafia turncoats who have been driven away from the cosa nostra and its oath of silence by the very man who is presumed to lead it salvatore \( toto \) riina , the boss of all bosses of the sicilian mob like their colleagues elsewhere in sicily , the two investigators live under close guard their wives and children fret for them their cars are armorplated three bodyguards tail them sometimes on sundays i might forget and go out to buy the newspapers by myself , mr petralia said , but i'm not supposed to even in the palace of justice here , where their offices are , some bodyguards stroll the corridors with heavy pistols tucked in their belts when the investigators eat at restaurants , the bodyguards are close by , and when they leave their offices , the bodyguards jump to follow them the investigators and their protectors are likely to share the same destiny in both the falcone and borsellino murders , the bodyguards died too 'we have some doubts' their homes are in catania , on the coast , and they commute , living in hotels here , leaving behind wives and families who , mr giordano said , do have some fears we have some doubts , but try to eliminate them by saying we can do something good for our country , he said still , mr petralia said , a day at the beach or a routine vacation is out of the question we have to go outside of italy , to greece or tunisia , to go to the beach he said when i go skiing , i have a carabinieri bodyguard who skis with me in fact , he s become my ski teacher the carabinieri are a paramilitary branch of the italian security forces the investigators work from caltanissetta because italian law insists that an investigation into a magistrate s or judge s death must be conducted from a locality other than the one where the magistrate was working both mr borsellino and mr falcone s wife , judge francesca morvillo , who died with him in the may bomb explosion , were based in palermo , so the investigation may not be held there the men vary their schedules , keep no written records of future appointments and do not believe that such precautions will protect them all the time there s no way to defend yourself 100 percent , mr petralia said the mafia has shown that where there s a will , there s a way and mr giordano said , the only thing we can hope is that there 'll be safety in numbers 'it is controlled by the mafia' the investigation unit here was set up in june after the falcone murder in may staff and resources are limited , and there has been only one arrest of a lowranking hoodlum who was supposed to have obtained the stolen car that carried the explosives that killed mr borsellino as he rang his mother s doorbell for a sunday visit mr borsellino was killed in july , after the unit was established here his death brought the deployment of 7 , 000 soldiers in sicily to help the police guard installations , run roadblocks and raise at least a banner of state authority on this island the reality is that a big part of the territory of sicily is not controlled by the state , it is controlled by the mafia , mr petralia said the italian army here is like saddam hussein s army in kuwait it s seen as an occupying force the police , the carbinieri and the army find all the problems of on occupying army yet despite sicily s tradition of silence , in recent times , the investigators have found an unexpected source of information in the testimony of mafia informers the investigators say the turncoats may not have led them to the killers of mr falcone and mr borsellino , but have helped in the effort to unravel the lower echelons of the mob initiation rites
london it is england in the 1480 s , and it is england in the 1930 s the wouldbe dictator speaks shakespearean verse , but wears a black shirt and a fasciststyle armband , the red cross of his country s patron saint , st george when he assumes power , he stands on a 15foot podium and speaks in the same singsong tones edward viii used when he publicly announced that he was giving up his throne for the love of wallace simpson indeed , recognizably modern upperclass english voices and upperclass english faces are all around , creating the impression of a nazi regime on the banks of the thames no wonder the revival of richard iii that arrives at the brooklyn academy of music on tuesday caused a stir when it first opened at britain s national theater in 1990 ian mckellen , who plays richard , is well known in new york , notably as the villainous salieri in peter shaffer s amadeus , for which he won a tony award in 1979 but richard eyre , who is responsible for the production , is surprisingly unfamiliar to americans he may be director of the national theater and a major name in britain , but the twoweek stopover of richard iii in brooklyn marks his theatrical debut in the united states one reason must be that mr eyre has spent much of his career staging the kind of socially sensitive british drama that does not always travel well another may be that , for all his past successes and present power , he remains a reticent , unpushy person thrust him into the limelight and he takes on a mildly troubled look , like a mole squinting and blinking at the sun he is about as far from the gogetting producer of showbiz tradition as barnstaple is from beverly hills barnstaple is the little devon town where mr eyre was born 49 years ago , the son of a naval officer who became a gentlemanfarmer on his retirement he grew up quietly in the country , not going to the theater until he was in his late teens yet there were unconventional stirrings in the conventionally bred boy he became more and more disenchanted with the ultratraditional boarding school to which he was sent \( terribly crude , really bestial , bullying , beatings and absolute contempt for scholastic work , all that \) and developed an interest in radical politics one day he swore at the chaplain , who had objected to the black shirt and red tie the young eyre liked to wear , and was expelled fortunately , he had already secured himself a place at cambridge , where his tutor was the writer kingsley amis , whom mr eyre mainly remembers as promoting subversive literary views over claret in the local wine bar he also ventured into university dramatics , playing seyton in a macbeth directed by the undergraduate trevor nunn but after graduation he was , he says , utterly , utterly lost , a drifter who worked as a barman , a photographer s assistant and occasionally as an actor but who never dreamed of staging drama for a living in 1966 , for no good reason he can recall , he was asked to direct a sundaynight performance of ann jellicoe s knack at leicester , where he had become a junior member of the local repertory company his boss liked it , made him his assistant director and took mr eyre with him to a more important theater in edinburgh , where his career prospered by 1973 he was running the prestigious nottingham playhouse and receiving national attention for premiere productions of socially combative work howard brenton s churchill play , set in an english gulag of the future mr brenton and david hare s brassneck , about political corruption , and trevor griffiths s comedians , an entertaining political allegory that eventually found its way to broadway , though it was directed there by mike nichols , not mr eyre i love work with a grand sweep , and i love the expressiveness of large stages , he said but i also love to combine the huge gestures with microscopically observed human behavior i cannot do a play unless it is also about a very specific social world i love the interaction between people as individuals and society as a whole at the national theater , where he became artistic director in 1988 , his productions have varied from gay s beggar s opera to hamlet , from jonson s bartholomew fair to brecht s schweyk in the second world war , from tennessee williams s night of the iguana to mr hare s study of the british lawandorder system , murmuring judges none of his recent productions has provoked more excitement than his fascistperiod richard iii , which sold out in london and then proceeded to tour to tokyo , milan , cairo , prague and bucharest , romania at the last of those cities , performances were invariably interrupted with gasps and applause , often at unexpected places the appearance of richard s mourning mother , cousin and sisterinlaw with candles instantly reminded the audience of the grieving women on bucharest street corners , building tiny shrines beside the chalked forms of the bodies of sons killed in the revolution the enthusiasm in bucharest was particularly important to mr eyre , because he often visited the city in the ceaucescu period and had romania as much in mind as england when he and mr mckellen began to discuss the production to me it is n't a play about medieval tyranny and the yorkists and lancastrians , he said to me , it s indelibly a model of tyranny in our own times , a prototype for the one political form that s been perfected in the 20th century but that does not mean the production was preconceived actually , it all emerged from our reading the text and saying , 'good lord , is n't this exactly analagous to what happened under hitler , stalin and so on \?

at the consumer electronics show in las vegas , nev , last week , while other retailing executives roamed the floors searching for hot new gadgets , ronald fleisher , president of newmark lewis inc , raced between meetings in a lastditch effort to find a buyer for his struggling company none materialized and mr fleisher said yesterday that newmark lewis s remaining 26 stores would be closed that action makes the 68yearold electronics chain the latest victim of the lethal retailing pox of overexpansion and anemic sales we could not continue to sustain losses , said mr fleisher , who was brought in two years ago to improve operations of the company , based in hicksville , li newmark lewis had been ailing for months , and since august was operating under the protection of chapter 11 of the federal bankrupcty code the company , which began 1991 with 67 stores , said that its remaining stores would be closed in two weeks , after a goingoutofbusiness sale seven of the 26 stores will be closed immediately advertisements in newsday and on new york radio stations yesterday advised shoppers to bring your car , truck or van for the final sale of all sales mr fleisher is still trying to sell all or parts of the company , and gary richard , chief executive of p c richard son , a long island rival of newmark lewis , said in an interview yesterday that he planned to make an offer for 10 newmark lewis stores newmark lewis s departure leaves several major electronics chains in the new york area , including j r music world , topps appliance city and 47th street photo several possible buyers mr fleisher said , we have several people that are looking at buying locations and we have one or two that are looking at buying the entire chain a receptionist at the executive headquarters of nobody beats the wiz , another competitor in the area and mentioned in the industry as a possible acquirer , said that it would not comment on newmark lewis in addition to overexpansion , mr fleisher said , the company , like others in the industry , suffered from the lack of a musthave new product in recent years recently , newmark lewis also lost business on long island to new competitors including k mart and several warehouse stores like the price club that sell electronics at low prices other bankruptcies expected as a result of the competition , mr fleisher said he expected other electronics retailers an awful lot of guys who are marginal right now to follow newmark lewis to the corporate graveyard newmark lewis also said yesterday that its stock was being removed from the american stock exchange list because the company no longer met the financial guidelines of the exchange the final trading day will be jan 24 the company said the liquidation was unlikely to leave anything for shareholders the company s stock had lately been trading at 125 cents a share the newmark lewis work force has been whittled down to about 200 employees , from 825 last year mr fleisher said newmark lewis was working with other electronic retailers to help find jobs for its workers when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in august , mr fleisher expressed hope that it could survive as a smaller company but christmas sales were far worse then expected debts to suppliers i thought we were going to hang on until airconditioning season , but we did n't make it , said mike mancino , assistant manager of a newmark lewis store in the bronx the manufacturers are demanding their money and we ca n't come up with it jeffrey l goldberg , executive vice president of newmark lewis , said the company owed 25 million to suppliers of ovens , camcorders , compactdisk players , color televisions and toasters he said it was too early to know what percentage of claims the company would be able to pay off the company owes an additional 15 million to several banks and finance companies 'boom and bust syndrome' martin brochstein , senior editor of television digest , an industry newsletter , said , newmark lewis is indicative of the boom and bust syndrome in the consumer electronics business the company , founded in 1924 , was a strong local chain that grew ambitious after industry sales exploded in the early 1980 s on the strength of new products like vcr s and microwave ovens that consumers could not seem to get enough of the company expanded quickly by opening new stores and by buying the 14 brick church electronics stores in 1990 those stores never performed up to expectations , and things began to unravel last year for newmark lewis photo newmark lewis , which has been in bankruptcy since august , announced yesterday that it would close its last stores within two weeks a branch in the flatbush section of brooklyn ran a liquidation sale yesterday \( steve hart for the new york times \)
dear diary , saw ad in this paper that asked what makes this watch worth 1 , 000 , 000 \? thought , good question thought , how much longer will battery keep going on fouryearold timex \? made note to take a look at what ad referred to as set of five handcrafted oneofakind timepieces as monumental as the event they were created to honor the discovery of the new world since ad said watches were to be leaving new york branch of asprey , the london jewelers , by wednesday for world tour , raced down to check them out at shop at 725 fifth avenue did not have to stand in line staff , all englishaccented , very hospitable and welcoming asked whether reference to watches being monumental as discovery of new world reflected british understatement lucinda nason , one of the sales people , replied crisply , this is new york she said a number of people had expressed interest in the watches , held them , strapped them on , but no bids had been made at the store eduardo ciruelos , a representative of north american watch , the parent company of concord , explained that it had taken three years to make the five watches and that the effort involved 20 craftsmen working in brienne , switzerland he said watches had been purchased by asprey , the twocenturyold british jewelers from bond street he would not say what asprey paid for them but said the five watches were being valued at 2 , 500 , 000 and he imagined they would be sold as a set they are really very nice watches four are gold and one is platinum and all are quite heavy mr ciruelos says he imagined they would carry a guarantee they have black crocodile bands , which , ms nason said , could be changed should a buyer prefer something else tried on the platinum one , the milliondollar number featured in the ad felt a little fear , some awe aware of personal history of klutziness also felt waves of broaderbased guilt is it right to wear a milliondollar watch , even for 10 seconds \? quickly returned it to ms nason , who seemed very understanding spotted one problem none of the five watches had the right time when this was pointed out to mr ciruelos , he said it was because watches had not been wound these are not batteryoperated or selfwinding , he said they are mechanical watches and need to be wound by hand , he said he added that he supposed anyone who could afford to buy them could afford to hire someone to wind them the platinum watch , referred to as the queen of the collection , has a lot of interesting features like a transparent crystal back , through which all the levers and wheels can be seen turning the back also has a thermometer , which registers the temperature inside the watch , but in centigrade sure , anyone rich enough to buy it could also hire own physicist to convert to fahrenheit front face of the watch , which is designated as the mariner v centenario no 4 , tells the time , the month , the day of the month , the day of the week and the phases of the moon it also takes account of leap years , which is the kind of thing that can slip your mind best things in the watch are the timetelling chimes , which mr ciruelos demonstrated say you are someplace where you ca n't look at your watch a cave , maybe , or a broom closet you pull this lever and the watch uses three tones to let you know what time it is first one makes a sound like pling and tells the hours so pling pling pling would mean three o'clock then there s a tinklier tone sounding like pchan that signals 15minute chunks so pchan pchan means half past a third set of tones combines the pling sound and the pchan sound to designate the minutes so there you are in the broom closet you pull the lever the watch goes pling , pling , pling , pling , pling , pchan , pchan , pchan , plingpchan , plingpchan , plingpchan right away you know it is 5 48 , though you have to figure out the am and pm on your own the platinum no 4 , which weighs 1281 grams , and the no 1 , an 18karat gold splitsecond chronograph , features tourbillons , devices invented in 1801 to keep watch movements ticking steadily as they are shifted from horizontal to vertical planes mr ciruelos said a tourbillon is just about the trickiest and most complex thing a watchmaker can make and that in fact there are fewer than a dozen people in the world who can make one from scratch the no 2 watch , also in 18karat gold , combines a splitsecond chronograph with perpetual calendar features no 3 combines a stop watch on one side with a tachymeter on the other surveyers use tachymeters to determine rate of speed or the distance between two fixed points finally , there is the no 5 watch that shows a map of the new world on its face and offers time in major cities it also chimes with plings , pchans and plingpchans a few blocks away from store met street peddler from senegal selling what looked like but probably were not famous swiss watches for between 30 and 50 they looked very nice but none quite like a million bucks photo one of a collection of five watches , valued at 25 million , for sale at asprey on fifth avenue \( fred r conrad the new york times \)
washington , june 15 in the third blow in a week to new york state s influence in congress , representative frank horton , the dean of the state s congressional delegation who faced a tough reelection battle because of redistricting , announced today that he was retiring the 72yearold congressman whose 30 years in the house spanned seven presidents , five speakers and four minority leaders said he had pondered retirement for some time but made the decision on sunday after discussing it with his wife mr horton , a rockefeller republican who voted with liberal democrats more often than with the bush or reagan administrations , said he did not want to run against a longtime friend , representative louise m slaughter , a democrat , his likely opponent under a redistricting plan adopted by the state legislature the two currently represent districts that include parts of rochester 'that s enough' if i 'd had the same district , i would n't even have thought about it , i would have run willynilly , mr horton said in an interview after announcing his decision to retire in a nearly empty house chamber none of the things i 've been doing are finished but with redistricting , you have to think about it there comes a time when you have to do something for yourself after 30 years , that s enough the ranking republican on the government operations committee , mr horton had an important , though unpublicized , influence on the operation of the federal government he was instrumental in placing inspectors general financial watchdogs in federal departments and in passing the 1989 whistleblower protection act , which guards federal employees who expose waste , fraud and abuse from reprisals what was most extraordinary about frank is his style frank prefers accomplishments that will help people rather than insider partisan squabbling that leads nowhere , said john conyers jr , the michigan democrat who is the chairman of the government operations committee and who would often spend time with his colleague debating jazz and baseball he is a coalition builder , a problem solver and a team strategist known as one of the least partisan representatives , mr horton was an expert in maneuvering new york representatives onto important congressional committees , and he often boasted he was the only minority member ever to serve as chairman of a state congressional delegation voter dissatisfaction mr horton s decision adds to the upheaval reverberating through the house in the wake of mushrooming voter dissatisfaction and the checking scandal so far , 71 representatives have announced their retirement or have been defeated in primaries , insuring the greatest turnover in the house since world war ii the wholesale turnover is likely to be particularly difficult for new york state and for the new york metropolitan area , which by most measurements receives less federal money per capita than almost any other region national population shifts have cost the state three seats , the most in the country in addition , new jersey is to lose one that means an 83 percent drop in the size of the two states' delegation the impact for new york is that california is going to eat our lunch , said representative slaughter , who now appears to have a clear path to reelection we 're not only losing people , we 're losing seniority california is gaining seven seats under redistricting for a total of 52 mr horton is the third member of the state delegation to announce his retirement in the last week he follows representative david o'b martin of canton , a veteran republican who has used his seat on the armed services committee to win federal money for his economically distressed , upstate district , and representative raymond j mcgrath of valley stream , li , a practicalminded moderate who focused on local concerns and the seventhranking republican on the ways and means committee
trying to make dna testing the kind of investigative weapon that fingerprints have long been , the cuomo administration wants to create a genetic database by compelling convicted murderers and sex offenders to provide blood samples gov mario m cuomo calls the dna system a revolutionary , powerful and necessary criminaljustice tool that will help track down criminal suspects and exonerate innocent people but a bill proposed by mr cuomo to establish the dna database is encountering mixed support in the legislature , with republican leaders more supportive than the governor s fellow democrats and , civil rights and legal defense groups are lining up solidly against the plan , asserting that it fails to assure the scientific reliability of dna as evidence and that the plan would violate people s rights by compelling them to give blood samples for evidence that could be used against them in the future governor cuomo should not rush to judgment that dna database banks are valid as evidence , said norman siegel , the executive director of the new york civil liberties union he should not be so beholden to the lawenforcement community that wants this system installed quickly a keen scientific debate the governor s proposal comes amid growing interest , and much debate , over dna testing in the most recent scientific report on the matter , a panel of the national academy of sciences last month endorsed the general reliability of dna typing in forensic science , but called for very strict standards to assure that the technique was performed properly in crime laboratories richard h girgenti , the state s director of criminal justice , who helped draft the cuomo bill , said that safeguards would protect the civil rights of defendants and that the system would comply with the highest laboratory standards for dna analysis in the country as the century is coming to a close we are on the verge of having dna technology as important as fingerprinting was at the beginning of the century , said mr girgenti we are going through the same kind of debate and resistance that people had 100 years ago over the value of fingerprints as evidence used in hundreds of cases since the late 1980 s , dna evidence has been ruled admissible in hundreds of criminal cases in the nation , including new york state , although critics contend that it has not been proved absolutely reliable dna evidence is now obtained by getting a blood sample from an arrested suspect to determine if the genetic pattern matches forensic evidence at the crime scene in principle , dna typing relies on comparisons of genetic material from a suspect to that obtained from microscopic samples of body tissue found at a crime scene , such as a drop of dried semen , a spatter of blood or a strand of hair the analysis compares the dna from the two samples to determine how likely it is that the material obtained at the crime scene came from the suspect except for identical twins , each person s dna is unique the governor s plan would allow detectives to submit dna evidence found at a crime site or on a victim s clothes to the database to determine if it matches a dna profile in the system and thereby could possibly identify a suspect the database would be similar to the computerized systems used in new york and other states to compare latent fingerprints found at crime scenes with fingerprints already in the automated system eighteen states have authorized dna databases in the last two years , but none is yet completely operational , mr girgenti said the federal bureau of investigation , which has conducted most of the analysis of dna samples for authorities in new york and other states , is a proponent of a national automated database system in which lawenforcement agencies would exchange dna data samples from the convicted the cuomo administration , in a bill submitted to the assembly and senate on april 20 , proposed that blood samples would be taken from all persons convicted of homicide or sex crimes starting june 1 , 1993 , for inclusion in the state s database the felony crimes covered in the bill are murder in the second degree , manslaughter , criminally negligent homicide , rape and sodomy mr girgenti said that the database would begin with murderers and sexual offenders because dna evidence is more likely to be uncovered in homicides and sexual attacks than in other crimes and sexual offenders , he emphasized , often are recidivists because the samples would be from people convicted of crimes , however , it would take years , until the defendants were out of custody , before the dna samples would be of much use the cuomo bill also would create a forensic science review panel at the division of criminal justice services to develop minimum standards and regulations for accrediting laboratories to analyze dna specimens mr girgenti said most of the dna analysis for local police agencies would be conducted by state police forensic experts in an accredited staterun laboratory in albany other provisions in the dna bill would place controls over the release of dna records and make the state s database consistent with the fbi s so that information could be exchanged democrats 'lukewarm' we are optimistic about the bill , said john e mcardle , a spokesman for ralph j marino , the republican majority leader of the state senate there is real interest in it on our side but steven a greenberg , a spokesman for speaker saul weprin in the democraticcontrolled assembly , said the party s leadership was lukewarm , mainly because of concerns that it would be premature to establish a database until there wascertainty that state technicians could conduct reliable dna tests sheldon silver , a manhattan democrat and chairman of the assembly s ways and means committee , questioned the constitutionality of mandating tests from convicted felons for use should they get out of of jail and commit another crime he contended that the compiling of fingerprint records differed from dna analysis because prints are obtained in connection with the crime for which the person already had been arrested , not for a possible future crime
charles lippman , a rabbi sister grace rowland , a nun the rev frank nelson , a priest leanza cornett , miss america 1993 five students from stuyvesant high school william joseph of cleveland and his children , robyn and bill twin brothers from glendale , calif and oh , yes dr ruth all of them have become fodder in the promotion of the broadway musical falsettos since last summer , ads for falsettos have also shown a doctor , a policeman and a manicurist , as well as blacks and asians and theatergoers with irish , italian and jewish names their approving smiles have been photographed , and their endorsements of the show have appeared in a series of jokey but attentiongetting newspaper and magazine advertisements that characterize the show as universal family entertainment falsettos is about a family , all right , though not exactly the cleavers or the nelsons in this household the husband takes up with a male lover and leaves his wife , who in turn marries her exhusband s psychiatrist it s a family , in short , that is transformed by homosexuality in the era of aids , not exactly an easy sell to theatergoers looking for an evening of fun , though in fact , the musical is quite lighthearted the current ad campaign is the fourth since the show opened in april falsettos , which combines two oneact musicals by william finn into a single show , received nearly unanimously positive reviews and two tony awards but its small scale and its subject matter have forced its producers to struggle constantly to sell the show to the mainstream broadway audience it needs to survive the success of barry and fran weissler , the producers , at keeping falsettos going is a classic case of creative theater marketing 3 campaigns later it almost did n't work the weisslers have gone through more than 800 , 000 , abandoned three promotion campaigns and switched advertising agencies to keep attracting an audience the first advertising campaign , inspired by the weisslers' desire for an identifying logo , such as the feline eyes from cats , focused on one elegant , transcendent image , which might nevertheless have been obscure to theatergoers keith haring s drawing of two adults and a child holding aloft a vibrantlooking heart despite the ads and enthusiastic audiences , the box office during previews was weak , and the weisslers were nervous since keith died of aids , mr weissler said , many people felt the drawing was meant to attract a gay audience on the assumption that gay theatergoers would find falsettos through word of mouth and that advertising should be directed at a wider audience , the focus was shifted to smiling , upbeat images of the cast members , especially the photogenic jonathan kaplan , who played the son , jason after that came ads trumpeting the show s seven tony award nominations and , in june , its two tony awards , for best book of a musical and best original score not bad , but since the show missed out on the biggest salebooster , the award for best musical \( which went to crazy for you \) , the struggle continued we kept pushing and trying , we kept making suggestions , said frank pellegrino , a vice president at grey advertising the weisslers were satisfied each time but then they would want more eventually they wanted more than grey could give i think we were driving them nuts , mrs weissler said by mutual consent , they parted the current tack on july 1 , ledonne , wilner weiner took over a specialist in theatrical advertising , the agency also represents catskills on broadway and solitary confinement we tried to make the show s contemporary themes work for us , said jon wilner , a partner who supervised the account his agency s answer was to take the television testimonial commercial , he said , which has been an art form on broadway for a long time , and make it into a print campaign he added that the campaign is not targeting specific catholic or jewish or family audiences , but trying to get across the idea that 'falsettos' is for everyone on successive matinee days , peter ledonne , the agency s creative director , waited in front of the golden as audiences emerged he picked out people and had them videotaped and photographed the instantly famous theatergoers signed releases but were not paid then mr wilner saw that the new miss america had based her program in atlantic city on aids awareness , and he invited her to the show within 48 hours of winning her crown , we were photographing her for one of our ads , he said benchmark of success ultimately , the months of marketing led to a moment of triumph in the last week of october , when falsettos earned back its investment in the relatively short span of 28 weeks trade publications have reported that the weisslers are negotiating a deal for a movie version with touchstone pictures of the walt disney company and interscope communications inc , owned by polygram nv in addition , falsettos will soon have two national tours , though the subject matter continues to be a problem the denver center for the performing arts has booked it for march 1994 , but unlike previous weissler productions , it will not be in the theater s subscription series , mr weissler said falsettos was the last show of the 199192 season to open on broadway with a cast of six and a barebones set , it was capitalized at 957 , 000 , hardly in the range of crazy for you , which cost 75 million yet many of the weisslers' regular investors , who considered the show s content too risky for broadway , declined to back it , and soon the producers were reduced to accepting investments of as little as 25 , 000 the smallest share in their other productions , which have included cat on a hot tin roof and gypsy , is often 10 times that , mrs weissler said ultimately , the weisslers lent falsettos much of its production money and invested more than usual , 350 , 000 of the capitalization so is it a hit \? in the 805seat golden theater , falsettos has a breakeven point of 160 , 000 to 180 , 000 a week , depending on the weekly advertising expenditure , which has averaged from 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 a week , an unusually high figure for such a modest production and on broadway , falsettos manages to hang in there , selling twothirds to threefourths of its seats every night is it a hit \? a nervous hit , mrs weissler said we never know in the morning whether we 'll have an audience that night there s still no advance but the people keep coming all along we 've just been feeling our way , mr weissler said we still are , mrs weissler said none of our previous experience prepared us for this as for mr finn , the haring ad was his favorite , and now you only see it on the tshirts this latest campaign is not pretty , he said , and it s not very classy for what is , i hope , a classy show but it is hilarious and it seems to be working photos the promotion of falsettos has evolved from the original ad , in which a drawing by keith haring depicted two adults and a child holding aloft a vibrantlooking heart , to the fourth campaign , where real people endorse the show as universal family entertainment
washington will the new era be dominated by regional alliances and economic pacts or by a renewal of global and multilateral institutions \? the 1990 s are shaping up as a struggle between these rival international orders so far , regional relationships in europe , north america and elsewhere have the upper hand the emerging world order looks like an old house new rooms , windows and doors have been added , but the foundation , plumbing and wiring remain in dangerous disrepair there is a need to make regional economic experiments complement , not compete , with multilateralism this requires agreement among the major nations about a blueprint of a new world order most creative foreign policy in recent years has been directed at regional economic integration , particularly in europe , north america and asia these efforts need not compete with the larger global order most studies of european and north american integration conclude that it will create more trade than it diverts nor are regional agreements necessarily incompatible with the global regime of gatt pulling down internal walls without raising external ones is good for the world economy the real danger of regionalism lies elsewhere regionalism is difficult to shield from domestic and transnational political pressures and disputes the european community s hard line against japanese imports suggests how regionalism deepens fault lines european and north american regionalism also diverts attention from gatt and other multilateral institutions the promise of european unity and the north american freetrade agreement has reduced the political costs should the current round of multilateral trade negotiations fail in this real sense , regional and global institutions compete the task is to fold regional experiments into global institutional reform key will be the relationship among the industrial democracies the group of seven some suggest a group of seven declaration on the limits and responsibilities of good regionalism this would ease fears in asia and elsewhere about the ultimate aims of recent regional agreements it would also push the group of seven countries to use their next summit to discuss the basic structure of world order helmut kohl and john major are not bismarck and palmerston , and presidentelect bill clinton certainly has none of the pretensions of woodrow wilson , but these leaders must be strongly encouraged to be global architects the group of seven should also focus on its own inadequate process the annual summit meetings of heads of state are overly formal , scripted events that produce little more than bland official communiques experts nicknamed sherpas do the real work in the months leading up to the meetings coordination must be strengthened by turning the summits into informal discussions , while formalizing meetings of ministers and experts global institutional reform must also extend to traditional multilateral organizations the united nations , international monetary fund and world bank without a new mission , they look increasingly like relics security council seats for japan and germany are inevitable negotiations over this issue should be broadened into an effort to make the un more relevant in international disputes the 50th anniversary of the international monetary fund and world bank in 1994 and of the un in 1995 will be moments of symbolic opportunity american officials need to articulate a vision of how these global institutions serve our interests and strategy for shaping the emerging order recession and electionyear politics have inevitably obscured the big issues of foreign policy after world war ii , americans were more worried about the economy than in building a new international order stalin provided the jolt to the west for united action today there is no such stimulus leadership and vision will have to make the difference if we are to put our global house in order
st louis , aug 15 in perfect concert with the underdog tradition of golf s fourth major championship , gene sauers continued to play the best golf of his life today to maintain his twoshot lead at the 74th pga championship the 29yearold sauers fired a oneunderpar 70 , punctuated by an eagle 3 at the 17th hole , for a 54hole total of sevenunder 206 that put space between him and several other underdogs , and even more between sauers and some of golf s biggest names the closest pursuers are secondyear pro jeff maggert , who fired a courserecord 65 , and nick price of zimbabwe john cook and jim gallagher jr are at 210 , and mark brooks is at 211 that putt went right between some spike marks , said sauers of the 25footer he made for an eagle i said thank you very much sometimes everything just goes your way the top six are the only players under par , and none have ever won a major championship , although price finished second in the british open in 1982 and 1988 , and cook did likewise last month at muirfield but at the championship where recent winners have included john daly , wayne grady , jeff sluman and bob tway , having a marquee name almost seems to be unnecessary baggage the closest stars are barely within shouting distance ray floyd and paul azinger are at par 216 , and fred couples and tom kite are at 218 nick faldo , the biggest name of all , and the man who was expected to take charge today , is at oneover 217 after a disastrous fiveover 76 in which missed putts eventually caused the most solid teetogreen game in golf to unravel for faldo , who has not finished worst than eighth in a tournament since the masters , the score tied his highest of the year i just played badly , said a terse faldo , who missed six putts of under 10 feet , as he left the 18th green for the practice tee i just lost it tomorrow will be a hard day it s not impossible , so i just have to find out what i'm doing wrong i 've just got to go for it i 've got nothing to lose in a different way , sauers , who came into this championship 36th on the pga tour money list and is the winner of two tournaments in nine years on the tour , can say the same thing i was a little nervous on the first tee , but nothing major , said the softspoken native of savannah , ga , who is trying to treat this week as a runofthemill event this is how i approach every golf tournament maybe i'm trying to kid myself , but i can sit here and say i can i wo n't know until tonight i think i can i hope daly went through the same dilemma last year , and passed with flying colors to win by three strokes price thinks sauers can , too 'he has a big heart' golf is such a daytoday game i do n't know if experience always matters , said price , whose caddy , jeff \( squeaky \) medlen , caddied for daly at crooked stick you go with how you feel over each shot gene is a very solid player he has a big heart we are going to have to go out and beat him tomorrow i do n't think he s going to give it to us it will indeed be hard to come from behind if sauers continues to play solidly bellerive was more grudging than ever with birdies today , as its greens became firmer and more spikemarked sauers said the greens were so hard the sound of a ball landing on them was like my little son s head hitting the floor but maggert and cook proved today that low scores can be shot maggert , who is winless in his two seasons on the tour but has contended on several occasions , had six birdies and no bogeys his final three birdies came on the final three holes , climaxing after a 3iron to 12 feet on the 454yard parfour 18th hole cook s recurring memory i do n't think anybody is going to go out and make seven birdies on sunday , said maggert , who is playing in his fourth major championship and the only one he has ever made the cut in i'm just going to be patient and try not to make any bogeys again for cook , a victory would be wonderful comeback from his heartbreak at the british open at muirfield , where he missed a twofoot putt on the 71st hole and bogeyed the 72d to lose by one to faldo i think about it a couple of times a day , admitted cook i do n't dwell on it , but i definitely think about it just as he did in the final round at muirfield , cook recovered from a double bogey on the front nine today , coming back to play the back nine in fourunder 31 he said his strategy on sunday will be to get in position on the front nine and see what it will take to win i'm going to go out and give 1000 percent , said the 34yearold cook i think muirfield was a great experience everything about it one thing i learned was that i 've got to control myself before i can control anything else of course , if sauers , who has led after every round , can continue to control himself , it will take a great deal indeed to keep him from going wire to wire
the more i watch earvin johnson and jerry tarkanian attempt to come to grips with their sports mortality , the more i wonder which of them is the more sorrowful figure both are clearly having difficulty letting go johnson from his role as a professional basketball star the sun around which the lakers once revolved tarkanian from his role as head basketball coach for 19 years at the university of nevadalas vegas there is more to their tenacious holding on , though , than a mere reluctance to face retirement the root of it is that they have been forced out to pasture , not by age , injury or common sense , but by their own blunders of excess johnson was overtaken by the trysts and turns of life in the fast lane , tarkanian was done in by his voracious appetite for great talent and questionable methods of getting it to unlv magic announced his retirement last november after testing positive for hiv , the virus that causes aids he played in the national basketball association allstar game and was the star of his own showcase the lakers retired his number a couple of weeks ago , and during the ceremony johnson repeated his assertion that he intended to play in the olympic games this summer and suggested that he might return to the lakers there have been murmurs from players and coaches that magic should give it up , move to the next level indeed , for so long , this was the next level but johnson s river has flowed so powerfully for so long that he ca n't believe it has run its course it s almost as if he wants to rise above his retirement and the illness that forced him into it tarkanian , on the other hand , has decided to go out with guns blazing he originally announced his retirement in june , weeks after a las vegas paper ran photographs showing three unlv players in a hot tub drinking beer with a man who had been convicted twice of fixing sports events now the 61yearold coach is saying that he was coerced into resigning on sunday , tarkanian told a congregation at a church in west las vegas that he was rescinding his resignation if they want him out , they 'll have to kick him out tarkanian had figured he would retire at unlv at age 65 and be treated like an icon he was brought to las vegas in 1973 by a group of bankers , casino owners and developers for the precise purpose of putting unlv on the map for the greater part of two decades he stretched , tugged and tested the margins of what was allowable , what was not he relied in great part on poverty and all the wretchedly desperate situations it created to produce hungry players players who would do anything , including move to the middle of the desert to escape their environments unlv under tarkanian became a sort of desert bush ministry with the reverend coach taking socalled street kids and giving them an opportunity the truth is that none of these kids would have been at unlv if they had n't been gifted players tarkanian s flaw is that he bought into his own role as a missionary and used it to rationalize his adventuresome recruiting practices lloyd daniels could barely read and write and never finished high school tarkanian , with the school administration s knowledge , tried to enroll daniels and wanted us to believe he was just giving him a chance at life the university faces 29 ncaa infraction charges regarding the daniels recruitment robert maxson was hired as the school s president eight years ago , essentially to change unlv s image a major component of that job was getting rid of tarkanian he allowed tarkanian to be buried under the weight of his excesses like daniels and patterns of behavior that had built up over the years last week there was a report that the fbi was investigating charges of pointshaving involving unlv s 1991 team that report almost certainly made tarkanian less desirable as a headcoaching candidate at san diego state , where he supposedly was a frontrunner so once again , tarkanian feels he was sabotaged by the administration , and this time he wants to make someone pay johnson and tarkanian find themselves in the same uncomfortable twilight zone , a world that stands foursquare against the finite sports arena where everything has a neat beginning , middle and end where you play and play until a winner is declared this time , they 've been forced to accept a stalemate and both are resisting magic and tark will soon have to face the fact , for their own peace of mind , that it s time to give up the chase the party is over photo jerry tarkanian \( associated press \)
to the editor most thoughtful reformers agree managed competition should be a basic ingredient of any national health care \( the guts to reform health care , editorial , aug 2 \) however , there are some essential components that must also be addressed \( 1 \) how will the 68 million americans who are uninsured or underinsured obtain universal coverage for care provided through managed competition \? the choices are either through general taxes \( single payer \) , employerbased \( mandated \) or individual contributions through the elimination of tax deductions on health benefits \( 2 \) there must be an adequate delivery system for managed competition to work managed competition will not bring much care to a patient in the mountains of appalachia if there are few doctors and facilities an innercity resident cannot use a more efficient community health center instead of a hospital emergency room if there are none \( 3 \) how will we provide less expensive medical care with a specialisttogeneralist physician ratio of 70 percent to 30 percent , largely at taxpayer expense \? specialist care is more expensive than the same care by a family practitioner every country that has national health care also has a ratio of 50 percent primarycare physicians to specialists after 50 years of debate comprehensive health care reform may come about however , correcting the financing of this system is only one component the expensive and inadequate delivery of health care must be changed harvey i sloane , md pres , health care for america washington , aug 3 , 1992
valhalla , ny , sept 30 the westchester county medical center has moved a step closer to losing 107 million in federal money unless it agrees to offer an unrestricted job to a pharmacist infected with the virus that causes aids the possibility that the hospital could lose the federal funds became likelier this week when it lost the last in a series of administrative challenges and the federal government said on tuesday that all medicaid and medicare payments would be stopped after 30 days that left open the possibility that an agreement in principle to satisfy the federal government although none has been forthcoming the precedentsetting case began in 1986 , when the pharmacist , who is in his 30 s and lives in westchester county , applied for a job the medical center , which at first refused to hire the pharmacist , later offered him a restricted position , arguing that there was a chance that he could spread the aids virus if he prepared prescriptions soon after bringing legal action against the medical center , he found employment as a pharmacist in another hospital in the metropolitan region it probably behooves them now to suggest that an understanding exists between us because they have once again lost another battle in our favor , said the pharmacist , who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons finding out you test positive is pretty devastating to begin with , he said putting hiv aside , the last untainted frontier was my ability to get up in the morning and be productive when the county pulled that up from beneath me , it was sort of the last nail in the coffin in april the department of health and human services told the hospital that it would forfeit as much as 107 million in federal financing each year unless it hired the pharmacist without placing restrictions on his duties barry bowman , a spokesman for the 1 , 000bed hospital in valhalla , said the hospital and the pharmacist reached an agreement six weeks ago and were still ironing out the technical aspects mr bowman refused to discuss the details of the agreement but said it allows the pharmacist to start work soon he said he was not aware of any restrictions in the agreement he said a loss of 107 million in federal financing would have a major impact on the services that it delivers to poor people in a sevencounty region north of new york city the hospital operates on a budget of about 200 million a year condition of employment a threejudge review panel ruled on tuesday that the risk of the pharmacist s spreading hiv through his work was so small that it could not be measured the case began in 1986 when the pharmacist applied for work at the countyowned hospital , the largest in westchester , and a nurse who knew of his case from when he had been tested told a doctor that he was hivpositive at the time , he said , he was scheduled to start work the next week the medical center was still willing to hire the pharmacist , on the condition that he not prepare intraveneous solutions but the pharmacist said that any restrictions would constitute discrimination and won his case in 1988 before the new york state division of human rights the hospital is appealing that ruling in state courts in march 1990 , the department of health and human services found that the hospital had violated the rehabilitation act of 1973 , which bars institutions receiving federal funds from discriminating against disabled people and required the hospital to hire the pharmacist without restrictions the hospital refused to comply with that ruling and the health agency brought an enforcement proceeding before a law judge , who ruled that the medical center s restriction was discriminatory mr bowman , the spokesman for the medical center , said today that the hospital had not admitted wrongdoing we have what we believed were legitimate concerns , but obviously the department of health and human services had a different view , he said the pharmacist and his lawyer said yesterday that they were mystified by the hospital s announcement that he would be hired the only thing that has gotten their attention is the threatened loss of federal funding , said evan wolfson , a staff attorney for lambda legal defense and education fund , which has represented the pharmacist the pharmacist said he was pleased with tuesday s ruling but was still uncertain what it would mean it s one thing for them to litigate in court and force us to spend year after year in court while they sit around waiting for our patient to die or get too sick to fight it s another thing when they 're faced with the loss of 100 million finally the curtain has come down , mr wolfson said
trenton , dec 1 ushered into law with marginal political support and faint praise from its creators , new jersey s new health care system already has brought talk of major revisions and the threat of protracted legal fighting gov jim florio signed the sweeping overhaul of the state s health care system monday night , only minutes after the republicancontrolled legislature approved the package of bills , which includes a plan to pay for hospital care for the poor by diverting 16 billion from the state s unemployment insurance fund we have averted a crisis that could have shut down new jersey s health care system at midnight dec 1 , mr florio said at the same time , we have enacted farreaching insurance reforms that will help make sure no one in our state has to lie awake at night wondering how they would pay the bills if someone in the family gets sick the new method of paying for the care of those who ca n't afford it is far from perfect but it was the only option that the legislative process made available amendments expected soon although the governor had acquiesced , none of his democratic colleagues in the legislature did they voted against the package , and the republican leaders in the senate were forced to cajole a freshman republican , who at first had abstained , to supply the deciding vote the measure passed , 48 to 23 in the assembly and 21 to 18 , with one abstention , in the senate the democratic minority leader in the assembly , joseph v doria of bayonne , predicted that the issue would be back before the legislature within weeks , saying i think politically the republicans will have to amend it immediately , before we have total chaos there are at least three amendments under consideration , according to democrats in the legislature one is intended to help hospitals , especially those in urban areas , that are expected to suffer financially provisions of the amendment would create a floor under which deregulated hospital rates could not fall it would also establish a fund in the state department of health to help pay expenses for teaching hospitals and provide for state money to make up for anticipated medicaid losses 'nice try' category a second amendment would give the legislature more power to oversee the new system as it stands , the new legislation diminishes the regulatory role of the insurance commissioner , the public advocate and the appropriations committees of the legislature the third proposal would guarantee that people in inner cities and other areas that might not be served by insurance companies would still have access to medical care faced with a federal court ruling in may that outlawed the state s 12yearold system of paying for charity health care , the governor and the legislative leaders used the opportunity to revamp the entire system pushing their own ideas on health care and borrowing ideas from other states , they produced a package unlike any other plan in the nation this legislation places new jersey in the 'nice try' category , said robert hunter , president of the national insurance consumer organization he described some of the legislation as noble sounding but the overall plan as full of loopholes under an open enrollment provision , for example , the package assigns every health insurer in new jersey a quota of customers based on its market share up to that quota , the company must accept customers without regard to age , sex , health or geographic location a company that fails to do so must pay a large subsidy to blue cross and blue shield of new jersey , which now insures most of the state s highrisk customers it s easy to say in the legislature that this will work , said mr hunter it s a lot harder to make it work at the kitchen table with the insurance agent sitting across the way he said there were a number of ways insurance companies could circumvent the law for example , he said , they can advertise only to lowrisk groups , so that customers they do not want might not think of applying to them the changes agreed upon by mr florio , the senate president , donald t difrancesco , and the assembly speaker , garabed \( chuck \) haytaian , were influenced as much by politics as by the need for reform finding a source of financing for charity hospital care was the major and most pressing issue , and with both gubernatorial and legislative elections less than a year away , the governor and the republican leaders avoided any direct tax increase instead , they settled on a republican idea , tapping into the unemployment fund , an idea that has been criticized as a backdoor tax the financing source would be eliminated or in legislative terms , sunset after three years , to be replaced by statesubsidized or lowcost private health insurance or by a system in which hospitals would simply absorb more of their unpaid bills the major shortcomings , as i see them , are structural , not philosophical , said senator richard j larossa of trenton , who abstained on the bill , citing problems with the funding mechanism the system sunsets , uses a highly questionable funding source and simply does not make genuine changes on a system that is hemorrhaging and bleeding businesses , patients , insurance companies , hospitals and consumers in new jersey to death the state aflcio , which along with the state chamber of commerce had opposed the use of unemployment insurance money , said today that it would try to have the courts overturn the package the regional administrator for the federal department of labor , thomas e hill , had advised the state in october that it was inadvisable to divert money from the unemployment trust fund but an official in the office said today that the new legislation did not violate federal guidelines legally we cannot intervene , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity the new jersey legislature is perfectly within its rights photo gov jim florio and brenda j bacon , chief of management and planning , meeting late monday as the senate voted on the health care bill \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)
point mackenzie , alaska after spending more than 120 million to create farms where none existed before , the state has given up on a dream born when oil money grew faster than anything planted in the ground the 15yearold program to produce milk on this stretch of flat land near anchorage and to raise barley in alaska s icy interior has collapsed under a pile of debt and bad luck the land that was supposed to give rise to the great alaskan dairy industry is fast returning to nature on a winter day , moose chomp on frozen willow twigs around barns that have been abandoned to the long boreal night harvey baskin , the last of the statesubsidized dairy farmers , kicked a pile of rockhard cow manure on a recent day you want to know how to lose money in a hurry \? he said become a farmer with the state of alaska as your partner this is what you call negative farming a sovietamerican hybrid the alaskan farm project , a curious hybrid of sovietstyle agriculture and traditional american romance with the land , would be the stuff of black comedy were there not so many families stuck with a lifetime of debt helped by the state development programs , farmers were sold the rights to land they could not legally own and given a strict time schedule to raise products that nobody wanted to buy wild animals ate most of the barley and the milk cost so much to produce that it was priced out of the market few of the agricultural pioneers have made any money i'm a veteran of three wars , and i have never been up against anything so bad as the struggle with this farm , said mr baskin , who is 63 years old and has spent the last 10 years in a losing fight with the land gusher of money in midfebruary at point mackenzie the temperature averaged 20 degrees below zero , but harsh weather is the least of the problems that have hounded all but mr baskin out of business to understand why a state with enough glaciers to cover half of new england aspired to become the breadbasket of the north , as they called it in the early days of optimism , one must remember what alaska was like in the late 1970 s the pipeline that carries oil from the north slope to valdez , 800 miles to the south , opened in 1977 , and with it came a gusher of money that radically transformed the state the pipeline made some alaskans believe that there was no dream too farfetched , no grand vision that could not come true and so , in the first year of extravagant oil wealth , a scheme to make alaska a major farm state was hatched at the state capital in juneau , we had more money than we knew what to do with , and somebody sold the state government on this idea , said john cramer , the acting director of the alaska division of agriculture the seed for this plan was planted initially by agriculture professors at the university of alaska at fairbanks , and nurtured by several governors land of giant turnips it was not as if crops could not be grown in alaska in the 1930 s , several hundred dust bowl families were relocated to farm the matanuska valley , about 30 miles northeast of anchorage to this day , the descendants of those families still grow 80pound cabbages and 200pound turnips that thrive on the midnight sun but those are vegetable farms , dependent on the summer s short , intense growing season what the state wanted in the late 1970 s was to establish barley farms in the vast , frigid interior near fairbanks and dairy farms outside anchorage in these cases , the weather would prove more of an obstacle beginning in 1978 , the first of 103 , 000 acres were sold in a lottery more than 10 , 000 people put in for less than 100 tracts for a minimal fee , the lucky winners could become farmers the state would lend them up to 1 million each , but in return they had to clear the land and have milk or grain on the table within three years the state promised to build a grain terminal , which would be used to ship some of the barley to the japanese the rest was supposed to be sold to the statesubsidized dairy farmers jerry brehmer was one of the first farmers to give it a go in 1978 he took over 2 , 300 acres near delta junction , south of fairbanks mr brehmer was reared in north dakota , whose climate is similar to alaska s interior hot summer days and long , frigid winters where the buffalo roam by the third year he had his crop up but he had not counted on the bison herds alaska , unlike north dakota , is still overrun with wild animals to keep the bison away , the state spent several million dollars making decoy farms , complete with a path of hay that was supposed to lead the bison away from the real farms but the bison ate the hay and grain on the decoy farms , and then went back to farms like mr brehmer s by the mid1980 s mr brehmer had enough fences to keep the bison out , and was producing bumper crops but there was no place to sell them barley prices , and demand , collapsed worldwide and with no export market , the promised grain terminal was never completed so here we were , sitting there with all this barley that nobody wanted to buy , and a mound of debt , he said mr brehmer now lives in new mexico
over the last few years , hundreds of coop owners in new york city have furtively turned their spare bedrooms and vacant apartments into bedandbreakfasts , helping them keep up with the cost of property that many cannot resell , and offering tourists a homey , inexpensive alternative to the city s hotels but now , overturning a judge s ruling that had given some legitimacy to these hosts , a state appeals court has held that a coop s board of directors has the right to prohibit a shareholder from operating a bedandbreakfast in his apartment the appellate division of state supreme court in manhattan ruled on thursday that peter hoffman , who for five years has rented his coop apartment on east 73d street to tourists , had violated the coop s proprietary lease and ordered him to stop having chosen the cooperative form of ownership , the fourmember panel wrote in a broad decision , plaintiff is bound to abide by the rules and regulations governing its operation growing trend threatened the court s decision could threaten hundreds of bedandbreakfasts that have proliferated in all sorts of apartments across manhattan and , to a lesser extent , in brooklyn , queens and the bronx , because the vast majority operate without permission from coop boards , and around city and state laws a bedandbreakfast costs anywhere from 50 for a single to more than 100 for a double compared with about 125 for an average hotel room the new york state hospitality and tourism association estimates there are more than 1 , 200 in new york city , many of them coops but also privately owned and rented apartments mr hoffman turned his twobedroom , 10thfloor apartment in the diplomat , a 140unit coop between first and second avenues , into a bedandbreakfast in 1987 , renting out either one room or the whole apartment for a night or more at a time he listed it with a number of reservation agencies that help match hosts and guests in 1990 , after noticing a stream of visitors lugging suitcases up the elevators \( including one who asked for a bellhop \) , the coop s directors notified mr hoffman that he was violating the rules , which prohibit unapproved guests and commercial activity appeal is planned arguing that the coop s directors and employees had harassed his guests , mr hoffman sued , and in september 1991 , justice irma v santaella of state supreme court ruled in his favor citing a 1938 ruling that permitted the occasional sharing of a home with others , she ordered the coop board to leave his bedandbreakfast alone but the appellate judges e leo milonas , ernst h rosenberger , betty wienberg ellerin and israel rubin disagreed , saying that justice santaella s interpretation of the 1938 ruling was misplaced and did not apply to coop apartments , which are governed by proprietary leases that all shareholders sign neal stearns , the executive vicepresident of the diplomat s coop board , said mr hoffman had never sought the board s permission to operate a bedandbreakfast a coop is just what it says it is , he said , a group of people living together cooperatively mr hoffman said he would appeal the court s decision he said he had come to rely on the income from his bedandbreakfast , which he insists falls in a legal gray area he said that none of his guests , which have included a congressman and a foreign ambassador , had ever troubled anyone in the coop discreete businesses the thing is i'm not running an opium den , mr hoffman said i'm having guests the decision , like several other state court rulings , reaffirms the ability of coops to decide who or what they will accept and it could pose serious problems for others like mr hoffman whose thriving cottage industry has grown steadily , especially as coop owners have struggled to cope with the realestate slump this will probably stop it in its tracks , morton h rosen , the coop s lawyer , said , and it will certainly reassure many shareholders in this city who were concerned about security and the devaluation of their property by the potential for their building to be used as a hotel but mary mcaulay , who runs urban ventures , the city s largest and oldest bedandbreakfast reservation agency , said she doubted that the ruling would profoundly affect business she said most hosts operate furtively anyway and , in today s tough economy , some coops welcome the idea as long as shareholders pay their bills i do n't think it s going to have much impact , ms mcaulay said , because most people do it very discreetly photo the appellate division of state supreme court in manhattan has ordered peter hoffman to stop renting his coop apartment to tourists as a bedandbreakfast , which he has been doing for five years \( philip greenberg for the new york times \)

wholeness again on the other hand , i may be reading meanings into a script that is vague enough to invite a wide range of interpretations the playwright has always liked to tell odd stories and that

bill graham presents my life inside rock and out by bill graham and robert greenfield illustrated 568 pp new york doubleday 24 bill graham knew how to stage a rock concert , but he really knew how to stage a tantrum in 1966 , shortly after he began operating the fillmore auditorium in san francisco , he threw a tantrum because ken kesey was allowing hell s angels into the club for free in 1969 he got into a tussle with the rolling stones' tour manager over a security matter onstage , in front of 15 , 000 people , while the stones were playing satisfaction in 1976 , right after he produced the band s allstar farewell concert , known as the last waltz , he screamed hysterically over the phone at the group s leader , robbie robertson , claiming that mr robertson had never thanked him and in 1988 , during a world tour , featuring sting , bruce springsteen and others , to promote human rights , he bawled out the entire staff of amnesty international repeatedly from the mid1960 s until graham s death last year at the age of 60 in a helicopter crash , concert promotion was his art throwing tantrums was his signature bill graham presents my life inside rock and out chronicles both an oral history with voices dominated by graham but including musicians , friends and associates and completed by robert greenfield , the author of stp a journey through america with the rolling stones , the book looks at 25 years of rockandroll from one man s vantage point graham saw it all , from woodstock to live aid , from 60 s acid tests to reaganera asceticism , and he saw it from backstage over the years , he evolved into one of rock s few nonperforming celebrities describing the atmosphere at the rolling stones' show in 1969 , the band s keith richards says that graham had a bigger personality in the building than anybody else who was on the show it was like , 'backstage starring bill graham ! ' in the same way , graham himself , over the course of the book , eclipses the times he lived in bill graham presents is certainly about rockandroll and because there is no narrator or framework for the incidents , the book assumes a certain knowledge on the part of the reader it is anecdotal , reveling in the minutiae but sometimes glossing over the big picture for example , plenty of analysis is given of the events at the 1969 rolling stones concert at the altamont speedway in california , but none of the various speakers lay clear the basic facts of how and why an audience member was killed woodstock is not interesting in and of itself , but in the way graham sees it the sound was awful at the height of the psychedelic era , graham was running around in a suit holding a clipboard , organized and responsible and drugfree he was like the wife , says one business friend always , graham had vision he was a master orchestrator of the live moment , with a strong sense of the way performer and audience should meet when his visions were realized , history was made young hippies dancing to the grateful dead at the original fillmore , millions of viewers tied into a cause at live aid when reality interfered with his vision , tantrums resulted graham s outbursts reflected the times they became more excessive in the 70 s , more desperate in the 80 s , as his 60 srooted ideals of expression simply fell out of date one of the most chilling passages in the book comes near the end , when graham is left out of the rolling stones' massive steel wheels tour he stops having tantrums bill graham presents is a vital portrait of a man , more than of an era it is a loving tribute in that it suggests the theater of rock might have been drastically dimmer without this character stomping around behind the scenes photo bill graham with janis joplin in golden gate park , san francisco , 1967 \( grant jacobs from bill graham presents \)
fort lauderdale , fla , march 2 every day , it s the same thing jesse barfield comes to camp , changes into his uniform , catches some fly balls in the outfield , takes his swings in the batting cage and then waits to see if this is the day he gets traded it has been like this since he arrived last week work and wait and wonder but six days into workouts , barfield is still a yankee i look at it one way , he said if i'm here , i'm going to play if i go somewhere else , i'm still going to play all i can do is come and get my work in i do n't worry about it , that s for sure the yankees are n't worried , either although their hope is to move barfield and his 2 million salary this month , they are prepared to keep him in an outfield that also includes danny tartabull in left and roberto kelly in center juggling for positions their initial hope was to trade barfield , then put tartabull in right , kelly in center and mel hall in left but with barfield still here , the yanks have two designated hitters , hall and kevin maas complicated , no \? they definitely have a lot of decisions to make , barfield said i 'd hate to have to make them but that s not my job it is gene michael , the general manager , who must attempt to trade barfield but at the moment , he conceded that everything is on hold teams are waiting to look at their players , michael said today at this time of year , the games are getting close , and talks wo n't heat up until a week to 10 days after that then you 'll see teams getting busy near the end but we think we can do a couple of things even without a deal , the yankees seem prepared and willing to keep barfield jesse , to me , is one of the premier defensive players in baseball , manager buck showalter said the other day and , he gives you offensive run production none of our outfielders will be given away there s a possibility that all of those guys will be with our ball club barfield s only response is , why not \? when they got danny , he said , i started to wonder what my status would be here i have never played anything but right field , and he s a right fielder , too my question is , why ca n't all three of us me , danny , roberto be out there \? that s a great outfield i sure would n't be hurt if they kept me in fact , barfield has made it clear to the yankees that he wants to stay michael has been among his strongest supporters , and barfield supplied needed power in 1990 , his first full season in new york , totaling 25 homers and 78 runs batted in but last season , he went on the disabled list for the first time in three years , suffering a broken bone in his left foot in late july he ended with 17 home runs and 48 rbi in a careerlow 84 games let s say i went out and hit 30 home runs , he said i do n't think that i 'd be in this situation but i did n't have a chance to do that if i'm here tomorrow , fine if i'm gone , fine i 've made it perfectly clear that i do n't want to go , but i'm not going to beg inside pitch pitcher pascual perez , a late arrival in camp , threw off a mound monday for the first time this spring and sounded encouraged it felt good , he said but i still need more time there s a long way to go perez threw 44 pitches in six minutes and said he felt no pain in his right shoulder , which has been surgically repaired manager buck showalter said that perez would continue his daily routine , although he was n't certain when the righthander would make his first appearance in an exhibition game we 're not putting limitations or expectations on him , showalter said the yanks play a seveninning intrasquad game wednesday scheduled to pitch scott sanderson , scott kamieniecki , allan anderson , jeff johnson , ed martel , mike draper , bobby munoz and mark hutton who wo n't pitch \? rookie phenom brien taylor i 'd love to see him pitch , showalter said believe me , it s quite a tease he s progressed well , and it s been a positive camp for him but the negatives outweigh the positives we do n't want to get too far ahead of ourselves , and we do n't want him to get too far ahead of himself daryl smith s dream of playing in the major leagues ended the former minor league pitcher told gene michael monday that he had decided to accept a lucrative offer to pitch in italy i ca n't blame him , michael said they offered him a lot of money he has a guaranteed deal over there smith , who won a tryout with the yankees after showing michael a newspaper clipping that detailed his season with class aaa omaha last year , wanted the yankees to give him a spot with their columbus affiliate at a guaranteed salary if he did n't win a major league job in camp when michael indicated he could offer no guarantee , smith chose italy photo each day yankees outfielder jesse barfield arrives at spring training , he works out , then waits to see if this is the day he gets traded \( ben van hook for the new york times \)
sometimes i infuriate myself just the other day , for instance on television selling a book i was , but too much the gentleman , too much the eleventhrate salesman , alas , to look the camera dead in the eye and say my book will not only make you smell better , relieve your headache , transform dingy yellow teeth to gleaming white and add five miles per gallon to your gas mileage , it will also make you live twice as long while enjoying twice as much happiness and getting twice as young every year instead , with mouth rattling along completely free of brain control television cameras always do this to me i started talking about america s anger why was the country so filled with anger \? what in the world did americans have to be furious about \? it had just prevailed in the 45year cold war the threat of nuclear holocaust was suspended stores were overflowing the choice of entertainments was infinite there were millions of cars to carry americans wherever whim or necessity dictated there was easy access to deadly weapons for every temperament , be it sporting , criminal , political , entrepreneurial , suicidal , selfpitying , paranoidal or just plain funloving moreover , americans could worship such gods as they chose , or none if they chose and what about other people from all over the world risking everything to get here \? if the place was really such a hatefilled sinkhole , why were foreigners dying to get here \? i hate to hear people talking like this , and afterward i hated myself for having done it it is unamerican misery is the new american condition , and making a loud noise about your misery is now the most american thing you can do , having replaced washing your car on saturday afternoon remember when you could sing that old spiritual , nobody knows the trouble i 've seen , and mean it \? not anymore nowadays everybody knows the trouble you 've seen that s because you 've told them you probably told them at the top of your lungs , too , maybe out in the streets screaming it to television cameras or even inside a tv studio shouting it on a misery panel to some competitive boaster who claims his troubles have been worse than yours there is so much competition for the misery championship these days that you have to scream to remain a contender thoreau wrote 150 years ago that most people lead lives of quiet desperation what an antique idea nowadays most people lead lives of noisy desperation , and if you 're not shrieking your laments you will be dismissed as a mere flyweight in the misery department what we 're seeing is a competition to be number one in pain and suffering , to win a statuette for most victimized , or most oppressed , or most forgotten , or most abused , or most unfairly treated , or most taxridden , or most bureaucracypersecuted , or most medically ill treated , or most telephonically violated , or most supremecourtdeprived the fact , of course , is that contrary to the whine that everything was better in the old days , almost everything was actually much worse in the old days true , the old days were n't afflicted with the telephone , much less the fax , but they did n't have airconditioning either , or the electric car crank , or television , or unemployment compensation , or social security , or overnight drycleaning , or movies right there in the parlor alongside the castiron woodstove with the isinglass windows easy now with those poisonous pens , ye angry millions i am not saying we ought to count our blessings instead of whining , moaning and wailing it up it s natural for each new generation of modern times to think it is born into the worst of times this may even promote happiness in a century that has lost its certainty about the purpose of life , it can be comforting to believe you are needed to do hero s work deprived so abruptly of the cold war s long twilight struggle between heroes and monsters , we have n't found much in the way of a new heroic task to pick us up perhaps this fascination with our own troubles is a healthy omen , portending a real effort to use this quiet time to neaten up the american act omen or not , it beats washing the car on saturday afternoon
goon there it was , that word coming from bob probert , of all people , wayward enforcer for the detroit red wings he s a goon , probert had said , after the big fight at madison square garden last month he s out there for one reason he s a dummy the words wounded tahir domi , son of an albanian restaurateur , proponent of the hardknuckles , softrules school of ice hockey the ranger forward , nicknamed tie long ago in elementary school , could not believe that probert , one of his heroes , a heavyweight much like himself , would say such a thing that bothered me , domi said he s been heavyweight champ for a long time i still respect him i 'd been wanting him for three years i just hope he remembered what got him where he is domi will never forget what got him from belle river , ontario , all the way to a ranger team that is ready labor relations and springtime hexes aside to challenge for the stanley cup domi s edge , the asset that transformed him from lightweight pug to national hockey league heavyweight , is his head not the inside , where domi s nimble brain works overtime figuring out which of his elaborate superstitions needs updating the outside the big skull shaved by his brother , dash , down to the wood adorned with as little hair as possible , to give domi what he calls kind of a unique look i'm fortunate my parents put me on this earth with a hard head , domi said i 've got short arms , so i 've got to take a lot of punches before i sort of work my way in there domi pokes this skull of his where it is not welcome he is in the face of probert , in the face and fists of mick vukota of the islanders he is jabbing and jabbering that is his job in itself , that would not offend those in the national hockey league who long ago accepted , even embraced , the morality of violent intimidation makes people squeamish what bothers probert , and the others , is something else entirely for domi , this rumbling is not only a way to eke out a living he has gone beyond that , beyond the 229 penalty minutes , beyond professionalism tie domi , uppercuts flying , helmet spinning , manic grin on his unshaven mug , revels in the warfare at times , he appears to be a madman in a mad sport , which makes a lot of people squeamish there is the way he goes hunting for trouble , even where there is none to be found domi chased after the united states olympic team during a gentlemanly exhibition match at the garden at one point , he challenged david quinn , who is a hemophiliac , to a fight with a slight smack to the cheek he could not stop treating this game , any game , as if it were the seventh game of the stanley cup final there is the way domi has celebrated after his fights and his two goals this season he has spun his fingers , like hulk hogan , toward one side of the rink and then toward another he has donned an imaginary heavyweight title belt he has banged away at a speedbag , suspended somewhere above center ice where only domi could see it and after his two goals this season , tie domi has ridden his stick over the ice like a witch on midnight prowl the stick shtick , he says , will go maybe nobody told me to stop , i just decided , i think , said domi , who borrowed that routine from his hero , the legendary bruiser tiger williams of toronto if it s a big goal in the playoffs , who knows \? the speedbag , that s my trademark that s got to stay people have stood up and noticed at the garden , fans groan audibly when domi is scratched from the lineup , which still happens about every other game when joe kocur is healthy domi , with his big black shoulder pads and cartoon mannerisms , is a folk hero in the blueturned teal seats part of the allure , no doubt , is his size at 5 feet 10 inches , tops , domi can never be typecast as a bully it s an advantage i have , domi said if i beat the other guy , he looks bad i'm expected to lose according to domi , he has not lost yet other judges have awarded probert and vukota their fights on points do not suggest this to domi i read where i was supposed to have lost to vukota , domi said he did n't hit me once my shirt went up i do n't even consider him a featherweight he s just a wrestler every team needs one probert \? domi said i'm not scared of anyone , no matter how big i ca n't be intimidated since every team in the nhl has an enforcer , every team needs one that is the logic of the league kocur and domi are the rangers' two runaway libidos they will continue to alternate for the rest of the season , unless the rangers are playing a team with two bad guys then , the rangers will need both their blue meanies kocur , a close friend of probert , is also an adviser to domi the two rangers often hold sparring sessions at the team s practices , but they are clearly at different stages of their careers domi is trying to gain respect , to promote dread in opponents who sneer at him kocur , still feared for his jawbreaking punch , would prefer to avoid confrontation these days his wounded right fist has smashed into too many helmets domi , the pit bull on ice , is a poodle mascot in the locker room he is everybody s little brother mark hardy , james patrick , mark messier take care of him thanks , big brother , domi will say , at the tiniest bit of advice if i'm his big brother , i did a great job , huh \? hardy will say
tony amonte was beginning to feel as if he would never finish a scoring opportunity mark messier had become frustrated and unhappy with his personal performance , though he kept it to himself ever cheerful , ever happy , adam graves was smiling less and less to gauge how low the rangers had fallen these past few weeks , one needed only to look at the top line a line loaded with talent messier , graves and amonte had a combined 235 points last season was not only not scoring , but was also frequently on the ice when goals were allowed heading into wednesday night s game at pittsburgh , messier had sunk to minus 11 on the season , ditto for amonte graves was a horrendous minus 14 top line in a breakthrough so it was no surprise that when the rangers made their big breakthrough in the game against the penguins and big hardly seems a strong enough word to describe the 113 trouncing new york inflicted on pittsburgh the strongest evidence of improvement could be seen on that top line amonte found his scoring touch messier played a game so spectacular that coach roger neilson considered it one of his captain s best performances since joining the rangers at the beginning of last season graves walked into what should have been a pressure cooker he is still much hated in pittsburgh for last year s slashing of mario lemieux during the playoffs and achieved his third career hat trick together , the threesome scored 6 of the rangers' 11 goals and had 14 points mark and tony really picked it up tonight , and it made a difference for us , graves said after the game we got some really big goals this one was good for the whole team chemistry made its first sign of a comeback on the rangers' first goal , when graves sent a perfect pass out of the corner to messier , who barely had to move his stick to beat the penguins' tom barasso that was the first of a string of impressive moves by messier , who had a breakaway goal early in the third period and provided a host of ranger scoring opportunities on both the power play and even strength it was a huge night for messier , who had 10 goals for the season heading into the game 'it s kind of a fine line' in 15 years i 've pretty much run the gauntlet of what can happen , messier said as the captain , it s important for me not to show i'm frustrated or concerned or down i take losing personally , but as the captain i feel like i 've got to show a positive attitude it s kind of a fine line messier may be adept at hiding his frustration when he wants to , but it was evident to his linemates that it was n't just the losses that were nagging at him of late it s tough for a goal scorer not to get points , goals , in any situation , amonte said people do get down , and mark s been in a tough situation he s been working so hard for two weeks now , but none of the breaks seemed to go his way this time , everything he touched was magic slap shots the last time the rangers scored 11 or more goals was oct 25 , 1984 , when they beat the devils , 112 no penguins' opponent had ever scored more than 10 goals at the civic center the last time the penguins had lost a regularseason game at home was on feb 27 , a span of 20 games the defeat also was the first in the patrick division this season for the twotime defending stanley cup champions brian leetch returned after missing monday night s game with an ankle injury and scored his sixth goal of the season leetch scored a shorthanded goal on a feed from mark messier
it is not quite as urgent as david o selznick s search for scarlett , or as spitefully competitive as teamcaptain selection in little league , but new york city s hunt for a new director of the mayor s office of film , theater and broadcasting has come to resemble a little of both it s a rat s nest , said alan s gordon , eastern executive secretary of the director s guild , and whose candidate for the job was not considered despite his strenuous lobbying effort it s pathetic , said one member of the nineperson search committee , who spoke on condition of anonymity , adding i question the quality of those who applied it s unbelievable , said jennifer kimball , a press secretary at city hall , who added that there had been more scrutiny and secondguessing over this relatively minor position than ever occurred during the sixmonth search last year for a health commissioner there is an old hollywood saying that seems just as apt in new york everyone has two kinds of business their own and show business and perhaps because the vacancy has occurred when new york city s film industry is in a slump , nobody seems pleased with anybody city officials estimate that film and television production is a 27billionayear industry in new york city after jaynne c keyes resigned to become an agent at the william morris agency last april , 50 people applied for her job of coaxing studio and advertising executives to approve location shots in new york which , over the last few years , has become a little like trying to rent out summer houses in a resort town after sharks have been spotted the city s entertainment industry has yet to rebound from the sevenmonth boycott led by hollywood studios last year to protest the city s high labor costs this month , the director sidney lumet threatened to personally boycott new york after a minor labor dispute erupted on his last day of shooting on his latest film he later issued a statement that said , rather peevishly , that he would consider shooting in new york , on a scripttoscript basis , but that i still resent the local crew s threat \( unrealized \) of a work stoppage because of its singular pool of actors , extras and technicians , as well as its vitality , the city has always attracted film makers but the high labor costs and logistical logjams just as characteristic of new york have driven studios and advertising firms to cities like los angeles , toronto and orlando even a longtime new york film maker like martin scorsese , who just completed several weeks of shooting in and around the city for his latest film , the age of innocence , said he was worried about the industry s future in new york these days , because of economic problems , he said , the first question from a studio is , 'can you do this picture somewhere else \? ' the filmoffice job , which pays 78 , 000 , is therefore not an easy one i ca n't lose , is how rafael piroman , put it mr piroman , the host of visiones , a spanishlanguage television show , is one of three finalists , searchcommittee members say if i get the job , i get prestige and responsibility , he said if i do n't , i avoid all those headaches 'a political thing' mr piroman , who was an official of a theatrical electrician s union , is favored by labor management seems unhappy with mr piroman and both of his rivals , lori rosenfield , a former development executive at fox television , and caitlan buchman , a film consultant and former agent the other two could not be reached for comment it s all a political thing , and it continues to be a political appointment , complained martin bregman , a producer they are destroying the film industry mr bregman , the producer of serpico , and sea of love , said he considered ms keyes inept , and said he was certain that none of the finalists would be any better he personally implored mayor david n dinkins to hire nancy littlefield , who had held the job during the koch administration ms littlefield , however , did not wish to be treated like an ordinary supplicant for the job now the executive director of queens public television , ms littlefield said she was willing to discuss the position with mr dinkins or mr sullivan directly , but added , i felt that to be called the night before to talk to that group was not appropriate , she said , referring to the search committee other candidates were less fastidious one candidate got big contributors to the mayor to lobby for them , said the search committee member who spoke anonymously yet for all the lobbying and jockeying , many within the industry complain about the caliber of the candidates the final cut ms littlefield said i agree that the people who are being considered are not heavyhitters they need someone who is not afraid to take the bull by the horns if that were the only criterion , then jeanne p nathan , director of public affairs for the city s housing authority , might be a shooin i am a pushy , hardworking person , she said i am not afraid to deal with people at any level i used to be a tv reporter we know how pushy and arrogant they are ms nathan , who solicited recommendations from her own boss , sally hernandezpinero , and several big names in the film industry \( taylor hackford , the director , was one \) , did not make the final cut undaunted , she said the mayor was not obliged to follow the search committee s recommendations i do n't think that s the end of the story , she said jane streich , who was ms keyes s deputy and is currently the acting director , was also a candidate who did not become a finalist she was less bold about her aspirations than ms nathan , but she too seemed to hold out some hope of dinkins ex machina i do n't know the mechanisms of the search committee , she said but hopefully , who knows \? a lot of the things people complain about in new york are mythical , said robert greenhut , a new yorkbased producer who has worked with two consummate new york city film makers , woody allen and mike nichols he allowed that production costs were still higher than elsewhere , but said union concessions that helped end the boycott had also helped level the field but he also said it would take someone really dynamic to alter hollywood s perceptions

white plains county executive andrew p o'rourke emerged victorious last week after a threemonth struggle with the board of legislators over control of the appointment and duties of the medical director , who heads the staff of doctors at the westchester county medical center in valhalla at issue was an attempt to prevent any future conflicts of interest after the recent resignation of the last medical director , who simultaneously had served as an administrator at the private , churchaffiliated new york medical college in valhalla , as well as being involved in a private business that provides billing services to doctors the legislators failed to override mr o'rourke s veto of a measure requiring the medical director to get legislative approval to work for a medical school or another hospital board members had approved the restrictive measure 17 to 0 in june , but they were deeply divided last monday , voting 10 to 6 for an override a twothirds majority , or 12 votes , is required to overturn mr o'rourke s veto mr o'rourke s office brought heavy pressure to bear on the legislators , causing some of them to reassess their position and to agree with the county executive that the rule would have interfered with his prerogatives others said they would have preferred a compromise the resolution of the issue , on which democrats and republicans were evenly divided on both sides , represented a reassertion of mr o'rourke s political strength against the background of the uncertain future of his pending nomination for a seat on the federal district court in manhattan politics and medicine it also represented support for the county s embattled commissioner of hospitals , mack l , carter jr , whose appointment by mr o'rourke a year ago was challenged by the board and staff of the county medical center and by the board of legislators the medical director reports to the commissioner , although the director s salary has been paid by the medical college one legislator , ernest d davis of mount vernon , a democrat , cited mr carter s problems as one of his reasons for voting with mr o'rourke i do n't have confidence that politicians are the best people to oversee the medical center , mr davis said i do n't want to politicize the hospital , and i do n't want to compromise the authority of the commissioner i still have a bad taste over his confirmation proceedings legislator martin l rogowsky of harrison , another democrat who voted with mr o'rourke , said , several issues were not on the table last june when we voted unanimously to approve this measure , and some aspects emerged since then first , the county executive did not participate in the creation of this legislation , choosing to wait until after the public hearing but we approved it immediately following the hearing , so he never had a chance to put his two cents in secondly , we do n't pay the medical director s salary , mr rogowsky said if we hire the medical director , we are going to pay at least 100 , 000 , if not more in vetoing the original bill , mr o'rourke said its language clearly implies that the intent of your board is to bar employment or appointment of the medical director with a medical facility or medical school but the basis of the success of our medical center as a tertiarycare facility has been the high level of care resulting from its role as a teaching hospital , he said whether the medical director should also be an employee of our medical school affiliate is a decision best left to the commissioner of hospitals , who is charged with running the medical center a natural link several legislators , especially those on the health and medical center committee , which sought to reach a compromise , raised the salary dilemma their position was that no firstclass medical administrator would be available for less than 150 , 000 , and with the county unlikely to pay more than 100 , 000 , acceptance of another job , like being a dean of the medical college , would probably be required health care experts said there was a natural link between the post of a medical director and the faculty of a medical school they cited four examples in new orleans the director of the medical center of louisiana is also an assistant dean at tulane medical school in dallas the director of parkland memorial hospital is also an associate dean of the university of texas southwestern medical school in kansas city , mo , the chief executive of truman medical center is also dean of the university of missouri medical school , and in syracuse , ny , the president of university hospitalhealth science center is also a faculty member of suny s medical school there the dispute over the medical director s role followed the resignation in april of dr richard levere , who held the post for one year until a report by a special county committee raised questions about possible conflicts of interest he was also vice dean of new york medical college , which has an affiliation agreement with the medical center he also headed medical business associates , a medical billing business , and medical research associates , a facultypractice plan in which the clinical faculty bills patients for services and funnels the proceeds back to the medical school to help support doctors' salaries and other institutional expenses
toronto , may 21 to placate its creditors , olympia york developments ltd said today that it would build financial walls around individual assets in canada to prevent any diversion of revenues to subsidiaries in the united states and britain that remain outside its bankruptcy protection the huge but now teetering commercial real estate concern made its surprise declaration at a hearing before justice robert blair of ontario general court exactly a week after he granted it five months of protection against asset seizure to work out a debt reorganization the hearing , the first in what is expected to be an extended process of litigation , was packed with blackrobed lawyers representing olympia york and some of the biggest banks in the world , as well as trust companies , bondholders and other lenders , who altogether are owed 149 billion \( canadian \) complaint of lenders the lenders , led by the bank of nova scotia , had been expected to ask justice blair to overturn last week s ruling on the ground that it unfairly kept them from pursuing their claims they asserted that under the judge s may 14 decree , there were no restrictions on olympia york s use of revenues generated by its farflung real estate holdings the lenders feared that the company could have taken rents from one building that were originally intended to back securities or loans on that structure and use the money elsewhere the creditors of individual buildings believed they alone were entitled to the rents from their buildings it has been widely reported in canada that olympia york has diverted revenues from at least one property a 53story office tower at 55 water street in new york to other parts of its empire one person at olympia york told the toronto star , canada s biggest newspaper , that the rents from that building were used for other purposes as a result of the liquidity crisis the company faced in february and march according to new york analysts , the manhattan tower has generated more than enough in rents in the last year to meet the 3588 million \( united states \) annual interest payment on its bonds , due june 30 but because of lease expirations , the building s operating cash next year is projected at only 25 million , they said statement of commitment it was against this background that david brown , an olympia york lawyer who is a partner in the toronto firm of davies ward beck , rose before justice blair today with a statement committing the company not to use the rents from one building to meet demands elsewhere he said the company would isolate the cash flow of each of its properties and put any surpluses in bank accounts he said there would have to be some pooling of funds to finance the debt restructuring and he asked the court s help to work out an equitable solution he promised to provide current cashflow information on the various properties the statement was intended to reassure creditors , and lawyers for the banks said they welcomed it they seem to be moving positively , said gordon marantz , a partner of osler hoskin harcourt , another toronto law firm representing a syndicate of banks led by credit lyonnais , which lent olympia 25 billion question of expenses there were some arguments about the amount of money the company would set aside during the restructuring for general administrative expenses at one point , an exasperated mr brown said the numbers were not large enough to justify the enormous efforts we are undertaking but after it was pointed out that olympia york , according to the papers filed last week , expects to spend 18 million on administrative expenses between may 14 and june 30 alone , justice blair intervened to note that such a sum was hardly negligible william g horton , a partner of mcmillan binch , a toronto law firm representing the royal bank of canada , which is owed an estimated 500 million to 700 million , said he was willing to see the company finance essential services but opposed its going back to business as usual while noting his agreement with an earlier statement by olympia york that debt restructuring would be a long journey , he added , none of us wants to be taken for a ride at the end of the hearing , which stretched into early evening , justice blair approved olympia york s plan for segregating assets and ordered the company to give notice of any pending asset sales he set another hearing for next thursday when details of the asset plan are to be hammered out

reflects the nation in nonpartisan ways that are likely to change congress as much as any partisan shifts at least 6 of the 11 representatives elected tuesday will be freshmen , joining as many as 125 others not since 1948 have there been so many new members and georgians will contribute to the striking increases in the number of women and blacks in the house great expectations nationally , it once seemed plausible that republicans , who now hold 166 house seats out of 435 , could gain 35 to 40 and assert ideological control over the house by allying themselves with with conservative democrats , much as they did in 1981 now gains of 15 to 20 seats seem more likely , with only trivial impact on the house similarly , georgia republicans hoped to go from 1 seat out of 10 in the 102d congress to 5 or 6 of the 11 in the 103d now it seems improbable they will have more than three , and none of their candidates are safe while national polling cannot measure individual house races , the latest new york times cbs news poll offers general encouragement to democrats fortyfive percent of the 1 , 912 registered voters polled by telephone from tuesday to friday said they would vote for a democrat for the house 35 percent preferred a republican but the rise in democratic hopes generally is far from reassuring to individual members from coast to coast , incumbents are attacked for voting themselves a pay raise , for overdrafts at the house bank and for travel abroad and if they have committed few or none of those particular sins , members like representative richard ray in westcentral georgia find themselves attacked for not preventing them many incumbents worry all over the country , house members are finding it hard to know if they have successfully countered attacks powerful incumbents of both parties are clearly at risk democrats like representatives les aspin of wisconsin , chairman of the armed services committee vic fazio of california , head of the party s campaign committee , and steny hoyer of maryland , chairman of the caucus , all have real reasons to worry so do republicans like representatives bill goodling of pennsylvania , the senior minority member of the education and labor committee don young of alaska , the top republican on the interior committee , and , right here , the no 2 republican in the house leadership , newt gingrich mr gingrich , attacked over checks and the car he gave up months ago , is taking more hits over incumbency than anyone else in the delegation lesserknown lawmakers are at least as vulnerable , and dozens feel threatened their fear has often led them to use the first negative advertisements , and , if they follow most consultants' advice , not to try to explain that the 1990 pay raise was justified or that no taxpayers' money was lost at the bank you respond by attacking your opponent on another issue , said neil newhouse , a republican consultant , who said the pay raise was deserved but politically indefensible party , not individuals , survived there are no political vaccines that guarantee an individual protection against antiincumbency but georgia offers a prime example of how a party can be protected two vulnerable democrats , representatives ben jones and charles hatcher were defeated in primaries sanford bishop , a black former state legislator in the americus area who defeated mr hatcher , a representative with 819 overdrafts , and don johnson , who defeated mr jones in athens and the augusta suburbs , are clear favorites on tuesday nationally , a postwar record of 19 incumbents were defeated in primaries at least nine democrats and two republicans in that group would have had a hard time winning the general election another 53 house members retired or sought other offices many of those who stayed on anyhow are in jeopardy , like two ohioans whose problems seemed over when they won their primaries , representatives bob mcewen , a republican , and mary rose oakar , a democrat reapportionment , the process of reallocating house seats because of population changes , and redistricting , the actual drawing of the new maps , both promised republican gains georgia went from 10 to 11 seats , and the justice department blocked two plans until the state created a second and third blackmajority district gop benefit foreseen

washington , may 26 reviving a strategy that helped catapult ronald reagan to reelection in 1984 , president bush s reelection campaign is handing control of its 40 millionplus advertising program to two madison avenue executives with scant political experience the bush organization has selected martin puris , president of ammirati puris inc , and clayton wilhite , president of d'arcy masius benton bowles north america , to head a private corporation that will hold an exclusive contract for all bush advertising in the general election taking another leaf from mr reagan s book , the bush organization has given the new entity a catchy political name the november company mr reagan s campaign formed a similar private concern , the tuesday team , which employed the techniques of consumer advertising to market a political candidate mr puris and mr wilhite have been working with the bushquayle organization for several weeks from offices on the avenue of the americas in manhattan , but their appointment was to be formally announced on wednesday the advertising group will remain at that location , with a fulltime staff of about 15 not meeting expectations although campaign officials do not say so outright , the selection of the two men is an admission that mr bush s previous media team , headed by three political advertising strategists , has not met expectations television commercials produced by the three for mr bush s primary races in new hampshire and georgia were criticized as dull , stylistically outdated and ineffective in conveying mr bush s reelection agenda the three michael murphy , alex castellanos and don sipple will join the november company as members of five or six creative teams under mr puris and mr wilhite that will devise new advertising and plot media strategy , mr puris said today they are the only political advertising experts in a corps of creative advisers that includes ron anderson , chief creative officer of bozell new york gordon bowen , chief creative officer of mccannerickson new york sean fitzpatrick , a detroit executive of mccannerickson who devised chevrolet s heartbeat of america slogan robert gardner , president of gardner communications in san francisco , and jim weller , of weller o sullivan advertising in los angeles the experts will work either full or part time assisting mr puris and mr wilhite mr puris and mr wilhite run agencies that represent some of the nation s bestknown brand names , including budweiser , pontiac , bmw , kraft , milk of magnesia and stanley in that , the bush campaign s advertising plans mirror those of mr reagan s 1984 race , in which the tuesday team recruited architects of some of the nation s most familiar television commercials that group shunned issuesoriented advertising for a theme , it s morning in america , that associated mr reagan with a swell of violins and a cloud of sentimental pictures previous informal role mr puris , who will be chairman and chief executive of the november company , served in mr bush s 1988 campaign as an informal adviser to roger ailes , the new york advertising executive who was the campaign s chief media strategist he has no other substantive political advertising experience mr wilhite said today that he was an adviser to president gerald r ford s 1976 primaryelection campaign frederic v malek , the bushquayle campaign manager , said in an interview today that previous political experience was n't a necessity for the president s advertising team because the campaign already had a wealth of political experts mr puris and mr wilhite said in an interview today that they would concentrate , at least initially , on exposing the electorate to more of what mr malek called the real george bush mr puris said my personal feeling , off or on the record , is that the more people see of him , the better they 're going to feel about him he s an outstanding man he has an outstanding record he s the epitome of integrity in the sorts of things that we like to have in a president that appeared to be an acknowledgement that the campaign has so far not succeeded in a principal mission to define mr bush in the sort of favorable terms that will persuade voters to support his reelection in this spring s primaries , political experts have frequently criticized mr bush for failing to give people any compelling reason to vote for him more recently , the president has responded with lists of goals and themes for his second term jobs , family and peace , the five pillars of reform in the government and society , or his sixpoint new america agenda for the inner cities but so far none has caught fire with the voters mr wilhite said today that the november company s advertising would seek to show mr bush talking personally about his goals this is of such import that i do n't want to be saying on nov 4 that i wish we 'd taken that one step , he said

daughter of lucille ball and desi arnaz , is currently creating the role on broadway of bella in neil simon s lost in yonkers \) he smiled , telling of the family s earthy country life , and offered the views of each child on presidential politics they have learned about the politics of theater and the theater of politics from their father , who is passionate about both subjects politics is the only fourletter word with eight letters , said mr luckinbill , who has been steeped enough in political affairs to know during the kennedy administration , he worked for the state department in italy and africa as a director , writer and lecturer on theater he also passed the foreign service examination and was offered a job with the united states information agency but ended his work in government service when president kennedy was assassinated i did n't want to be part of a johnson administration , mr luckinbill said years later , fate brought the actor and lyndon johnson together in spirit , when mr luckinbill played the title role in lyndon , a onecharacter play by james prideaux produced in 1987 as a pbs special the actor still tours with the play and notes the irony of portraying johnson his fate is in my hands , he said , amused by the idea , but johnson has earned his respect lyndon himself is a great intellectual on the model of sam adams or paul bunyan , mr luckinbill said he is a figure large on the landscape but he did n't read books , he read bills clarence darrow , best known for defending a tennessee high school science teacher , john t scopes , for teaching the theory of evolution , focuses the actor s attention on a different kind of brilliance he was a great man , with a passion for mercy , mr luckinbill said of darrow , who also defended the

working day , a decent standard of living , his interest in peaceful integration and the right of citizens to criticize their government humor studs both lyndon and clarence darrow , which is one reason mr luckinbill likes the plays so much everything i do has a lot of comedy involved , he said you do n't survive in life without laughing the arkansas native recounted how he decided to major in drama after seeing his hopes of becoming a doctor dashed he had finished three years as a premedical student at the university of arkansas when he got a dminus in organic chemistry for the young man , this was as good as failing the man who flunked me , a dr royce , was a chemist who had been on the nuremberg trials committee , mr luckinbill said i told him , 'you 're wrecking my life' i had been the class clown , the actor continued , and dr royce said , 'mr luckinbill , you have amused us all year and well you do n't belong in medicine you belong somewhere in the performing arts' a battery of aptitude tests confirmed the chemist s insight , and after graduating as a drama major , mr luckinbill went on to receive his master s degree in playwriting from the catholic university of america

yazoo city , miss long before the official presidential campaign began , before the first candidate kissed the first baby in new hampshire , an echo of elections past began to fill the air this sound , which gained strength and power over the months , was the sound of democrats crying foul ! while every recent democratic presidential hopeful has made liberal use of the charge that republicans rely on dirty tricks during campaigns , none mastered it as early or as well as bill clinton at the first whiff of criticism or even a recitation of facts from his record , the clinton camp immediately went on the attack , accusing the republicans of dirty tricks if unflattering stories cropped up in the press , the democrats decried the low road taken by bushquayle operatives day after day , they sounded the refrain the clinton people have crowed about the effectiveness of this strategy , and it has worked it has become virtually impossible for the president to discuss any issue from mr clinton s economic proposals to his draft record without being tarred as meanspirited or , in one account , accused of mccarthyism when a recent bush campaign ad estimated the costs of mr clinton s economic plan , the press complained that the numbers did n't come from the governor s camp that s because the clinton campaign never calculated the most important number of all what tax rate you must charge to generate 154 billion in revenue it s important to recall that the big early scandals involving mr clinton s character were not generated by republicans , but by the press and his democratic primary rivals but that did n't stop him from blaming these stories the gennifer flowers expose and his draft record on republican dirty tricks and when his 1969 letter about avoiding the draft was published , he lambasted a pattern by people desperate to stay in power and willing to impugn the motives , the patriotism and the lives of anyone who stands in their way after his claim that the pentagon had leaked the letter was proved wrong , mr clinton continued to blame the republican attack machine and search and destroy politics that have taken the heart out of the political system in this country for the most part , the press did not hold him accountable for such unsubstantiated or demonstrably false charges so he has stuck with his tactic never defend this attack campaign has two major goals to mask their own assaults on the president and to inoculate mr clinton from republican charges no campaign in recent history has been as aggressively personal as mr clinton s assault on george bush a national cochairman of the clinton campaign called the president a racist ron brown , the national democratic chairman , likened the president s racial policies to massive resistance to civil rights in the south in the 1960 s south al gore has insinuated that george bush lied about the powmia issue and called the president a hypocrite during the clintongore buscapade in july , albert gore and other speakers would rise to rip into george bush and dan quayle , then mr clinton would take the stage and sanctimoniously warn the crowd not to fall for the republicans' tactics he told one audience , everywhere i go , people say , 'are you ready for one more republican negative campaign \? ' this is character assassination , plain and simple , disguised as a plea for civility bill clinton knew that long after the public lost interest in the facts of any particular controversy , his insinuations about republicans would linger on and so they have this weird spectacle reminds me of the bad guy in the wrestling match who gouges eyes and pulls hair while whining to the referee about his opponent s cheating it succeeds because no referee intervenes despite the polls , i do n't think the clinton scheme cynical , clever , wellorchestrated will succeed through nov 3 as in the wrestling match , i believe people will cheer as the guy on the mat rises and flattens the bad guy americans just do n't like unfair tactics especially unfair tactics masquerading as fair play
new orleans , june 19 butch reynolds s long and arduous campaign to run in the barcelona olympics ended tonight when a federal appeals court in cincinnati overturned a lower court decision that would have allowed him to compete in the united states olympics track and field trials , which opened today judge eugene e siler jr dissolved a preliminary injunction issued this morning in a columbus , ohio , district court that would have cleared the way for reynolds to compete in the 400 meters despite his twoyear suspension for drug use that expires on aug 11 the ruling effectively eliminated any chance reynolds could return to international competition before his suspension ends with the men s 400meter competition scheduled to begin at 2 45 pm on saturday , he had the option of asking the united states supreme court to consider the case on an emergency basis but his attorneys said they would not they said reynolds would pursue the case through a civil lawsuit filed earlier this month , in which he is seeking 125 million in damages from the international amateur athletic federation , the world governing body for track and field , which suspended him in a fourpage explanation of his order , siler acknowledged that reynolds could appeal the case on its merits , namely , his contention that the drug test that caused the suspension was so fraught with administrative errors it could not be proved to be his but the judge was persuaded that other 400meter runners could suffer greater harm if reynolds were allowed to compete against them throughout reynolds' attempt to gain reinstatement , the iaaf threatened to suspend any athlete who competed against him , as its rules allow in recent months , the iaaf has told reynolds that no matter what redress he gained from an american court , he would remain ineligible for the barcelona olympics this summer by virtue of the suspension siler specifically mentioned steve lewis , the 1988 olympic champion danny everett , the olympic bronze medalist and antonio pettigrew , the 1991 world champion , who joined tac in the suit to argue that reynolds s inclusion in the trials might eliminate one or more others who compete siler , a 56yearold jurist who coincidentally is a member of tac , said he interpreted that to be a possible adverse effect of reynolds s participation this certainly is n't a victory for tac , said its president , frank greenberg there are a lot of things in our system that we have to make sure never happen again , that athletes have to be more concerned about a judicial system than running in their events neither reynolds nor his agent , brad hunt , was available for comment after siler s order was issued earlier in the day , after judge joseph kinneary of the district court in columbus had granted his third order in several weeks that allowed reynolds to run for specified periods of time , reynolds answered questions for 30 minutes he vowed to fight on , no matter what happened in the appeal huge legal expenses yet after spending vast sums to undo the damage of a drug test he underwent on aug 12 , 1990 after a race in monte carlo , he finally gave in to the weight of opposition and it was considerable the test indicated that he had used the performanceenhancing anabolic steroid , nandralone but he argued steadfastly that he had never used such drugs and , with documents to bolster his case , he tried to show that errors in paperwork at the testing laboratory in paris make it impossible to make certain the test in question was his over the months , he convinced an independent arbitrator through the united states olympic committee that his case was sound he then argued successfully before a tac appeals panel , and that led to the usoc and tac joining him in an appeal for reinstatement before an iaaf arbitration panel but , there , his momentum stalled no , in no uncertain terms the panel denied his arguments , heralding the veracity of the test and the sanctity of the testing program at the same time , the iaaf made it clear that no matter how successful he was in court , he would remain ineligible for barcelona the federation also made it clear the rules of contamination would be used that any athlete who ran against reynolds would risk suspension in fact , enrico jacomini , the assistant to primo nebiolo , the iaaf president , said today from rome that the 10 athletes who competed against reynolds in san francisco and holmdel , nj , earlier this month opportunities created by kinneary s earlier restraining orders would be suspended none of those athletes , however , is of olympic caliber if the athlete , butch reynolds , competes in the united states olympic trials , jacomini said , the iaaf will continue to enforce its rules , as it has done in the past following the leader as time went on , it became clear that the iaaf was the driving force behind tac s legal position once the iaaf arbitration panel denied his appeal , tac moved across the aisle to become an adversary the overriding issue had become the greater goodjust this afternoon , the usoc joined tac in providing the appeals court a letter of support it pointed out that even if reynolds were to qualify at the trials , the international federation would not allow him into the olympics therefore , the usoc said , it could not make him eligible to be a member of the olympics team in addition , the iaaf sent ambiguous signals about the severity of potential consequences its rules stipulate that in matters of contamination the federation can suspend all athletes in the event or in the meet we were concerned in those early releases that the entire us team could be in jeopardy , said greenberg more recently , the focus was on those in the 400 but we were troubled by the fact that the iaaf could do either
baltimore , april 3 the mets players , showing little remorse and lots of solidarity , declared today that their weeklong blackout on interviews with the media would officially end saturday they did so after the unofficial opening of the baltimore orioles' baseball stadium we realized from the outset this recourse would have repercussions , said pitcher david cone , the mets' representative to the players' union but the benefits to the preparation of the 1992 season far outweigh the ramifications our initiative was designed to strengthen internally and fight back externally the players' wish to fight back with silence stemmed from a noisy and unsettling spring in florida , where they got fed up with unsettling headlines and stories on rape accusations against three teammates and a civil suit filed against cone last friday , 31 players signed a petition vowing not to speak to any members of the media a statement , then silence the mets' decision today came after they lost to baltimore , 53 , in exhibition play , completing the first game played in the quaint new oriole park at camden yards , the 1065 million stadium , where 31 , 286 fans were on hand for the dress rehearsal for monday s official opening cone relayed the team s sentiments as he read from a prepared statement while he and his teammates stood in a semicircle facing about 20 reporters in an odd and awkward scene in the middle of the spacious visitor s clubhouse once cone finished his statement , the players dispersed , the stoney silence in place for at least the rest of this day by way of explaining the initial stance taken a week ago , cone stated because of what we perceived as slanderous and stereotypical attacks on our team as a whole , it became apparent that our clubhouse needed an internal regrouping secondarily , we wanted to address the issue of the right to privacy we realize we are public figures and understand that responsibility but we felt that things had gone too far some of our teammates had been shadowed in public places , at their private residences , have had phones monitored and cameras placed within their homes hope for fan support for those reasons , cone said the players went quiet we hope that all loyal new york mets fans will understand and support our sentiments , he said hours earlier , the players and baseball officials had given indications that there was a shift in policy afoot when the team arrived at camden yard , many members took a quick look at the field in the brick ball park , then retired to the clubhouse to cloister first with a union official and then club executives after an hour of closeddoor sessions , the mets emerged , still silent but there was noticeable activity elsewhere as a series of huddles involving baseball and mets officials took place on the field first , commissioner fay vincent , who had met with fred wilpon , the coowner of the mets , while the players were huddled inside , joined in conversation with mark belanger , special assistant to the major league baseball players association , as soon as belanger ended his session with the team vincent then consulted with al harazin , the mets general manager , and frank cashen , the mets' senior vice president and chief operating officer signs of thaw none of the officials would speak on the contents of the players' meeting , but the signs of the thaw were there , especially when vincent said that he would not meet with the players on the issue , something he had held out as an alternative as recently as thursday i hope that the players understand their obligation to the fans , was all vincent would say 'clear and thoughtful decision' the overall progress of events does n't surprise me very much , fehr said by telephone from his home in westchester county they have a complete right to demonstrate how they react to what they perceive to be unfair publicity and i think it s fair to say that they got a lot of people s attention and that was their object manager jeff torborg , for one , was happy that , whatever the messages , the team considered them delivered i think they thought about it for a long time and it was a clear and thoughtful decision , said torborg who , along with harazin and cashen , also addressed the team before the game i'm glad that they 've done this i think they were sincere in their beliefs and what they did the afternoon s other activities focused on baseball , the oldfashioned nostalgic sort , as camden yards was unveiled in the only dress rehearsal to be held before the orioles' season opener against cleveland on monday built with bricks , filled with wroughtiron work and quaint touches seemingly out of the 1940 s , the park caused fans , players and executives to gush warmly on an otherwise frigid day said wilpon what does this ball park mean to me \?

boston president bush is under such attack these days for lacking principle for wavering on issues that he is entitled to credit for one area in which he has made a principled commitment and stuck to it that is his policy for peace between israel and the arabs no one can doubt that mr bush cares about the issue , deeply and personally he has worked at it from the beginning of his presidency he seized the moment after the persian gulf war to press a new proposal that actually got the parties to the negotiating table and in all this he has taken considerable political risk now his policy is up against an especially prickly question whether to insist that israel , in order to get american loan guarantees , stop building settlements in the occupied territories in this time of political difficulty for him , will the president stay the course \? i believe he will one reason for thinking so is that continuation of the peace talks hangs on the settlement question , as mr bush is well aware any formula that provides billions of dollars in guarantees to israel without effectively stopping its creeping annexation of the west bank and gaza would make it impossible for the palestinians to stay at the table the key word , for american policy makers , is effective for more than 20 years us administrations have opposed the seizing of land and building of settlements in the occupied territories , but the opposition has been pathetically ineffective the president and secretary of state baker know about that firsthand in 1990 they arranged 400 million in loan guarantees to israel for housing new immigrants mr baker arduously negotiated conditions that none of the money go to the occupied territories and israel provide full information on what it spends in the territories but the conditions have had no effect a report issued by the general accounting office last week found that the us guarantees simply freed up other money that israel spent in the west bank and gaza and the israeli government did not provide the promised information once burned , mr bush and mr baker will no doubt be twice shy they are likely to require firm and enforceable rules that any us loan guarantees will not allow israel to spend other funds on housing and infrastructure in the occupied territories , and that there will be no new settlement construction the president is also likely to stick to his guns because his policy is good for israel it encourages israel to make a choice that its political system has been avoiding but that world trends demand the choice is between peace and annexation israelis have long wanted peace but their governments have pursued expansionist policies incompatible with peace it was possible to fudge the choice so long as there was no one to negotiate with anyway so long as the arabs refused to make peace but now arab delegations are actually negotiating an israeli policy of refusing to make the territorial compromise necessary for peace has also required enormous american subvention the billions in annual military and economic aid could be counted on while the cold war was on and israel helped to block soviet ambitions in the middle east but the cold war is over now , there is no soviet threat and it is not so clear that american support at such levels can continue indefinitely israelis themselves are increasingly restive at their dependence on the united states moreover , the end of the cold war presents israel with a great challenge and opportunity to build a hightech civilian economy that would employ immigrants but that can happen only if there is peace secretary of state baker , in talking with israel s ambassador about the request for 10 billion in loan guarantees , has made it clear that the choice is israel s the united states wants to provide the guarantees , but only on terms that do not destroy the chance for peace if the president holds to that position , he will be doing both israel and the united states a service he will put their crucial relationship on a more realistic basis for the postcoldwar era , to their mutual benefit
after a promising start , the stanley cup playoffs have been losing momentum but they may enjoy a strong finish when two powerful , streaking teams the defending champion pittsburgh penguins and the chicago blackhawks meet in the final round , which begins tomorrow night in pittsburgh the blackhawks have won 11 consecutive playoff games , a national hockey league record for a single playoff season , and the penguins have won seven in a row the blackhawks' best player is a rising star , jeremy roenick , while pittsburgh s biggest gun is mario lemieux , the best player in the game , who has dazzled recently with a series of spectacular goals he s the best hockey player in the world right now , said dave poulin of the bruins , who were eliminated by the penguins on saturday night it s almost scary to think that he can look like he s toying with you and that he can turn it on at any moment one to remember lemieux , who missed six playoff games with a broken bone in his left hand , nevertheless leads all playoff scorers with 27 points on 11 goals and 16 assists in 11 games his best moment saturday , perhaps one of the best goals of his eightyear career , came while killing a penalty in what eventually became a 51 pittsburgh victory to wrap up the fourgame sweep of the wales conference finals it was the first of his two goals in the game and it demoralized the bruins and their fans while amazing everyone lemieux stole the puck in his own end , raced up the center of the ice , maneuvered past adam oates and around ray bourque and then beat goalie andy moog with a rising wrist shot just under the crossbar oates , bourque and moog are boston s best three players lemieux , with a stillsore hand , beat them singlehandedly when i got the puck , i did n't know what to do , lemieux said ray was right in front of me , and i just put the puck in his feet to get his attention a little bit bourque , like lemieux a team captain , paid attention to the penguins while sitting on the bench you find yourself sitting on the bench and watching , he said then , you shake your head and say , 'wow ! ' the bruins were badly overmatched at times , the penguins made extra passes on rushes to try to slam dunk the puck from close range few of their goals in the series were on rebounds or scrambles or tipins they probably will have a more difficult time against chicago , which tries to hem an opponent in with forechecking in their attack zone they are a physical team , they are playing smart and they are a dangerous club , said pittsburgh s rick tocchet , who used to play for chicago coach mike keenan when both were employed by the philadelphia flyers they are going to have brent sutter against mario they are n't going to turn away from him when he makes a pass they are going to hit mario but mario is a pretty shifty guy and it will be tough to hit him it s loud in chicago after the first two games , on tomorrow and thursday in pittsburgh s civic arena , the series moves to chicago stadium for games 3 and 4 on saturday and monday there , the penguins will find a small ice surface and acoustics that often intimidate visitors i think everybody likes playing there , tocchet said , because , even if you are n't ready to play , that building gets you ready to play obviously , you hate playing there because it is a tough building , but guys enjoy it on a competitive level both teams had their toughest tests in the first round pittsburgh came from deficits of two games to none and three games to one to oust washington in seven games the blackhawks needed six games to eliminate st louis of the eight firstround series , six went seven games after a 10day players' strike in early april , the playoffs seemed to get off to a good start but , in the second round , the drama faded chicago swept detroit in four games while pittsburgh needed six to eliminate the rangers boston also swept montreal in that round while the edmonton oilers were swept by chicago
baltimore , sept 22 baltimore manager johnny oates did n't need a degree in algebra or calculus to figure out the orioles' chances of catching the toronto blue jays the math , he surmised , is simple unless the orioles were able to win the first of a threegame series against the blue jays tonight and just about every game after that , their chances of winning the american league east stood somewhere between slim and none mathematically , it s not a must realistically , it is , as is tomorrow night and the next night , oates said before the game i was never a math major , but i do know that we have to win right here to have a shot baltimore did not win , falling 43 as toronto survived a rain delay of almost three hours and a late orioles' rally baltimore flirted with a comeback by scoring a run in the eighth inning on mike devereaux s second run batted in of the night and his 102d of the season unhapppy in the stands neither devereaux s rbi grounder nor his 23d home run in the third was enough to keep the cajoling resilient crowd of 45 , 104 happy the blue jays now lead the thirdplace orioles by six games with 10 remaining on their schedule baltimore has a dozen games left in which to make the allbutimpossible turnaround that it would be all too improbable oates also acknowledged before his team even took the field even winning two is not good enough , he said , contemplating the threegame series we win two , they still leave town three games up in the loss column , and all they have left are eight games , five of them at home , against sub500 ball clubs it does n't paint a very good picture from where toronto sits , the picture looks perfect the blue jays' victory tonight was the team s 16th in 22 games with it , they were able to maintain their fourandonehalfgame lead over secondplace milwaukee , which defeated the california angels , 32 , tonight after this series , all that will stand in the way of the blue jays winning their third division title in four years are the alsoran yankees , red sox and tigers by winning the first game here , the blue jays accomplished a major objective they avoided a sweep , something toronto has managed to do in every series they 've played this season and by doing so they granted the only wish their manager , cito gaston , said before the game we need to win a ball game here dire picture the scenario is growing increasingly dire for the orioles , who not only they have to battle the calendar , but also must find a solution to their offensive slump due primarily to its lack of hitting , baltimore has lost 10 of 15 games since sept 5 and has fallen from second place to third place , a halfdozen games back the orioles had scored just 33 runs in their previous 14 games , their worst scoring famine since the team pushed across just 33 runs in their first 17 games of their now infamous 021 tumble into the 1988 season toronto starter todd stottlemyre was instrumental in keeping baltimore mired in its slump the righthander allowed only two hits through the first six innings a harmless double to cal ripken in the first inning and a basesempty home run to devereaux in the third starting to click conversely , toronto s offense clicked early devon white , the leadoff hitter , drilled rick sutcliffe s fourth pitch of the game off the top of the rightfield scoreboard , the sixth time this season white has opened a game with a home run the blue jays flexed more muscle in the fourth , using a towering tworun home run by john olerud to snap a 11 tie the fourth would not only mark the undoing of the orioles , but also sutcliffe moments after olerud s blast , the righthander left the game because of back spasms but in the seventh , a glenn davis double and a runscoring single by joe orsulak made the score 32 and drove stottlemyre from the mound

nobody can go wrong by running against lawyers and bureaucrats so i was n't surprised thursday when president bush lashed these wretched devils with the limp noodle of his campaign oratory the luncheon audience of high capitalists at the detroit economic club hooted with delight when the president suggested that lawyers will get a nasty comeuppance in a second bush administration the audience applause suggested most would gladly give up dessert if the sacrifice could persuade the president to have a halfdozen lawyers hauled to the podium , stripped of their briefcases and birched with wet writs this being a political campaign , it is unsporting to call attention to presidential nonsense on the other hand , what s wrong with being unsporting when both candidates hold to the proposition that anyone who does n't want the presidency desperately enough to kill for it is unworthy to lead us toward fulfillment of the american dream \? the president said lawyers cost the nation billions in wealth he mentioned a specific number of billions , which i instantly forgot after checking the amount of brain space still available for storing fraudulent statistics and finding none left surely seven maids with seven computers computing for seven years could n't make a sensible estimate of how much money lawyers are costing the country such statistics are cooked up by political researchers to fit the transient needs of candidates the fact , of course , is that the most formidable and most expensive lawyers are almost invariably employed by corporations their duties include lobbying to shape the law to their employers' advantage , adjusting corporate policy to the everchanging whims of the tax laws , and glowering at the occasional impertinent citizen trying to make trouble for the corporation the typical upstart who takes his grievance to a lawyer tends to settle cheap when confronted by the mountainous array of corporate legal power so obviously capable of bankrupting him with the astronomical costs of american justice in short , the prime function of the infamously overpaid lawyer in the united states is to help the rich get richer it is not just comically ironic to see a gathering of capitalists cheering a presidential assault on their loyal , if extravagantly paid , flunkeys it also smacks of corporate ingratitude for people who devote their lives to the corporation well , of course it s not the corporation lawyer whom good capitalists want undone it is the socalled trial lawyer , who rejects the corporate offer and insists on a trial , which sometimes ends with a huge jury award depleting the corporate till such juries are usually said by corporate types to be sentimental and foolish such lawyers , usually working only for a very large percentage of the award , are denigrated as ambulance chasers it was n't clear from the president s speech whether the billions lawyers cost the country are composed of jury awards against corporations or the amount corporations pay their own lawyers , or the sum of the two in his ceremonial bashing of the bureaucrats , the president promised a 5 percent cut in the salaries of government workers who earn more than 75 , 000 this may or may not be a good idea , economically speaking , but the politics of it is weird even by the standards to which the bush campaign has accustomed us why \? well , because what is the president proposing here but an income tax on a clearly defined population group \? and who is the fellow who says he once made a terrible mistake by raising taxes but will never , ever raise taxes again \? that s right it is mr president , the same fellow who is simultaneously promising to put an income tax on upperincome bureaucrats is it not captious to dwell on these presidential absurdities \? yes , if we agree that what is said and done in pursuit of office is merely circus , just ritual gameplaying that is not meant to deal with the world as it really is nor tell us anything at all about what will be done once the game is lost and won being serious about serious business is bad taste in america
valley stream , li , june 23 the employees of alexander s department store gathered for their farewell supper around the long narrow tables at tony roma s , a mile down the road from the discount store where many of them had worked since it opened in 1967 over spareribs and potatoes , they exchanged hugs and phone numbers , and a certain grim view of the future there was maureen murphy , 41 years old and single , who had started working in the store before christmas 25 years ago and never left now , she feared more than anything losing her home in rosedale , queens , just seven years shy of paying off the mortgage there was ronald alexander , 29 , who laughed with the longhaired beauty from the camera department and wondered whether they would still be together in six months he 'd worked in alexander s during high school , traveled to germany with the army , and came back to a job in the stockroom alexander s has not announced when its 11 stores will close , but the death of the 65yearold departmentstore chain is hurling 5 , 600 employees into an unwelcome job market in a field hit hard by an unforgiving recession impact on the retail industry while talk of unemployment often focuses on the loss of factory jobs , the recession has had an even greater impact on the wholesale and retail industry since 1988 , according to the state labor department , new york city and the surrounding counties have lost more than 171 , 000 jobs in the wholesale and retail industry , falling to 890 , 000 from 1 , 061 , 600 it s the no 1 source of decline during the past several years , said samuel m ehrenhalt , new york regional commissioner at the federal bureau of labor statistics we 've never seen a recession take this kind of a toll in the service industry retailing tends to employ a large number of workers at either end of the age spectrum the older workers at alexander s , many of them part timers , are too young to retire but fear no one will hire them they are terrified of losing severance pay , pensions and other benefits they had counted on to ease them into retirement the young , for whom unemployment is now at its highest level in 25 years , also wonder if they will be able to find jobs , even if they try new fields , though some are excited about the challenge the employees of alexander s are going to be competing in a labor market that is very difficult for new entries , said mitchell moss , director of new york university s urban research center statewide , unemployment last month was 79 percent there could be no worse time to add to the labor supply than right now , mr moss said if they are entering a job market that is all but lifeless , the employees at valley stream are leaving a store that each day descends further from the tidy divisions they once tended into retail hell scrawled signs announce that the third and fourth floors are closed to customers the second floor is a grab bag of appliances scattered around the escalator the first floor is mayhem women s skirts and artificial flowers in the men s department , patio umbrellas in lingerie , boxes torn open and the parts of lamps and fans strewn about , stuffed animals with the eyes pulled out i still ca n't believe that it s gone , ms murphy said i walk through the store devastated customers just come in to say goodbye , not even to buy things when ms murphy began at alexander s , she was a high school student of 16 picking up extra cash around christmas her supervisor , pleased with her work , recommended that she stay on she never left she progressed swiftly at alexander s to become manager of the women s dress department before she was 20 it s like a familyoriented type of store , she said , and glanced at her coworkers , laughing and putting their arms around one another s shoulders at the dinner tables you see how it is a trim woman in a buttondown shirt and pants , short hair brushed back in a nononsense cut , ms murphy has so far gone on two job interviews tense encounters relieved only by the sympathy of the recruiters they know the situation with alexander s , that it was n't your fault , she said ms murphy and other employees began to suspect the store would go bankrupt after christmas , when the receiving department screeched to a standstill but they thought bankruptcy would be a gentler matter , involving the closing of a few stores or a reorganization of the company s debt none expected the entire chain to fall in a sense , mr moss of nyu said , alexander s was the retail equivalent of the post office , offering flexibility , opportunities to advance within the company and above all , job security ms murphy now worries about paying her bills and making her mortgage , but she hopes to avoid taking a job in desperation for her , strength came in what she remembers as , simply , the call , from her older brother in pennsylvania he said everything right 'i'm here whatever you need , do n't worry , ' ms murphy remembered sometimes things work out for the best' she is thinking of leaving the retail trade , which no longer offers the security it once did , and considers retraining for a career in medicine , an avocation until now at the rosedale volunteer ambulance corps , she is known as lieutenant murphy
walnut , iowa for three generations , the lessons of farming have been passed down in the fields here on rural route 1 , where the rogers family has planted corn every spring for nearly 100 years i remember when horses plowed the fields , orris rogers said and my father and i would pick corn by hand but as mr rogers , now 67 years old , prepares to retire , the family tradition is ending his children , like a growing number of other young people from the farms , have followed careers far from the cornfields ominous shadow unlike the forced sales of the 1980 s , which led to benefit concerts and movies about the farmer s plight , the situation of the rogers family is evidence of a quieter exodus from the land the farmers who are selling land today are often making a handsome profit but all the same , the movement is hastening the decline in the number of family farms and casting an ominous shadow on the little towns built around them since 1980 the number of farmers under the age of 25 has dropped by half , while the number of those over 65 has held steady , a circumstance that could leave tens of thousands of farms in the next decade without anyone in the family to tend the fields when a small farm comes to the end of the family line , the land almost always goes to a bigger farmer with deep pockets and a powerful line of machinery who can work an extra few hundred acres with efficiency even the future farmers of america has fewer future farmers the organization for high school and college students has seen its membership shrink more than 20 percent since 1980 , and just 25 percent of its members say they plan to go into farming , as against 41 percent a decade ago about half plan to work in jobs that relate to farming , but 27 percent say they will leave agriculture altogether , up from 5 percent in 1980 transformation in farming in most cases , the link between generations is being broken by an economic transformation in american agriculture that makes it impossible for the average grain farm of 400 acres or so to support more than one family or generation at a time so with parents still working the fields , the heirs must leave the farm after high school or college years later , when the time comes for the parents to retire , their children have settled lives elsewhere even for those who want to return to the fields , the move toward bigger and bigger farms often poses another insurmountable hurdle a beginning farmer can have startup costs of as much as 200 , 000 and even on farms with room for one more generation , the experience of the calamitous 1980 s , when foreclosures hit farm country like hailstones , has soured many young people on a way of life that offers so little security in return for so much hard work some of them do n't want to experience what they grew up with , said eddie smith , the director of agriculture education in oklahoma in other cases , the parents are telling the kids not to come back to the farm now , a big business mr rogers and his wife , patricia , own 350 acres of corn and soybean fields along nameless gravel roads at the edge of pottawattamie county here in southwestern iowa hogs were a mainstay of the family operation for many years , but they were sold when mr rogers turned 65 their son , scott , 39 , and daughter , connie schaberg , 44 , left iowa long ago their grandsons , who are in their early 20 s , have lived in many places , but never on a farm so the tending of these fields will pass from the family farming is n't a way of life anymore , but a big business , mr rogers said recently as he pulled on his boots , overalls and cap adorned with a seed company logo before firing up the corn planting machine you 're kidding yourself if you try to think otherwise and you 're probably going to go down the tube the family riding tractors , gazing at airplanes as a boy , scott rogers reveled in the world of mischievous freedom on the family s farm , where the yearnings of a larcenous young heart could be satisfied by snatching a few watermelons from a neighbor s patch or turning on somebody s lawn sprinkler , ringing the door bell and then running like heck , mr rogers said , recalling youthful days of daring his older sister , connie , who could drive a pickup before she was 9 , was a natural in the fields as a teenager , she was often hired for chores by neighboring farmers in a later generation , she might have become a farmer herself but in the 1960 s , girls were not allowed to join future farmers of america or raise livestock with the boys in 4h connie thought these rules were worse than silly i did n't think it was fair , said connie , a saleswoman in tulsa , okla but , she added , she accepted the rules and never thought of becoming a farmer cultivating other dreams scott , a star athlete who was offered a college scholarship to play football , also kept busy with chores on the farm but as he neared graduation from high school , he knew the farm was n't big enough to support another farmer he cultivated other dreams
saying that he wanted to send a strong signal to those who carry out wolfpack attacks in new york city , a state judge yesterday sentenced each of the four defendants convicted in the murder of brian watkins to the maximum of 25 years to life in prison make no mistake , we must come to grips with these marauding gangs , the judge , justice edwin torres of state supreme court in manhattan , said ask any new yorker , from mayor dinkins on down we all grieved a river of tears for brian , for his family , and for our city and it came at a bitter time , clutched as the city is in the vise of a fiscal crisis convicted last month under the sentence imposed yesterday , the four defendants will not be eligble for parole for at least 25 years last month , the four defendants were each convicted in the murder of mr watkins , a utah tourist who was fatally stabbed on a subway platform in front of his family in 1990 in sentencing the four yesterday , justice torres said that although none were accused of stabbing the 22yearold victim to death at a subway station in manhattan , they were just as guilty as the person who did under state law , when a victim is killed during a felony all participants are as guilty as the killer another defendant , yul gary morales , who is accused of stabbing mr watkins , will be tried with three others next month jabbing his finger at the defendants in a crowded but hushed courtroom , justice torres described the defendants as unremorseful predatory beasts who attacked as a wolfpack and who killed to go dancing the stunning heartlessness of this motivation propels us almost into the realm of the bizarre , the stupefying , again reminiscent of anthony burgess s 'clockwork orange' world the blood was up , it was killing time , he said , repeating a remark attributed to the defendants moments before attacking the watkins family during a trip from provo , utah , to new york city for the united states open tennis tournament by refusing to sentence the defendants to anything approaching the minimum of 15 years to life , as urged by the defendants' lawyers , justice torres lived up to his reputation as one of manhattan s toughest judges they were cold , these guys , just as cold as the corpse they left behind , he said sherwin and karen watkins , the parents of the victim , showed no emotion when the judge handed down the toughest sentence possible before they were sentenced , each defendant stood and said he was sorry for what had happened and asked for mercy but the prosecutor , thomas schiels , said they deserved none and urged the judge to impose the maximum the subdued appearance of mr watkins s parents yesterday was in sharp contrast to their testimony in october when they repeatedly broke down while describing how they and their family were attacked on sept 2 , 1990 , on the subway platform of the seventh avenue station of the ind line in newspaper interviews , they said they decided to attend the sentencing to honor the memory of their 22yearold son , who justice torres said was cut down in a valiant effort to save his mother who had been been kicked in the face the defendants , ricardo nova , johnny hincapie , eliliano ferndandez and pascal carpenter , all 19 years old , all sat with their heads bowed as the judge then proceeded to castigate them and express alarm for a society in which a band of marauders can surround , pounce upon and kill a boy in front of his parents and family , not to flee the winds , but stride up the block to roseland and dance until 4 am , as if they had stepped on an insect as if not sufficiently beset , he said , our beleaguered citizenry must now contend with this new terror , and if not new , newly labeled , the wolfpack but he said that the jury s verdict and his tough sentence might serve as a harbinger , with the message being that marauders can no longer anticipate that they can take protective cover by attacking in groups 'ran with the pack' pausing for a moment and staring hard at the defendants , he said you will have stepped as far as he who steps the furthest hammer or anvil , it is of no consequence the law does not distinguish you will not be heard to say , i ran with the pack , but i only veered the calf from the herd , or only snapped at its heels i did not rip out his throat , i only partook of the meal when you run with a pack as lethal as this , it matters not whether you were in the vanguard or in the rearguard you are in then turning to the watkins parents , justice torres said their pain and their courage in testifying and being present for the sentencing yesterday only heightens the unbearableness of the atrocity for a mother to hold a dying child in her arms , murdered before her very eyes , is a visitation that the devil himself would hesitate to conjure up , he said that can not go unpunished
santa clara , calif for almost four years , mark h johnson was a chemical technician for a microfilm company , doing skilled work that paid him a good salary of 30 , 000 a year but the company s three shifts were cut to two , and he was on the third soon he landed another skilled job paying 27 , 000 , as a highspeed packaging mechanic but a year and a half later production was cut , and with it mr johnson so about five years ago , mr johnson joined the ranks of the underemployed , settling for a series of lowwage jobs because his talents were no longer valued enough to assure him a secure and wellpaid position but now , at 37 years of age , mr johnson has found the right job machining , a vital craft for manufacturing industries what rescued him was an innovative retraining program that the state of california offers to tens of thousands of workers each year about one million experienced workers nationwide are laid off every year as the economy undergoes a fundamental restructuring and finds itself needing employees with more sophisticated skills presidentelect bill clinton has made job creation and training central elements of his plans for economic growth among those needing retraining and new jobs are workers with outdated skills like mr johnson success in california if the nation is to stand up to international competition , experts say , the economy needs more skilled workers but , they add , most state and federal programs intended to help those with waning skills are small or ineffective california seems to be an exception , as mr johnson and 150 , 000 other workers have found over the 10 years since the state legislature established the retraining program in 1990 , mr johnson went to work for mcneal enterprises , a thriving machining shop of 25 employees in this recessionworn silicon valley town he started at 8 an hour now he makes 11 , or 22 , 000 a year , and he can aspire to 46 , 000 , the salary of mcneal s top machinist machinists make pieces of machines and whole machines that make machines they fashion the models of industry s new products , along with the tools and molds to produce them on the job , mr johnson shapes fistsized chunks of clear plastic into the core components of medical devices , like blood analysis instruments used in testing for aids it s good work , he said it s clean work it makes you think you work with numbers all the time degrees circumferences all kinds of numbers you 're actually creating something you look at a blueprint and make it into what the blueprint calls for help for the skilled the california legislature created the employment training panel for experienced workers like mr johnson , not the chronically unemployed or the unskilled youth that other programs help with more basic training some other states , like new york , illinois , maryland , delaware and alaska , have retraining agencies , but they are much smaller and less comprehensive just this year , new jersey started a program intended to approach the scope of california s and through the job training partnership act , the federal government also tries to retrain laidoff workers but california has achieved the most impressive results , experts say the program starts with a hardnosed assumption that reverses the wisdom of the 1970 s and early 80 s it does not try to turn middleaged blast furnace operators into advanced computer programmers some people like mr johnson are taught completely new skills , but only after passing aptitude tests more often , the program tries to beef up the workers' existing skills long before they lose their jobs interestingly , the most effective training is for people who are working , said anthony p carnivale , chief economist of the american society for training and development , an organization of training professionals the overview skills change with economy as the american economy evolves , there is widespread agreement that if government wants to create more employment opportunities for everyone , it must do a better job of retraining experienced workers whose skills have grown less valuable unlike the old days , when an auto or steel worker knew his abilities would be needed through his working life , now few businesses stand still , and americans who do not master new skills are at the mercy of foreigners who do we have a rapidly changing economy where workers' skills have been getting out of date , said evelyn ganzglass , director of employment and social policy studies at the national governors association a result is the erosion of the standard of living that mr clinton repeatedly mentioned in his campaign workplace skills are not the only problem inattentive corporate management , federal economic policy and the general weakness of the economy affect the nation s competitiveness , too but the huge deficit in foreign trade is in large part a measure of the deficit in workplace skills by learning new skills , employees raise their productivity , which means they produce more and better goods and services without working harder we want to step in to train people to be more productive while they are working , ms ganzglass said that s our big aim , and the kind of training that works best training for 50 million
hackensack , nj , may 28 when lance hamilton , a freeagent defensive back , was cut by the giants in early august 1986 , he secretly recorded a conversation he had with coach bill parcells before departing from the team s pace university training camp in pleasantville , ny that conversation was heard today by a jury of six men and two women as part of a civil suit hamilton has brought against the giants in the superior court of new jersey hamilton charges that the giants broke a promise to hire him as an assistant coach , and he has sued the team for breach of contract and racial discrimination in the tape played in judge benedict lucchi s courtroom at the bergen county court house , parcells was heard to say to hamilton , then 21 years old and newly graduated from penn state i think you 'd be a hell of a coach i might be interested in you returns to penn state according to the tape , parcells suggested to hamilton , who had never thought of coaching as a career , that he include that in your possibilities as a consideration the giants' coach also encouraged hamilton to get some experience , which he did he returned to penn state and served as a graduate assistant coach under joe paterno during the nittany lions' 21day spring practice in 1987 hamilton testified that he then wrote parcells about employment and the giants' coach replied that there were no openings but that he would keep the letter on file parcells is expected to testify friday or monday , according to the giants' attorney , andrew berry , who insisted that hamilton had been presented only with the possibility of a coaching job and that none was available for him recorder hidden in gym bag hamilton testified that he had used the tape recorder , hidden in a thin nylon gym bag , only to furnish a record of the conversation that he could play back to his father i wanted to find out why i had been cut , he said after gaining a master s degree in business administration at penn state , hamilton graduated from yale law school and now lives in tampa , fla , where he is a clerk with the united states circuit court of appeals his older brother , harry , was also a defensive back at penn state and later played with the new york jets and the tampa bay buccaneers harry hamilton was placed on the plan b list by the buccaneers last winter and is a free agent
manchester , nh , feb 12 trying to prevent further damage to his presidential campaign , bill clinton made public today a 1969 letter in which he thanked an army officer overseeing the reserve officers training corps program at the university of arkansas for saving me from the draft and also apologized for misleading the officer about the strength of his antiwar feelings at a news conference here , the arkansas governor said he was issuing the letter , dated dec 3 , 1969 , because he knew it was to be disclosed later today by abc news the unexpected development came as mr clinton , whose campaign has been disrupted by accusations that he had an extended extramarital affair with a cabaret singer and manipulated his draft status , was trying to shake free of personal controversy and focus attention on his economic program opponents on the attack with the voting in the new hampshire primary set for tuesday , mr clinton s democratic opponents are shedding their reluctance to take advantage of his trouble today they adopted the theme that whatever the truth of the accusations , they created a cloud of doubt that detracts from mr clinton s value as a democratic presidential nominee mr clinton wrote the 1969 letter to col eugene holmes of the army to explain why he had decided not to join the university s rotc program when mr clinton agreed to join the program , colonel holmes requested that mr clinton be reclassified from 1a , immediately eligible for the draft , to 1d , the category for men who joined the reserves or student rotc units in the letter , mr clinton described what he said today was a snapshot of that generation s feelings the letter shows that the candidate , like thousands of men in his generation , actually opposed both the war and the draft and viewed the rotc program mainly as a way of staying out of combat without breaking the law text of letter , page a25 in tones of moral anguish , mr clinton wrote about his role in organizing antiwar rallies in the united states and britain , where he was studying in 1969 as a rhodes scholar he stated that he admired friends who had defied the selective service law , but did not want to break the law himself and damage his career and political viability first , i want to thank you , not just for saving me from the draft , but for being so kind and decent to me last summer , when i was as low as i have ever been , mr clinton wrote one thing which made the bond we struck in good faith somewhat palatable to me was my high regard for you personally , mr clinton wrote in retrospect , it seems that the admiration might not have been mutual had you known a little more about me , about my political beliefs and activities at least you might have thought me more fit for the draft than for rotc last week , fending off questions about his draft deferment , mr clinton said , you 've got to understand that if you look at the facts as they then existed , instead of some 23yearlater rewrite , the facts are , i put myself into the draft , i did n't take it out issue is revived the question of mr clinton s draft status was revived as an issue last thursday when the wall street journal reported that in 1969 mr clinton secured a draft deferment by promising to join the rotc program supervised by colonel holmes and enroll in the university of arkansas law school instead , he attended oxford university for a second year then went to law school at yale university mr clinton admitted last week that he had done that , but denied any intention to mislead colonel holmes or the local draft board in his hometown , hope , ark he also insisted that he had acted in good faith and later asked to have his rotc deferment revoked because he felt a moral obligation to submit to the draft i had four of my high school classmates killed in vietnam , he explained last week , and i just did n't feel right about it the letter released today showed that mr clinton actually signed a letter of intent to join the rotc , rather than simply making a verbal promise it also suggested that he knew he was misleading colonel holmes about true feelings about the war and the army when the two men had talked during the summer of 1969 in the letter he wrote of loathing the military to which you and other good man have devoted years colonel holmes has not been available for comment on the letter it was a time of growing discontent with the war , with president nixon and , at times , with authority college students and many democratic politicians worked that year to fan such sentiments a high point came on oct 16 when millions of americans across a broad spectrum of society wore black armbands , held prayer vigils , chanted at rallies and stayed away from classes or jobs in a protest they called the vietnam moratorium 'no interest in rotc' after i signed the rotc letter of intent , he continued in the letter , i began to wonder whether the compromise i had made with myself was not more objectionable than the draft would have been , because i had no interest in the rotc program in itself and all i seemed to have done was to protect myself from physical harm
two teams won approval from a federal panel yesterday to treat cystic fibrosis by inserting sturdy new genes into the patients' frail and beleagured airway tissue , a scheme that if successful could amount to a cure for cystic fibrosis , the most common lethal hereditary disease the two teams take a very similar approach to rallying the power of human gene therapy against the illness , and human trials could begin by early next year i think this is a major step along the way , and after working so hard on this for so long , i feel really good , said dr ronald g crystal of the national heart , lung and blood institute in bethesda , md the time is right to cure this disease , and while i do n't think we 're going to be able to do that immediately , we now have the potential for a cure dr crystal led one of the teams whose projects were approved yesterday by the recombinant dna advisory committee , the federal panel that oversees gene therapy research 'just a first step' but other researchers and experts on cystic fibrosis cautioned against overly buoyant expectations of success even if the therapy proves promising in the initial clinical trials , they said , it will still take about six years before it is widely available we 're very encouraged , said robert k dresing , president and chief executive officer of the cystic fibrosis foundation but this is very early work , and it s just a first step toward getting that ultimate therapy at any given time , cystic fibrosis afflicts about 30 , 000 americans many die from the disease before they reach 30 years of age several new drugs designed to ease the extreme mucus buildup and chronic lung infections often associated with the disorder are now being tested , but none , if effective , would rank as a cure dr james wilson of the university of michigan in ann arbor led the second group whose project was approved by the advisory committee a third group , headed by dr michael welsh of the howard hughes medical institute at the university of iowa , plans to offer a similar but somewhat more conservative gene therapy method today its approval is believed to be likely fda approval also needed the projects must next be authorized by bernadine healy , director of the national institutes of health , who is expected to take her cue from the advisory committee and the food and drug administration the three teams will try to deliver fresh copies of the crucial cystic fibrosis gene to patients by packaging the gene in a harmless cold virus called an adenovirus , and then , essentially , squirting the virus into the patients' airways two teams will deliver the virus and the gene it enfolds to the patients' nose and lungs , while dr welsh s team , concerned about possible lung inflammation from the treatment , will start with nasal administration alone preliminary results from animal and test tube experiments have been described by many scientists as impressive , although researchers say they will only know how well the plan works by trying it on humans some doctors have expressed concern that using a cold virus as a delivery vehicle for the gene carries risks that have not been sorted out , and some say they would not immediately recommend such a treatment for patients who have only a mild form of cystic fibrosis risks viewed as minimal but dr welsh said he believed that the risks of unexpected infections from the adenovirus are minimal , and notes that the virus the scientists will be using has been genetically manipulated to prevent it from reproducing once it has entered a cell this is a lethal disease , and the chances that gene therapy will work are high , dr welsh said the potential benefits clearly outweigh any risks involved mr dresing said he , too , believes the method is safe my own son , who has cystic fibrosis , may very well volunteer for the early trials , he said mr dresing s son is 24 years old the current wealth of gene therapy offerings is no surprise , given the fervor with which geneticists have been studying cystic fibrosis in the last several years some researchers say the entire field of human gene therapy was practically invented with the goal of thwarting cystic fibrosis in mind , although the approach has already been tried against an immune disorder , a lethal cholesterol defect and several types of cancer , with varying success the teams plan to begin experiments with adult victims of the disease , enlisting about 30 patients over the age of 21 for the early phases of the trials the scientists will give patients copies of the gene they lack , called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in its healthy guise , the gene directs cells to create a protein that controls the body s flow of chloride molecules cystic fibrosis patients , lacking that essential trafficking molecule , end up with a dangerous imbalance of salt , which in turn leads to excessive mucus buildup in the lungs the mucus serves as a broth for chronic bacterial infections , and eventually the pulmonary tissue gives out , leading to death the researchers hope that the adenovirus delivery vehicles will infect about 10 percent of the cells of the airway tissue , installing just enough copies of the cystic fibrosis gene to correct the defective chloride flow diagram a cold virus to carry a missing gene cystic fibrosis patients lack a gene for a protein to control salt flow in lung cells mucus builds up and infections destroy tissue scientists will try a replacement method that worked in animals adenovirus , which causes colds , is altered so it cannot reproduce missing gene is inserted into virus the virus is to be delivered through the lung or nasal passage in the lung tissue , it is expected to infect about 10 percent of airway cells the gene should begin to work , producing the control protein , and mucus buildup should be significantly reduced
newark on a torpid afternoon , the two rumpled police officers watched an overhead jet dwindle into a speck and climbed into their unmarked lincoln town car be careful out there , boys , the captain told them they knew they had only to glance at their car the right front fender was badly crumpled a couple of weeks ago when a criminal slammed into it the wounded car was a taunting reminder of the perils of their trade catching car thieves from their base in borrowed space at newark international airport , lieut anthony mullarkey and sgt rick winowski headed off into the bustle and thicket of newark s west and south districts , where poverty and crime exist in equal measure both were members of the essexunion auto theft task force , a nascent effort to combat a stolencar epidemic that has elevated newark to the auto theft capital of the country a struggle for control newark and new jersey are struggling to bring the rash of thievery under control , though nothing ever seems to be enough prosecutors and other officials have intensified the pressure on judges to stiffen what they see as lenient penalties meted out to thieves mayor sharpe james of newark , for example , plans to meet thursday with judge burrell ives humphreys of superior court , the essex county assignment judge , and james f mulvihill , the acting county prosecutor , to discuss harsher measures mayor james also said he was considering reversing a policy under which the newark police would be forbidden to chase stolen cars unless they believe the thieves were involved in more serious crimes i am very much concerned that our police are becoming the target and not the solution , he said tuesday and it is unfair if we tie their hands mayor james has called on the state to create boot camps for auto thieves and to place liens against the assets of the parents of juvenile thieves to pay for damages he and others have also beseeched auto manufacturers to make their vehicles less accessible to thieves all of which obscures a basic truth that many subscribe to there is a woeful lack of attention to troubled urban youth one of the more strenuous efforts under way is the police task force , largely put in motion by the union county prosecutor , andrew ruotolo jr , and sponsored by the essex and union prosecutors' offices formed at the end of december with officers from 14 forces , it focuses on newark because the police have found that much of the car theft in outlying areas is the work of newark criminals the newark police maintain their own autotheft force , though its role is to investigate stolencar reports most of the cars it recovers have been abandoned the task force , on the other hand , deploys undercover officers to try to snare thieves behind the wheel from the vantage point of one of the force s dented cars , it is possible to get a streetlevel sense of newark s war against car theft before this day is over , lieutenant mullarkey said , i 'll bet dinner we catch a thief lieutenant mullarkey eased down avon avenue he had sergeant winowski call in a license number because he thought the driver looked too young the response was negative because of the danger to bystanders , the task force , like the newark police , will not chase stolen cars unless the driver is believed to have committed another more serious crime instead , the force splits newark up into 50block grids and crowds all of its cars into a particular grid for a few days before shifting to another the force will not divulge how many cars it has because it does not want the thieves to know boxing in suspects is touch and go unlike the newark police , the task force has portable computers tied into the department of motor vehicles that can tell , in a matter of minutes , whether a car has been reported stolen if it has , task force cars converge on it , and in a sheepherding fashion , try to box it in when it stops for a light or gets bottled up in traffic we work like a wolf pack , said sgt thomas decastro , the task force s commander so far this year , the force has arrested more than 215 car thieves that s a success , said mr ruotolo , but the problem is still not something we can live with lieutenant mullarkey went down clinton , past tumbledown buildings he spelled out some concerns we 've had so many instances where we 're within two seconds of getting a guy and the light changes , lieutenant mullarkey said for safety s sake , we have to let him go but it hurts we get reminded not to take it personally , not to be macho , but it s tough you get this rush of adrenaline when you 're closing in on someone clues indicative of a stolen vehicle are a broken window , a lock that has been punched out or a car being driven with no key in the ignition if a driver does a doughnut \( spinning a car in a tight circle that leaves doughnutshaped skid marks \) , that s a dead giveaway hey , nobody i know does a doughnut in his own car , lieutenant mullarkey said newark s car thieves , however , are wily because they realize the police look for cars without keys , they often stick a dummy key into the ignition
rene pujol the greeting as you step down into rene pujol is as warm and comforting as a mug of tea in january in part , that is what has kept this gallic institution vigorous during all these years of jarring change in the theater district the 22yearold rene pujol is part of the loosely related trio of pujol family restaurants , which includes les pyrenees on west 51st street and pierre au tunnel on west 47th street in recent years it has been known as a place that turned out serviceable french fare in a rather somber and stuffy setting two years ago , however , the restaurant was given a welcome overhaul , and the results have been all for the better the setting is more evenly lit and contemporary without losing its french allure creamtoned walls , sleek saucershaped ceiling lights and a stately grandfather clock brighten the bar the main dining room still has a brick hearth and a long row of tight tables , yet it is more cheerful and colorful soundabsorbent ceiling tiles keep conversations from drifting like pollen on a windy day food , like the decor , is brighter the chef and coowner \( with his wife , nicole , and fatherinlaw , rene pujol \) is claude franques mr franques returned to the restaurant last summer after a threeyearsabbatical to work at maxime s , la grenouille and le pistou , all in manhattan he returned with a more refined approach , especially regarding seafood , and wider reach in his french discipline at the same time he has not abandoned the classics that customers look for here this can be seen in appetizers like the spirited eggplant terrine layered with red pepper and tomato and ringed with black olives and dollops of goat cheese , as well as the deliciously sweet tart of onion sprinkled with fresh thyme a provencal leaning can also be seen in the plate of richly flavored broiled sardines served over french bread with tomatoes and herbs a bistro standard , fromage de tete , or head cheese , was well made but it was served in thin slices instead of whole , making the gelatin melt faster two other solid choices are the country pate with green peppercorns , and the relatively lean saucisson \( garlic sausage \) over green lentils the excellent waiters at rene pujol have the style and selfpossession of seasoned professionals , which they are if you merely raise an eyebrow at a dish they swoop down to take it back to the kitchen , no questions asked that is how it should be knowledgeable wine drinkers will be astonished at some of the bargains on the extensive list , particularly the bordeaux and house wines by the glass offer surprises too a 1975 chateau gruaudlarose and the 1979 chateau talbot \( both 8 a glass \) diners will have no trouble finding a fine wine to go with the savory lamb shanks with white beans , a special , or the sauteed veal chop in pan juices with good mashed potatoes at lunch , lamb also came in a navarin with sundry vegetables and a lovely hint of rosemary filet mignon is , to my taste , one of the most insipid and textureless cuts of beef despite my admonishment , a fellow diner ordered it , and it was terrific beefy , nicely seared and embellished by a textbookperfect sauce

chinatown is one of a new breed of chinese restaurants taking root throughout new york city , one that spotlights the cuisine of chiu chow province \( pronounced chew chow \) chiu chow is a region of canton , and the food shares many of its characteristics among the hallmarks of chiu chow food are various types of deepfried fish balls , duck that is basted with soy instead of the cantonesefavored honey , and different spice mixtures in soups and sauces sun golden island is a shiny new space with aggressively bright lighting , coraltoned wall panels and relatively wellspaced tables draped with pink tablecloths servers are cheerful and helpful , but once you are served they tend to disappear until you flag them down many dishes at sun golden island are straightforward cantonese , while a few offer a taste of chiustyle cooking chiu chow spring rolls are not the best introduction to this regional food the porkfilled cylinders are tasty but somewhat greasy and heavy much better are the tempuralight strands of saltandpepper shrimp , and the dense , goldenfried calamari also titillating are brittle and cleanly fried seafood rolls filled with a wellseasoned blend of fish and shellfish

the voters have been yearning for magic , hoping to see a white dove flutter from a black top hat they have been longing for dramatic change , that impulse wile e coyote gets as he is about to push the plunger on a bundle of acme dynamite but new york has brought a loss of innocence a week of democratic dueling has shown everyone that the voters will have to choose among negatives , pick their way among lesser evils and figure out which man or party they most want to keep out of the white house the voters seem eager to make a positive choice yet , like a party guest cornered by a bore , they are hemmed in by candidates who have remarkably high negative ratings many of those who vote for bill clinton will do so because he is not jerry brown many of those who vote for jerry brown will do so because he is not bill clinton some will vote for paul tsongas because he is neither of them and they have forgotten what they did not like about him when he was in the race or they will not vote at all even the stated reasons for choosing one above another are often rooted in negatives new yorkers say they will vote for mr clinton because he fends off blows well they say they will vote for mr brown because he wants to shatter the system that turned the planet into a stinking junkyard after 1988 , it was predicted that disgusted voters would never tolerate another such negative , empty campaign and yet , barely halfway through this prickly primary season , edward rollins , the republican strategist , is already forecasting that the general election will be one of the roughest campaigns ever all this negativity is having its effect after all , according to the definition in the encyclopedia of philosophy , nothing is an aweinspiring yet essentially undigested concept , highly esteemed by writers of a mystical or existentialist tendency , but by most others regarded with anxiety , nausea or panic voters , watching their candidates getting more bruised and scratched by the day , must feel like the man in kenmore , ny , who jumped out a window saturday morning , survived by landing on a car , rode the elevator back up and tried again , and ended up leaping from the same window and landing , a bit battered , on the same car certain fears have hardened into convictions one of them is now the suspicion , after the case of the uninhaled marijuana and the case of the missing draft induction notice , that bill clinton may have an inexhaustible supply of surprises for jittery democratic leaders and clinton workers with careful syntax and cagey omissions , the arkansas governor has tried to parcel out his political problems in portions he felt the voters could swallow but there is now an impression of a man who half wants to be coy and half wants to be caught there is an impression that the clintons are a political couple who combine the idealism of the 60 s with a touch of the yuppie materialism and selfabsorption of the 80 s as usual , jerry brown overstates with the prince of sleaze , but there is an impression of past carelessness that is disturbing in a man who has wanted to run for president his whole life bill was always very careless , out of an unbelievable naivete , betsey wright , mr clinton s former chief of staff , said in a newly published vanity fair article , talking about mr clinton s attitude toward political groupies ms wright , who is now a clinton campaign aide , added that his judgment about the motives of certain young ladies was not always good he just thinks everyone is wonderful , she said he is also careless about appearances jerry brown may have hit the target in describing mr clinton as a candidate of personal responsibility who does not want to take responsibility for the past but this week mr brown also strained the limits of bornagain politics even with the scalding desire to throw out the bums , voters worried about the aroma of hypocrisy around mr brown playing savonarola has been harder with newspaper stories painting him as machiavelli , charging that as governor and afterward , he adroitly played the insider game , trading judicial positions for campaign contributions and using clout on behalf of contributors and business associates mr brown makes fun of mr clinton for pandering to special interest groups , and yet how else to describe his tango in new york with the rev jesse jackson and black voters \? new yorkers seemed unsure about the notion of turning the white house into a new age animal house populated by mr brown , jacques barzaghi , patrick caddell and carl sagan nothing has changed much in terms of negatives some voters say that mr brown still seems weird and also a little slick , and that mr clinton still seems slick and also a little weird mr clinton played golf at a whitesonly country club , in a move worthy of the white men s club that makes up the heart of the bush administration as for the republicans , voters seem skeptical that george bush will ever want to sit down at his desk and toil on domestic chores voters are left with a choice between three career politicians running as agents of fundamental change it s no wonder that the big news out of the new york primary may be that anybody but , none of the above and why bother \? will continue to look pretty good
despite years of ballyhoo about rapidly privatizing huge state enterprises , none in russia and very few in eastern europe have been turned over to private owners the reason is that the state is not the uncontested owner of these companies after all , and therefore lacks the authority to cede them before privatization can proceed , the various owners have to resolve their claims for control claims suppressed over decades of communist central rule state ownership has turned out to be a bit of a misnomer there is implicit ownership by other groups , each claiming a stake , said jeffrey sachs , a harvard economist who advises the polish and russian governments such recognition of the conflicting claims from managers , workers and municipal officials as well as central government has come only recently and now the question is , can the transition to free markets proceed without first resolving these conflicts so that the big state enterprises can be privatized \? the answer appears to be no , if only because eastern europe along with russia and the other members of the commonwealth of independent states rely so heavily on their giant manufacturing operations , each of which employs more than 5 , 000 people and remains immersed in red ink and inefficiency ending this heavy drain on government treasuries requires privatization , virtually everyone agrees but privatization is turning out to be beyond the power of central government to mandate the struggle of the four groups for ownership , in a nation that does not yet grant property titles , is taking a special form , said andrei shleifer , a harvard economist and adviser to the privatization ministry in russia the owner in each case will be the group that commands an enterprise s operations and revenue once such property rights are defined among the contending factions , then those factions in most circumstances will negotiate an efficient way to use the assets , mr shleifer said so far , the managers appear to have the upper hand their influence is enormous because they can threaten to fire workers or send them on strike , parading in front of city hall , mr shleifer said that gives them power over local governments and through them , a strong lobby in congress much is riding on the outcome of the ownership struggle until the winners are declared , president boris n yeltsin s government , for example , might fail to make the russian ruble freely convertible to hard currencies , as the western industrial nations and their agent , the international monetary fund , are urging mr yeltsin to do , by late summer the reason is that russia s high inflation rate eats at the ruble s value inflation , in turn , is hard to control while the yeltsin government is running up deficits to subsidize giant state enterprises the imf is not paying attention to privatization , although the corporate sector is the main drain on the budget , mr shleifer said it is often simply assumed that the government owns all the shares and only has to sell or distribute them to the population to make privatization a reality relying too heavily on a central government s power to orchestrate privatization has already delayed the process in eastern europe and could undermine czechoslovakia s current attempt to sell control of state companies to the public through what is in effect a giant stock offering more practically , an interim solution is emerging , particularly in russia one in which big state enterprises are slowly being reorganized as shareholder corporations , with the various factions holding stock thus , the vaz auto works in the city of togliatti the giant manufacturer of russian cars , with more than 200 , 000 employees is to be divided up among its top managers , its workers and a yeltsin ministry with the managers angling to retain control , although they 'll probably acquire less than 10 percent of the stock sidestepping the struggle over control of big companies , some managers of smaller enterprises those with fewer than 5 , 000 workers often try to buy their companies , frequently by leasing them and then purchasing them with lowinterest loans and some experts argue that the effort to privatize big state enterprises should be postponed , and the china model adopted instead there , thousands of small , newly formed companies are developing a freemarket system , bypassing heavy industry , which remains stateowned and inefficient the problem is that heavy industry represents less than 20 percent of china s economic activity , while in the commonwealth and eastern europe it accounts for more than 80 percent the size of this industrial sector means you cannot go around it , said richard ericson , an economist and russian expert at columbia and gradually , as these companies continue to lap up government subsidies , the public spotlight is shifting away from the imf s stabilization efforts to the far more basic struggle over control of heavy industry , now only nominally owned by the state drawing

you can work on it and become good with hard work and talent indeed , those who know mashburn talk about how hard he has worked to change from being a pudgy playground hopeful to becoming one of the nation s leading players 'people are jealous' a lot of times people are jealous , but everybody s so proud of jamal , first of all because they know what he had to do to get this far , said russell glover , mashburn s cousin and one of his closest friends when he was younger , jamal had a hard time even getting chosen for a team when they played in back of the building they called him a big baby , said he would never make it the other reason people are happy for jamal is because of the kind of person he is , glover added he s quiet , does n't bother anybody people want to talk with him or touch him i remember once a couple of people , i guess they were crackheads , came up to him and wanted his autograph and wished him good luck they said they followed his career and were happy he 'd made it that meant a lot to jamal he sees himself as part of the community indeed , aside from becoming a procaliber basketball player , mashburn s must consistent quest , as he negotiates fame , is a longing to fit in in lexington he is the monster mash , no 24 or an allamerica basketball player he is featured on posters showing him crushing a basketball search for reality trips back to new york tend to ground him in reality , help him maintain a fix on what is real and what is not i know that s all part of the hype , but that s not who i am , mashburn said sometimes in lexington , there s so much hype around basketball , you 're treated in a way than can make you lose sight of reality back home , around my friends i'm just jamal they ask me about my experiences they want to know what it s like playing against the dream team or playing at kentucky but it s not like i'm this big star i'm just a friend who s had some different experiences after playing on a select team of college allstars who scrimmaged against the united states olympic squad , mashburn spent most of last summer in new york he proudly recalls how he spent a good deal of time in recording studios with glover , an aspiring musicianwriter who plays keyboards and hopes to produce rap , rhythm and blues and gospel groups he s a person i really admire , mashburn said sometimes i envy him because he s so creative , he taught himself to play he can write and mix that s the thing , there s so much music where i grew up people just do n't have the resources to get it out perhaps a little more then he would like , trips to harlem also help remind mashburn that , for all the hype of his allamerica career at kentucky , in some eyes , in some environments , he is merely a potential criminal in a perpetual game of cops and robbers according to his family , mashburn was stopped by the police in harlem twice last summer both in cases of mistaken identity the first time mashburn and two friends had just picked up glover from his job at a bank on 145th street they were four young black men riding in a car with kentucky license plates glover said the police stopped the car , and with guns drawn told everyone to get out only when mashburn announced that his father was a police officer was the situation diffused his father , robert mashburn , recalled the other incident when his son was stopped outside of the rangel homes same thing outoftown license , black male wearing a certain type of shirt , robert mashburn said they thought he was selling drugs both of mashburn s parents agree that since their son has been in kentucky , they have slept easier centerpiece of rebuilding when he committed himself to the wildcats three seasons ago , mashburn became the centerpiece of kentucky s rebuilding process , with coach rick pitino at the helm mashburn was a freshman when the wildcats completed the final season of a twoyear probation last season , he helped pull kentucky within an overtime victory of reaching the final four this season may be mashburn s final one at kentucky he is projected as a national basketball association lottery pick should he choose to leave school after this season mashburn says whether he leaves this season or next , in many positive ways he will not be the same person coming out of kentucky that he was going in i 've matured a lot , he said i appreciate education before , i just wanted to come in , play ball and go to the pros now i understand the value of an education , particularly for an africanamerican male even if you do n't finish in four years , you absorb information it changed the way i approach some things his mother would like for mashburn , a communications major , to earn his degree the reality of economics , however , may dictate a different course of action wants to help he would like to move his family out of new york city , he would like to give his cousin s production company a boost there s more than just me to think about , mashburn said , referring to his decision whether to leave school or stay of course , the first order of business for mashburn is to have a dominating year after deferring to upperclassmen his first two seasons , mashburn , with prodding from pitino , has taken over but he has not taken over in a frenzied , egocentric manner he might take the open shot when he would have passed off , or now he might demand the ball in clutch situations basically , jamal is unselfish , his father said he s a team player , but it goes past basketball he was taught to respect all people , to respect his elders he knows how to wait his turn the way i approach the game , and people , is to respect all and fear none , mashburn said so far , that s what s worked for me photo jamal mashburn is the centerpiece of a rising kentucky team \( allsport \)
morris township , nj , june 11 where is sidney j reso \? the short answer is no one who is looking for him has the slightest idea in the six weeks since the exxon official disappeared from the driveway of his home here , lawenforcement officials say that almost nothing is known about how he vanished and why , or who may be holding him and where because so little is known , the morris county prosecutor s office and the federal bureau of investigation have continued to classify his disappearance as a missingperson case , not a kidnapping we do n't have any concrete proof that he is in the hands of any group or individual , said lois ferguson , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor , w michael murphy jr we have no photograph , no voice recording before you have a motive you have to have an occurrence so we ca n't speculate as to a motive neither mr murphy s office nor the fbi is suggesting that mr reso , a wellliked 57yearold executive who was by all accounts the model of a company man , got fed up with the american dream and swapped it for a secluded foreign beach and a new identity to date , we have yet to uncover anything to suggest that mr reso disappeared voluntarily , said william tonkin , an fbi spokesman in newark but the authorities and officials at exxon international in florham park , where mr reso served as president since 1988 , would not comment on details of the investigation after a flurry of publicity almost a month ago , including a televised plea from mr reso s wife , patricia , for his safe return , nothing more has emerged from official or family representatives they cited concern that speaking publicly might somehow jeopardize the prospect of mr reso s safe return , although none suggested that there had been any warnings from terrorists , kidnappers or anyone else however , experts in law enforcement , counterterrorism and security who have been following the reso case say they do not believe that terrorism or political motives are involved this is not a terrorist act or one that is politically or corporately directed , said gerald walpin , a former assistant united states attorney in manhattan who is now head of litigation for rosenman colin , a manhattan law firm otherwise , the kidnappers would certainly have created publicity for themselves 3 possibilities mr walpin , who as a government lawyer once investigated the bogus kidnapping of the elderly crime boss joseph bonanno , drew no conclusions on what actually happened there are three alternatives and no way of being certain , he said one is that it was a selfcreated fiction , for whatever purpose he had second , that it was a kidnapping that got botched very quickly and the third is that it was a kidnapping and that ransom requests have been made , and in order to protect him there has been total silence but michael hershman , president of the fairfax group , an international investigating agency based in northern virginia that specializes in corporate security , said , i did not take this as a kidnapping this does not follow any of the norms of kidnapping , he said , adding that his agency had been monitoring the case , as it does many missing persons cases , for trends and patterns if you kidnap somebody , you want to give yourself as much time as humanly possible to get away , he said you do n't leave the guy s car in the driveway for someone to discover , for someone to sound the alarm immediately no ransom request the biggest factor is that there has been no request for ransom other than one note that they received and that they discounted , mr hershman said he has not participated in the investigation but said he kept in touch with those familiar with such cases in discounting a terrorist kidnapping or corporate abduction directed against exxon for its environmental policies , mr hershman said it would make no difference to kidnappers if their subject was alive or dead that s how terrorists operate , he said they consider the publicity to be the most important element of the crime the major corporations have kidnapping and ransom insurance they have deep pockets for their executives any professional kidnapper knows basically what the insurance companies are willing to pay without suspects or a motive , there is little to go on mr reso s career at exxon is unremarkable except for its success hired in 1957 after graduating from louisiana state university with an engineering degree , he moved up through a series of foreign and domestic postings until becoming president of exxon international , a major division that handles corporate operations outside north america mr reso and his wife have four grown children a fifth died about two years ago mr reso played golf , mrs reso worked in charitable or civic organizations they were considered charming guests at neighborhood parties but friends have said they especially enjoyed evenings at home or a quiet restaurant meal coworkers said mr reso was hardworking , easy to get along with and , until april 29 , all but anonymous vanished from the driveway
over the years , students at the university of new haven have grown accustomed to some of the confusion about the school s identity often when i'm home in wilton and mention that i go to unh , people will say , 'oh , how are things in new hampshire \? , ' said jason mumbach , the president of the day student government at the university adding to the confusion is the fact that the university , which was founded in new haven in 1920 , moved to west haven in 1960 last month , though , the university got a huge identity boost when its football team , the chargers , scored one of the state s biggest alltime sports upsets , beating the university of connecticut , 1413 , at storrs that victory , in the first meeting ever between the two teams , was monumental , since new haven is a division ii school , while uconn plays at the more competitive division i level , and the chargers were given virtually no chance to win not only did the sept 5 triumph , in the opening game of the season for both teams , give the new haven players a lift , it also attracted attention to a university that has been overshadowed by other institutions in the state , like yale , wesleyan , connecticut college and trinity as well as uconn there s been an extra sense of pride on campus since the uconn game , said mr mumbach , a senior for the chargers' coach , mark whipple , the victory over uconn brought plaudits galore i ca n't believe the number of calls and letters i 've received from people , some of whom i have n't heard from in years , said mr whipple , who is in his fifth year as the head coach at new haven and i 've also received quite a few nice congratulatory notes from faculty members coach whipple , who was a quarterback at brown university , pointed out that the new haven upset could not have come at a better time it was early in the season , and the only college or high school game in the state that day , he said as a result , it got a lot more attention , and the ramifications were greater it also brought a lot of attention and recognition to the school and it will be a big plus in our recruiting 13 , 000 vs 1 , 400 students what made the new haven victory particularly remarkable is that none of the university s 115 players is on a full athletic scholarship , while practically all of the uconn huskies are yet coach whipple said he was not all that surprised at the upset by new haven , which has only 1 , 400 fulltime day undergraduate students , compared with approximately 13 , 000 at the uconn storrs campus i know we have a good team and realized that we were capable of beating uconn , said the 35yearold coach , who was an assistant at new hampshire before coming to new haven and even though we won , i do n't think we played that well on offense against connecticut though it is a division ii school , new haven has played , and beaten , other division i teams in the past in recent years the chargers have defeated towson state three out of four times in regularseason games and in preseason scrimmages , new haven has beaten yale , the university of pennsylvania and columbia since uconn has defeated yale decisively over the last few seasons , that would lend support to the claim by many charger followers that new haven is the best college team in the state scoring as few as 14 points , as new haven did in beating connecticut , is rare for the chargers , who are renown in division ii for their offense indeed , they bounced back to score 10 touchdowns in defeating buffalo the following saturday , 6948 a week later , the chargers beat clarion \( pa \) university , 4847 then a week ago saturday they exploded for 11 touchdowns in crushing virginia union in richmond , 8026 that sent them into yesterday s game against central connecticut state university in new britain with a 40 record , the best by any college team in the state last year the chargers averaged 32 points a game despite finishing 37 , their first losing season since 1983 home attendance burgeons if mr whipple was unhappy about his offense against uconn , he was not in the buffalo contest , when roger graham , sophomore tailback , broke four school records , and the team as a whole set two new marks most points scored in a game \( 69 \) and total offense in a game \( 766 yards \) crowds at dodds stadium on the campus in west haven usually average about 900 , but sometimes are considerably smaller but the first home game of the season , against buffalo , drew about 1 , 500 spectators , no doubt in large measure because of the chargers' triumph over uconn the previous saturday everybody is excited about the team the students , the faculty , the administration and the alumni , said mr mumbach , the student government president the win over uconn pulled everyone together tooting its own horn appropriately enough , it was at the uconn game that the new university of new haven pep band made its debut the band had only five pieces , a drum set , two saxophones and two flutes , compared with the big uconn marching band , mr mumbach said but our little pep band gave them a run for their money so , too , did the new haven supporters , who although vastly outnumbered , made their presence known and heard i never saw so much school spirit at a new haven football game before , mr mumbach said for alan schmidt , the editor of the university newspaper , the charger bulletin , the game was a difficult one to watch i grew up in storrs and spent two years at uconn before transferring to unh , said mr schmidt , a senior , who now lives in middletown i had mixed emotions , but i still wanted us to win besides , it gave me a lead story for our next edition the story , on the front page , carried the headline upset of the year strong baseball tradition though the university has a strong sports tradition , the football team has been overshadowed by others for example , the men s baseball team , year after year , is one of the best in the nation in division ii during its 30year history , the baseball team , which has been coached from the outset by frank \( porky \) vieira , a sports legend in the state , has never had a losing season and the team has twice been runnerup in the national championship tournament the men s basketball team is also traditionally a winner under stu grove , the head coach , the university of new haven has enjoyed 12 consecutive winning seasons , and last season was ranked as high as fourth in the country and the women s basketball team won the division ii national championship in 1987 but for all the victories by those teams , none ranks with the charger football team s upset of uconn at storrs that one did a lot for the team and the school , and i do n't think anyone who was there will ever forget it , mr mumbach said
russia makes a perilous leap to markets today when it lifts price controls on nearly all consumer products prices are expected to triple , or more , grinding millions of russians those without a mountain of rubles stuffed under mattresses further into poverty no matter what preparations were in place , the leap would n't be easy or graceful but in russia , virtually nothing is in place to absorb the shock no sizable western aid , no banking or taxation systems and no functioning safety net for those who will be crunched what makes the situation truly terrifying is that russia is flying off on its own by launching economic and military reforms that could harm its neighbors at monday s meeting in minsk , the former soviet republics made a stab at forging economic and military agreements but nationalist pressures blocked firm accords unless the leaders find a way to pull together , economic crisis will unravel the commonwealth or , worse , provoke armed rivalry the new commonwealth is not a state but a budding alliance of republics after seven decades of central control , their mutual dependency exceeds that of any other group of neighboring countries under these circumstances , for any republic to go it alone risks economic catastrophe , for its neighbors if not for itself take today s price decontrol by russia in russia itself , prices will skyrocket but republics that refuse to go along with price decontrol wo n't go unscathed attracted by the higher prices , their suppliers will divert production to russia , leaving store shelves in other republics picked clean the only way to stop the hemorrhage would be to erect trade barriers but for a republic that imports virtually everything it consumes , trade barriers are a ticket to deprivation another risk of goitalone reform is monetary crisis ukraine is committed to dropping use of the ruble and adopting its own currency but that threatens russia if , as feared , rubles now circulating in ukraine flood back to russia , driving up inflation the answer to these problems is cooperation one possibility would be for republics to agree to a common schedule of price reform yet , as of now , only two other republics plan to emulate russia another cooperative scheme would be for republics to commit themselves to destroying rubles taken in exchange for new currencies no such agreement was struck at minsk military affairs are also falling prey to narrow nationalism in minsk , republic leaders reaffirmed their commitment to central control of nuclear arms , a step that reassures nervous western powers , but is less reassuring than cuts in their nuclear arsenals would be most of their attention was devoted to dividing up remnants of the soviet armed forces such as the black sea fleet , which russia and ukraine each seek to control yet it would be costly for either republic to maintain and operate the fleet what russia , ukraine and the other former soviet republics need to do , for their own sake and the world s , is agree to cut swollen military budgets that none can afford the west could have made agreement easier by offering economic aid and arms cuts of its own , conditioned on ironclad agreements among the republics on economic reform and demilitarization that would have given the commonwealth as good a chance to survive its leap to markets as the poles had but even poland , with substantial aid , is assured neither a safe nor successful landing for the new commonwealth to survive it must accommodate independence of the republics but not nationalist excess judging from the skimpy agreements announced in minsk , it does n't know how which , in part , is why russians today look terrified
in a small paneled room , norman rosenbaum rummages furiously through his archives , marshaling his evidence like the federal prosecutor he once was in australia his yarmulke slightly askew , he is looking for the newspaper article that appeared after a black man was killed by a white mob in bensonhurst , the one that quoted david n dinkins , then a candidate for mayor , as saying , the tone and climate of this city does get set at city hall then he searches through his collection of mayor dinkins s press releases to find the one that was issued late last month after a jury acquitted a black teenager of murdering mr rosenbaum s brother , yankel , during the racial violence in crown heights what did he say \? in his first one \? he said , reading the mayor s words so fast in his heavy australian accent that only the sections he most disdains are coherent , phrases like , some will be disappointed with the verdict , but ours is a society of laws , and an appeal to accept and abide by the decision of the jury system i 'll tell you what , mr rosenbaum said with rodney king , he was quick to condemn it when it came to rodney king , he was the first one to condemn it fifteen months ago , yankel rosenbaum , a visiting hasidic scholar , became an unwitting victim of new york s racial angst now , as political and religious leaders clash over the jury s verdict , the victim s avenging older brother , norman , has become a visiting , and highly visible , player in the city s racially charged debate entering the new york fray working feverishly to make sure his brother s slaying remains in the forefront of the public consciousness as the federal government considers possible civilrights charges , the 35yearold mr rosenbaum has virtually moved to new york , living with different sets of friends and conducting his australian law practice at nights by fax although his wife and four children remain in melbourne , mr rosenbaum says he will stay in new york until we get justice listen , i'm here for as long as it takes i mean , i'm quite resigned to years , he said , sitting in the small crown heights office that hasidic jewish leaders have given him in the national center for furtherance of jewish education resignation , however , seems the wrong word for mr rosenbaum on the night that 17yearold lemrick nelson jr was acquitted of murder , mr rosenbaum let out a raw cry of pain , shouting , the jury has the blood of yankel rosenbaum on their hands since then , he has become a rally orator and media celebrity who can launch into a wellrehearsed denunciation of mr dinkins one minute , and then become charmingly selfdeprecating the next a political wild card mr rosenbaum is something of a wild card in new york s racial , ethnic and political wars he has no past new york political alliances and none of the prior history , inhibitions or concerns of those who must continue to live in a racially polarized city he dismisses the new york board of rabbis , with its recent support for mr dinkins in the crown heights case , as part of a whitewash mr dinkins , the constant target of mr rosenbaum s attacks , has pointed to the australian s recent appearances with republican politicians and suggested that mr rosenbaum is either politically motivated or is being used why is it norman rosenbaum is holding aloft the hands of rudolph w giuliani and al d'amato \? the mayor asked in an interview mr rosenbaum vehemently denies that he has a partisan agenda i'm not here to get rid of the mayor , he said that is not my aim at all i can make it no more emphatic than that the issue , and the whole issue here , is one of justice he added , as far as being used by people , i wo n't be used as a political pawn wooing from d'amato he insists he did not plan his election night appearance at the side of senator d'amato as the republican declared victory i pledge to you , we will pursue justice , mr d'amato said that night , embracing mr rosenbaum the senator s aides , mr rosenbaum said , called him several times beginning at 10 pm , inviting him to the new york hilton they became insistent at 20 minutes before midnight when he arrived at the hotel , mr rosenbaum said , he spoke for awhile with reporters , and then was told that mr d'amato wanted him to go with him to declare victory i thought , ah , what he s doing , he probably wants me and 150 people who will all cheer and clap and do whatever , like a rentacrowd , he said let me assure you there was no person more surprised than me when he kept calling for me and would n't let me go mr rosenbaum s obsession is the mayor , whom he believes held back the police in crown heights , allowing racial violence to persist there for four days top police officials have acknowledged publicly that they deployed too few officers and lacked a coherent strategy to contain the violence scholar of local conflicts mr dinkins rushed to the side of yankel rosenbaum at the hospital he called the rosenbaum family in australia to offer condolences , and he met with mr rosenbaum at gracie mansion in november 1991 , three months after the killing he has called the killing of the australian a lynching yet mr rosenbaum says he believes that mr dinkins sets the tone for the city and has never worked sufficiently to see that his brother s killers were found and brought to justice i'm not interested in his rhetoric , he said i'm not interested in his diversionary tactics

the invitationonly format that defines the world s matchracing circuit leaves little room for upandcoming sailors not so with the gold cup , a regatta in bermuda that opens its fleet to a mix of topranked sailors and relative amateurs the gold cup s racing plan allows 16 unseeded skippers to enter the event , each for a fee of 1 , 200 another eight skippers , seeded professionals , are invited to compete there is no fee for them , other than the obvious cost of having to live up to their sailing credentials and the standings that supposedly make them better than everyone else the melding of amateur and professional adds a touch of traditionalism to a regatta that has , in other ways , become as corporate as yachting gets in this , its 53d year , the competition is called the 1992 omega gold cup match racing tournament , in recognition of its sponsorship from omega , the watch company and its purse 80 , 000 in cash and expensive watches is one of the most lucrative in sailing series starts today the unseeded sailors are scheduled to begin their elimination series today in hamilton harbor the skippers cannot be considered novices , since they have all won acclaim in other sailing competitions but only 5 of the 16 unseeded competitors are ranked among the world s top 50 matchrace sailors in contrast , 5 of the 8 invited skippers are ranked in the top 10 the 24 sailors represent 12 countries each competes with a crew of three on identical sailboats the boat is the 33foot international one design , a class that has been used in almost every gold cup since the inaugural event in 1937 by the time the championship portion of the regatta begins wednesday , eight of the unseeded skippers will have been eliminated from competition by a series of preliminary roundrobin races then , the unseeded players challenge the seeded helmsmen in paired matchups among those invited to race are chris dickson and russell coutts , new zealand sailors who are no 1 and 2 in the world matchrace rankings , and seeded in the same order for the omega gold cup earlier this month , the two men battled it out for firstplace in the finals of the acy cup , a leading matchracing event that was sailed in wartorn croatia kolius is seeded no 8 seeded no 8 is john kolius , a 41yearold yachtsman from la porte , texas , who sailed for italy as an alternate helmsman in the 1992 america s cup trials in san diego last week , kolius won the columbus cup , a matchracing event in annapolis , md despite his recent victory , kolius says he is n't assured of the same outcome in the gold cup nowadays , i do n't think you can sit back and say , 'i'm pretty good , ' kolius said you have to keep proving it the only female skipper scheduled to compete in the gold cup is dawn riley , a 28yearold detroit sailor who is one of the 16 skippers paying for the right riley , who sailed as an alternate crew member for bill koch s america in the america s cup trials last spring , has competed as skipper in three matchracing events since then lack of opportunities the hardest thing for a woman in this sport is to get the opportunity , said riley none of the matchracing regattas she has competed in so far carry the panache of the gold cup , which is one of 10 premier matchracing events in the world at this point , the only way she could expect to compete at that level was to buy her way in if riley does well in bermuda , it is very likely she will be invited to another one of the premier events , such as the liberty cup in new york and the congressional cup in long beach , calif but winning is n't as important , she said , as who cashes in on the experience if i was going at this thinking that i had to win , and that i wanted a sure thing , i would have asked guys i know with the most experience to sail with me , riley said instead , she has asked two women and one man to join her crew in sailing , she concedes , the extra weight and strength of men is often a decided advantage those who make it to round 1 on wednesday have a chance to move from there into the quarterfinal pairings for eight boats the semifinals for four boats , and then the finals , a best threeoffive sailoff between the top two boats next sunday making waves organizers for the next america s cup regatta , scheduled to begin may 6 , 1995 in san diego , announced last week that there will be a new format for racing instead of the traditional 24mile triangular course , competitors will compete on an eightleg windwardleeward course of 20 miles the winner will be decided in a fiveofninematch series instead of the usual fourofseven races photo eddie warden owen of britain winning the 1991 omega gold cup \( dan nerney \)

tokyo , monday , july 27 in a growing atmosphere of crisis surrounding the economy and the stock market , the bank of japan announced early this morning that it was lowering a key interest rate in response to what it described as a severe adjustment process in the economy the central bank said it was reducing its official discount rate , which it charges banks for shortterm loans , to 325 percent from 375 percent , effective immediately the action followed an emergency meeting on friday evening between prime minister kiichi miyazawa and his top ministers , at which they assembled a package of measures to restore confidence in the stock market and provide some lift to the weakening economy the meeting produced little more than a plan to push forward some previously announced measures to increase public works spending by one month , to september in morning trading today , the stock market rose more than 2 percent in what analysts described as a moderately positive reaction to the cut in interest rates but in the afternoon the market quickly reversed course the nikkei average of 225 issues closed down 12445 points , or 08 percent , to finish the day at 15 , 37334 little longterm impact most market experts and economists said that they expected the government actions to have little longterm impact because of the depth of the problems afflicting the financial system anything at this point is good , because things are so bad , but this wo n't make much of a difference , said paul summerville , the chief economist here with jardine fleming securities it s like putting lotion on a sunburn it takes the sting out but it does n't remove the real problem the stock market has seesawed since the prime minister s meeting was first reported last week on thursday , nikkei stocks rose briefly and then fell , ending at 15 , 49779 , a sixyear low that left the indicator down more than 60 percent from its peak at the end of 1989 the bank of japan s move was widely reported over the weekend in nearly every major newspaper while most central banks closely guard plans for changes in official policy in an effort to prevent profiteering by those with advance knowledge , in japan such information is routinely leaked many here welcomed the news as a sign of greater concern by the authorities a number of senior bank of japan officials have admitted that the depth of the economic slowdown and the corrosive influence of tumbling stock prices had caught them by surprise but there was much debate on how effective a rate reduction would be in reviving a stock market beset by a range of serious problems the last time the central bank cut its discount rate , on april 1 , it was followed by a 2 , 000point plunge in the nikkei stock market index over the next several days on that occasion , too , the central bank s move was accompanied by a promise from the government to stimulate the economy with public works spending to some , a political ploy today s reduction was the fifth time the bank of japan has cut the rate since july 1991 , when the rate stood at 6 percent none of those reductions have yet shown signs of breathing new life into the economy mr summerville said that few people expected the economy to respond much to today s discountrate drop because the problems were so deep mr summerville said that corporate japan was likely to have to go through a wrenching adjustment to slower demand and weaker markets some urgency has been added to the concerns over the economy and the stock market by important parliamentary elections held sunday some commentators referred to the prime minister s emergency meeting friday as more of a preelection ploy than a serious attempt to come to grips with the deep erosion in confidence in the economy and market graph a long slide shows the decrease of japanese stocks from aug '91july '92 \( source bloomberg business news \)
kirkenes , norway since the end of the cold war , the military might of the former soviet empire has actually grown modestly in size just across from this arctic border outpost the heavily armored divisions protecting the old soviet northern flank have not withdrawn as they have in central europe but in all other ways , the cold war seems as dead here as anywhere and security in the nordic countries facing the old empire to the east is being defined increasingly in nonmilitary terms , like environmental security , economic and social stability in russia and the improvement of arctic trade and if anything , these new security challenges are no less daunting than the old and familiar ones a halfhour s drive from here into russia , a traveler comes upon one of the symbols of the new definition of security the hellish sight of a towering , threestack nickel smelter , one of the largest in the world , which belches out more sulphur dioxide than all sources combined in norway the sulphuric acid rain that descends from the factory s triple plumes has turned thousands of acres of norwegian and russian woods into wasteland other factors are also making norwegian politicians look nervously across the border for example , russian politicians visiting oslo have told norwegian cabinet ministers that russian officers cannot feed their wives and children these politicians have asked norway s military unions to lend humanitarian aid in hopes this will quell the resentment that is building against moscow s economic reforms on the environmental front , norway , finland and sweden are in the process of deciding whether the environmental security of the region demands that they help finance part of the cleanup necessary to prevent the nickel plant from doing more damage farther east are two more sites of constant concern in norway two former soviet nuclear power reactors that have been producing steam for electricity for more than 20 years norway s government is constantly concerned about their safety , and not only because reindeer meat in certain norwegian mountain ranges is still off limits because of radioactivity from the chernobyl cloud that passed over norway in 1986 shutting down these plants would cut power to the 12 million military men and civilians in northwest russia who cannot survive the winters there without a stable power supply this situation raises not only purely humanitarian concerns but also fears of a wave of immigration to norway last month russian officials acknowledged that the former soviet navy and icebreaking fleet dumped much of its radioactive waste in shallow arctic seas that are part of the region s bountiful fishing grounds a team of scientists will spend this summer trying to assess the damage threats to norway beyond threats to the environment , norwegian officials assert the major economic and social dislocations that loom across the border pose threats to stability that are equally significant in a month , one of the largest components of the former soviet military will begin the largest reduction in forces in three decades and almost no one is willing to predict the social and economic consequences for northwest russia norway s foreign minister , thorvald stoltenberg , convened a meeting last month in tromso of russian and norwegian municipal officials in the region to promote a local common market and to build bridges across four decades of suspicion and military orientation if the day comes when hundreds of thousands of russian refugees come across our border , it will not be a problem of norway , he warned , but a crisis for europe and the rest of the world ivan i menshikov , who is president boris n yeltsin s personal political representative in murmansk , a three hour drive from here , is predicting that tens of thousands of russian officers involuntarily discharged from the military will hit the local economy beginning june 1 without jobs , apartments or adequate pensions and the situation will get , as he said , ugly how this could affect norway remains mostly a matter of dark speculation we do not know the socioeconomic situation of the russian military in the north , and we have three concerns , defense minister johan joergan holst said in an interview in oslo the first is pure humanitarian we do n't want women and children going hungry the second is , we do n't want a restive russian military , and third , we want to build a longterm relationship with the russian military in a way that will help keep the military out of politics to add to russia s difficulties , mr menshikov , a former colonel in the soviet army , said that the military leadership that has long dominated the northern region was undermining mr yeltsin s reform process in oslo one day not long ago , the russian member of parliament who represents the northern military region , leonid b gurevich , said he feared instability in the officer ranks this summer some of them have told me directly , 'we spit on your reforms , ' he said the prospect that the military force reductions in russia could bring political chaos on norway s northern border has touched off a debate in oslo over the russian politicians' request for aid from this nato country s military unions for russian military families undecided on aid so far , norway s top military officer , adm torolf rein , has replied that moscow should stop flying its war planes and testing its ballistic missiles if it needs more money for food
the living by annie dillard 397 pp new york harpercollins publishers 2250 annie dillard , a poet and essayist whose nonfiction work has won the pulitzer prize , has moved to fiction now with an invigorating , intricate first novel , the living here she displays everything a person could need to know about what befell the lummi , skagit and nooksack indians between 1855 and the end of the last century everything about european and asian settlement in the washington territory in the same period everything about tree felling , hops farming , railroad fever , land speculation , fashion , politics and education in the bellingham bay region in the extreme northwest corner of the united states at first , the reader might think that the celebration of the setting is the most important part of the book , that this is to be a hymn to the peculiar frontier passages , enthusiasms and griefs of the community of whatcom on bellingham bay ms dillard so frankly cherishes her material that we are willing to forgive what , at first , seems a peremptory narrative pace the passage of time seems so brisk , in fact , that a sort of anxiety is momentarily induced how can the material last the narrator near to 400 pages \? for example , we are at first merely told that young ada fishburn has buried her 3yearold boy child , charley , crushed by the wagon wheels , under a lone tree on the oregon trail in earth thickly sown with the bones of earlier , unhappy voyagers we are also told in a few sentences how rooney fishburn , ada s husband , digging a well on their small , misty claim among the douglas firs , asphyxiates when his shovel strikes a pocket of gas an englishman , a former manservant who goes to help rooney , perishes just as instantly the narrative moves from 1855 to 1872 in a few crammed paragraphs ms dillard deals with an entire population as briskly as she deals with the fishburns young john ireland sharp s entire family , parents and siblings , drown when their skiff sinks off madrone island near puget sound it seemed to him that his submerged family listed north and gestured towards lummi island every day when the sea flooded in from the strait of juan de fuca they swayed like singers in a chorus under the pillars of the sea god pinned people under the sea among crabs again , in the style of the book , this event is bluntly announced it was in may that the sharp family met with an accident they drowned , except for john ireland not even william kennedy s grand , roistering novel of 19thcentury albany , quinn s book , travels so headlong and produces such anxieties of pace the reader is quickly taught , however , to have more faith in annie dillard s tremendous gift for writing in a genuinely epic mode for the action of the living is cyclical , returning again and again to events , imbuing them with poignancy the wealth of cherished detail is met in full by a wealth of cherished character no fake suspense in annie dillard s writing instead the same incident enriches us over and over again her writing has another extraordinary quality that is , in fact , the whole point of her narrative she convinces us of , rather than simply positing , the fragility of the lives of all her people this is , above all , why we remain fascinated for all the length of this strange and marvelous account the indigenous crab of this foggy rainy region stands as a symbol of the tenuousness of life , the omnipresence of death it eats the face of lee chin , an unhappy chinese man tethered to a pier in a rising tide by the scholarly hermit beal obenchain in turn , a crab scurries from the boots of the possibly murdered obenchain death s pincers work on the forested shore too men died from trafficking in superior forces , like rivers and horses , bulls , steam saws , mill gears , quarried rock , or falling trees or rolling logs women died in rivers , too , and under trees and rockslides , and men took fevers , too , and fevers took men everywhere the tribes of the dead press in on the living and work at their memories the widowed minta honer goes to meet her parents , senator and mrs green randall , at the pier , and while she is gone two of her children are consumed in flame nooksack indians must rid her of these ghosts , squeezing them from her body , starting with her shoulders , ending with her feet beneath such shadows , enthusiasms flare riotously the account begins with the fraser river gold rush in 1858 , just 18 miles away in british columbia , and ends with the klondike rush of 1897 hearing of the klondike strike , pearl sharp , enjoying a picnic on madrone island with her reclusive , bewildered husband , cries , let s go home , troops hard times is over amid flux and loss , people have time to be worldly the advice girls were given was to marry a man from new england , for new england men treated their wives right fine and by all means arrange to become a man s second wife , at least the previous wife will have accomplished the backbreaking labor of improving his claim none of this prevents senator randall s second daughter , june , from marrying the apparently feckless clare fishburn , or prevents beautiful young grace , who keeps house for a seattle madam , old mother damnable , from marrying clare s intense , surly brother glee just as illadvisedly , socialists and unionists so forget the dream of brotherhood as to expel or murder the celestials \( the chinese \) , who , with the terrestrials \( the irish \) , are the great railroad builders of the day and every time there is a rumor of whatcom becoming a railway terminus or a center for japanese trade , real estate booms and speculation and its attendant angel , embezzlement , seize the civic soul people lose faith in society , ideology , brothers , spouses , god but never their faith in a boom time only a few stand back from the fever john ireland , the disabused socialist schoolteacher , and beal obenchain , who lives in the millenniumold stump of a giant cedar having taken possession of the soul of a calf that he strangled in his boyhood , obenchain now plans to take possession of the soul of one of his fellow citizens , a possession which has nothing to do with real estate , which is not on the temporal plane ms dillard s tale is packed with oddity of character and incident for oddity of character , try the pullman conductor tommy cahoon , who survived being scalped by the sioux while fishing in wyoming for oddity of incident , try the scene in which eustace honer chooses his moment to raise his concern with the nooksack chief , kulshan jim , that the indians treat their women too harshly , working them like mules he finds that kulshan jim is thereby free to raise his concern about the way the bostons treat their women , striking them in anger all the nooksacks pitied the boston women pitied them ! he said softly whose houses were long journeys apart , who worked alone , got hit , and died young what is more important than any of this , and harder to convey , is the way annie dillard gives weight to every detail the living is an august celebration of human frenzy and endurance her living are hectically alive , her dead recur in furious memory and annie dillard , sometimes by an apparent crabwise indirection but with utter thoroughness , proves herself a fine novelist drawing
to the editor in one minute to doomsday \( oped , oct 14 \) robert s mcnamara writes of the 1962 cuban missile crisis that each nation s decisions before and during the crisis had been distorted by misinformation , miscalculation and misjudgment true enough but equally true of the cold war as a whole among the misjudgments of the cold war , none was more emblematic than the expectation of doomsday \( world war iii \) while it lost its immediacy with the unexpected and unexplained demise of the cold war , the rest of its mythology survives in this country essentially intact it obscures in our minds the true nature of the cold war and its events we are commemorating the cuban missile crisis as a nearmiraculous escape from a brush with nuclear holocaust we believe there were others , perhaps less close were there not enough sparks in the cold war to set off the explosion for which the stage was supposedly set in the dangerous world we inhabited in the opinion of both hawks and doves \? what were the luck and circumstances without which the world might have exploded 30 years ago , as you put it in the most dangerous days \( editorial , oct 15 \) \? they were then and throughout the years of the cold war the same neither of the cold war principals , contrary to their own misinformation , miscalculation and misjudgment , had a genuine need to engage the other in allout war neither was committed to any goal or purpose for which to fight an annihilating war against the other but what of miscalculations in tense situations \? could they not lead to unintended war \? nikita s khrushchev miscalculated on cuba so did john f kennedy they found themselves in a mess , but got themselves out of it because the threat of world war iii was just a cold war fantasy , which neither side wanted to become reality that could have been the lesson of the missile crisis , except that the cold war still had a quartercentury of life in it and trillions of dollars left to waste mark priceman larchmont , ny , oct 17 , 1992
phoenix , march 19 helping the world league of american football kick off its second season on solid footing , somehow finding a solution to the national football league s labor mess and preventing a court battle three months from now are the priorities for the nfl , commissioner paul tagliabue said today as the league owners concluded their annual meeting the world league , which opens saturday , has promised a better product this year and more return to the nfl owners for their investments by providing a stronger pool of players for nfl scouts tagliabue said those expectations were realistic maybe we 're still building the first story of a threestory house in terms of the league s quality of play and appeal , tagliabue said of the world league i 've talked to nfl personnel who are surprised at some of the players they sent to the league who were cut maybe that s an indication of the growing strength of the league , but we 're going to have to wait and see as for labor peace , there appears to be no quick solution the nfl has not had a collectivebargaining agreement with the players since 1982 , chiefly because the players have demanded free agency and the owners have balked that is why the players hope to resolve their differences in the freeman mcneil case , which is scheduled to begin on june 15 tagliabue said behindthescenes negotiations leave him hopeful that an agreement can be reached before the trial the commissioner also had comments on the following issues tv contract the league has tabled until march 30 in dallas discussions on whether to give a 210 million rollback to the networks and extend the current tv contract two years through 1995 tagliabue favors the move to help the networks and said that only four or five clubs flatly oppose the deal new england patriots the league is waiting for patriots majority owner victor kiam to decide whether he will accept an offer to purchase the team from st louis businessman james b orthwein tagliabue has endorsed the deal and said that , in any event , the patriots would remain in new england instant replay the owners' decision not to renew the instantreplay rule for the 1992 season makes it hard for the commissioner to say whether replays will ever return to me , the most significant part of the replay decision is we 've restored a level of input and significance to the officials in our game , he said noncelebratory rules last year the league tried to crack down on player celebrations , dances and taunting tagliabue said he would tend to be more lenient for celebrations after a score and offer more restraint and penalties on player celebrations and taunting during the flow of a game or a drive tagliabue wanted instant replay continued , wanted the tv deal approved and hoped to have more encouraging news on the labor front none of that happened here how is he being judged in his third year as commissioner \? some say i will be judged as the labor commissioner , some say as the replay commissioner and others as the world league , international football commissioner i do n't know i leave that up to others to decide
eighty minutes the length of a marx brothers movie playing time for a women s quarterfinal at wimbledon and now the number of minutes it takes for the rangers to lose eric lindros to the philadelphia flyers , and to sabotage their next decade for the rangers , 80 minutes on the morning of june 20 will grow into something much more , much longer , over the next 10 or 15 seasons those minutes will come to symbolize lost momentum , lost opportunity , and just plain losing the philadelphia flyers traded for lindros at 10 30 on that frenzied morning in montreal the rangers traded for him at 11 50 , with a phone call between two harried executives , stanley jaffe of paramount and marcel aubut of the quebec nordiques sorry , said an arbitrator first trade counts aubut has a history of such carelessness he was cited in 1982 by the league for tampering , and he once traded an allegedly injured wilf paiement to the rangers in 1986 aubut can be a slippery customer , but he does not change the hands on the clock if paramount had been 80 minutes more aggressive , 80 minutes less bureaucratic , it could have made a very smart business deal , and a critically important hockey decision instead , ranger management has problems on and off the ice , none of them packing up to go anywhere before next season there is , to begin with , the question of image last season , general manager neil smith was able to acquire mark messier , and the rangers posted the best regularseason record in the national hockey league this was nice , but ultimately it was not enough the rangers were beaten badly by the pittsburgh penguins , who were without the injured mario lemieux there is good reason to think the rangers would also have been defeated by washington if the capitals had been given a fair chance at their personal patsies in new york ranger fans have every right to ask themselves existential questions about the coming regular season , which is now expanded to 84 games from 80 basically , what is the point of it all \? to defend the president s trophy \? to get a glimpse at peter andersson , the new swedish defenseman \? if there had been a lindros , there would have been a reason to come to the garden for that midseason game against hartford or san jose there would have been this strapping , brassy teenager , no 88 , who idolized mark messier growing up and had all these outrageous things to say on almost any topic paul bunyan with an attitude , and his hockey stick , babe the kid would have made great ink that much was obvious to those who watched lindros trade barbs with the legendary russian coach , viktor tikhonov , at the olympics in meribel , france lindros , playing center for canada , took the tough checks from the unified team , then skated over to tikhonov on the bench and pointed to the number on his own jersey how dare you \? lindros was saying i do n't speak russian , so i do n't know what he said , lindros said of his encounter i used the universal language paramount , the entertainment company , should know about boxoffice appeal if you can get schwarzenegger , you do n't settle for chuck norris it is a new year , and the rangers are without a new attraction smith might yet make a major trade , excusing john vanbiesbrouck from his purgatory to obtain another solid scorer smith might hire a new coach he will press hard to bring aleksei kovalev , the draft pick from moscow , into training camp but the newcomers will not be lindros at meribel , kovalev danced along the boards and swooped in nifty circles but he ducked the body checks , never went to the net like lindros , and he always listened to what tikhonov said kovalev , if reports were accurate , nearly became a nordique in the deal so did tony amonte , who can no longer view the ranger uniform with the same sort of innocence and dedication beyond such lingering morale problems , there is the matter of winning a stanley cup , the silver trophy that was recently renovated and is now bereft of a single , engraved ranger name from glorious , fading 1940 the rangers' chief strength at the moment is their depth , a positive trait that wins regularseason titles but has little to do with the playoffs they have two good goaltenders and five 30goal scorers but messier is a year older mike gartner is a year older this team needed another young superstar for april and may , an injection of foolish optimism lindros might not have matured in time to peak alongside messier and gartner but he would have been there with brian leetch and mike richter in five years , the nucleus of a potential dynasty paramount has streams of money , and in the national hockey league that means the rangers will be able to buy their share of greatness for many years to come it would have been more fun , however , to watch a young man with bold , flawed skills grow into a star in front of us new york does n't usually get that chance at discovery its sports teams traffic in used superstars , who arrive with portfolio but without the hunger eighty minutes in montreal might have changed that , and made up for a few of those 52 years
as in most election years , poll takers had their own ups and downs during the 1992 presidential race most came within two or three percentage points of predicting the margins by which gov bill clinton would beat president bush and ross perot in fact , most major poll takers came within one point of mr clinton s percentage of the vote but earlier in the year there were some total misses by poll takers , as well as some inexplicable readings one of the significant misses occurred during the new hampshire primary in february , when some surveys of voters leaving polling places , the socalled exit polls used by news organizations to predict eventual outcome , indicated that patrick j buchanan , the conservative columnist , would run stronger against president bush than he actually did late surge questioned as for puzzling readings of voter preferences during the year , none stirred more debate than two polls by the gallup organization over the weekend of oct 2829 , one for newsweek , the other for cnn and usa today they indicated that president bush was making a late surge and had closed to within one to two points of mr clinton most other polls at that point were showing a spread at least twice that large , and many poll takers questioned the timing of the gallup sampling and the composition and breadth of its sample the gallup organization insisted it had detected a genuine bush surge , even if the surge eventually fell back overall , the performance of poll takers this year compared favorably with their projections in 1988 , when they also came within two or three points of predicting the winning margin their 1992 performance was slightly better than their 1980 performance , when some missed the final spread by as much as seven points , and better still than in 1984 , when some missed by as much as eight points the year of the poll this has been a polling year with some bad things but also some good things , said martin wattenberg , a political scientist at the university of california at san diego who specializes in public opinion surveys there were too many polls , many of them not carefully done early on , they indicated ross perot was a real player , when in fact the voters being polled did n't really know anything about him on the other hand , this was the year that a lot of news organizations finally began to run the results of other polls with the results of their own polls that provided people with some badly needed context in the end , five of six major polls , exhibiting unusual agreement , indicated at the end that mr clinton would win 44 percent of the vote the sixth predicted 43 percent his final margin 43 percent most polls predicted that mr bush would get from 35 to 38 percent of the final vote his final figure 38 percent people like to criticize us , but i think poll takers had a remarkably good year , said frank newport , the president of the gallup organization

two researchers at a new jersey chemical company this week patented what they say is a simple and effective treatment for acne that offers none of the side effects of antibiotics and could probably be sold without a prescription the active ingredient is hydrogen peroxide , the familiar antibacterial compound used in treating cuts and other injuries hydrogen peroxide is not new as a treatment for acne , but until now it has been combined with chemicals like benzene to keep it from decomposing rapidly some experts have recently begun to worry that trace elements of these other chemicals could pose safety problems the new compound was invented at international specialty products inc in wayne , nj , formerly the chemical business of the gaf corporation it combines the hydrogen peroxide with a polymer called polyvinylpyrrolidone , or pvp , which is widely used as a binding agent in pills and tablets the result is a solid form of hydrogen peroxide , a white powder that can then be mixed with a cream or gel according to the inventors , the new compound creates an invisible film that kills the acnecausing bacteria for hours at a time john j merianos and michael w helioff , chemists at the company , received patent 5 , 122 , 370
ginger ale has an image problem older people drink it you mix it with rye or bourbon , drinks of a bygone age ginger ale is served in hospitals , not mod bars ask someone the last time they had a sip as often as not , it was years ago , lying in bed with an upset stomach these are not exactly the sort of associations soft drink marketers hire michael jackson or elton john to create yet one of the few signs of life in the slowgrowing soft drink business is the market for socalled new age beverages , which include natural sodas , flavored sparkling waters and sparkling juice drinks it is also a category ginger ale makers desperately are trying to be a part of the new age drinks are generally less sweet and lighter in both taste and appearance than the colas that have long dominated the soft drink business while sales of the new age drinks are tiny , about 550 million in the 48 billion soft drink business , they are growing by a robust 15 percent a year , compared with the overall soft drink business s meager 2 percent also , the new age drinks appeal to older consumers but with sales of 327 million last year , ginger ale represented less than 1 percent of soft drink sales that kind of growth has sent all beverage companies feverishly searching for new types of drinks last month , pepsi cola introduced a clear cola , crystal pepsi , expressly to appeal to alternative beverage drinkers with its spicy bite and light taste , ginger ale is a natural contender for the changing consumer tastes they have one of the best flavor profiles out there , said william vick , an expert in flavoring with international flavor fragrance , which produces flavoring ingredients it s a good flavor for our times herein lies the quandary facing marketers of ginger ale while its flavor is perfect for the times , its image needs some industrialstrength burnishing of all the carbonated beverages i can think of , there is none that is more underdeveloped from a marketing standpoint , said george rosenbaum , chief executive of leo j shapiro associates , a market research firm in chicago the king of ginger ale cadbury owns both major brands cadbury schweppes plc , is out to change ginger ale s image as the world s largest seller of ginger ale , it is the only large beverage company that truly cares about ginger ale through sales of its canada dry brand , which it acquired in 1987 from rjr nabisco inc , and its schweppes ginger ale the company accounts for about half the ginger ale sold in the united states its nearest competitors are privatelabel store brands dominic cadbury , chief executive of cadbury , admits that ginger ale should be a bigger force in the market it was a marketing failure that allowed ginger ale to be positioned as on old person s drink , he said our task has been to reposition ginger ale as a much more contemporary product repositioning a product is a huge task ask prune growers , who have been struggling to cast a new image for prunes for the past five years prune growers have tremendous sympathy for the ginger ale marketers as a marketer , i would say they have some of the same sort of forgotten product issues that we had , said robert swensen , vice president of marketing for sunsweet growers , a large prune company in california as if to reinforce the point , he added , i like ginger ale , but i do n't consider it while cadbury has yet to concoct a prune flavored brew , it has begun adding flavors to ginger ale to attract new drinkers a few months ago , canada dry introduced a cranberry flavored ginger ale in new england the product is doing well and has already been copied by several grocery store companies that have introduced their own lines of cranberry ginger ale a blank slate lots of flavors can be added ginger ale , because of its light taste , is considered a good flavor carrier you can do a lot with it , said mr vick , the flavoring expert cadbury has two other flavors schweppes raspberry ginger ale , introduced in 1988 , and canada dry lemon ginger ale , introduced in 1989 the wide availability of flavors caused ginger ale sales to jump by 82 percent last year , according to information resources inc , a market research firm in chicago the firm measures grocery store sales it really breathed life into the whole category , said ken romanzi , vice president of strategic planning for cadbury beverages in north america some of the growth last year was people trying out the new flavors , and mr romanzi said he was not sure that sales would continue to grow at such a brisk clip in addition to attracting new drinkers , the flavors are also encouraging younger drinkers to try ginger ale drinkers of flavored ginger ale are younger than the average ginger ale sipper , cadbury says teenagers drink about 75 gallons of soft drinks a year , compared with 48 for the average consumer mr romanzi , however , acknowledged that teenagers are unlikely to ever be heavy drinkers of ginger ale , which means it will always remain a niche product more than a mixer selling the brew as a soft drink
allen grubman , one of the most powerful lawyers in the recording industry , yesterday denied charges brought two weeks ago by the singer billy joel in a 90 million lawsuit he contended mr joel s suit was libelous and contrived and called it an effort to extort a settlement in a suit filed in new york state supreme court on sept 23 , mr joel charged , among other allegations , that mr grubman and his firm , grubman , indursky , schindler goldstein , which represented the singer between 1981 and 1988 , had breached its fiduciary responsibility by paying kickbacks to frank weber , who was then both mr joel s business manager and brotherinlaw the suit also maintained that mr grubman had violated his responsibilities as a lawyer by representing both mr joel and cbs records , with whom mr joel s lawyers were then negotiating mr joel seeks 30 million in compensatory damages and another 60 million in punitive damages conflict of interest discounted in yesterday s response filed with the court , mr grubman said that he had worked for cbs toward the end of the period during which he represented mr joel but that he was employed by cbs in matters unrelated to mr joel there was no conflict and certainly none adverse to joel , the filing said at the core of the charges is the allegation that mr grubman knew mr weber was not acting in mr joel s best interest and as mr joel s lawyer should have told mr joel mr joel s filing charged , for example , that mr weber had put pressure on mr grubman and his partner arthur indursky to pay him kickbacks to keep mr joel as a client mr joel s lawyers said that these payments came to light last may when during an fbi investigation of mr weber , who filed for bankruptcy three years ago , the fbi interviewed mr grubman mr joel s suit charges that the value of checks paid from personal accounts of mr grubman and mr indursky totaled 127 , 000 documents filed yesterday do not deny that the defendants paid mr weber but they argue that the payments were for mr weber s personal financial and investment planning services because mr grubman and mr indursky told the fbi they could not remember what the payments were for , mr joel contended that no such consulting was done and that the checks constituted kickbacks to mr weber , who set fees mr joel paid to the law firm in his response , mr grubman said that because the fbi investigation took place 10 years after the payments were made , he and his partner did not immediately recall what those services were while the documents acknowledge that mr grubman and mr indursky invested other funds in a series of mr weber s tax shelters under pressure from mr weber , the papers argue that they invested to make money , as did a number of other toplevel record executives , and ultimately lost twothirds of their investment the case has attracted wide attention within the record industry , where mr grubman represents both executives and artists public relations representatives have been hired by both sides and associates of mr grubman have publicly commented on his behalf irving azoff , chairman of giant records , said yesterday , one reason talent hires allen is that he does have relationships with companies he added that the music industry is too small a community to find someone that has no conflict he said , that person has no perspective for knowing what a deal should be
the la mama experimental theater club , a downtown theater institution for 30 years , may soon close its doors i do n't see how we can go past the end of march , said ellen stewart , the founder and director of the theater institution , which is known simply as la mama and has played a major role in the establishment of off broadway theater in new york city i should be closed now unable to raise the 150 , 000 she needs to finish the season , which ends on june 30 , ms stewart is contemplating closing the theater complex , possibly forever we 'll close until we can pay our creditors , ms stewart said yesterday but i do n't know when that s going to be i do n't have any promises for the future who has dealt the blows ms stewart said la mama had been hurt by cuts in grants from the new york state council on the arts and the national endowment for the arts we 've had a 60 percent cut in our nysca money and a 16 percent endowment cut the rockefeller foundation continues to support us we get a small grant from philip morris the ford foundation gives us nothing we ca n't even get an interview there we 've never got much money from corporate foundations they simply do n't fund places like us this year la mama is getting 200 , 000 from the endowment and 79 , 000 from the state council the closing of la mama might seem inconceivable to those who cut their off broadway teeth at the theater , seeing plays by such authors as sam shepard , lanford wilson , harvey fierstein and andre serban , as well as writers like tom eyen , rochelle owens and tom o'horgan , who helped define the rowdy , influential alternative theater of the 1960 s mr fierstein s torch song trilogy opened at la mama , as did godspell and the blue man group s tubes at la mama , it was possible to see performers like robert de niro , richard dreyfuss , danny devito , f murray abraham and jill clayburgh before they became household names there was an emphasis , too , on international theater , in a tradition that will continue this month with an italian production of the golem , in italian and yiddish , and a korean theater company ms stewart talks with typical fervor of those productions , but then reality seeps back into the conversation we have enormous insurance and enormous con ed bills , she said , adding that insurance costs run 48 , 000 a year and con edison about 60 , 000 for a 10month year the la mama payroll is 5 , 500 a week , which covers 21 people who work in a gallery , rehearsal and office space and 3 theaters , all housed in 4 buildings spread out over the lower east side in addition to artists' fees , there are telephone and supply bills to be met , she added , as well as payments on a small mortgage on one of the buildings , and the company s real deficit , which ms stewart puts at about 176 , 000 we 've gone deeper , and deeper , and deeper , she said one problem , ms stewart said , is that people seem to expect la mama just to keep going on its own honey , we 've tried , she said but we just do n't fit what people expect we 've been living on skin before these cuts but i do n't have any more money that i can dump into la mama another problem is that to a great extent , la mama has remained the kind of seatofthepants artistic operation that it was in earlier , easier economic times , and its freewheeling style is no longer possible in the business of theater where it all began ms stewart is uncharacteristically bitter these days the city has made concessions to the public theater and the brooklyn academy of music , she says , asking only symbolic rents from them for cityowned buildings they occupy , but has made none to la mama on its cityowned space few offers of support have come from the stars who came out of the theater , though they have been approached by the friends of la mama it hurts , ms stewart said la mama had its roots in a tiny basement theater on east ninth street , as a place where new playwrights could show their work and where directors could experiment the inspiration for the venture came , ms stewart said , from a comment by a lower east side merchant who befriended her in her early days in the city she had come to new york in the 1950 s to study fashion design , training she said was closed to her as a black back home in chicago one sunday , she found herself walking along delancey street , where this little man came out of his store wearing something black on his head , she recalled i did n't know it was a yarmulke he wanted to sell me something i told him i did n't have any money his name was abraham diamond , and he took her into his store to talk soon there were regular sunday visits with his family and gifts of exquisite french fabric he 'd take me all over the neighborhood , ms stewart said i was his daughter the designer mr diamond , who had started as a pushcart vendor , told her she needed a pushcart of her own 'but do n't push it for yourself , push it for someone else , ' ms stewart recalls him saying and so the theater became ms stewart s pushcart , she said there were no rules in the theater , i 've always felt we should never be bound to a stage , to being understood through any one language , ms stewart continued i always felt there were other ways to communicate
washington , dec 10 presidentelect bill clinton said today that despite a bush administration investigation that found no criminal wrongdoing in a bank fraud case involving loans to iraq he still believed that there was more to be discovered about what happened mr clinton said that after he took office he would consult with his attorney general to decide whether to ask the courts to name an independent prosecutor to examine allegations that bush administration officials covered up efforts to help iraq build up its military in the years before the invasion of kuwait the law that provides for the appointment of such special prosecutors expires next week , and mr clinton said today he would support its early reenactment , making it a virtual certainty asked at a news conference in little rock , ark , about the bush administration s decision not to seek an independent prosecutor in the case , mr clinton replied i certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know what i intend to do is to appoint an attorney general and get a recommendation on it of the special prosecutor law , he said i think it should be reenacted and i will support that mr clinton s comments come one day after a special counsel appointed by the justice department concluded there was no criminal wrongdoing the special counsel , frederick b lacey , a retired federal judge , scornfully dismissed accusations by critics in congress and elsewhere that officials may have stifled criminal investigations of loans made to iraq by the atlanta branch of an italian bank , banca nazionale del lavoro but rather than lay to rest the issue of whether bush administration officials engaged in wrongdoing in the case , mr lacey s report appears to have only spurred fresh suspicions judge lacey sought by both his conclusions and the brusque air of certitude with which he delivered them to put an end to congressional demands for a judicially appointed independent prosecutor to investigate the government s behavior but a variety of people , including marvin h shoob , the federal judge who began hearing a criminal case involving the bank , and several members of congress today sharply criticized the lacey report , which was used by attorney general william p barr as the basis for rejecting an independent prosecution mr barr , who is opposed to the independent counsel system , demonstrated consistency on the issue today , rejecting another call for an outside inquiry , this one sought by republicans on the senate judiciary committee who wanted a courtappointed prosecutor to investigate lawrence e walsh , the iran contra independent counsel judge is disappointed judge shoob said in an interview that he was disappointed in the recommendations of the lacey report i strongly feel that an independent prosecutor would be appropriate in this case , not necessarily to indict or prosecute but to get to the bottom of the matter , he said one of the issues in the case involved the prosecution by the united states attorney in atlanta of christopher drogoul , the manager of the local branch of the italian bank mr drogoul was charged with fraud for making sizable unsecured loans to iraq without the knowledge of his superiors in rome but at a tumultuous court hearing before judge shoob in september , it was disclosed that the central intelligence agency knew and withheld information that the italian managers were aware of the loans and thus could not have been defrauded much of the speculation has been about whether officials at the cia and justice department sought to limit the investigation out of fear of embarrassing the italian government , which was closely tied to the bank judge shoob said today that he felt he had been misled by the cia and the justice department representative henry b gonzalez , a texas democrat who has pressed the idea of a coverup and who was criticized by judge lacey on wednesday as having made uninformed attacks , responded today in a way that demonstrated the harsh feelings generated by the bank affair i'm not going to get into a micturition contest with a skunk , he said , using a word for urination congressional staff members also said today that some lawmakers were considering summoning judge lacey to testify before congress about his conclusions the limited scope of the lacey inquiry was the principal target of critics of the bush administration , some of whom said the inquiry was narrowly focused , superficial and driven to completion by artificial deadlines because the report deals narrowly with the issues surrounding the atlanta case , many of the critical questions about united states policies toward iraq remain unanswered some congressional committees are investigating whether the government used a network of companies , some financed by the atlanta bank , as conduits for illegal arms sales to iraq some lawmakers have said that despite investigations around the country none of the companies have ever been charged with violating export laws and documents released today in connection with the lacey report show that federal prosecutors in atlanta are investigating allegations that a former official of the agriculture department was seeking bribes from companies doing business with iraq under a department program representative charles e schumer , a queens democrat on the banking and judiciary committees who has been pressing for an independent counsel , said that the report was a whitewash and that he expected the clinton administration to move swiftly to select an independent prosecutor
if the national transportation safety board determines that ice on the wing caused the crash of usair flight 405 last week , it could prompt fundamental changes in how aircraft are inspected before takeoff , how they are deiced and even how they are dispatched to the runway the federal aviation administration has a simple rule on icing now the pilot is responsible for checking for it , and is not to takeoff until all critical components of the aircraft are free of adhering snow , frost or other ice formations even at the thickness and roughness of a sheet of sandpaper , ice on an aircraft s wing can cut its lift by a third but despite the potential danger , there is no universal rule on how ice should be detected and removed or what precautions should be taken to keep ice from forming while a plane is taxiing on a congested runway in freezing rain or snow pressure for new standards the crash at la guardia airport last week , which caused 27 deaths , could pressure the faa to write rigid standards on dealing with icing those standards might govern formulas for antiice fluids methods of inspecting planes the time that can elapse between deicing and takeoff how close deicing equipment should be to runways , and ways to shorten taxiing time for deiced planes such standards have been debated extensively in the aviation industry in the last few years but some experts say the usair crash could spur the faa to incorporate new standards into federal regulations , which carry the force of law i am certain that it will generate new interest in this , said john enders , president of the flight safety foundation , a nonprofit educational organization financed largely by the aviation industry there is ongoing activity here , and i am sure it is going to heat up the sad fact is that it is after accidents that the intensity comes into play an official at the air line pilots association , the union representing pilots , said he believed that the crash at la guardia could provide the impetus for procedural changes backed up by faa regulations the union has long argued for two changes to have planes held at the gate and deiced only when they are assured of taking off quickly , and where that is impossible , to have deicing equipment on the runway so that planes can be cleaned after they have finished taxiing the association is also pushing for the mandatory use of type ii deicing fluid , which adheres to airplanes better than the type i mixture of antifreeze and hot water that was used on flight 405 and that is widely used across the united states flight 405 was deiced twice , the last time a halfhour before attempting to take off although the copilot has told federal investigators that he looked out the cockpit window to check for ice and saw none , some passengers said they saw ice on the wing after previous aircraft accidents , various icing regulations have been proposed , but the faa has stuck with what it calls its clean aircraft concept an faa advisory handbook on the subject contains page after page of discussion and offers examples of generally accepted industry practice , but the handbook does not carry the force of regulations and it states again and again that it is up to the pilot in command of a plane to decide whether it is safe to take off the faa leaves to the pilot s discretion whether to inspect for ice from the cockpit , or from inside the cabin , or to call on an airport worker on the ground it has declined to impose a time limit between deicings , saying that there are too many variables in what causes ice to set a meaningful rule but in one exception , the agency recently required physical inspections for ice of certain dc9 s after a series of accidents suggested that this model of plane was especially vulnerable to ice other planes , including the fokker f28 that crashed last week , are inspected visually , even though the f28 shares many design features with the dc9 and also has a history of icing crashes a similar crash of a f28 in dryden , ontario , three years ago prompted canadian authorities last week to recommend spot checks of such planes at the end of runways just before take off the recommendations also asked for research into devices like remotecontrol cameras to allow pilots to see ice more easily training for flight attendants to teach them to inspect for ice from the cabin windows deicing equipment at the end of the runways , rather than at the gates the use of type ii deicing fluid , and improved air traffic control procedures , including gate holds , to minimize taxiing time after planes are deiced at gates a common practice in the military in this country is to post an inspector in a cherry picker to visually and physically check the surfaces of every plane that takes off , in part because aircraft carrying bombs already require crews at the end of the runway to arm the aircraft the air line pilots association s suggestion that icing be carried out at the end of the runway , perhaps in a carwashlike structure set up for that purpose , is already in practice at the united parcel service hub in louisville , ky but it may not be practical at many airports , for example , those that have limited space , and those that seldom deal with icing one of the most difficult changes to implement , especially at congested airports , would be to smooth the flow of planes to the runway from the gate , where they are typically deiced it is not always practical to hold planes at the gate , because arriving aircraft need to pull up to empty gates the problem is more difficult at large hub airports like chicago s o'hare , where airlines transfer passengers from plane to plane
los angeles , april 30 the los angeles police , apparently caught off guard by the violent reaction to the acquittal of four white officers in the beating of a black motorist , were slow to react , even after the scope of the anarchy sweeping the city had become apparent as unruly demonstrators threatened to invade police headquarters downtown early wednesday evening , chief of police daryl f gates was attending an event in the affluent brentwood area , about 11 miles away , to raise money to fight a proposal on the june ballot to limit the term of the police chief matthew hunt , the deputy chief in charge of the affected area , was attending a community meeting about 6 miles from the police command center it was hours before the police entered many of the areas in southcentral los angeles where stores were being looted and motorists were being dragged from their cars and beaten chief resisted national guard as late as 11 pm , with at least two dozen fires blazing out of control , chief gates resisted mayor tom bradley s call for national guard troops , telling gov pete wilson in a conference call with the mayor that he was not sure the police needed help handling the situation , according to someone who is close to mayor bradley and who spoke on the condition of anonymity the mayor prevailed with the governor , and by this morning mr gates agreed that the guard was needed but the first contingent , about 2 , 400 guardsmen , including 100 military police , was not deployed on the streets until midafternoon today the governor traced the delay in part to a shortage of ammunition fires burned unattended similarly , the los angeles fire department , had no special contingency plan apart from declaring a tactical alert , meaning engine companies moved in special teams the department was forced to let many fires burn unattended , not because it lacked sufficient engines at first but because the police did not have enough officers to protect firefighters there were barely enough officers on hand to prevent parker center , the police headquarters downtown , from being overrun the slow response was due in part to the fact that almost nobody , including the mayor , anticipated such a sweeping acquittal of all four officers and partly because the police department , as targets of minority animosity , tried to avoid seeming provocative the police apparently gambled that restraint would result in less violence than an aggressive show of force but by the time they mounted a more intense response , rioting , looting and burning had spread beyond containment mr gates today conceded that the police should have moved faster quite frankly , we were overwhelmed , he said at a news conference at city hall this morning i wish it had been much faster , but it was not we think we were as ready as we ought to be we did not want it to appear that we were overreacting we were very , very careful not to show that provocativeness the police department had devised several contingency plans for the verdict s aftermath but apparently none that anticipated the speed and breadth of the violence we were overwhelmed from the beginning , said jesse brewer , a former deputy chief of police who is now a member of the police commission , the body appointed by the mayor to oversee police department policies he fought the watts riots in 1965 , and said this one was vastly different because it broke out in so many places the police mobilization began slowly after the first signs of unrest a tactical alert was issued at 6 45 , meaning that all 18 police divisions were notified that they might have to provide up to half their force to combat disorders the first thrown into the fray was the metropolitan division , an elite citywide unit with special training in crowd control they were suddenly used up , chief gates said today the fullscale mobilization did not start until 7 30 , after demonstrators rushed parker center and started to vandalize buildings and vehicles downtown under a mobilization , officers are recalled from their homes and placed on 12hour shifts routine police tasks like taking accident reports are halted at city hall and parker center alike , the general assumption had been that the jury would return at least one or two guilty verdicts and that that would be enough to prevent unrest in any case , it was assumed that trouble would start after dark , not during the afternoon 'drastic' verdict not expected given the sensitivity , there was the desire to avoid provoking , said stanley k sheinbaum , president of the police commission and nobody in the first instance expected a verdict as drastic and extreme as this one interestingly , it is mr gates whose critics accuse him of fostering a climate of police brutality and racism that led to the beating of rodney g king who is in charge of quelling the riots but even his detractors say mr gates may have exactly the kind of experience needed for this kind of job , having cut his teeth as a commander in the watts riot and having invented the special weapons and tactics \( swat \) concept adopted by police departments nationwide to apply overwhelming force to dangerous situations
as president i 'd have television kick the lawyers out of prime time and put back cowboys in the 1950 s when america was on top of the world , television had almost nothing but cowboys now television has lawyers up to here , and america is not on top of the world , though it could be if it stopped acting like a drunken riot on the street corner and went for dignity and selfrespect i do n't necessarily blame tv lawyers for america s descent into squalor i merely point out that it did n't go that route as long as the cowboy ruled the tube and the tube , after all , is where we learn how to live our lives nowadays there are so many lawyers in prime time that you can be finicky in choosing one i know a woman so addicted to tv divorce lawyers that she no longer watches la law unless arnie the divorce lawyer is the center of the hour arnie , as you may not know if you shun divorce lawyers in favor of public defenders or bond lawyers , is a poor model for a nation that needs to lift its gaze from the mire his is a dreary form of human corruption the conviction that a little sleaziness is not only human , but also slightly charming this was the kind of stuff of which matt dillon , back in the 1950 s , purged dodge city week after week prime time was unknown in marshal dillon s america it was n't needed thanks to all those hipholstered , cayusestraddling straightshooters , children and even grandmothers could tune in safely at any hour under the hard cowboy discipline , even a tv cop like sgt joe friday minded his manners , politely addressing women as ma'am if he were back on the force today , friday s commendable civility would probably make him the butt of other tv cops' cruel jokes , just as howard s gentlemanly style made the other cops on hill street blues treat him like an imbecile whenever there is a display of politeness or good manners in today s lawyerdominated television , the purpose is usually to suggest either a dumb comic innocence or a feebleminded inability to adapt to social realities the social realities , of course , are assumed to be vulgar , meretricious , corrupt and possibly bestial , and anybody capable of the routine decencies is assumed to be ridiculously ill equipped to deal with them big boffolas on the laugh track will drive home the point that a cop saying , just the facts , ma'am , can only be a nerd one of the best modern tv cops , mick of hill street blues , was given to addressing particularly loathsome felons as dog breath this , doubtless , contributed to the authenticity of the show , but not to the viewer s grasp of decorous conversation much as i admired mick s truly fine character , i think he would have felt ashamed about speaking so coarsely on tv if marshal dillon had been around to give him that cold , disgusted eye and say remember , mick , america is watching us to learn how to live its life you do n't want your mom to think she s out of date because she does n't talk nasty and ugly like tv people , do you \? so , as president , i 'd have the tv bosses into the white house and tell them about the civility gap , or the manners crisis , or the politeness shortage i 'd have my campaign handlers \( wordsmith division \) come up with a suitable earpleaser to make the public worried about the rising tide of rudeness i 'd say tv sure would be doing america a mighty big favor if they canceled a bunch of lawyers and got some cowboys back in the old telesaddle again , back where a horse is a friend and a cowboy calls a woman miss kitty instead of well , never mind that and none of those modern cowboys either , because america already knew more than it needed about sadism , sodomy and rape i 'd want the kind of cowboys who 'd run arnie out of dodge fast if he did n't clean up his act after the tv people refused , i 'd call in some lawyers of my own and , like any normal american educated by television , i 'd say i want that tv mob leaned on hard i want them leaned on until you can hear their stinking guts gurgling for mercy i want them leaned on until they put cowboys back in the parlor so we can save america from heroes so vile that they can say stinking guts gurgling' in polite company , order hired guns to lean on people , and cheapen our noble law by calling its agents 'hired guns'

pittsburgh , may 14 the number on his back , 68 , is unique in the national hockey league , but that is n't the only distinctive thing about jaromir jagr there is also the mop of hair flowing from the back of his helmet and flopping in the manmade breeze it is a hairstyle that might remind people of the year 1968 , four years before jagr was born in kladno , czechoslovakia his number , jagr said , is about history in czech and it s a number i like , said jagr , the pittsburgh penguins right wing who is emerging in these stanley cup playoffs as a marquee performer in the national hockey league jagr scored the winning goals in both game 5 and game 6 of the secondround series with the rangers , won by pittsburgh four games to two he also scored on a penalty shot in game 5 and he has six goals and eight assists in 13 playoff games with mario lemieux still idled by a broken hand , jagr is the most dynamic offensive threat for the penguins , who open their thirdround series with the boston bruins on sunday night in pittsburgh at the age of 20 , jagr is finishing his second season in the league and in north america in many ways , he represents hockey s new ice age as communism crumbled in the former soviet union and its allied nations , jagr was one of about a dozen new kids from the bloc to immigrate to north america back in 1968 , czechoslovakia and the soviet union had plenty of good hockey players , but none of them played in the nhl although allies , prague was more liberal than moscow after reformers tried to change the system during the prague spring of 1968 , the warsaw pact nations , led by the soviet union , invaded czechoslovakia and crushed the movement it is a chapter of modern history that czechoslovak parents teach their children jaromir \( pronounced yaromir \) loves his country he did n't come here to get away from it , said michael barnett , his agent he came here for hockey barnett refers to him by the nickname jags , which is pronounced yoggs when jagr \( pronounced yahger \) was a boy , he went to a junior tournament and saw the teenage lemieux , then playing for canada from then on , he modeled his style after lemieux , who blends size and strength in a finesse game of skating , passing and shooting although lemieux is a righthanded center and jagr is a lefthanded right wing , there are many similarities lemieux s number is 66 , two digits lower than jagr s lemieux is taller than most hockey players at 6 feet 4 inches jagr is 62 lemieux is heavy for a hockey player at 210 pounds jagr is 208 a sign in the civic arena wednesday night pointed out another eerie similarity it scrambled the letters of jagr s first name to say jaromir mario jr lemieux is like a god to jagr , said jan smid , a correspondent for czechoslovak state radio who interviewed jagr at length on wednesday mario is like a teacher to him outside the ice as well halting english spoken here jagr s english skills are rapidly improving in english , he tends to give short answers , punctuated by smiles and giggles when complimented on his english , he replied with the trendy , not ! he turned serious only when someone mentioned another coach , bob johnson , who led the penguins to their first stanley cup championship last spring , but died of brain cancer last fall badger was best coach in my life , jagr said , pausing with emotion between words and describing johnson by a nickname he was number 1 then he smiled , and quickly shifted gears that s it guys , he said i'm tired of english the veterans on the penguins say he is n't as emotional as when he was a rookie gordie roberts , the 34yearold defenseman , said , right now , he s got so much innocence about him he even loves to practice , said roberts it s fun to see him in this state of mind right now in a couple years , when he is making bigger money , he will probably realize the game is a little more of a business than anything else barnett , the agent , said that jagr is making a little under 200 , 000 , which is a bargain for a player of his talent jagr , a firstround draft choice in 1990 , scored 32 goals and 37 assists in the regular season after posting totals of 27 and 30 in those categories in his rookie season he has a year left on the contract and one option season after that like many skilled players from europe , jagr is lightly penalized , with only 76 minutes in 150 regularseason games he served a 10game suspension last winter , however , for bumping referee ron hoggarth , a collision that jagr said was accidental it was a moment that may indicate a storm cloud on the horizon jagr and lemieux both charged that day that hoggarth was refusing to call penalties against washington capitals who were holding and hooking them jagr asserted that hoggarth told him that he would n't call penalties when european players are the victims of the fouls bryan lewis , the nhl s director of officiating , said today that he never heard of jagr s complaint against hoggarth the hoggarth incident was n't his only unhappy brush with authority general manager craig patrick has talked seriously to jagr about the speed at which he drives his black camaro police have given him tickets for two moving violations , barnett said thank goodness he consumes alchohol in moderation , barnett added applecheeked and babyfaced , jagr s visage does n't yet adorn advertisements , even in pittsburgh his teammates , however , notice other qualities he can carry a couple guys and walk around the net and still have control of the puck , said ulf samuelsson , the penguins' defenseman he is so strong his legs could be the strongest pair of legs i have ever seen on a hockey player he s going to be one of the top three players in the league in the next couple years paul stanton , another defenseman , calls jagr a mini version of mario he definitely does n't shy away from an uneasy situation when you need a goal , stanton said he likes the pressure he s not like a kid he is a kid the guys get on him about his hair and the funny things that he says and he gives it right back he s the kind of player people come to watch guys like him sell tickets photo in many ways , the penguins' jaromir jagr , who came to north america from czechoslovakia , represents hockey s new ice age \( r r sports group \)
one day after a hasidic jew was arrested in a gang beating of a homeless black man in crown heights , mayor david n dinkins traveled to the racially divided brooklyn neighborhood and once again found himself the target of hasidic anger leaders of the ultraorthodox lubavitcher hasidim bristled at the mayor s immediate denunciation of the attack , saying the black man had been a burglar , not a victim and mr dinkins , preaching racial tolerance to a group of children at a public library , was briefly confronted by an angry hasidic woman who compared him to a controversial black nationalist you are just as dangerous as farrakhan , screamed rosalyn malamud , referring to louis farrakhan , the nation of islam leader , whom many jews consider antisemitic the only difference is that you are an elected official , and you can cause me more harm an encounter in crown heights the mayor , whose impromptu sermon against bigotry was the latest in a recent campaign of racial healing , told her , you 're doing this for the cameras and after the distraught woman left he told reporters , i think it s sad and unfortunate she s uninformed he defended his statement on tuesday calling the beating of 25yearold ralph nimmons by 20 to 30 hasidic men repugnant , despite charges by some jewish groups that the mayor s statement was premature all i have said is that if this is a bias incident as the police have alleged it to be , i find it repugnant , mr dinkins said later in the day , moshe katzman , a 24yearold rabbinical student , was arraigned in brooklyn criminal court on charges that he was among the crowd that beat mr nimmons behind lubavitcher headquarters , hit him with a rock and a stick , and shouted epithets like black nigger dozens of hasidic men jammed the courtroom wearing yellow stars of david that were intended to recall the persecution of jews in nazi germany mr katzman , who was released on his own recognizance , was charged with assault in the second degree , as well as misdemeanor charges of discrimination , aggravated harassment , criminal possession of a weapon , and unlawful possession of mace the assault charge carries a maximum sentence of two and a third to seven years in prison his lawyer , george farkas , said outside the courtroom that his client would plead not guilty my client s defense is that he did n't do it , he said the incident has further inflamed racial tensions in crown heights , and comes a month after a black teenager was acquitted by a predominantly minority jury in the killing of yankel rosenbaum , a hasidic scholar , during racial disturbances in 1991 last night , the police recorded another bias incident in the neighborhood , saying that a 16yearold white student reported that a black teenager had tried to steal her purse about 5 pm outside the 71st precinct station house , and that when she resisted , he called her a jewish bitch the woman was unharmed , the police said , and the assailant fled racial tensions in crown heights threaten to turn into a political issue that could dominate next year s mayoral campaign by last night , the city council president , andrew j stein , an expected mayoral challenger , and mr dinkins s press secretary , leland t jones , had already traded press statements concerning the appropriateness of mr dinkins s statement on tuesday the beating and the arrest have also raised once again the grievances and volatile sentiments that have continually afflicted crown heights the black charges of hasidic racism and intolerance , and the hasidic concern about black crime and their perception that mr dinkins , the city s first black mayor , is insensitive to their concerns campaign promoting healing in the last few weeks , under harsh criticism by the lubavitcher leaders , mr dinkins has aggressively campaigned to defend his record of responding to disturbances in crown heights and to preach tolerance he continued that campaign yesterday , telling the 70 students , mostly black and caribbean , bigotry comes from ignorance do n't let anybody get you to look down on any other group of people other community leaders both black and hasidic joined the mayor at the event at the crown heights branch of the brooklyn public library , which had long been planned to open a new library computer center but quickly turned into a news conference about the latest incident city councilwoman una clarke , who is black , said , it is in our best interest to come together , to isolate those who are wrongdoers in our community she said that mr dinkins had been made a scapegoat for the outcome of the crown heights murder trial rabbi jacob z goldstein , the chairman of community board 9 , said , i'm dismayed by the fact that so many detectives can be found at a moment s notice , but for yankel rosenbaum no one was found police and prosecutors' descriptions of what occurred early tuesday morning in crown heights continued to differ significantly from the accounts of hasidic leaders maureen mccormick , an assistant district attorney , said mr nimmons had been on a walkway behind lubavitcher headquarters at 770 eastern parkway , and was met by a hasidic man who said he was going to hold him there she said that about 45 males came out of a nearby building and about 20 to 30 of them surrounded the man the police have at least two witnesses to the incident supporting mr nimmons account account of attack
angola , la , aug 13 two murderers were bidding farewell at the gate of the louisiana state penitentiary at angola , separated from the outside world by the dense thickets bordering the mississippi and by a combined 54 years of prison time i'm leaving you here , bud , said ron wikberg , a lanky , sadeyed man , newly freed after 23 years , his life term undone by a legal loophole he opened for himself glad to see you go , said his colleague , wilbert rideau , not so fortunate as he stayed behind in the 32d year of his life term have enough fun for me the parting on wednesday evening was remarkable for its terseness considering that the two men have been honored by the outside world as among the most articulate of the nation s prison inmates two professionalclass journalists who have won numerous awards for editing , reporting and publishing what is widely considered the best , freest and most unusual prison publication in america , a magazine called the angolite in the past 15 years , the two lifers , actively encouraged by one of the more progressive prison administrations in the nation , have produced the premier publication of prison muckraking in the process they changed many features of life at angola by producing pioneering exposes on prison rape , writing about aging and longforgotten lifers and getting them freed , seeing to the dismissal of an overly gleeful state executioner , and even ending the use of the electric chair itself at angola in favor of lethal injections they and their inmate staff achieved unusual press freedoms , and not only in eventually being free from editorial censorship by their keepers they are free to roam the 5 , 000inmate maximumsecurity prison with cameras and tape recorders they are free to make reporting trips accompanied by a single unarmed guard across the state in interviewing judges , prosecutors , criminals and victims , all the people in their stories of what is wrong and what is sad and what is worthy about legal justice in louisiana we 're two bad guys who did good , said mr wikberg , who at 49 years of age was departing angola in the most bittersweet mood imaginable he was heading off to the arms of his new wife , kay , a schoolteacher struck by his prison writings who came ever closer through letters and visits across the last four years but he was leaving behind his closest soulmate , mr rideau , one of the longest serving inmates in the state and the outspoken resident genius of the angolite at 50 , mr rideau is an anomaly , a prime example of a rehabilitated individual , one who learned to read and write during 13 years on death row , yet one who has repeatedly seen recommendations for gubernatorial clemency rejected when he was 19 , he murdered a hostage in a bank robbery whose ruthless details resurface three decades later with each annual recommendation for clemency and with each recounting of his success as a prison writer and reformer his celebrity behind bars has become a barrier to his ever being freed , says the one man who can ever free him , gov edwin w edwards i think he has effectively forever barred any possibility for clemency because of his own selfgenerated press , the governor once said in an interview with ann butler , a writer who interviewed him he was describing his dilemma over mr rideau , who has never written about his own case that s unfortunate because that should not be a consideration , said the governor , conceding a kind of the agonistes existence to mr rideau s remaining prison years in louisiana the state bars parole to lifetermers and leaves them to the mercies of a governor who is popularly elected and regularly receives recommendations against clemency from survivors of the rideau bank holdup it s a nowin situation for the politician , said mr wikberg , sympathizing as much with the governor as his prison friend and editor better to be unknown the history at angola of mr wikberg , who killed a grocery clerk in a holdup , has been quieter and steeped in careful detail , like his writings educated now as a paralegal , he championed his new freedom by attacking as a faulty expedient an old lifesentence law hurriedly enacted by the legislature after louisianna s capital punishment law was struck down two decades ago by the supreme court the key to getting out of prison is anonymity , said mr rideau in bidding his friend farewell he is so trusted an inmate that he was permitted to step outside angola under the casual gaze of a corrections officer to chat for an hour in saying goodbye to his friend in the hot afternoon sun you get your time , he said to mr wikberg you go serve it you keep your mouth shut , and four or five years later nobody knows who you are or what your crime was how long would it take me to become anonymous again \? he asked ten years \? it s too late writing and searching in any case , he told his departing friend , it was the writing and searching from within prison that put meaning into life even if it did cost them anonymity
rockville , md , feb 26 the dozens of upscale subdivisions , shopping centers , government complexes and office parks that carpet oncebucolic montgomery county , northwest of washington , are the main reason former senator paul e tsongas of massachusetts stands a good chance of winning this state s democratic presidential primary next tuesday mr tsongas , who needs a victory in maryland to demonstrate that his electoral appeal extends beyond new england , appeals most strongly to welleducated , welltodo voters , according to polls of participants in earlier primaries and this is the bestpaid , bestschooled county in the nation speaking at a rally on tuesday night in bethesda after gaining the endorsement of gov william donald schaefer , mr tsongas , who featured his probusiness stance in generally conservative new hampshire , shifted the emphasis to the left for a more liberal suburban audience he proclaimed his support for gay rights and called himself an economicgrowth liberal economy is chief issue maryland , which has grown rapidly in the last decade , has not suffered as much from the recession as other states unemployment stood at 68 percent last december , the same as the national rate but the defense and high technology industries , important to this county and the state , have been contracting rapidly , and construction is also in a protracted slump the economy is the chief issue only gov bill clinton of arkansas appears to stand much chance of beating mr tsongas here senator tom harkin of iowa has won the backing of some unions , but his weak showings in earlier tests have handicapped him here senator bob kerrey of nebraska , winner of this week s south dakota primary , is concentrating on colorado next week , as is former gov edmund g brown jr of california , who won a surprise victory in the maryland primary in 1976 but mr clinton and his strategists seem unable to make up their minds whether to risk a headon confrontation with mr tsongas after making elaborate plans here and involving scores of elected officials in his campaign , the arkansas governor decided the day after his loss in new hampshire to scale back the campaign days allotted to maryland from six to one , and to slash the money budgeted for television advertising , several of his backers in the state legislature his supporters protested the move an important endorsement then mr clinton decided to do more he swept into the state last saturday , picked up the endorsement of mayor kurt l schmoke of baltimore and promised he would be back he pledged not just a deal , but a solemn agreement to create new opportunity for workers in maryland and in the nation television ads have been broadcast , but mr clinton has not returned to the state his aides are starting to lower expectations , suggesting that the real test on tuesday will be in georgia , where mr clinton is strongest this kind of straddle wo n't work , said nathan landow , the party chairman in maryland they 've made a substantial effort here , and if clinton loses he ca n't claim that he s passed in this state there s a great opportunity here for him , but tsongas has picked up support rapidly in the last week mr landow calls the maryland balloting the first freestanding primary , because none of the candidates comes from this state or from the region as such , he said , this is a place where someone can demonstrate his electability , which is what the democrats want tsongas leads in survey brad coker , who heads masondixon opinion research , a polling firm in columbia , md , agreed that mr clinton could win maryland and possibly deal a decisive blow here to mr tsongas , who has said he must win this state if he came in here , invested time and money , targeted and turned out the black vote , my numbers indicate that he has a good chance of winning , mr coker said of mr clinton but i'm talking about two , three days of hard work if he does n't do it he 'll lose , and probably lose decisively in a survey of 464 people whom masondixon considered likely to vote democratic , the poll found mr tsongas with the support of 33 percent , mr clinton with 26 percent , and no one else in double figures almost a quarter of the respondents , 24 percent , said they remained undecided the gap between mr clinton and mr tsongas in the poll was within the margin of sampling error , which was plus or minus 45 percentage points but all the momentum was with mr tsongas in a poll taken by masondixon before the new hampshire primary he trailed mr clinton , 24 percent to 10 percent a premium on experience on the republican side , mr coker reported , his polls show president bush far ahead of his challenger , patrick j buchanan , who grew up in chevy chase , a washington neighborhood just across the state line from maryland politicians here theorize that mr buchanan is doing poorly partly because he has chosen to focus on georgia and partly because voters here , many of whom work in washington , put a greater premium than most on broad governmental experience as a qualification in a candidate seeking the presidency mr clinton is running strongly among blacks , who constitute onefourth of the state s population , helped perhaps by the endorsement of mr schmoke , who is black a heated race in a new , majority black congressional district in largely black prince georges county , also in the washington suburbs , should help spur black turnout in addition , mr clinton appeals to conservative rural democrats in the long panhandle of western maryland and on the eastern shore jay rouse , mr clinton s local manager , who compares his candidate to robert f kennedy , asserted that he had built a strong , wellrounded campaign organization that would propel bill clinton forward even if he ca n't get back to maryland because he s in such demand in all parts of the country but john willis , the author of a history of presidential primaries in maryland , warned against selling the tsongas organization short , noting that it had turned out a large crowd on short notice the day after the new hampshire primary mr tsongas has backing in the big greekamerican community in baltimore and among other ethnic groups in the city but the fight will be won or lost in the washington suburbs , which now cast more votes than baltimore and baltimore county combined the question is who can grow in this state in the last week , mr willis said i think it s difficult for clinton he did n't counter his negatives the charges on the draft and on infidelity as intensely here as in new hampshire he was n't on television constantly knocking them down , and they 've hurt in maryland all the democratic candidates except mr kerrey plan to take part in a debate sunday night at the university of maryland in college park photo former senator paul e tsongas appeals strongly to welleducated , welltodo voters , according to polls of voters in earlier primaries mr tsongas met with patrons at an atlanta bar yesterday \( alan s weiner for the new york times \)

after years of resistance , miranda richardson has graciously agreed to become a movie star it is n't easy for her she hates crowds , photographers and interviews she is not particularly fond , either , of having to talk her way across america to plug her new movies , damage and the crying game she refuses to discuss her personal life \( that s why they call it personal \) , and she thinks prattling on about her craft diminishes it but stardom has its demands , and acting is n't always among them this makes her crazy , because the 34yearold ms richardson is an actress with a capital a , a highminded brit from the masterpiece theater school , where art matters and the commerce attached to it is a necessary vulgarity ms richardson had her first intense burst of glory in the united states seven years ago , with her film debut in dance with a stranger she played ruth ellis , a deadeye femme in stiletto heels and bloodred lipstick who murdered her boyfriend in 1955 , bleached her hair before walking into the courtroom and became the last woman hanged in britain the movie was a success , and ms richardson was praised lavishly by american critics then she disappeared if you do n't work in america , americans think you are dead , she said , laughing a little derisively at the notion that if you do n't appear in a hollywood movie you are n't acting in fact , it s the other way around , do n't you think \? anyway , i worked a lot after 'dance , ' but i also needed to rest it was my first film , and i was n't ready for the response and i got some scripts that i would rather not have read , let alone work with one of those scripts was for the role glenn close eventually performed in fatal attraction , a film ms richardson has said in the past she deplored and one in which she had no interest in appearing but she has surfaced in america again this year , displaying her range and talent with three compelling and pointedly diverse film performances as the dowdy , upright , but disconnected rose in enchanted april , mike newell s wry examination of four englishwomen vacationing in italy in the 1920 s as ingrid , the stolid middleaged wife of a member of parliament whose unique obsession destroys him and his family in louis malle s explosive film damage and as jude , the fiery ira regular who changes identities with dizzying regularity in neil jordan s crying game the three portrayals prompted the new york film critics' circle a week and a half ago to vote ms richardson best supporting actress of 1992 the biggest sin in my business is having a label , ms richardson said during a recent interview over lunch in new york and i will do anything i can to keep a director from being able to say , 'oh , yeah , she s the tart killer type , or the society matron type' i want them to say , 'oh , yeah , she can play anything' so her career has been a studied march from training at the bristol old vic to a variety of repertory roles on stage to television , where she has played a zany , schizoid version of queen elizabeth i , a sciencefiction terrorist reminiscent of the replicants in blade runner and dozens of other roles ms richardson \( no relation to the director tony richardson or the actor natasha richardson \) admits to the need for diversity and for diversion she said she was a singular child quiet and intense she isthe second daughter of a marketing executive and a housewife her older sister is a chiropodist a youth of silence and solitude in southport , just north of liverpool , has given way to an almost obsessive need to cycle through as many types of acting experiences as she can perform asked whether she finds film , television or theater the most enticing medium , she answers quickly none of the above , really the most dangerous medium is radio , because you are asked to use your brain and for ms richardson , who appears smaller , softer yet more remote in person than on film , danger is obviously an experience worth pursuing you never want to do the same thing too often , she says , noting that she is obsessed with the struggle to be original if you are not original , then you are n't acting but acute originality presents dilemmas directors do n't want troublemakers , and , as she readily observes , there are n't all that many interesting parts out there she should know after rejecting a dozen of the actionadventure roles that were sent to her after her success at playing a killer in dance with a stranger , ms richardson appeared in steven spielberg s empire of the sun , in which she portrayed a british prisoner of war in japaneseoccupied shanghai during world war ii the 1987 movie was noted more for its spielbergian pyrotechnics than for the intensity of its characters , and ms richardson s dislike of american films deepened that s why she has decided that stardom and the power it brings has its value it took neil seven years to scrape up enough money to make 'the crying game , ' she said , slowly shaking her head and it s so much more interesting and complex than the average film ms richardson said she is fonder of the jordan film than of the much more sensational damage , because it is so hard to categorize or put into a box it is a political thriller , but it is also really a love story and a story about labels and how they do n't mean a thing
the yankees would love it if everyone concentrated on what is fresh and new about their team from the new , young manager to the new cleanup hitter to the new shortstop and the new second baseman to , of course , the new attitude they would prefer boasting about an improved product to try justifying higher ticket prices but like the box of detergent that adds splashy colors and a logo while the product remains basically unchanged , the yankees are in certain respects still old and tired their problems with starting pitching are old , and the thirdbase woes are ancient so what will this mixture of old problems and new faces bring for a team trying to avoid its third consecutive season with 90 or more losses \? can they win with a starting rotation that has more holes than a mesh jersey \? can buck showalter , the youngest manager in the major leagues , work miracles while he works under the pressure of a oneyear contract \? probably not i think we 're a year away , conceded the team s acting managing partner , joseph molloy we might even be two years away winning will come slowly until the organization makes more intelligent decisions the yankees added free agents danny tartabull , the new cleanup man , and mike gallego , the new shortstop , at a cost of 306 million , but they continued to fail to address adequately their two imposing weaknesses pitching and third base general manager gene michael is hampered by onagain , offagain budget restraints and has not been able to trade for pitching there s no reason for jesse barfield to remain , crowding the outfield to bernie williams s chagrin , and michael should have made a deal long ago we 've still got a lot of question marks , confirmed mel hall a lot with tartabull , hall , roberto kelly , don mattingly and matt nokes , the yankees will score runs with scott sanderson , melido perez , jeff johnson , tim leary and greg cadaret , they are likely to surrender more runs the bullpen is sturdy but a useless asset if the score is 50 at the right are ways the yanks could avoid dreary deficits showalter brings youth to bear on old woes banking on a buck he was fired as the third base coach , then hired as the manager his father died , then his son , william nathaniel 4th , was born everything happened in 10 weeks one thing is certain nothing will frazzle showalter after he endured such a terribly emotional off season he is respected and was 360207 as a minor league manager , but the yankees are four or five players shy of challenging for the pennant , so the honeymoon could be short although buck is no stump on a log , it is necessary for him to have patience for him to truly exploit his abilities given time , the youngest yankee manager since 1914 can win i think , showalter said , we can surprise people the new don this is the season when fans find out if mattingly will ever be the old don he proved he could play 152 games last season , and now he wants to prove he can hit 310 and belt 20 homers he has a novel approach of not talking much and simply focusing on baseball could he actually be pouting about being trapped in new york \? he does not want to talk about that idea either just baseball one thing to remember there is nothing shabby about a 290 hitter who drives in 75 runs and is the best defensive first baseman in the league that may be what the yankees get that may be the new don under the spotlight you do not sign a 255 million contract to play baseball in new york and avoid intense scrutiny tartabull wanted the spotlight and he will get it but the yanks did not seem to get it by playing him in left field this spring , instead of right he is no gold glover , and his body and mind are fragile , and that is not the proper way to protect a huge investment tartabull has been charming in some sections of the clubhouse , but it is intriguing how a few teammates look askance when he saunters past and decline to answer questions about him none of that will matter if he drives in the 100 runs that he should front and center just as the yankees want to break their streak of losing , roberto kelly needs to break out of the solid mold and have a superstartype season several teams inquired about kelly this winter and michael would not budge , so new york would like to see 25 homers , 40 steals and a 300 average in return big numbers are in order or he may be classfied as a big disappointment how about a jump start \? the focus on the search for a fourth and fifth starter disguised the fact that the other three spots are not manned by clemens , langston and morris sanderson was 1610 on a horrible team and it could be difficult for him to repeat that perez was 14 as a starter with the white sox , and leary , whose 649 earned run average last year was the highest in yankee history , might have been waived if he was not collecting 2 million per year then there are the pressing problems in the last two spots in the rotation the pitching was thin before pascual perez was suspended a year for drug abuse and now it is anemic how bad \? the yankees have not pitched a complete game since july 11 , an embarrassing major league record of 83 straight games not so hot corner charlie hayes can hit a little , field a little and give you a headache once in a while hensley meulens can hit a lot \( in the minor leagues , at least \) , cannot really field much and has never been given much of a chance to prove himself on either count security at third \? hardly but the yankees will undoubtedly improve on the eightthirdbasemenisnotenough approach of last year , which produced a 225 average , 6 home runs , 38 runs batted in and 37 errors ouch ! what a relief there is a pitcher for every capacity , from a righthanded closer to a lefthanded middle reliever , and they must be used judiciously so they do not tire prematurely , as they did last year steve howe s impending trial on drug charges does not make longrange planning a breeze , but this is one place where showalter can still feel somewhat comfortable 'bash the manager ii' \? hall wants to play the outfield , cadaret wants to start and kevin maas does not want to be a parttime player could the grousing grow into another version of bash the manager ii , with showalter replacing stump merrill \? not likely the players already respect showalter more than they did merrill , and he has worked to rid the clubhouse of detrimental personalities releasing moody alvaro espinoza was no accident the final score they won 71 games last season after winning 67 the year before that there may be an arithmetical trend in the bronx because the yankees should be good for about 75 victories this year like the box of detergent says , it is new and improved just not by very much photos yankee fans should learn to value the latterday don mattingly \( associated press \) it s time for roberto kelly to be the man \( associated press \)

the lincoln center jazz orchestra s performance of the music of duke ellington tonight at avery fisher hall should be , in the language of musicians , smoking after all , the orchestra has just come off a 25concert crosscountry tour and for the last month its repertory has been exclusively ellington but more important , the 16piece ensemble , which is ending its tour here , has become a symbol of the widening reach of jazz itself while jazz orchestras , those that remain anyway , might perform in a club one night , a concert hall the next and at a countryclub dance the next , the lincoln center jazz orchestra has been playing finearts halls and college campuses , places usually reserved for european classical concerts , filled in part by subscription series the orchestra has been used in an attempt to broaden the waning classicalmusic audience base , and it appears to be working most of the shows were sold out or near capacity , and the audiences crossed generational lines to some , this indicates not only the depth of jazz s renaissance , but also the increasing willingness on the part of classicalmusic institutions to follow lincoln center s lead in programming jazz i was a bit surprised at how well the tour did , though there was n't really any way of judging because there is n't any precedent for it , said scott southard , who booked the tour , which features wynton marsalis , the artistic director of lincoln center s jazz program part of the reason it was so successful was that both wynton marsalis s name and lincoln center s name were on the bill we 're dealing with a huge cultural institution , and just the weight of the name has the ability to open doors while the word jazz has , over the last 20 years , often meant music that had jazz elements , the lincoln center orchestra has been playing , in the works of ellington , traditional , acoustic music it s also music that was meant for large halls and for the communal activities that saturday nights are known for , from dancing and partying to listening the extraordinary thing was to get that number of people out to hear ellington , mr southard said and the audience was n't all bluehaired it was moderately upscale but it included a lot of students and adults at the monterey festival there were standing ovations in the middle of tunes , and people screaming like at a rock show people are getting quite emotionally involved in the music partly it s because wynton and the other younger jazz musicians have made the music socially acceptable to younger audiences the tour was part of lincoln center s own mission to spread the gospel not only has its jazz department committed itself to expanding its programming off the grounds of lincoln center into schools and other concert spaces it has also just signed a deal with columbia records to release recordings of live performances in the jazz series the first , by the orchestra , portraits by ellington \( columbia \) , is already out the tour itself , which cost 600 , 000 , will probably just break even , despite a 25 , 000 gift from the metropolitan life foundation lincoln center is working on sending out another tour in the spring of 1994 pieces rarely played for the musicians , the orchestra , which includes a few veterans of the ellington band and a number of the 30yearold mr marsalis s contemporaries , offers a chance to get close to some of the most powerful music written in the 20th century it s also music that is rarely played , partly because of the lack of jazz programming in colleges and high schools , but also because ellington s huge legacy has not been totally codified and made public much of the music cannot be found and had to be transcribed from recordings those transcriptions have not yet circulated i would say that i 've never been in a band that swung this hard since duke , said art baron , who joined ellington s band in the early 1970 s , when he was in his early 20 s this band is the closest i 've been to his sound we 're the last of the mohicans , with people like norris turney , britt woodman and joe temperley all playing , people who were all associated with ellington the key elements are there , the right people , the right transcriptions and the right feeling it s great for todd williams , a 25yearold saxophonist best known as a member of mr marsalis' band , the orchestra is both a way to experience the music and to soak in the accumulated knowledge of the older band members jazz , though it is taught in school , is still very much a process of apprenticeship , and a big band , where the members are in constant contact with one another from poker games to the bandstand is the perfect way to pass on knowledge 'a pleasure to play' it s a real good experience both personally and musically , said mr williams musically it s nice to be able to hear some of voicings of the music you might not get off the record , and the polyphony also , it s a pleasure to play in the reed section because the musicians are a lot more experienced , and when they step up for a solo , i end up learning so much most large ensembles are lucky if they get a few days of rehearsal time the lincoln center jazz orchestra has been performing daily things change in its music sections become longer or shorter , improvisations change nightly riffs start appearing where there were none , and the music starts breathing most important , an orchestra starts swinging harder and harder the music has just gotten so exciting , mr williams said it changes every night people call riffs , clap hands , and soloists who are really doing it get cheers from the band it s really good camaraderie , and the music reflects it photo wycliffe gordon , left , and wynton marsalis performing with the lincoln center jazz orchestra \( stephanie berger \)
the sisters rosensweig is wendy wasserstein s captivating look at three uncommon women and their quest for love , selfdefinition and fulfillment unified by their sisterhood , they are as different as only sisters \( or brothers \) can be , as each tries to live up to an image imposed by her family at the same time , each performs her own act of rebellion or is it penitence \? because of their disparities , they are heroines to one another ms wasserstein s generous group portrait \( at the mitzi e newhouse theater \) is a not only a comedy but also a play of character and shared reflection as the author confronts the question of why the sisters behave as they do the immediate answer is that they are rosensweigs and are only doing what is expected of them the play offers sharp truths about what can divide relatives and what can draw them together the oldest sister is sara \( jane alexander \) , an overachiever , the only woman ever to head an international hong kong bank she is an expatriate in england who is , we are told , assimilated beyond her wildest dreams second is gorgeous \( madeline kahn \) , a triple threat as housewife , mother and radio personality in newton , mass the youngest is pfeni , nee penny \( frances mcdormand \) , a globetrotting journalist who lives her life as if she were on an extended junior year abroad the three come together in london for sara s 54th birthday one of the show s surprises is that in a play essentially about women , the sisters are subtly upstaged by two of the men in their lives , characters enhanced in performance by robert klein and john vickery the play is steeped in jewish culture and humor , but the emotional subtext is broader none of the sisters can find happiness they have all been nurtured in a family in which heartbreak has been confused with heartburn with effort , the women arrive at a new understanding bonding as siblings , they can anticipate a more promising future with sara , additional hope comes from a most unlikely source a wealthy new york furrier \( mr klein \) who in politically correct parlance manufactures synthetic animal protective covering in dealing with social and cultural paradoxes , ms wasserstein is , as always , the most astute of commentators along the way , she shatters the myth that jewish men do n't drink \( a myth made up by our mothers to persuade innocent women that jewish men make superior husbands \) as well as national patterns of speech \( when an englishman praises a stew as brilliant , mr klein adds , the chicken was very bright , too \) but underlying the comedy is an empathetic concern for the characters and for the prospects of women today at the same time , the play has its imperfections there are gratuitous remarks and irrelevancies both ms wasserstein and her director , daniel sullivan , should have been more judicious in their editing , especially in dealing with the author s penchant for labeling characters and offering information in the guise of conversation there is no need , for example , to keep saying that sara is so intelligent the character and the actress should speak for themselves in addition , two stock characters represent the polarities of english society an upperclass snob and a young radical with incredible gaps in his knowledge \( and too many easy jokes made at his expense \) these flaws do not substantially detract from a play with wit as well as acumen the sisters rosen sweig grows naturally out of the author s previous work with its jewish themes and reference to a mother s strong influence on her adult daughters , it looks back to is n't it romantic \? in contrast to the title character in the heidi chronicles , each sister is focused on her life to an obsessive degree but as with heidi , each has difficulty with men those they meet seldom seem worthy of the rosensweigs it is in this area that the play is at its funniest and most observant , with mr klein s faux furrier and mr vickery as a flamboyant theater director both roles could lead actors into excess , but the pitfalls are assiduously avoided acting as armchair counselor , the furrier sees through sara s protective screen as written , and as played by mr klein , he is an unpretentious wise man who forces sara to see herself as he sees her shrewdly , the actor plays the role straight , eradicating all thought of his background as a standup comic mr vickery s character is pfeni s man of many moments , who is unable to commit himself either in love or in art evidently a serious man of the theater , he has made his reputation by staging an andrew lloyd webberlike musical of the scarlet pimpernel , from which we hear exuberant excerpts mr vickery is both dashing and selfmocking , winning laughs with looks and pauses as well as with ms wasserstein s lines the women also rise above stereotype as the expatriate , ms alexander assumes an artful englishness despite her admission of being humorless , she wryly observes her postmarital situation because her second husband has been married so many times , his wives , past and present , could form a club with branches in chicago , new york , london and tokyo in the course of the play , ms alexander reveals a vulnerability beneath the ladylike veneer
washington , feb 6 four republics of the former soviet union have provided some details to the bush administration on plans to eliminate a number of strategic nuclear weapons over the next seven years and to concentrate those remaining on the territory of russia using the framework of the strategic arms reduction treaty agreed to last july between the united states and the soviet union , the newly independent republics will remove all strategic nuclear arms from belarus , ukraine and kazakhstan , the administration has been advised these plans had been foreshadowed in statements by leaders of the three republics and by president boris n yeltsin of russia after his meeting with president bush last week timetables are given specifically , all 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles in ukraine will be removed by the end of 1994 and all 104 intercontinental missiles in kazakhstan will be transferred to russia or eliminated altogether by the end of 1999 , according to what the administration has been told belarus has pledged to become a nuclearfree zone , but has not yet completed a timetable for elimination of intercontinental missiles on its soil assurances on these and other arms reduction moves were provided in january to an arms control delegation headed by reginald bartholomew , under secretary of state for international security affairs in testimony to the senate armed services committee on wednesday , mr bartholomew said that according to his understanding of what he was told by russian officials , this means they will eliminate modern ss18 s and ss24 s that they had planned to keep although he did not provide more detail , he appeared to be referring to 46 of the latemodel ss24 intercontinental missiles currently deployed in ukraine , and to the 104 ss18 missiles , some of them modernized , that are deployed in kazakhstan the russian plan appears to be to dismantle some of the kazakhstan missiles altogether and to remove others to russian territory so as to comply with a ceiling set under the strategic arms reduction agreement of a total of 154 of the ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles for the entire area of the former soviet union currently there are 204 of the ss18 s in russia , so some of these will face elimination as well mr bartholomew also noted that his delegation had been informed by russian authorities that 600 missiles had been taken off alert , of which 250 had been made inactive by removing them and their warheads from launchers he said this was consistent with information developed independently by the united states the under secretary added that all tactical nuclear weapons of the former soviet union had now been concentrated in russia , ukraine and belarus and that there are none remaining elsewhere in the former soviet union or abroad further , he said those remaining in belarus and ukraine were to be decommissioned and withdrawn to russia by july 1 mr bartholomew also said the united states was preparing to assist the new republics in dismantling their nuclear arsenals , using a fund of 400 million appropriated by congress for this purpose he said the administration was considering plans to send special containers and secure rail cars to assist in safe transport and storage of the nuclear warheads in addition , he said united states specialists were studying alternatives for safe storage of plutonium recovered from russian nuclear weapons and for methods of converting enriched uranium to fuel for reactors
spokane , wash one afternoon in june 1986 , more than 18 police officers raided two modest homes of an extended gypsy family here , looking for stolen property they took the marks family s heirlooms , ripped goldplated false fingernails from women s hands , removed earrings from a 5yearold girl and even searched a baby s diapers at the time , the police characterized the markses as an organized crime family similar to the mafia but now , after a series of court setbacks for the spokane authorities , the raid has come back to haunt this city and may lead to a staggering blow to its treasury family sued the city breaking a tradition of passivity and silence , the gypsies sued the city in federal court for violating their civil rights the trial , set for april 21 , is viewed by some gypsies as the first big civil rights case for a people who have usually shunned legal remedies for their grievances there is a long history of police harassment of gypsies , especially in smaller communities , but this is the first time that a romaniamerican family has really fought back , said dr ian hancock , a professor of linguistics at the university of texas who represents the largest international union of gypsies at the united nations the word romani refers to the gypsy language if they win , dr hancock said , it will mark a turning point for gypsies in this country already , the case has opened a window into a subculture of american life that has rarely been examined in public there are more than a million gypsies in this country , and the pacific northwest is one of the main areas where they have settled the gypsies of spokane trace their ancestry to eastern european families who were persecuted by christian churches for centuries and who were killed by the nazis during world war ii they say the spokane police raid is another example of cultural misunderstandings that have sometimes turned tragic search was ruled illegal spokane officials , worried that the lawsuit could drain the city s meager reserve funds , have entered into negotiations for a possible settlement it is already one of the most costly lawsuits in the city s history , generating about 500 , 000 in lawyers' fees from both sides the criminal case against the markses , four felony charges of trafficking in stolen property , fell apart after a court ruled in 1988 that the search was illegal but even as city officials make conciliatory gestures toward the markses , they say the family members , none of whom had a previous criminal record , are a criminal enterprise what you had here was the proverbial den of thieves , said rocco treppiedi , an assistant city attorney they have n't been persecuted they were just caught redhanded when the police raided the two markses family homes on june 18 , 1986 , they also took 16 million in cash , some of which was sewn into family and religious quilts the search warrant , which was later ruled illegal because it was issued after the raid , did not specify that cash could be taken but once the police found the money , they assumed it had to have come from criminal activity , mr treppiedi said the gypsies have long kept large sums of money and family jewelry in their homes , said grover marks , the patriarch of the extended family that calls itself the gypsy church of the northwest the cash is for weddings , family gatherings and daytoday business , and for funerals , when money is given to the dead for functions in the afterlife , he said members of the marks family , some of whom cannot read or write , say they do not trust banks stole our pride' the spokane police did not just steal our jewels and our money , mr marks said they stole our pride by calling us gangsters mr marks said that once he was arrested his status among gypsies was irreparably harmed , even after the charges were dropped dr hancock , who wrote a book on gypsies , the pariah syndrome \( karoma , 1987 \) , agreed , saying , after the raid , the family was defiled even if grover marks was not at fault , his credibility is gone the markses say their religious community , which once numbered more that 2 , 000 people , has dwindled to a few hundred since the raid the gypsy case is one of a string of complaints about official misconduct filed in recent years against the police department in spokane , a city of 175 , 000 people in eastern washington the accusations against the department include sexual harassment , solicitation of prostitutes , drug use by officers and mistreatment of blacks at the same time , this city s crime rate increased 6 percent last year , more than twice the state average terrence mangan , the chief of police in spokane , says most misconduct complaints have been blown out of proportion in local news accounts the raid of the gypsy homes occurred before mr mangan was named chief , but he says his officers acted by the book if anything , the police tried to be too nice to those people , he said we hold our officers to the highest standards the case grew out of a joint city and county investigation of a string of residential breakins in 1986 the gypsies say the police started watching their homes , suspicious of the clan and their possessions the markses had a sign in front of one house , advertising palm reading and fortunetelling they also sold used cars for a living they are very much like the amish , in that they are clannish and outsiders do not understand what they do , said gregg r smith , one of the lawyers for the family but to the police , the gypsies were a fence for stolen goods the police used a 17yearold boy , who was connected to the residential burglaries , as an informer he was wired with an audiotape and made several visits to the two markses homes , offering to sell the gypsies silverware and stolen jewelry according to court records , at least one family member made remarks on tape that indicated that he knew he was buying stolen property when the police raided the two family houses , they took nearly everything of value marie marks , the wife of grover marks , said a bracelet , which had not left her wrist for 50 years , was forcefully removed 'had all these riches' questions remain as to why the police , if they were looking for stolen property from residential burglaries , took gold fingernails and earrings from women in the houses more than two dozen family members live in the two houses the detectives , obviously , thought they had a reason to do what they did , mr treppiedi said grover marks s house was a modest home in a poor part of town , and here they had all these riches the family said , from the start , that the police did not have a warrant later , in a court hearing on the admissibility of the evidence , a police videotape showed that detectives began searching the houses two hours before a legal warrant had been signed two years after the search , judge john schultheis of spokane county superior court ruled it illegal four of the felony charges were dropped , and two members of the marks family pleaded guilty to misdemeanor offenses of trying to buy stolen property mrs marks said she bought some silverware from the 17yearold boy for 50 her son , james marks , pleaded guilty to a similar offense although most of the money seized by the police was eventually returned to the family , thousands of dollars are still missing , the family says the police say an inventory error is to blame for the discrepancy the markses have asked for 40 million in their lawsuit the city of spokane has only 15 million in the reserve fund that it set aside for such emergencies photo the spokane police did not just steal our jewels and our money , said grover marks , the patriarch of a family of gypsies suing the city for violating their civil rights when they raided their homes for stolen property they stole our pride by calling us gangsters with him was his wife , marie \( jeff green for the new york times \)
americans are used to being inundated with slick commercials for beer , fast food and cars , so it was probably just a matter of time until a company like gateway educational products tried the approach with one of its product lines , hooked on phonics the insistent advertising campaign has worked , if one accepts the privately held company s sales claims gateway , which is based in orange , calif , says that more than 500 , 000 consumers have dialed 1800abcdefg to order hooked on phonics , a 17995 collection of tape cassettes , cards and workbooks but does it work \? whether the product works , however , is another question gateway offers reams of testimonials to the program s success but many of the nation s widely recognized reading experts have leveled blistering attacks on the company s claim that with its materials , virtually anyone from a child to an illiterate adult to a foreigner studying english can learn to read these critics demand that gateway offer scientific support , not testimonials and sales figures , to make its case in response , carolyn sisco , a company spokeswoman , says there is no need for tests phonics is already a proven method to learn to read , she said all we have done is made it easier and more fun gateway is certainly not alone in making alluring though unscientifically documented claims in mass media advertising it s just that other companies are less willing to discuss them for example , early advantage of norwalk , conn , which markets bbc language courses for children , and chesterbrook educational publishers of west chester , pa , marketers of where there s a will , there s an a , did not respond to repeated requests to discuss their products gateway s success has made its products , and advertising , a focus of unusually intense scrutiny but the disconcerting truth is that very few vendors of educational products to schools or the public have statistically valid proof of how effective their wares are as teaching aids 'very little testing' about 10 , 000 products are published annually and 99 percent of it is driven by marketing conditions , said douglas carnine , a university of oregon professor specializing in curriculum development and school reform there s very little testing of whether it is efficacious consumers are out of luck if they turn for guidance on such products to bigname groups like the national parent teachers association or the national education association none of them issue product reviews or guidelines for assessing product claims consumers may be more bewildered than usual in gateway s case , because the company freely admits that most highprofile reading experts have criticized hooked on phonics for promising more than it can deliver but the company dismisses such critics as protectors of vested economic interests who are jealous of its success the country is in an educational freefall , said john shanahan , gateway s 51yearold founder , who never misses an opportunity to say that tutors and schools , unlike gateway , do not offer refunds when they fail gateway promises that anyone can read almost anything by memorizing the letter combinations that represent the english language s 44 basic sounds and then practicing putting them together to sound out words it says it has made the task simple and fun for nonreaders of all ages by putting exercises to music it has applied the same approach to other products few seek refund mr shanahan says that nearly all of gateway s customers are pleased fewer than 10 percent , he says , seek the refund guaranteed if the hooked on phonics program , for example , is returned within 30 days but last spring , a panel of experts convened by the international reading association of newark , del , which comprises 92 , 000 educators , concluded that the chances of learning to read using hooked on phonics were slim even academics who share gateway s belief in the power of phonics are upset by its claims i have n't encountered one scholar who has said it is a good program , said jeanne chall at harvard university s graduate school of education professor chall notes , for example , that consumers cannot test whether they understand the meaning of the words and sentences they have learned to sound out the problem , according to many reading experts and counselors , is that illiterate adults , and many parents , are too embarrassed to return educational products or to complain to authorities about false advertising when they fail the people who order this are most likely to blame themselves when the product fails , because there s a lot of shame in not being able to read , said kathleen stassen berger , a developmental psychologist who teaches at bronx community college others will put it on a shelf , telling themselves they will try later , where it becomes a symbol of dashed hopes but ms sisco , gateway s spokeswoman , says customers report and survey results show that using the program leads to progress in reading and spelling besides , mr shanahan said , the american people are n't stupid if they do n't like it , they send it back mrs berger complained early last year to the national advertising division of the council of better business bureaus , the council s selfregulatory arm after discussions with gateway , the division concluded that the advertising misleads consumers by claiming that the program is all the nonreader needs to learn to read the division noted that many parents and teachers who submitted testimonials had used the program with other materials and with readers on hand to help the nonreaders gateway disagreed with most of the conclusions in an interview , ms sisco said that gateway encouraged parental involvement in children s education and would never discourage adult customers from getting help but she said a lot of people had learned to read using the program alone we only say things in our advertising that customers have told us , she said still , gateway said that it wanted to cooperate and subsequently introduced new advertisements that satisfied the national advertising division the potential for conflict was also reduced by the company s decision to sharply cut radio advertising in favor of infomercials , paid halfhour television programming packed with testimonials critics like mrs berger are upset but say they are unsure how to proceed meanwhile gateway is adding to its offerings a phonicsbased reading comprehension package based on sra reading laboratories , reading lessons published by a division of macmillanmcgraw hill don h parker , a 79yearold former teacher who started developing sra laboratories 40 years ago , came to gateway s attention when he sent an unsolicited endorsement of hooked on phonics drawing
harvey grant will not be happy if the washington bullets , as expected , match the knicks' offer sheet to him the bullets have until 6 pm this evening to match new york s sixyear , 176 million offer sheet to grant , a restricted free agent forward but according to his agent , grant is angry that the bullets filed tampering charges against the knicks , a charge the knicks were found not guilty of after a hearing this week harvey wants to play with the knicks , said jimmy sexton , grant s agent , in a phone interview yesterday we knew from the outset that we had never done anything outside the rules , and neither had the knicks harvey s very , very upset if the bullets do in fact match this offer , how can they expect harvey grant to walk back into the bullets' family with open arms after what they did \? it s not like they questioned a clause , or an interpretation of the rules they questioned his integrity and character with the action they took harvey s not real thrilled with the idea of signing with the bullets , or playing with them the knicks are a solid team growing stronger , and harvey would love to be a part of it but it is unlikely that grant s anger will persuade the bullets' general manager , john nash , to let grant sign with the knicks grant is a 27yearold , 6foot9inch forward who averaged 18 points and 67 rebounds last season the kind of player the rebuilding bullets cannot afford to lose without getting something in return the bullets would probably have already matched the knicks' offer , but they are still trying to sign their firstround draft pick , tom gugliotta of north carolina state if the bullets match grant s offer sheet before signing gugliotta , it will be very difficult for washington to fit gugliotta s contract demand under the salary cap far apart in negotiations nash did not return a phone call to his office yesterday for comment , but league sources said that washington and gugliotta were still very far apart in negotiations none of the league s top five draft picks have signed , and gugliotta , the no 6 pick , is unlikely to sign until he sees what some of the higher picks get so unless something drastic happens this morning in the gugliotta negotiations , the bullets will probably be forced either to match the knick offer and worry about gugliotta later , or let grant go and use some of that additional money to sign gugliotta the odds are that the bullets will decide to keep grant but the knicks , and grant , are hoping to beat the odds
rostovondon , russia , oct 15 while the manacled defendant bellowed from his metal cage and spectators cheered , a rostov court today sentenced andrei chikatilo to death for a 12year career of unusually sadistic sex murders of 52 boys , girls and young women irrespective of any mitigating circumstances , taking into account the extraordinary cruelty of the crimes , the court cannot but give him the only punishment he deserves , the supreme measure of punishment , and sentences him to death ! the chief justice , leonid b akubzhanov , shouted into his microphones over the din for a few minutes bedlam erupted spectators mounted benches and craned forward while television cameramen jostled with uniformed guards outside mr chikatilo s cage relatives break down several relatives of his victims burst into sobs nina beloretskaya , whose 12yearold son had fallen prey to the killer , threw herself shrieking against three policemen barring her way , seeking to reach mr chikatilo mr chikatilo , who has rarely spent more than five minutes in his cage before being evicted for his incessant ranting , shouted unintelligibly all through the sentencing and slammed his bench against the metal bars concluding his sentence , the judge turned to him and said chikatilo , you are sentenced to death do you understand \? crooks ! i fought for free russia and free ukraine ! bellowed the 56yearold mr chikatilo , a ukrainian in origin take him out , the judge ordered , and mr chikatilo was hustled down a narrow wooden stairway , screaming , crooks ! crooks ! appeal is planned mr chikatilo s lawyer , marat khabibulin , said he would file the usual appeal to the russian supreme court , and if that failed he would appeal for clemency to the president if the death sentence stands , mr chikatilo is likely to be executed by a bullet through the back of the head in about nine months mr chikatilo acknowledged all but three of the 36 murders with which he was originally charged and then confessed to 21 more , including nine of which nobody knew before in the end , the court confirmed 52 killings 14 girls , 17 young women and 21 boys and acknowledged that there were probably more the case filled 222 volumes , 222 volumes impregnated with blood , blood spurts from every page , the judge said if you look at the photos your hair stands on end under russian legal procedures , the court is required to review every accusation in detail for two days , while everyone except the families of the victims stood in his large , pink courtroom , judge akubzhanov read page after page of a verdict that he later said cost me five years of my life doctors stood by relatives of victims , several of whom collapsed as the grotesque litany droned on , the crimes growing ever more cruel as mr chikatilo sought to assuage his insatiable appetite when the recitation came to her son , one woman leaned far forward , stuffed her fingers into her ears and sobbed convulsively the number and extraordinary brutality of the killings , in which mr chikatilo would suddenly pounce on his young victims , stab them , rip their bodies apart and eat pieces , confirmed mr chikatilo as perhaps the worst serial killer in the annals of crime the case introduced the public and the russian press into a dark world of sexual perversion , child vagabonds and other horrors that the soviet government had routinely concealed judge akubzhanov said much of the horror might have been avoided if not for the soviet obsession with secrecy in our soviet union there was no banditry , no killing of children , nothing bad , he said judge akubzhanov also blamed the soviet system for inculcating in the victims a blind respect for authority we lived in 'barracks socialism , ' where the word of an adult was law i was raised that way if we had a normal system of upbringing , none of these children would have taken up with this stranger in his verdict , the judge accused the police and prosecutors of gross negligence that allowed mr chikatilo to elude them for 12 years , from his first killing in october 1978 until his arrest in november 1990 in probably his most sensational ruling , judge akubzhanov declared that mr chikatilo was in fact responsible for a 1978 killing for which another man was executed that killing , he said , was mr chikatilo s first , a botched rape that ended in murder , in which the killer first discovered that sadism and blood aroused him long before that , the verdict declared , mr chikatilo had a record of repeated sexual harassment of boys and girls , for which he was dismissed as a teacher and disdained by children the judge described in detail how mr chikatilo was arrested in 1984 by a detective who was certain he was the rostov sex killer , and how he was released after a botched blood typing there were other incidents officials in uzbekistan concealed the existence of one victim found in a cornfield because they thought she had been caught in a harvesting machine in at least three cases , experts misidentified the remains of a boy as those of a girl in the end , judge akubzhanov said mr chikatilo succeeded in evading arrest so long primarily because he was so unremarkable an outward conformist in everyday life he was a father whose two children paid him little heed , a communist party member who always posted pictures of the politburo in his workplace yet in his secret life he was an insatiable sadist always on the prowl for a victim , never leaving home without a knife and rope in the event that he might find one , the judge said he took a job as a supply clerk because it gave him an excuse to travel to neighboring cities , so he could leave home without arousing suspicion he spent endless hours in search of victims at railway stations , in commuter trains , on isolated paths the central question in the case was the defendant s sanity judge akubzhanov argued at length that the killer was in fact a coldblooded killer who planned some of his crimes and feigned madness in court only to save his skin mr chikatilo asserted he never planned to savage his victims , but that he would be overpowered by a mad need for blood the judge said that on the contrary , mr chikatilo searched out his victims and actively lured them with proposals of a visit to his dacha , or a request for help , or an offer of a ride photo andrei chikatilo , who was sentenced to death in rostovondon , russia , for sadistic sex murders of 52 people over a 12year period \( agence francepresse \)

atlanta , oct 25 joe carter kept thinking bill buckner 1986 dave winfield refused to think dave winfield 1981 the atlanta braves would just as soon not think anything today , thank you , because the toronto blue jays are the world series champions and they are not just when it looked as if the braves might duplicate their incredible comeback against the pittsburgh pirates in the national league championship series 10 days earlier and force a seventh game tonight , the blue jays refused to relinquish their grasp on the championship that had eluded them in other years canada s team handed america s team its seventh successive onerun world series loss saturday night , actually completing the 11inning , 43 victory 50 minutes into today when carter caught mike timlin s toss at first base and ended the 4hour7minute march to canada s dream the winning hit belonged to winfield , who in the 1981 world series got only 1 hit in 22 times at bat in the yankees' losing effort when winfield was asked afterward if his tworun double would forever bury the memory of 1 for 22 , he did n't directly answer but suggested that was ancient history his wife , tonya , echoed that view he s never said , 'i have to dispel 1981 , ' she said in a clubhouse that was so crowded all of canada seemed to be there david looks to the future he never dwells on the past carter , an outfielder playing first base for the second game in the series , could n't avoid the past minutes before he took the seriesending throw , he fielded a groundball for the second out of the 11th inning with runners at second and third and the blue jays leading , 42 , on winfield s tworun double brian hunter hit the ball to first base , carter related on the fringe of the crushing clubhouse crowd , and i'm thinking , 'do n't do like buckner' in the ninth inning , i was thinking about it , too i said , 'get it out of your mind , it s not going to happen' but i definitely was thinking about buckner when hunter hit the ball in the sixth game of the 1986 world series six years ago today , the mets had rallied for a 55 tie in the 10th inning when mookie wilson hit what appeared to be an inningending grounder to boston s buckner at first but the ball inexplicably rolled between buckner s legs , and ray knight scored the winning run from second the mets then won the seventh game and the series carter , however , did not let the ghost of buckner haunt him to distraction he fielded pinchhitter hunter s grounder cleanly and beat him to first for the second out as jeff blauser scored and pinchrunner john smoltz moved to third with the switchhitting otis nixon coming to bat , cito gaston , the oftmaligned toronto manager , called for the righthanded timlin to replace lefthanded jimmy key key , the starting and winning pitcher in the fourth game , had indicated to gaston that nixon had given him trouble in the past furthermore , nixon is a consistently better righthand hitter , and gaston preferred that he hit lefthanded but that strategy also gave nixon one advantage a fast runner and good bunter , nixon had the option of trying to bunt for a hit that would bring smoltz home with the tying run batting lefthanded , if he chose to bunt , he would be slightly closer to first and he could be moving out of the batter s box as he dragged the ball toward first aware of the possibility , carter went to the mound to remind timlin of it a veteran s advice this guy will lay it down , carter told the blue jays' seventh pitcher of the game you got to bounce off the mound timlin , a 26yearold secondyear major leaguer , said he was surprised that he was able to remain calm it s a single 'a' game , he said he told himself just relax and throw strikes maybe his calm came from all of the times he had envisioned himself in such a situation i 've dreamed about this more times than i 've gotten out of bed , he said , speaking of being on the mound for the last out of the world series i sat in class and dreamed about it i thought about it all the time earlier in the series , tom henke said he , too , had dreamed of being on the mound for the last out of the world series the blue jays' no 1 relief pitcher got his chance , in the ninth inning when the blue jays led , 21 , and the braves had two out but nixon poked a single between shortstop and third base , driving in blauser from second with the tying run henke , allowing the toronto bullpen s first run after a seriesrecord 15 1 3 scoreless innings , had shattered his dream , but timlin was not about to squander his nixon swung at timlin s first pitch and fouled it after that , carter said , you could almost see it in his eyes that he was going to bunt nixon acknowledged that he decided after the foul to bunt i wanted joe to field the ball , he said but i got it more on the end of the bat than i wanted another 6 inches , another foot minutes later , in the jampacked jubilant clubhouse , the blue jays would chant , peeeffpee , peeeffpee , peeeffpee i enjoy it , timlin said of one of the pitchers' most hated spring training drills , pitchers' fielding practice , or pfp , for short i'm one of the few pitchers who like it nixon bunted the ball , and timlin leaped off the mound i wanted to tag him , the pitcher said , but he already was past me then i wanted to make sure i did n't throw it over joe s head carter caught timlin s good throw , then repeatedly leaped in the air , the right and obligation of every player who has the ball in his hand after the last out if nixon had succeeded and brought home the tying run , he would have been a hero but his strategy failed his manager , bobby cox , was asked how he felt about the bunt he does that a lot , cox said i do n't fault him for it it s a good weapon but the braves had run out of weapons that worked jeff reardon was one of those acquired by the braves aug 30 , baseball s career saves leader did a creditable job in the final month of the season but he gave up the gamelosing runs in the second and third games \( ed sprague s tworun home run , candy maldonado s basesloaded single \) and cox had seen enough that s why he kept the lefthanded charlie leibrandt , normally a starter , who had not pitched in the series , in the game in the 11th inning when the righthanded carter and winfield were scheduled to bat with runners at first and second with one out in the inning , leibrandt had hit devon white with a pitch , and roberto alomar singled to center leibrandt , who in last year s sixth game gave up a gamelosing home run to kirby puckett in the 11th inning , got carter on a fly to center field carter then returned to the dugout i'm on the top step saying , 'he s gonna get a hit and drive in the winning run , ' carter said and he did it carter s dugoutstep thoughts may have seemed optimistic , because winfield had gone only 4 for 21 in this series before his last time at bat and of those four hits , none were for extra bases and two were infield singles he had only one rbi but the 41yearold winfield , whom the blue jays imported as a free agent last winter to lead them to the world series , won it when he grounded a 32 pitch just

dublin , nov 25 as the irish voted in a national election today , they had already been told by pollsters and other experts how they would select a new parliament and how they would deal with three constitutional amendments that would liberalize the abortion law no one will know if the estimated 17 million voters agreed with the predicters before thursday , when the ballotcounting begins the results on abortion will probably be clear in the afternoon , but a close parliamentary election could drag out the count to friday or saturday , under a system of proportional representation that can involve 10 counts for a single seat according to the experts , the newspapers and the polls , the irish will deny prime minister albert reynolds the 83 seats his fianna fail party needs for a majority that would probably mean a coalition government either between fianna fail \( warriors of destiny \) and the labor party of dick spring , or a mix of three or four parties excluding that of mr reynolds on the abortion issue , approval is expected for amendments that will guarantee women the right to travel abroad for abortions , as more than 4 , 000 irish women already do each year to britain , and for the right to receive abortion clinic information in ireland many questions open but recent polls and politicians say the voters will disapprove the amendment that would expand the grounds for legal abortion if that happened , abortion law would be based on a supreme court decision last march that ended the categorical constitutional ban on abortion , but left many questions on the legality of abortion here in its decision , the court overruled the government and allowed a 14yearold girl who said she had been raped to go to britain for an abortion , after her doctors and lawyers said she had threatened to kill herself the proposal voted on today does not permit suicide threats or rape or incest as legal grounds for abortion the twoandahalf week campaign on politics and abortion included an incident in which mr reynolds used a vulgarism to describe an opposing point of view the public outcry was considerable , as women phoned radio stations to say that if their little boys talked like that , they would have their mouths washed out with soap mr reynolds apologized , saying he considered the word an american term for rubbish all the parties , recognizing that the main concern of voters in a country with 20 percent unemployment was the economy , promised to create jobs without spending too much money , while holding down taxes and mortgage rates in the last days of the campaign , pressure increased on european money markets for a devaluation of the irish punt , now pegged unusually high against the british pound none of the party leaders would promise absolutely not to devalue coalition expected outside a polling place on killarney street in central dublin this afternoon , a fianna fail party worker handed out leaflets and said his party had no chance to win a majority it 'll have to be a coalition of labor and fianna fail , he said , but added that he was worried that mr spring , the labor party leader , might not agree because reynolds has antagonized him with campaign charges that mr spring has called dirty tricks the government proposal on expansion of the grounds for abortion was opposed by the opposing sides in the debate in this predominantly roman catholic country the prolife campaign said the proposal would legalize abortion , which they consider murder women s groups that want to liberalize the law also opposed the government proposal because it says abortion would be legal to save the life as distinct from the health of the mother if that amendment is defeated , the new parliament may try to legislate a new abortion law , or it may let the issue drop , waiting for an other test case to arise the catholic church deplored abortion in principle , but said people were free to vote yes or no on the three amendments today , the abortion campaign continued right up to the time polls closed at the connolly station in downtown dublin , two middleaged men handed out leaflets reminding people that pope john paul ii opposes abortion the prolife campaign produced a letter against abortion from mother teresa , the nobel prize winner , in calcutta short campaign a mercy many people and several newspapers said that the election was unnecessary and that the short campaign was a mercy the main parties spent about 1 million , but not a penny on television advertising the national network , radio telefis eirann , apportions television time to the parties in relation to their strength at the last national election , in 1989 this meant that the strongest party , fianna fail , got a total of 24 minutes , the rest proportionately less there were some smiles early in the campaign the government issued a new 20 \( about 33 \) note engraved with a portrait of the 19thcentury national hero daniel o'connell that is , all irish agree , the spitting image of bertie ahern , the finance minister in its pamphlet explaining the voting system , the department of the environment , which is in charge of elections

this is how jeff torborg makes out the mets' lineup first , he puts eddie murray s name at the no 4 spot second , he writes in the starting pitcher at the bottom of the list then , he turns to a long list of rookies and callups and platoon players and starts scratching his head who will bat first \? who will play second \? who will hit in front of murray \? behind murray \? not that it matters not that much , anyway last night , barely more than 8 , 500 spectators showed up at shea stadium to see the mets beat the chicago cubs , 87 for new york , the starting lineup consisted of names like thompson and howell and donnels and mcknight looking for bobby bonilla \? gone dave magadan \? gone howard johnson \? long , long gone at this point , there is nothing predictable about the mets lineup save for its unpredicatability and , of course , eddie murray s name there he is , still playing , torborg said , shaking his head , before the game he can play every day as long as he wants i told him , just let me know what you want to do it s a respect that he deserves i had carlton fisk and it was like that , too these are guys who are on the way to the hall of fame i'm willing to adjust to their plans and their schedule because they have earned that murray will continue to start because murray wants to start he was out there at first base last night , and he went 1 for 2 with two walks and two runs scored for the 36yearold murray , it was his 146th start of the season , putting him four shy of recording the 14th 150start season of his career a mark surpassed only by pete rose \( 17 years \) and equal to that of hall of famers brooks robinson and hank aaron combined , the other eight mets to start against the cubs last night do not have the major league experience that murray has i shoot at playing at 162 games when i leave spring training , said murray , who is hitting 262 with 16 homers and 89 runs batted in for the mets in his 16th major league season it s no fun sitting on the bench that s not what i am i 've always been a doer what a surprise ! the viewers of sportschannel have voted murray the mets' most valuable player usually , reserved , murray showed first surprise and then genuine pleasure when he was informed of that at the start of the season , who would have thought that it would turn out that way \? it s always nice when people recognize what you do , especially this year , murray said in a way , murray stands as the only remnant of what the mets' season was supposed to be the only other members of the openingday lineup still playing are bill pecota , todd hundley and vince coleman and none of them have started on a consistent basis this year you have to have your starting lineup all year to win games , murray said every year , somebody has to step in and do something you do n't know who it 'll be , but there will be somebody who gets hurt and somebody who comes in and does the job the problem is , we had too many people go down murray admits that the season has been frustrating , but only because i thought we would be better than we have been injuries and the other stuff dictate this ugly scene , he said where are we , fifth \? we 're a much better ballclub than that and he has seen worse than this remember 1988 \? remember baltimore \? in murray s book , you have n't seen the truly ugly until you play through 21 straight losses to start the year in 1988 , when we lost the first 21 , that was ugly , murray said this is n't that bad there are still people below us , right \? inside pitch anthony young nearly continued his string of bad luck , taking over in the ninth last night with an 85 lead and giving up a tworun homer to gary scott before getting out of the inning to earn his 15th save rookie ryan thompson cracked his first major league homer , a threerun blast in the fourth that gave the mets a 52 lead dick schofield singled in two runs in the eighth and chico walker followed with an rbi single to break the game open for the mets bobby bonilla visited the clubhouse yesterday wearing a sling he will have on his right arm for the next three weeks when bonilla had shoulder surgery on thursday , the doctor found much more damage than the magnetic resonance imaging test had shown and bonilla , for one , was surprised he showed me and said , 'i do n't know how you were throwing , ' bonilla said and i said , 'i do n't know either , now that i 've seen this' bonilla fully expects to be throwing by january and to be ready to go full force in spring training photo mets catcher todd hundley after cubs' luis salazar was safe at home on a single by steve buechele in sixth \( barton silverman the new york times \)
san diego , april 22 it is n't often that dennis conner finds himself looking up the stern of another boat but it s something else again when the stern is so far ahead he can barely see it such was the case today when conner lost his america s cup defense finals match to america3 by 4 minutes 20 seconds on the challengers' course , the boats were relatively close in a reversal from its heartwrenching onesecond defeat two days ago to il moro di venezia of italy , new zealand beat il moro today by 34 seconds to take a 21 lead in the fiveofninerace finals large waves bring trouble conner s defeat today created a visible chink in his armor with skills tempered by 18 years of america s cup experience , conner has few rivals at the helm but he is now down three races to none in the defense finals in the 7of13 series conner must still win seven races to edge out america3 bill koch needs only to win the next four races to sweep the series a lack of wind postponed racing for more than an hour today , a good early sign for conner when the breeze filled in , it was fairly light at 6 knots , the kind of conditions in which stars stripes could be expected to excel it seemed at first that stars stripes was in a strong position heading out to the left side of the 203mile course we got off to a nice start , said conner after the race it looked as if within five minutes we had a 500foot lead we thought , wow , this is going to be great but large ocean waves and a skittish breeze spelled danger as stars stripes and america3 made their way up the threemile first leg , the choppy fourfoot seas got the best of the conner boat it s like the molokai channel , said conner as he watched waves spill over stars stripes s bow the action reminded him of the habitually rough waters off the hawaiian island of molokai , where conner has often raced boats his 75foot yacht leaped up and down , sinking into the sea with each pitch as if springloaded for the next the ungainly motion cost conner precious seconds in a race in which the clock showed no mercy added to that , the wind swung nearly 50 degrees to the right , a change in direction that favored koch at one point , it looked as if we were going to need our binoculars to see him , said conner by the first mark , stars stripes was 1 16 behind america3 as the oldest design in the cup finals , stars stripes has a wide body and full bow compared with the more evolved narrow hull and slim foredeck of america3 when we saw america3 for the first time , it looked to us like the boat we would have built , david pedrick , one of conner s yacht designers , said monday differences are revealed ten minutes into the race today , the difference between the defense opponents was readily apparent besides having better boat speed , koch s america3 team picked the better side of the course from the start choosing shifts correctly is usually conner s forte the challengers' race was governed by many of the same considerations paul cayard , skipper of il moro di venezia , sailed off to the right after his start new zealand went to the left the payoff for italy came at the first mark a 1 42 lead over rod davis and his kiwi team the relatively large lead was in marked contrast to the pairing s last race , an exuberant , hotly contested match that ended in a onesecond photofinish victory for italy

to the editor kudos to edward rothstein for his essay on music written for children s stories and for his emphasis on the need for good music in this field an evening at the pops lolli , that is , feb 23 there has been , and still is , what can only be called an attitude of condescension by the adult public regarding what is acceptable in this area pop songs , jingles , kitschy instrumental effects are deemed adequate for undeveloped tastes more than 10 years ago , i composed some 15minute operas , setting to music a few of the more popular children s books of the time my intent was to introduce children , ages 5 to 8 , to sung stories that would appeal to them , educate their sensibilities to music other than pop , prepare them for real opera and make a vivifying connection with their own literature i was able , with great effort and no profit , to present these storybook operas in live performance to children in the new york metropolitan area , particularly in brooklyn and they loved it , as did their teachers and parents attempts , however , to reach a wider audience got nowhere marketing organizations , financing sources , influential people all saw merit , but none saw a future for the stuff it did n't fit into any of the more easily exploited niches of the musical educational establishment it is nice to know that the good fight is still being fought , if only by an enlightened few jack w chaikin palm desert , calif the writer , now retired , was a professor of music at long island university
a 16yearold boy was killed and five other people wounded , none of them seriously , when two men opened fire last night on a dice game on a staten island street , the police said the teenager , kiam crabbe , of bowen street , was believed to have been one of the intended targets of the shooting , which stemmed from a dispute over the game , said lieut william quinn of the crimes against persons squad at least four of the surviving victims were thought to have been innocent bystanders , he said the gunmen , who had not been identified by the police , emerged from the apartment building at 160 park hill avenue in clifton just before 9 pm and began firing on the dozen people involved in the game , which had been going on all day , the lieutenant said
jacksonville , ala , feb 29 it is already spring in this northeast alabama college town the tulip trees along highway 21 have filled with fleshy pink blossoms , and the daffodils are up in the busy town square , where the statue of a confederate soldier stands above the following inscription times change , men often change with them principles never times have changed in jacksonville just down the street from the confederate monument , in a gray frame house with a cannon out front , a surrender took place the other day in the war over southern memory last sunday members of the allwhite chapter of kappa alpha fraternity at jacksonville state university voted not to wear the traditional confederate uniforms or display the confederate flag during their annual spring march at the start of what they used to call old south week in years past , they would assemble out front by the cannon and march to the nearby campus in gray confederate uniforms with bright yellow sashes around their waists their dates waited for them there in hoop skirts as in all masquerades , there were elements of comedy the men would doff their hats and sing kappa alpha rose kneeling , they would take their dates' hands a few used the occasion to propose marriage for others , the march was a first date photographs were taken , civilities indulged the couples would file arm in arm beneath crossed swords to bibb graves hall , the campus administration building , where the university president would greet them and acknowledge their symbolic secession from the university for a week the presidential greeting was later discontinued , and two years ago , during a black lecturer s visit to campus , the university asked the fraternity to reschedule its march it was the first time the march had been publicly linked to issues of racial sensitivity the fraternity reluctantly agreed but by means of gentle persuasion , the university continued to press the fraternity to end display of the flag and uniforms finally , after guidance from regional and national leaders of kappa alpha and a lengthy debate among themselves , the chapter threw in the towel the vote was 41 to 3 the entire affair was less than a bump on the topography of change but it raised the question of what was wrong with the act of remembering for the most part , the kappa alpha brothers at jacksonville state are wiry country boys from towns like ider , hokes bluff and rainsville , and their vote to dispense with the uniforms and flag appears to have had more to do with concern about their own futures than with the burden of southern history they still see a college education as a ticket off the farm and out of the town square , and they say they did not want to be thought of as rednecks they also did not want , even unintentionally , to give offense if racial harmony comes out of it , that s great , said the chapter s president , russ means , 21 years old but our goal has been to get on track about what ka is about it s not about a flag or a uniform , but about the ideals of robert e lee kappa alpha was founded in 1865 at washington college , later washington and lee , in virginia by four confederate veterans who wanted to preserve the idea of the southern gentleman the fraternity now has 130 chapters and 85 , 000 living members gus edwards , 74 , a kappa alpha brother and former dean of men at jacksonville state , said he associated the idea of the southern gentleman with moonlight and magnolias , chivalry , courtesy and high regard for god and womanhood the tradition of old south week did not begin until the late 1930 s , said kappa alpha s national executive director , richard a barnes by the early 1950 s , the leadership of kappa alpha began urging its chapters not to display the battle flag or uniforms in public , and many had agreed although he was pleased by the decision of the jacksonville chapter , which was founded in 1976 , mr barnes said the vote was not anything anybody s going to write home about the changes have come none too soon , though , for the university administration and for the many black students on campus who take offense at the display of what they consider to be symbols of a slaveowning past it makes me think people had n't modernized and civilized and do n't accept us as equals , said shandala drake , 18 other black students praised the decision it was great , said anissa grimes , 21 the racial climate needs work , but i'm optimistic about jacksonville for some fraternity members and residents along the parade route , though , the vote was bittersweet i always thought it looked nice , said a neighbor of the fraternity house , margaret saterfield , 69 even kappa alpha members with northern roots found themselves regretting the vote there s nothing racial about getting dressed up in uniform and impressing the girls , said toby schwartz , 21 , a descendant of a colonel in the union army but all were reconciled to the change
longtime cure fans should brace themselves for what happens midway through the band s new album , wish there are two cheerful songs in a row over folky guitar strumming , doing the unstuck advises kick out the gloom and let s get happy ! next , friday i'm in love uses the major chords and jinglejangle guitars of british invasion folkpop to praise the wonderful surprise to see your shoes and your spirits rise it does n't last in other songs on wish , the english rockers' ninth album of new material , the singer drinks himself into a selfhating stupor at a party , agonizes over a former girlfriend , pushes away those who would offer comfort , sees the inevitability of a breakup and realizes that his only love does n't trust him even friday i'm in love makes the other days of the week less than lighthearted i do n't care if monday s black tuesday wednesday heart attack but robert smith , the cure s singer and lyricist , has n't allowed his melancholy to lift for two consecutive songs since the band coalesced in 1978 the packaging for wish \( elektra 61309 cassette and cd \) includes an epigraph from shelley that concludes , our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought , and for more than a decade the cure has told of sad thoughts almost exclusively tormented love shades into unspeakable loneliness devastated hopes lead to thoughts of murder or intimations of death as the band s music has veered from punk concision to dancerock to somber ballads , the lyrics have rarely wavered from the essence of moperock smith sings in a hurt , desperate voice , one that bays and then breaks as he keeps finding new ways to tear himself apart although his singing immediately separates fans from skeptics , smith has managed to avoid selfparody , perhaps because he has been so extreme from the beginning the cure s songs offer the flip side of the widely promoted image of adolescence all youthful exuberance and wellbonded groups and a promising future and perfect skin the cure speaks to people left out of that fantasy , to adolescents and postadolescents who feel isolated and unloved , who wo n't or ca n't fit in if such people are a minority , they 're a sizable one the cure s recent albums have sold in the millions , and on the band s last tour , in 1989 , the cure filled giants stadium kiss me kiss me kiss me , released in 1987 , offered some strippeddown rockers , and the 1990 collection of remixes , mixed up , emphasized the beat , suitable for dance disk jockeys although it has n't disdained public gatherings like concerts and clubs , the cure knows that its music is usually heard in private disintegration , released in 1989 , and wish are both made for the most solitary listening through earphones portable stereos have made earphones part of most listeners' routine yet surprisingly few performers have chosen the kind of sonic subtleties that reigned during headphones' last heyday , the psychedelic late 1960 s and early 1970 s , when musicians from the steve miller band to pink floyd stretched out songs and tucked unlikely sounds into the background for hyperattentive fans \( apart , on wish , is a pure pink floyd homage \) many current bands try to jolt and tickle soundbitesize attention spans or to pound home a knock'emdead riff simultaneously , digital clarity has led to a backlash of guitar murk and general noise but the cure has found its own kind of excess making every song a sea of riffs not one bassline , but two , three not one guitar hook , but layers of harmony and countermelody , and a vocal line that follows none of them the riffs do n't mesh and then repeat instead , they drift and contend , surge and collapse with disintegration and now with wish , the cure has returned to the dirgelike tempos it used in the early 1980 s now , however , the songs have thickened , as the band has added keyboards and allowed itself to pile on studio overdubs , with sounds floating across the stereo field on disintegration , keyboards and basses clouded the atmosphere wish turns up the guitars , using them to pick out lines and to fill arrangements with woozy disorientation the melody lines and arrangements often paraphrase older cure songs cut derives its frantic wahwah guitars from the kiss on kiss me kiss me kiss me the magisterial keyboards of trust recall homesick from disintegration the march beat and multiple basses of high look back to in between days from the head on the door \( 1985 \) yet the new songs sound less stable , more distracted , bleary with noise and uncertainty it s psychedelia , but turned insideout what sounded in the 1960 s like an explosion of possibilities is now a dank nightmare , full of looming terrors a drumbeat that mutates into a phased whoosh , a guitar line that melts into its own reverberation singing crisply defined rock , smith used to present his character s pain and dread as if it were an objective fact in his more recent songs , that pain has become a private condition , echoing between the ears though he has long sounded like someone at the end of his tether , smith now seems not only trapped inside his own head , but also impatient with his role as the voice of lonely suffering doing the unstuck is one attempt at escape , and so is the album s final song , end giving up and going on , he sings , are both the same old song eventually , he begs please stop loving me i am none of these things but after all this time , what else can he be \? happy \? photo robert smith of the cure the new album is made for the most solitary kind of listening , through earphones \( jay blakesberg retna \)

what if none of the candidates for president win in november \? in a threeway standoff , the house would decide but first it needs rules to govern its voting it is time to start preparing well before the election the house has elected two presidents , in 1801 and 1825 both decisions were highly contentious , and a new one would surely be so students of politics identify sound ways to reduce the prospect of a damaging deadlock yet house speaker thomas foley shows no interest he is said to fear that merely to open the question helps ross perot that s no excuse public confidence in the electoral system would be sorely tested if the election were thrown into the house , particularly when confidence in washington is low if that happens , better to write rules now , before the argument is colored by the nov 3 vote the 12th amendment to the constitution sets only broad guidelines if no candidate wins an electoral vote majority , the house votes on the three leading candidates each state has one vote , and a majority of 26 is needed to win america votes in five months , and the following questions need answers before then should each state s house vote be cast by incumbents whose terms are about to expire , or by the members elected in november \? in 1801 and 1825 the old house voted but this time the argument favors the new house , truly new because of reapportionment should the thirdplace finisher be dropped if the first ballot yields no winner \? yes , to avoid a possible crisis of indecision should the proceedings be secret , as in 1801 and 1825 \? that s unthinkable should members again cast secret ballots \? modern attitudes about openness make this unthinkable too in a paper written for the house rules committee in 1980 , when john anderson made a serious independent bid , representative martin frost of texas raised all these questions , plus another that he called the single most important should states determine their vote by majority or plurality \? in 1801 and 1825 , state votes were decided by the majority of each delegation two evenly split states in 1801 were n't counted but mr frost argued for a plurality rule , with good reason a threecandidate race increases the likelihood that a state delegation could not find a majority for any one , and thus could not vote a plurality rule avoids that problem whatever rules are written by the current house could , of course , be rewritten by the new one nonetheless advance spadework would be worthwhile to minimize partisanship , it could be done by a special committee , with equal democratic and republican membership and a balanced representation of states the election of a president might be at stake public acceptance of the winner depends on confidence that he was chosen fairly the constitution s odd coupling if a presidential election winds up in the house , then the seante elects the vice president it is always possible that the two bodies would elect candidates who were n't running mates , but it is more likely in a threeway race under the constitution , the house chooses from the top three electoral votegetters for president while the senate chooses from only the top two candidates for vice president that inconsistency needs fixing by constitutional amendment before it makes trouble
never has terry porter been so accurate from so far for so long in a game nor has any other national basketball association player porter went 7 for 7 from 3point range to set a league record while matching his career high with 40 points in the portland trail blazers' 130116 victory saturday night over the golden state warriors at oakland , calif i 've never been that hot , said porter , whose club is off to a 40 start i 've been in situations where i 've shot the ball extremely well and missed two or three shots , but never to the point where i went 100 percent outside in 3point range the shooting exhibition eclipsed by one chuck person s previous record for most 3point attempts in a game with none missed person went 6 for 6 for the indiana pacers in a game against the phoenix suns on feb 11 , 1987 porter did most of his damage in the fourth quarter , when he scored 25 points \( ap \)
moscow , dec 15 at 4 pm , as the winter sky darkens , thousands of traders from the giant fleamarket at the luzhniki sports stadium here trudge homeward through the dirt and slush , lugging bags and suitcases stuffed with unsold goods for many russians today , this is the market that the politicians have been talking about in the kremlin for all these weeks it is not a free exchange of goods and services , it is not checking accounts or credit cards , or even unemployment benefits and unpaid bills it is standing in the cold for hours on end , holding up cheap cosmetics , or sweaters imported from turkey , or the odd pair of boots or shoes , waiting for someone to come and buy during the twoweeklong battle at the congress of people s deputies , president boris n yeltsin s conservative opposition turned on this brisk , if crude retail trade as a symptom of what had gone wrong with the economic program on monday , the country s new prime minister , viktor s chernomyrdin , seemed to echo their line when in his first television interview , he declared he wanted the country to move to a real market and not a bazaar our country with its powerful infrastructure , with its wealth in resources must not become a country of small shopkeepers , he said , in a comment that sent a chill today through the rickety network of street fairs , renovated kiosks and commercial shops that have sprung up in moscow and other cities over the last year it may be entrylevel capitalism , but after 11 months of economic change , for many people , trading is simply a way of surviving so , while world leaders and local commentators excitedly pondered the resignation of yegor t gaidar , the program s architect , and the appointment of mr chernomyrdin in his stead , here at luzhniki the news registered in more sullen ways , as traders took stock of the day s take pavel , a 28yearold aviation mechanic , came the closest to testing the reaction to the latest news from the kremlin each day , he comes to luzhniki to buy privatization vouchers , pieces of paper issued to all russian citizens last oct 1 as their share in the national wealth issued at a face value of 10 , 000 rubles , the vouchers had tumbled to 4 , 000 in street trading until recently , when with the first official auctions of stateowned factories , they began to climb up again slowly today , the value of the voucher fell again on moscow s infant stock exchanges and the best pavel could offer his customers was 6 , 000 rubles there is no certainty now , said pavel , who declined to give his last name i'm worried too if those who do serious business do n't want to put their money in vouchers , they must know something nothing is likely to change before the new year , but after that i do n't know as far as i can tell , chernomyrdin is not of the same view as gaidar in his case , buying vouchers on the street , and selling them to brokers is a way to earn from 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 rubles a week , much more than at his old state job what we have to do now is accumulate capital , said pavel s colleague , who declined to give his name but then the question will be where to put it lyudmila , a 44yearold unemployed teacher who comes to luzhniki twice a week , also had a bad day today , selling only six handknit baby outfits , for 600 rubles apiece of that , she will keep 300 rubles , with the rest split five ways among the other members of her cooperative in the gathering gloom , as a police truck drove by with its bullhorn blaring at the crowd to vacate the stadium grounds , lyudmila , who declined to give her last name , stopped to give her thoughts about the new government taking shape in the kremlin , a few miles away the government itself does not seem to know what it wants to do next , she said the problem is that this transition is taking such a long time these reforms are going so slowly , and in the meantime , it is very difficult for people to live trading a lucrative sideline across town , irina pogribnaya was spending part of the afternoon browsing through petrovski passage , a turnofthecentury mall in the heart of moscow that is now restored and filled with two floors of gleaming boutiques on the ground floor , besides a german clothing store , there is a honda show room , a kodak film processing center , a french cosmetic outlet , a russian souvenir stand , a flower shop and a booth selling eyeglasses most , but not all , of the stores sell for dollars only , putting most of the goods beyond the reach of the ordinary russian , particularly those on government salaries but even if the glitter is more than they can afford , the people strolling down the passage s midway this afternoon were not complaining about its existence most agree that this influx of imported goods , and the glimpse of the good life they can provide , has been one of the benefits of the economic changes last year like lyudmila , mrs pogribnaya , who is 40 , has taken up trading to supplement the family income with three small children , she can devote only a few days a week to her business , which consists of selling food produce outside her local subway station in a good week , she brings home 14 , 000 rubles , enough to keep herself smartly dressed , to pay for her children s private music and english lessons , and to keep up with the inflation that has been steadily rising all year her earnings compensate for her husband s low salary with 25 years' experience and a graduate degree , he earns 3 , 700 rubles a month as chief building engineer we cannot afford any big luxuries , she said but i can buy expensive cosmetics for holidays and for new years , i can bring my children here to buy toys dealing for space three months ago , vladimir kronov opened a shop on the frunzinskaya embankment one of a growing number of businesses that have finally moved indoors , and off the streets at 50 , mr kronov has made a transition from governmentpaid scientific researcher to a manager of a commodity exchange that specialized in lumber and now to a private store owner like other small businesses in russia , mr kronov s company , faber , is made up of many parts in one room , he sells what he describes as moscow s best collection of meissen porcelain and 17thcentury engravings in another , he sells used furniture and rugs on commission , while the shelves in the front room are stocked with french brandy , georgian wine , sparklers , chewing gum and japanese soup packets but none of that could have found a home had mr kronov not agreed with local authorities to subsidize a bankrupt dry cleaner that is the legal occupant of the firstfloor premises that kind of tenuous arrangement is just an example of the travails of russia s small businesses mr kronov was no fan of mr gaidar s taxation policies , but he is worried that mr chernomyrdin has even less comprehension of how things work on the economy s lower rungs he has experience in major industry , he said but i worry about whether he has any understanding of small and medium business we still face alot of artificial difficulties
the son is a star , but his mother is a legend andre collins is a strong side linebacker for the super bowl favorite washington redskins frances collins is the strongwilled matriarch of a family that has almost enough people to field its own team and even a sportsagent daughter , cheryl , to make the backroom deals but while andre collins led the redskins in total tackles this season with 151 and in solo tackles with 91 , he has some catching up to do with his mother in terms of productivity people come up to me , say they 've wanted to meet me and ask for my autograph , frances collins said this week in an interview from her home in cinnaminson , nj , a town outside philadelphia i sign all my autographs the same frances collins , mother of 19 breaking it down with her husband , charles , a wallpaper hanger for 47 years , frances collins has raised her 12 girls and 7 boys in a splitlevel home in the town in which she has lived all of her life her own parents raised eight children and when her mother died recently at the age of 81 , there were 54 grandchildren left behind i never thought much about having a large family , she said , it just happened and i never had one regret despite the attention , giving birth to 19 children \( none of them twins \) over a 22year span has never been that big a deal to frances collins , never a life that seemed more unmanageable than anyone else s they all seemed to be eating dinner at different times , ' she said i went to bed later than most mothers and i woke up earlier every outfit for school had to be laid out the night before , all the lunches made but , believe me , it was n't that hard it was a labor of love for that reason , and as not to encourage stereotyping her home as overcrowded and deprived , family members politely discourage questions about children sharing bedrooms or being forced to make material sacrifices we lived very close , but it was very comfortable , said andre , the 12th child it was nice closeness there were always pairs of kids or groups of three that hung out together a lot of people think it was a burden or hard , but the one thing my mother always made sure we had was clothes to go to school , clothes we could be proud of , just to be like the other kids role models it is also clear that appearances were only a small part of the collins family values what you have to understand is that despite the incredible number of children , this family is a model for families all over the town , including my own , said jim robinson , a teacher at cinnaminson high school , who was the football coach when andre played they all seem very close , all supporting and helping each other achieve all of the 15 collins children who have finished high school there are four between the ages of 13 and 17 have either graduated from college or are now enrolled all 15 received athletic or academic scholarships and a 16th , jason , is being highly recruited by penn state , rutgers and other division i schools as a senior football star at cinnaminson it had to be that way , frances collins said of her childrens' scholarships otherwise , they could n't have gone she is hoping jason will follow in the footsteps of his older brothers andre , gerald and phil , who all received football scholarships to penn state with a 37 grade point average , andre graduated with a degree in health planning and administration gerald , a running back , will graduate next spring and hopes to go in the middle rounds of the national football league draft phil was redshirted by coach joe paterno during his freshman season after he is drafted , gerald will be represented in contract negotiations by cheryl \( seton hall , class of 1986 \) , hired recently by the kamson corporation , an englewood , nj , realestate company that recently took the plunge into sports marketing and management gerald was cheryl s first recruit , but after trips to recent bowl games , she thinks kamson s list of clients is certain to grow most of the collins women also played sports , cheryl placing second in collegiate fencing one year at seton hall but as one of frances collins s daughters , she quickly became accustomed to mothering younger footballplaying brothers sharing the load as the older girls matured , they took a little bit of the burden off my mother by taking care of the little ones , andre said especially on saturday mornings , after frances collins began the ritual of the 5 am departure to state college , pa , for that week s penn state game i do n't know if it s because i'm a woman , but players are willing to talk to me , cheryl said of her business acumen i think it really helps that i 've been involved so closely with my brothers it s all very natural when andre was hearing pitches from agents after being picked by washington in the 1990 second round , cheryl interviewed many of them , and a couple , she said , offered her a job in the hope of making it a package deal andre settled on a group called eastern athletics i'm not going to put any pressure on him , cheryl said but i would n't be surprised if he wound up here hitting the road as andre said , the collins children have long been used to operating in groups on sunday , 12 family members , headed by frances collins , will be in minneapolis as the redskins play the buffalo bills charles collins will not , opting for the comfort of his recreation room , in front of his largescreen television , a gift from andre my father is not a coldweather person , so he usually stays home and keeps things together , said cheryl collins my mother is the one who s always gone to the games that s how she s stayed trim , in great shape , by running around after 19 kids photos cheryl collins , a sports agent , and andre collins , a linebacker for the redskins , are just 2 of 19 children in the collins family i never had one regret , said frances collins , their mother , of her brood \( barton

for the rangers , last night was supposed to be the start of something big , the start of an eightweek journey toward the first stanley cup since 1940 for hockey s most frustrated franchise but this really was the start of why mark messier was imported from the edmonton oilers after having marched in five playoff parades there this was why the rangers' general manager , neil smith , wrapped a silk ribbon around a package containing bernie nichols , louie debrusk , steven rice and 5 million , then shipped it shortly after the season began to the oilers for the now 31yearold center this was why smith convinced the paramount communications executives and accountants that messier was worth the fiveyear 13 million contract that he signed on dec 11 , a contract that reportedly includes 380 , 000 in bonus money if the rangers win the cup this was why the rangers were charging 85 for a side loge seat in madison square garden last night and why they were charging 16 for a seat up in the corner of the top tier but for more than two periods in the opener of this bestfourofsevengame opening series with the new jersey devils , this ranger team resembled all those other ranger teams by carefully and cautiously protecting a 10 lead on darren turcotte s early goal , the rangers appeared vulnerable then a voice midway up the garden slopes implored , let s go rangers wake up wake up indeed , it s the playoffs as if on cue , mike gartner , swooping in from behind the net , tucked in the puck for a 20 lead after hot goaltender chris terreri had skidded to the other side gartner s goal would make the difference in the rangers' 21 victory as goaltender john vanbiesbrouck held off the devils in the final minutes of a typical stanley cup game close checking , close score messier , hounded by claude lemieux , did n't score or collect an assist , but in his pregame address , he did remind his teammates of the stanley cup syndrome do n't lose your poise , do n't be suckered into a cheap penalty that would provide the devils with a powerplay opportunity we discussed composure , messier said we did a pretty good job of that it s tough enough to play five on five , much less four on five none of the goals were on power plays as the ranger penaltykillers extended their streak of having allowed only one goal to a total of 63 shorthanded situations that s more than two hours giving up only one goal , coach roger neilson said that must be a record for more than half a century , the rangers had never been considered the national hockey league s best team going into the playoffs but last night , as the garden rocked with the great expectations of fans who had suffered for too long , messier was accorded the loudest roar when , one by one , the rangers were introduced it started in the warmup , messier said it s incredible playing in a rink like that messier played in a rink like that in edmonton and over the previous eight years , he was on only three oiler teams that were eliminated in the playoffs now , after having led the rangers to the best overall record in the nhl during the strikeinterrupted season , he s expected to lead the rangers to the promised land during his 12 consecutive years with the oilers in the playoffs , messier established one stanley cup record , 11 career shorthanded goals messier also ranks second in career playoff points , 215 , behind wayne gretzky , and second in career playoff assists , 135 , also behind gretzky he ranked sixth in career playoff goals with 80 , behind gretzky , jari kurri , mike bossy , maurice richard and glenn anderson only bossy and the rocket did not score most of their playoff goals for the oilers mess is the best player in the league , he 'll win the hart trophy , his left wing , adam graves , said the way some people talk about him , you should put a cape on him and let him fly around but the reason we wound up first was because we played as a team for any team in any sport , it s always more difficult to win when you 're expected to win and for the first time in the memory of most ranger fans , the rangers are expected to win the stanley cup in that situation , the first round can often be the most dangerous i was talking to cliff fletcher the other night , said neilson , referring to the toronto maple leafs' general manager who assembled the 1989 stanley cup champion calgary flames he told me that for a good team , the key round is the first round if you get your confidence in the first round , you can carry it through that s what the flames did despite a sluggish start in the first game of their first round , these rangers escaped with a 10 lead in the series after playing the devils so often in our division , messier said , there s no secrets , no feelingout process we know them just as the devils know why the rangers imported mark messier to win the stanley cup for the first time since 1940
manezi , italy he may look natural at his work and his victories this season might well be because of a prodigious inborn talent for keeping his weight centered and forward while tracing the straightest , fastest line between two gates but in italy , where alberto tomba is one of the country s most precious national treasures , no one is leaving anything up to mother nature it was clear that alberto had an unprecedented potential as a skier , said giorgio d'urbano , the conditioning trainer in the fourman equipe that has followed tomba for the last three years , since the 1988 olympic gold medalist in slalom and giant slalom slowed down and swelled up after a season of parades , dinners and guest appearances and it was just as clear that this potential could not be allowed to go to waste not a drop of it it would be inexact to say that alberto tomba is the most popular figure in skiing today he is skiing today fans flock to tomba luxembourg s marc girardelli may have won four world cup titles while tomba has won none , and girardelli may ski in all four alpine events compared to tomba s two franz heinzer , the swiss downhill specialist , might run greater risks speeding down the slope at 80 miles an hour than tomba does dancing in and out of slalom gates but nobody draws people to skiing like tomba , especially in italy almost 20 , 000 fans turned up in sestriere on dec 10 to cheer him on to his second slalom victory of the year the following sunday at val badia , a crowd of more than 30 , 000 including 31 busloads of supporters from a fan club in bologna showed up as tomba overtook switzerland s paul accola in the world cup standing with a victory in the giant slalom he clinched the world cup slalom season title with a victory on jan 26 in the final slalom before the winter olympics the notoriety is exhilarating , but difficult tomba regularly needs a police escort to walk from the finish line to his hotel subject to heavy pressure of course we like the attention , said d'urbano but you ca n't imagine the sort of pressure that alberto is subject to last year , alberto came in second in the overall world cup , won the world cup giantslalom title , and people wrote that he had a bad year , said gustavo thoeni , the fourtime world cup winner who has been tomba s onski trainer since 1989 it s kind of hard to live up to those expectations in a sport where most competitors still get in shape for the racing season by jogging , tomba and his team represent a revolution working full time \( and paid a total of 208 , 000 by a grateful italian ski federation \) , d'urbano thoeni andreas felderer , a physical therapist , and fulvio cuizza , a sports psychologist , tend to tomba with the minute thoroughness that a formula i auto racing team devotes to its 12cylinder cars following a strict diet developed by the equipe enervit the same sports dietitians who assisted the recordsetting cyclist , francesco moser , and others tomba quickly returned to his fighting trim , dropping from 206 pounds to 191 for the 198990 season it was n't just a question of giving up sweets , said d'urbano , a ski instructor with a degree in physical education this was an eating strategy , created specifically for alberto we wanted to increase his muscle mass , to make him more powerful along with the diet , the team created a training program for the world s greatest slalom and giantslalom skier the conventional thinking has always been that all a skier needs is a good general condition to be competitive , said d'urbano but we realized that tomba needed a sprinter s preparation he has to ski 50 gates , and last for a minute or so we eliminated all endurance training and replaced it with speed training on the slopes , thoeni tries to coax his pupil through the gates like a trainer would a thoroughbred a person whom tomba describes as a man of few words , and all the right ones , thoeni was perhaps the only trainer with the experience and authority to command respect from tomba the idea was to create ideal conditions for him to work under , said thoeni alberto is not always ready to work out we try to vary his routine so he can enjoy himself there have been other issues with tomba when the 25yearold skier won consecutive races to open the season , he dropped to his knees and kissed the snow in park city , utah , celebrating the breaking of a jink that had resulted in him falling or skiing off course in five of last year s nine world cup slaloms i was n't giving thanks for winning , tomba said i was giving thanks that i had managed to stay on my feet all the way down to the bottom it got to the point last year that he was afraid to go to the starting gate because all he could think about was falling , said thoeni the one member of the team who is able to help tomba deal with the fear is cuizza , the sports psychologist who also assists the soccer club ac milan it was clear that alberto did n't need psychoanalysis , said d'urbano what he needed was someone to help him with his concentration and to deal with the pressure alberto s emotions are very intense before a race , especially here in italy we ca n't afford for this pressure to transform into panic , which is an emotion that disperses nervous energy if looked at properly , pressure can be used as a stimulus , an ally if tomba maintains his current pace , he may win his first world cup title , even without competing in the highspeed superg races that he has always shunned but tomba is thinking of something else four years ago i was at alberta , tomba likes to joke his typically bolognese hedonism , his flippant humor stand out in contrast to the methodic precision of his team he knows he is the one who has to perform and things went well february i 'll be at albertville and if there s anything in a name photo alberto tomba , whose work habits , training table preferences and concentration levels needed complete overhauls , has himself in top shape for the slalom races at val d'isere \( nancie battaglia \)

islip , li , april 9 when peggy gaultieri moved into her home in holbrook near long island macarthur airport more than 20 years ago , town officials assured her that only prop planes would use the runways and that the field , surrounded by scrub pine , would never become a major airport now , town officials are planning to expand the airport s two major runways , citing safety requirements and ms gaultieri and other residents of communities near the airport envision jumbo jets rumbling overhead islip s supervisor , frank jones , announced the plans last week , calling for extending the southwest and northeast runways by 1 , 000 feet , to 7 , 000 feet and 6 , 700 feet , saying the move would make the airport safer i know this is a controversial decision , mr jones said but i have spent a great deal of time studying all of its aspects , and in my judgment , the extensions will add a significant safety factor to the future use of the airport the shorter runways at macarthur airport , long island s only commercial passenger airport , have forced airlines to use smaller planes or to carry lighter loads the heavier the plane , the more runway it needs to reach speeds high enough to achieve sufficient lift for takeoff different issue aloft critics , however , are not convinced the bigger runways are not meant for safety , but rather as an excuse to justify bigger planes , said steve levy , a suffolk county legislator who lives in sayville , which , along with ronkonkoma and bayport , is in line with the southwest runway flights using the airport s northeast runway pass over bohemia , holbrook and farmingville , where homeowners have seen the scrub pine give way to sprawling industrial parks , office buildings and motels the plan has been welcomed by airlines and the island s business community , but residents who have long opposed expansion vow to continue their fight at the next islip town board meeting , to be held april 21 the 56 million project , which would take 18 months to complete , requires the approval of the town board and the federal aviation administration the faa has cited macarthur as one of several small airports that could be used to relieve congestion at kennedy , la guardia and newark airports macarthur airport , once a rural aerodrome approached by a dirt road where passengers parked free in a grassy lot , has given way to circular , colorcoded access roads for arrivals and departures and long and shortterm parking , none of it free usair and american airlines , the two major carriers at macarthur , say the runway extensions would make more flights to florida and major airline hubs , like dallas , possible some major airlines have bypassed macarthur because its runways limited the number of passengers or weight their planes could handle for example , american airlines canceled its nonstop flights from macarthur to miami last summer because it had to leave a third of the 150 seats on its boeing 727s empty , said john byrnes , american s general manager at macarthur mr jones said the extra length would enable the runways to remain in use during inclement weather and give pilots extra room during takeoff and landing to win over residents , mr jones said islip would offer to pay for soundproofing , airconditioning and other improvements for up to 260 homes nearest the airport he said the cost would be about 15 , 000 per home and would be financed from a 3 fee to be charged each passenger flying into macarthur airport mr levy argued that there was nothing unsafe about the airport unless the town decided to bring in bigger planes he said that the shorter runways have precluded this possibility , and that s exactly why we oppose expansion ms gaultieri said that her homeowners' group , the holbrook triangle civic association , was not opposed to the operation of the airport , since many local residents enjoy its use , but do not want to see it become the next kennedy she and other civic leaders dispute the argument that they have no right to complain about the airport since they knew it was there when they bought their homes when the vast majority of current residents moved here , macarthur was utilized by strictly prop planes , mr levy said they were assured that it would never be a major metropolitan airfield no one is being an extremist and saying 'close down the airport , ' mr levy said we 've all enjoyed its convenience , and we do derive a good deal of revenue from it but there have to be limits and boundaries
paris , june 4 barry f sullivan , the former highpowered banker who was appointed new york city s top economic development official five weeks ago , gave a news photographer here an uncomfortable frozen smile today as he demonstrated a frenchmade public toilet that new york city is considering leasing i can see the headlines you 're writing now , mr sullivan said under his breath to reporters well , i 've done my part being photographed inside a public toilet is emblematic of the many changes in mr sullivan s professional life since he retired last fall as the head of first chicago bank and accepted mayor david n dinkins s offer to become his deputy mayor for finance and economic development in his first significant act in his new post , mr sullivan has escorted mr dinkins through business meetings in london and paris in the last four days the trip was organized by the new york chamber of commerce and industry by persuading mr dinkins to lead a delegation of business leaders , mr sullivan has emerged as the administration s main connection to new york s business establishment big switch in roles when he took office in march , mr sullivan , 61 years old and a bronx native , exchanged the powerful but largely private job of running the united states' 10thlargest bank for the intensely public role of selling new york to investors and persuading failing businesses to remain in a city reeling from the effects of the recession and federal budget cuts mr sullivan says he is trying to adjust to life in the spotlight because decisions usually require a political consensus , they take longer than they did in the private sector , he said , and for the first time in his life , how his actions play in the news media counts almost as much as their results the press is far more important in the political arena than i would have thought it was , mr sullivan said in an interview in his paris hotel room today it s tough it is something that does n't come naturally to me as it does to the mayor i can watch the mayor think in media terms and that is not my first instinct i'm learning to do that his appointment was widely interpreted as a sign that mr dinkins wanted to patch up his relationship with the city s business leaders , who have complained bitterly that the administration has not done enough to help business his first move was to make peace between the chamber of commerce and industry and mr dinkins , who had to responded to an invitation to lead the delegation to europe mr dinkins , bitter about criticism from some prominent chamber members over his handling of the city s budget negotiations , was planning his own trade mission to germany i came in and said why do n't we see if we can do these two things together , which is exactly what we did , mr sullivan said since sunday , the mayor and more than a dozen new york executives have held seminars and meetings with scores of european businesses here and in london the mayor has tried to sell new york as a comeback city with a soft commercial realestate market and declining crime seriously successful' several delegation members said mr sullivan had played a criticial role in arranging meetings with chief executive officers , especially bankers at national westminister bank and credit local de france interested in doing business with the city barry is a seriously successful capitalist , said one member of the mayor s delegation who insisted on anonymity these executives know it when he walks in the door daniel gronich , a new york realestate executive , said mr sullivan s appointment had convinced him and other business leaders that mr dinkins was finally serious about economic development this guy was chairman of a moneycenter bank , mr gronich said that broke the ice the business community said to the mayor , 'ok , let s work together' foreign investment is goal in the interview , mr sullivan stressed that his general plans for revitalizing the city s economy depended upon attracting foreign investment from service industries already linked to new york s economy , like entertainment , financial services and fashion but he said he also intended to develop programs to help subsidize biochemical and other hightech companies and to encourage small businesses to expand he conceded that many of his plans were sketchy i'm comfortable , he said i'm only in the job for five months a major difficulty new york faces , he said , is the dearth of cheap labor another significant obstacle to developing new businesses and retaining old ones , he said , is the city bureaucracy itself a large corporation that deals with new york , he said , may deal with seven , eight or nine agencies many times , he said , none of the agencies are aware the company is dealing with the others in contrast , mr sullivan thinks of the businesses as the city s customers and insists that the government must become more customer friendly most foreign executives mr sullivan has met on the trip think the united states is coming out of its recession faster than britain or france , he said , and are eager to invest in new york still , he said , he and mr dinkins have had to fight new york s image as a crimeridden , deteriorating metropolis with high taxes where they have an issue , it tends to be the quality of life , mr sullivan said they say , 'we want to hear you talk about safety' photo barry f sullivan \( the new york times \)
newark , nov 10 the older sister of the mildly retarded woman in the glen ridge sex assault case took the witness stand today and recalled how her sister , at age 5 and 6 , ate dog feces and mud cakes at the urging of other children the witness , elizabeth verillo , also testified that in 1989 , the year of the events in question in the trial , the young woman , then 17 years old , frequently played with children 5 , 6 and 7 years old and mrs verillo said that she had never heard her sister make any sexual comments i do n't believe she has feelings like that , mrs verillo said the 24yearold mrs verillo , who is married and the mother of two sons , is the first member of the young woman s family to testify against the four former glen ridge football players charged with sexual assault on march 1 , 1989 the defense says that the young woman willingly participated in the acts 'your sister s retarded' mrs verillo testified that as a child her sister was called dummy , retarded and piggy and was mocked by other children because she was enrolled in a special education class in elementary school people used to come up to me and say , 'your sister s retarded , ' she told a prosecutor , robert laurino mrs verillo is the first prosecution witness in the trial , now nearly a month old , to describe any negative interaction between the young woman and two of the defendants , kevin and kyle scherzer , 21yearold twins when her sister was 5 , mrs verillo said , she was with playmates and they made her eat dog feces kyle and kevin were there , she said before mrs verillo could say anything else , a defense attorney , thomas ford , who represents another defendant , christopher archer , objected and asked for a private conference between all the lawyers and the judge , r benjamin cohen during the conversation at the side of judge cohen s bench , the scherzer twins sat alone at the defense table kyle scherzer s eyes were downward , fixed on the table kevin scherzer looked straight ahead , tapping his fingers the private meeting with judge cohen apparently dealt with his pretrial ruling in september involving the feces incident a ruling on identification he told prosecutors then that they could refer to the incident in the trial , to build their argument that the young woman was vulnerable and susceptible but the judge ordered in september that none of the defendants could be identified before the jury as participants nothing was said in open court about the subject of the private conference but as it ended and mr laurino resumed his questioning , he directed mrs verillo to discuss only what she observed at the incident she said she saw her sister standing holding a pen covered with feces she had a look of disgust on her face , she testified mrs verillo said she then went home and told her mother and her mother was outraged mr laurino asked nothing further about the incident or the participants , but he asked the witness if she knew anything else her sister did in childhood that other children normally would not do mrs verillo briefly described how she once encountered her sister and other children at a mud puddle , making what mrs verillo called mud hershey bars she said her sister and another girl were told to eat them only her sister did , she said said to never refuse the witness described how her sister had once returned home as a child with one arm covered by red welts and told her parents , they were pinching me mrs verillo said her father asked her sister why she had not stopped the pinching and her sister replied , i do n't know describing how her sister would , while in high school , play with much younger children , mrs verillo said the young children organized the game , and she 'd participate she added , they 'd make up the rules and she would just play along to close his questioning , mr laurino asked the witness if she ever recalled her sister refusing to do anything anybody asked her no , she answered during his crossexamination , mr ford , mr archer s lawyer , asked the witness if she had ever heard her sister use words of a sexual nature starting at age 15 , she replied , her sister would say a guy s got a cute butt she continued , she said it about my husband spectators and jurors alike broke into laughter at the remark , in one of the few light moments in the trial later , another defense attorney , alan zegas , resumed questions about the young woman s sexual vocabulary and asked if she understood the slang expression for masturbation not unless somebody explained it to her , mrs verillo said mr zegas asked the witness if her sister had ever told her she was on birth control pills she does n't know they 're birth control pills , she replied she thinks they 're to regulate her period mr zegas then asked mrs verillo if anyone had ever told her her sister was sexually involved in any way i heard she was making inappropriate comments of a sexual nature , she replied but , she added , i 've never heard her express anything sexual
robert hamilton s interview with cathy juni , speaking out for disabled people \( feb 2 \) , was informative and constructive in many ways , but it presented a very unfair and inaccurate picture of southbury training school your readers deserve to know what southbury training school is really like our current population , 24 years after ms juni left the school , is very different from what she remembers over 77 percent are severely or profoundly retarded , with little or no language , functioning below a 5yearold level in addition , 25 percent are both mentally ill and mentally retarded , and 33 percent are at risk , needing either special drugs or a behavior modification program to help them control behavior problems they are extremely handicapped , and almost none of them would know what to do with the freedom ms juni wants for them people first , a selfadvocacy group for people with developmental disabilities , wants to close southbury training school but the parents and guardians , who after all are the primary advocates for the school s residents , are pleased and relieved to have their relatives living in a protected community set up to meet their very serious handicaps the advantage of having immediate access to medical and psychological help on campus adds to the families' peace of mind at this time , less than 5 percent of the parents and guardians are actively seeking a community residential placement for their relatives at the school that is a very clear message to outsiders who think they know what is best for our children ms juni does n't have any bad memories of southbury , but , she says , there s a lot of people who feel the place is n't good she is listening to the wrong people those who are in closest contact with the school think it s by far the best place for their relatives to be sarah e bondy president home and school association southbury training school
the mostly mozart concert at avery fisher hall on tuesday evening was an unusually vivid demonstration that a single orchestra , on a single evening , can play appallingly in one part of the program and with distinction elsewhere gerard schwarz conducted the program and delivered the bad news first , a slovenly account of bach s brandenburg concerto no 1 performances as brisk as mr schwarz s are not uncommon these days , and there are performers who regard tempo as a paramount issue but daredevil speeds demand precision mr schwarz s players played the music as if they had been roused from a sound sleep and dragged onstage they lurched through the first movement , delivering muddy string lines and woefully imprecise horn playing , and tumbling into each other at the cadences within this mess , mr schwarz s conscientious ornamentation and his rescoring of the repeats in the menuetto sounded fussy amends were made immediately andre watts , a pianist heard most frequently in romantic repertory , gave a reading of mozart s piano concerto no 24 in c minor \( k 491 \) that showed an affinity for the classical style his playing was clean , perceptive and reasoned , and he struck a sensible balance between the work s two battling impulses , dramatic storminess and an almost operatic lyricism mr watts did not heed the scholarly suggestion that the soloist support the orchestra in the tuttis but he did provide his own cadenzas , which treated mozart s themes tastefully and concisely mr schwarz and the orchestra were solid , supportive accompanists , and there were none of the mishaps that plagued the bach after the intermission , mr schwarz offered a charming but slight mozartean footnote , a cassation in b flat \( k 99 \) that mozart composed at the age of 13 written as festive music to celebrate the end of the school year , it was not for the ages what its eight brief movements have to say to us today is that at 13 , mozart could comfortably churn out the same pretty , uncompelling music that grownups were producing for celebratory occasions that he eventually pushed the style into deeper waters is , of course , the reason he has remained a fixation in the two centuries since his death the cassation was not dull enough to make a listener doubt that , but just in case , mr schwarz closed the concert with an energetic and finely sculptured account of one of the late symphonies , no 39 in e flat \( k 543 \) at the preconcert recital , pedja muzijevic , the winner of the juilliard william petschek piano debut award , introduced himself with elegant readings of a group of brief , attractive sonatas by galuppi , and a fiery account of chopin s polonaisefantaisie in a flat \( op 61 \)
to the editor joseph horowitz s article advocating opera sung in english is a needed and useful corrective to the more frequent objections to opera in the vernacular we agree that snobbish resistance plays a big part in these objections another factor , not discussed by mr horowitz , is the devastating effect bad translations have had on the receptivity of englishspeaking performers and audiences to operas sung in english the reasons why most english translations have been unspeakably \( and unsingably \) wretched are many and complex but may be oversimplified into three a theory of translation for opera librettos , held by victorian and edwardian translators in particular , that demanded overly constricting literalness and mimicry of rhyme scheme a propensity for sexual censorship , again especially among victorian and edwardian translators , and the hiring of hacks to do many of the translations none of these reasons has anything to do with the three most often cited , which we believe to be totally false english is an unsuitable language for opera because of its sounds \( especially diphthongs and consonant clusters \) english is a rhymepoor language , and opera plots are too silly to bear translation good translations are not only possible but absolutely necessary if opera is to be theater as well as music mark herman , ronnie apter shepherd , mich the writers have translated many opera librettos into english , including the magic flute and la traviata mr horowitz replies actually , my appreciative account of early american experiments with opera in the vernacular in no way suggests that it is practical today for major international houses like the met to mount opera in english on a regular basis as london s english national opera does and as the new york city opera could do if it wanted to incidentally , clara louise kellogg personally supervised the english translations used by her company for the flying dutchman and other operas in the 1870 s the american opera company of 188687 also supervised its own translations like novels , librettos in translation date faster than the originals
chicago , june 4 a day after scoring 39 points against portland , michael jordan took a different sort of shot this afternoon from one of his teammates craig hodges , the bulls' 3point shooting specialist and one of the league s best , chided jordan and other national basketball association players for failing to use their visibility to call attention to pressing social and political issues , from the deepening plight of innercity youth to the failure of owners to hire more black head coaches hodges spoke after the other bulls had left practice for the day , and jordan could not be reached for comment the 31yearold hodges , who has chided jordan in the past , called jordan s lack of response to the recent violence in los angeles a typical maneuver to avoid controversy 'you are bailing out' when they came to michael after the la deal went down and asked him what he thought , his reply was that he was n't really up on what was going on , hodges said i can understand that , but at the same time , that s a bailout situation because you are bailing out when some heat is coming on you we ca n't bail anymore i'm not going to tell michael what to do , hodges continued at the same time , i cannot go talk to young kids and not use michael as an example of what is possible because he has so much and he has children in the palm of his hands hodges s comments came when he was asked about the lack of black head coaches in the nba , which is heavily populated with black players only two head coaches are black hodges said he had suggested to some players that they consider sitting out a playoff game in protest onus on the players twelve jobs come open and none of us gets one that s drastic , hodges said of the recent headcoaching vacancies it s also drastic for us to say 'we 're gong to stop working' but nobody is going to do that the problem is that we are apolitical and we are not unified hodges said he intended to be more critical of fellow players than of owners he said he felt that it is the players who are shirking an obligation at a time when increasingly they are being looked to as beacons of light this is a war , he said we 're in war when you look at what happened in los angeles , what s getting ready to happen in chicago , newark the poverty in the city is so hellish , just look across the street then you have us playing in here how much money did we make here last night \? how many lives will it change \? leadership in america is the athletes and entertainers that s why i feel i have to start speaking out i do n't like to , i do n't like to step on toes i do n't feel like somebody should tell you what you should be doing on one hand , being in this league , you have a right to make as much as you can make , but you have a responsibility a lot of us do n't look at the responsibility end of it as much as we do our right to ask for as much as we can get drexler in agreement clyde drexler , the trail blazers star , said he agreed with hodges he said the absence of blacks as head coaches is a particular problem we talk about it all the time , drexler said eventually , i think something has to be done at some point in time , something has to be said on a national level i think the implication is that you can play , but you ca n't coach or scout or be a gm , and i think those things need to be addressed asked how he felt about sitting out a game , drexler said i think that s more of a strike situation , and i do n't think you want to get into forcing anybody s hand i think you want it to be voluntary
a year after most of new york city s contracts with municipal labor unions expired , contract negotiations are stalled , union officials and mayoral advisers say each side blames the other for the failure to make progress in the talks , whose outcome could have a major impact both on the city s fiscal standing and on the mayoral election next year the city is projecting a budget gap of 13 billion for the fiscal year that begins next july , and the ability of mayor david n dinkins to keep the city s finances stable will depend significantly on the size and shape of the labor settlements the bargaining could also play a role in the mayor s reelection effort support from many municipal labor unions was critical to mr dinkins s election in 1989 , and at least one union official has already suggested that she might not back him next year if she remains dissatisfied with the contract talks no move from positions the major issue in the contract talks is the city s insistence that its fiscal distress is so severe that the only way it can give municipal workers a raise is through productivity savings or other union concessions the city has not budged from its position , and neither have the unions , which say they will discuss concessions only after the dinkins administration first puts some money on the table the dinkins administration has been negotiating intermittently for months with dozens of unions , some of which have formed a large coalition for bargaining while others are negotiating on their own the latest round of talks with the major coalition a group of 15 unions that includes district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , by far the largest municipal union began with some fanfare in june since then , leaders of the coalition have met with city negotiators only twice , according to labor leaders and mayoral advisers there has n't been a whole lot of progress being made , a senior mayoral aide said some city officials speculate that the coalition may be waiting for the city to settle first with the teachers , although those talks , too , are languishing in turn , some union leaders who say the teachers may have the best case for a raise speculate that the city is reluctant to settle first with the teachers some small progress has been made by one of the coalition s bargaining subcommittees on a proposal for an early retirement program that could reduce the city s work force , a labor negotiator said and the sanitation workers agreed in principle to help finance a raise in part through concessions , as the administration has demanded , but a specific agreement eluded negotiators in a contract reached last march , the city gave the sanitation workers a oneyear raise of 35 percent both sides then said they would reach an agreement within a month that would require the trash haulers to work a more complete workday by extending their collection routes the route extensions in a sample collection district were then to serve as a model for achieving similar productivity gains within a year for each of new york s 59 trashcollection districts but the city and the union have still not reached the initial accord , and the matter is in arbitration money , of course , remains at the core of the city s impasse with most of its unions a 1 percent raise for all of the city s more than 200 , 000 workers would cost about 150 million a year so a wage increase that kept pace with inflation , about 35 percent , that would cost the city more than 500 million a year a threeyear contract city officials say they are looking for a longterm deal would cost between 15 billion and 18 billion a year in the third year , city officials say the recession and the city s budget strains make such a wage increase impossible , the mayor and his aides contend the traditional rules of bargaining do not apply , said one of the mayor s advisers they have to work with us to help find solutions but many labor leaders insist that there is some flexibility in the city s 295 billion budget they also contend that their workers deserve a raise and that the city has deliberately hidden money in its budget for an anticipated raise the workers who run this city do a hell of a job , and they need to be treated with respect and dignity , said stanley hill , the executive director of district council 37 of american federation of state , county and municipal employees but finances are only part of the reason for the impasse in the private , complex world of city labor relations , there are many other forces at work that complicate the talks and make progress elusive city officials believe that the slow pace of the talks with mr hill s coalition shows that the unions want the city first to make a deal with the united federation of teachers the teachers , who contend that they are paid less than teachers in other parts of the region , may have the best argument for a significant raise in 1990 , the city settled first with the teachers , granting a 55 percent increase , which mr dinkins s critics contended was too much the agreement made it difficult for other union leaders to settle for substantially less than the teachers' pact
washington the last time a dying man ran for president of the us was in 1944 franklin roosevelt was declared to be in splendid shape by his doctor , adm ross mcintire when the wartime president s haggard appearance and quaking hands started rumors of his high blood pressure and weak heart , his press secretary prevailed on the fbi to investigate a doctor suspected of leaking the truth the story was squelched i remember watching fdr campaign down broadway through the rain , as if to demonstrate robust health he died three months into his fourth term a generation later , lyndon johnson , fighting for the democratic nomination , had his friend john connally put out word that john f kennedy suffered from addison s disease , a glandular affliction requiring cortisone treatment again a respected physician deliberately misled the public dr janet travell described the serious ailment as a wartime depletion of adrenal function from which he is now rehabilitated , and she helped robert kennedy cover up his brother s treatment all during the 1960 campaign perhaps a case can be made during wartime for a doctor surrounding a presidential patient with a bodyguard of lies to keep a commanderin chief s condition from the enemy but that does not excuse a dying president from hiding his illness to benefit his candidacy nor does it excuse the doctors for a candidate in peacetime for misleading the voters a doctor can properly refuse to say anything about a patient , but ethical doctors do not lie does the public have a right to know the intimate details of the health of candidates for president \? do doctors , directed by the candidate to tell the whole truth , have a right to hold back evidence that might lead to a different prognosis \? that issue has been raised again in the case of paul tsongas , who suspended his campaign last month , but not for reasons of health he presented himself as a recovered cancer patient and forthrightly told his doctors in boston to lay out the full details to medical reporters they did not dr lawrence k altman , the medical columnist for the new york times , reported their assertions last month , but it seemed to the writer and to this reader at the time that there was more to the story than the doctors were letting on dr altman kept after them , and now it seems that they failed to provide pertinent information that might conflict with their optimistic prognosis after mr tsongas s bone marrow transplant , the cancer recurred in a lymph node , requiring additional radiation treatment and creating a cause for concern it s hard to fault the gutsy mr tsongas , who may have mentioned the troublesome node to a reporter or two but he did not understand , or was not overly eager to explore , its possible significance his specialists in boston \( whose funerals mr tsongas may well attend \) will issue statements about how forthcoming they have been , or how laymen can never understand the complexities they face but the political fact is this if mr tsongas had been the frontrunner yesterday , his campaign would have been over today when doctors disagree about a person s ability to complete a term , voters will turn elsewhere how do we apply this lesson to future presidential candidates \? we have seen how personal physicians and even entire hospitals have a conflict of interest between patient privacy and public responsibility to avert that conflict , let the republican and democratic national committees appoint a candidate s medical review board that panel could review the candidates' medical records in camera , interview their doctors , examine the candidates if necessary , and issue a simple statement about the candidates' general health as mr tsongas wrote to his doctors yesterday , urging full disclosure , limited access to the record will no longer be an option in the future privacy is a value the public need not pry into any psychological consultations , none of which should be an impediment to public service but good health is a qualification for office we do have the right not to be misled about the life expectancy of the person we make the most powerful leader in the world
san francisco , may 10 over the next three weeks , bill clinton can reasonably expect to win approval from democratic voters in all the remaining presidential primaries except possibly the one in california , where he runs as the underdog against a former governor whose family has been involved in state politics for more than three decades aides to mr clinton say that in most of the remaining primaries he will ignore the former governor of california , edmund g brown jr , and will try to give voters a clearer sense of his own personality and his positions on major issues , in preparation for a general election campaign against president bush presidential primaries will be held in nebraska and west virginia on tuesday , in oregon on may 19 and in kentucky and arkansas on may 26 mr clinton s aides are planning a tickertape parade to celebrate the arkansas governor s homecoming just before the primary there seeking 'reagan democrats' the primary season ends june 2 , when alabama , new jersey , new mexico , montana and ohio vote , along with california , the biggest prize of all mr clinton s strategists say that in campaign appearances leading up to those contests , he will test themes intended to attract reagan democrats , those who abandoned the party s candidates over the last 12 years because ronald reagan s conservative republican agenda more closely matched their own views the people of california , just like the people of pennsylvania , want a discussion of the important national issues , said william m wardlaw of pasadena , chairman of the clinton campaign in california what s important for us is to focus on national issues without being distracted by jerry brown that is the strategy bill clinton will follow in california over the weekend , mr clinton began to campaign in california , like an explorer discovering a strange new world he addressed diverse audiences , from the politically conservative suburbs of san diego , near the mexican border , to affluent areas of pasadena , los angeles and the san fernando valley , to san francisco , where he visited churches and a mexicanamerican festival chance to 'define himself' james carville , senior strategist for the clinton campaign , said that though the fight for the democratic nomination had lost some of its intensity , the remaining primaries offer us a good opportunity to have governor clinton get out there and define himself and talk about what he wants to do as president fundraising needs will be almost as important as strategy in determining mr clinton s itinerary in the next three weeks his campaign , which has raised nearly 12 million in contributions from 39 , 300 people since november , estimates that california alone will cost more than 1 million the states holding primaries in the next three weeks include more than onefourth of the nation s population mr clinton already has 1 , 665 of the 2 , 145 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the democratic national convention in new york city from july 13 to 16 nearly 900 delegates are at stake in the remaining primaries george devanney , executive director of the new jersey democratic state committee , said the clinton campaign was just beginning to organize a network of volunteers in that state asked if he had seen any political activity in support of mr brown , he said , none , and added brown did have appeal at one time , but it seemed to peak during the new york primary once he lost the new york primary , interest in brown waned known in new jersey mr devanney said that the governor of new jersey , jim florio , has provided information to the clinton people and has been helpful with fundraising and organizing , but has not formally endorsed the arkansas governor clinton aides say they assume that mr clinton is known to new jersey residents from his campaigning and advertising in new york and pennsylvania , which held primaries last month sam barone , executive director of the ohio democratic party , said that if brown does well in california , clinton will have to look to ohio and possibly new jersey to put him over the top mr barone said clinton has been extremely well organized in ohio since december , when there was a cluttered field of six democratic candidates for president clinton has the state well wired the manager of mr clinton s national campaign , david wilhelm , is from athens , ohio , and one of the deputy managers , george stephanopoulos , is from cleveland mr barone said it was difficult to know how strong brown would be in the ohio primary , but he said the former california governor did not have a broad base of obvious support looking to the general election on nov 3 , mr barone said ohio is a classic bellwether state it s also a quintessential swing state , very unpredictable , and cannot be taken for granted by either party there is one issue here it s the economy if the economy does not significantly improve by june or july , it probably wo n't trickle down in time to help republicans here in the general election the ohio primary , originally scheduled for may 5 , was shifted to june 2 because of delays in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts in california , mr clinton is not well known the california primary campaign is a critical period for clinton to come into the state and get ready for the general election campaign , said william a carrick , a democratic strategist and consultant in los angeles he should spend a lot of time here and use california as a launching pad for november mr wardlaw , the chairman of the clinton campaign in california , said we start here with jerry brown having many builtin advantages , a long history in the state and a reservoir of support among democratic party activists , who are important in the primary early polls showed brown with a substantial lead but i believe the gap will close as we introduce clinton to more and more people in california we have nowhere to go but up mr brown was governor of california from 1975 to 1983 his father , edmund g brown sr , was governor from 1959 to 1967 his sister , kathleen brown , is the state treasurer philip n angelides , chairman of the california democratic party , said , i 'd expect jerry , at the worst , to get 35 to 40 percent of the vote in the democratic primary in oregon , carol h auger , executive director of the state s democratic party , predicted that mr clinton would win the presidential primary there by a comfortable margin , because he was seen as the most viable candidate we have but she said mr brown would get at least 15 percent of the vote mr brown campaigned in oregon on thursday , and mr clinton plans to visit the state this week photo gov bill clinton

some people are not convinced that figure skating , with its ballet music and its style points , is even a sport i say , let rickey henderson try to steal second base while staying in sync with erik satie or tchaikovsky , and see what kind of marks he gets whatever figure skating is , cbs is going to show 44 hours of it from albertville , all of them in american prime time without figure skating , the winter games would feel like just another afternoon of wide world of sports people you never heard of performing sports you notice once every four years figure skating is the reigning monarch of the winter olympics and it is the only sport in the world in which the women are vastly more popular than the men some of us feel that women s tennis has been just as compelling as men s tennis in the past generation , what with billie jean king and martina navratilova and chris evert , but the touts outside the stadiums and the television officials remind us that men s tennis is the hot ticket in figure skating , it is just the opposite , going back to sonja henie and peggy fleming and dorothy hamill at the recent nationals in orlando , fla , the men s finals were held at 3 pm on a saturday and the women s finals were held at 9 pm showtime and for good reason we think of our audience as being women , 35 to 65 my grandmother from des moines , said rob dustin , the cbs feature producer for figure skating at the winter games in 1988 , the ratings for the battle of the carmens and the battle of the brians were close to super bowl ratings , dustin added , referring to the different interpretations of carmen performed by katarina witt and debi thomas in calgary in 1988 , and the rivalry between brian boitano of the united states and brian orser of canada figure skating was the absolute best thing i covered in the last winter games in calgary i had never been around it before , and i found it to have some of the best of the bullfights , a wimbledon final , and the ballet from the sensational press section , just above the ice , where the skaters entered , you could see the looks on their faces , who was ready , who was tense it was one of the rare times a sportswriter has a better vantage point than the television audience you could actually see the serenity of witt , the favorite from east germany , the energy of elizabeth manley , the surprise from canada , and the intelligence and ambiguity of debi thomas , the american when thomas hit the ice wrong in the early seconds and plodded away to a bronze medal , none of us knew that this complex premed student had just secretly married her college boy friend she was in love you could see something was distracting her it is this upclose and personal drama that makes figure skating so popular with live audiences on several competing tours some of this demand traces to the creative and attractive jayne torvill and christopher dean , the absolute stars of the 1984 games , but the answer is bigger than any one draw many of the sports do n't lend themselves to being there , unless you 're at the finish line , said dr franklin nelson , the president of the us figure skating association i love the other sports i went to see eddie the eagle i love hockey , said dr nelson , a former olympic figure skater but the way this builds , it is n't over in a few seconds it is elegant it is appealing because of the art of doing difficult things and making them look easy it is easy to ridicule figure skating with its routines set to music , its often gaudy costumes , the prejudging by officials , the bizarre names of the figures , but the performers are also athletes , attempting feats as difficult as the long jump or the dunk fleming has often praised the men for showing ways to mix muscle with grace , and the current trend for women seems to favor the jumping ability of midori ito of japan over the smoothness of kristi yamaguchi of the united states that tension between power and style will be worth watching , particularly because fortunes are at stake under normal circumstances , for an american girl to win the gold medal is worth 10 million over the next fivesix years , although obviously , the recession changes that , said michael rosenberg the business agent for the tough little american buzzbomb , tonya harding any of the skaters can blow it with one openedup jump , one fall , rosenberg said one little split second on the ice and anybody s life changes that drama will be played , with music and color , in 44 hours over the next two weeks if there were any more figure skating , cbs would show it , too

tbilisi , georgia , oct 10 the first to hold multiparty elections and the first to topple its elected president , georgia on sunday will also become the first former soviet republic to hold a second national ballot but after two bloody conflicts and a brutal new one in the region called abkhazia , this time there is no jubilation or illusion the outcome of the voting is known to all eduard a shevardnadze , the former soviet foreign minister and leader of the provisional georgian state council , is certain to win an overwhelming electoral endorsement for his leadership from this nation , which has found in its former communist boss the lone anchor in a whirlwind of conflict and grief nobody here , and least of all mr shevardnadze , conceals the fear that the elections are very likely to be followed quickly by war the collapse of a ceasefire in the mutinous coastal province of abkhazia put georgia on the edge of a civil war against abkhaz nationalists backed by militant muslims from the north caucasus range , russian reactionaries and a variety of mercenaries from across the crumbled soviet empire i cannot say our mood is festive before these elections , a somber and tired mr shevardnadze said at news conference today chances of accord slim the softspoken , silverhaired leader repeated what he has said again and again in recent days , that he will continue seeking a political resolution of the conflict to the end but the chances for a political settlement have significantly decreased , he added he said the new parliament s first act after the election , within one or two days , would be to form a military council the current governing state council was formed in january by the political forces that drove out independent georgia s first president , zviad gamsakhurdia the council s dubious legal position has been one of forces tying mr shevardnadze s hands in the current crisis the elections are technically for a new parliament but in a curious improvisation , mr shevardnadze is running separately and nationally for the post of speaker that in effect would make him the popularly elected leader of georgia , with a legitimate mandate a remarkable comeback his expected victory will be a remarkable return for a politician who made his mark in georgia first as a ruthless police chief and then as the communist party boss after he left in 1985 to become mikhail s gorbachev s foreign minister and comrade in reform , few thought he would ever dare return when he was an orthodox communist , i was totally against him , said akaky bakradze , a writer , member of the state council and honored veteran of the independence struggle that he was a communist may not be forgiven , but it s overlooked now now we see him as the man who played a key role in dismantling the soviet union he came back a different man i think his contact with the west in all those years played a big role in changing him mr shevardnadze gained great respect for his willingness to accept the leadership of georgia when he did georgia , with its 54 million people , was not alone among the former soviet states in swerving from the euphoria of independence to economic and political crisis , but the transition here was exceptionally dramatic mr gamsakhurdia , a former dissident who was thrust to the head of the country in october 1990 , soon proved to be authoritarian and brutal , and in january 1992 he was driven out in a hail of bullets that scarred the elegant heart of tbilisi after the debacle with mr gamsakhurdia , many georgians saw in mr shevardnadze the one statesman who could restore georgia s standing and guide it out of the economic , political and security swamp into which its first independent steps brought it mr shevardnadze did , in fact , establish foreign relations with major western countries , unite the various antigamsakhurdia political factions and negotiate a ceasefire in the tenacious conflict with another rebellious province , south ossetia crisis was a surprise but then the abkhazia crisis struck , by most accounts to everyone s surprise the abkhaz , one of the small , predominantly muslim ethnic groups that people the fringes of the high caucasus range , have had friction with the georgians before , most notably when they petitioned to join the russian federation in the 1970 s mr shevardnadze tried to build a new peace , giving the abkhaz 80 , 000 people who account for only 17 percent of the population in their own province a majority of the seats on the provincial legislature but fighting broke out anyway in august the reasons are difficult to disentangle from the conflicting claims but a peace brokered by russia on sept 3 seemed to take hold , and georgia withdrew all but a few score soldiers , when the abkhaz , backed this time by a coalition of caucasus tribes , some cossacks and some apparent mercenaries , swept through gagra , a town on the black sea coast , and drove out the georgian troops there the offensive in effect gave the secessionists control of abkhazia north of the gumista river , with georgians holding the provincial capital of sukhumi to the south waves of refugees flee as has happened so often before in the ethnic wars of the former soviet state , waves of panicked refugees by the thousands swept out in all directions , carrying tales of atrocities and horrors that fired passions further on all sides reports from sukhumi told of vast throngs fighting to board the few planes that left the city at the iveria hotel in tbilisi , once the premiere tourist hotel , a huge crowd of refugees milled about , poking through clothes donated by tbilisi residents , searching for neighbors or sobbing as they described the horrors they had lived through they told of men buried alive , of children shot in their mothers' arms , of several hundred georgians burned by abkhazians at the gagra stadium , of houses pillaged and set ablaze they told of caucasus mountain tribesmen with green headbands , the sign of islamic warriors , and of tanks with russian crews none of the reports could be confirmed but there were too many to dismiss totally photo the collapse of a ceasefire in the coastal province of abkhazia is putting the former soviet republic of georgia on the edge of a civil war against abkhaz nationalists backed

atlanta , oct 24 if yogi berra had a conversation with toronto catcher pat borders before game 6 of the world series tonight , it might have gone like this berra you 're swinging the bat pretty good borders yeah berra you know you broke my postseason hitting streak record for catchers the other day \? borders yeah berra well , you got to swing the bat to get hits otherwise , you wo n't get any borders you said it , yogi this byplay could really happen , and not just because berra was known for turning simple thoughts into hilarious statements borders is known for saying little about himself he will expound on the opposing pitcher and the toronto pitchers , but he is reluctant to discuss his wonderful knack for hitting in october going into tonight s game , he had hit in 13 straight postseason games , dating back to game 4 of the 1991 american league championship series , and broke berra s record by one game hitting 438 in a world series that has been devoid of offense , borders is the only player on the blue jays or the atlanta braves to have a hit in each of the first five games roberto alomar , candy maldonado , kelly gruber and manuel lee , half of the jays' starters , had combined for 5 hits in 61 times at bat before tonight meanwhile , borders , a lifetime 266 hitter , had 7 hits in 16 times at bat to lead toronto with a 438 average he also had a homer and 3 runs batted in you just get hot , borders said sometimes you see the ball good but when borders was asked if he was seeing the ball well , he sheepishly backtracked from his previous comment and said , i have no explanation for it maybe it defies an explanation how can a decenthitting catcher who never had more than a ninegame hitting streak during five seasons in the majors hit in 10 straight postseason games this year \? alomar hit 310 this season and he could not do it atlanta s terry pendleton hit 311 and he could not , either it s one of those things , said borders , a lifetime 345 hitter in the postseason it s just like i'm not throwing the ball well now that s at the other end of the spectrum it goes both ways no catcher of thieves throwing out wouldbe base stealers has not been his strength maybe if he took a bat behind home plate and hit line drives to second base , he would be more successful but borders is in a difficult situation because he catches jack morris , david cone and juan guzman , three pitchers who throw nasty stuff that is not easy to handle morris and cone throw the lively splitfinger fastball , and just about every one of guzman s pitches has movement on it besides , none excel at holding runners on base still , borders deserves blame the athletics ran rampant , stealing 16 bases in 18 attempts during the alcs , but they lost in six games entering game 6 tonight , the braves had stolen 13 bases in 15 attempts , but borders pointed out that he had caught the runners in the last three games after throwing out 293 percent of attempted base stealers in the season , borders has nabbed 4 out of 33 in postseason gene tenace , toronto s bench coach , a former catcher and world series hero , seemed unfazed by borders s futility it s easy to explain , tenace said speed intimidates pat s mechanics are a little messed up right now because he s rushing things on the topic of defense and throwing , borders was , once again , a man of few words he said his throwing has improved over the last two years and expressed more concern with calling a smart game and keeping balls from skidding past him 'i'm average' i feel i do an average job , borders said i'm not going to say i'm real good i'm average then , sounding like anything but a potential world series hero , borders added if i do n't block pitches , they 'll find someone else who can it s more like i better do it if borders continues hitting and the jays win one of the next two games , he is likely to be named the most valuable player of the series after borders slugged a runscoring single off john smoltz in game 5 to make the score 22 , the skydome fans began chanting , mvp , mvp of course , borders said that he did not hear it and that the award would mean little to him to win a world series ring , borders said , is far more important than anything else you can get to that comment , yogi would probably say , you 're right , kid photo going into last night s game , blue jays' pat borders had hit in 13 straight postseason games , a record \( associated press \)
'le nozze di figaro' metropolitan opera a critic dispatched to report on changed personnel in mozart s nozze di figaro at the met on friday evening found himself distracted from the immediate task in ways good and bad the pleasant distractions came from the fine work of holdovers in the cast , not least , heidi grant murphy in the small role of barbarina the unpleasant ones stemmed from the cute touches of staging that have accrued to jeanpierre ponnelle s ungainly production , most recently under the direction of lesley koenig none of which detracted in the end from jorma hynninen s dominating stage presence as the count mr hynninen , despite all the nonsense around him , created a rounded portrayal , suave yet heavy with menace , and gave a good account of the role with his finegrained baritone heikyung hong proved winning as susanna but never quite compelling , either dramatically or vocally after a slightly shaky start , she sang with ease and purity , needing only more character in the tone against strong odds in this staging , sondra kelly managed to salvage some dignity as marcellina \( among the many dubious uses to which harpsichord continuo has been put recently , the squiggly little imitation of marcellina s wiggling bustle here ranks high why not just shut down the opera and show proper cartoons , if that is what everyone wants \? \) carolyn james seemed tentative as the countess her attacks were often unfocused , and her wide vibrato tended to center above pitch john keenan , conducting the opera for the first time at the met , seemed not quite in control the discrepancies between stage and pit , especially in the first act , might have been accounted for by the number of new singers onstage , except that the orchestra also seemed unsure of mr keenan s wishes at times in the overture , for one
philadelphia , dec 11 two months ago a pennsylvania supreme court justice was publicly reprimanded by his colleagues for violating judicial ethics by privately advising a trial judge about a pending case two weeks ago the justice , rolf larsen , retaliated against the two justices who voted to censure him , accusing them in a sworn statement of fixing cases , accepting kickbacks and wearing body wires to illegally tape private conversations and today in an effort to end the dispute , the state s attorney general intervened , appointing two special investigators to begin an inquiry into the accusations justice larsen , a democrat , made these charges in a 45page court document that is less like the reasoned legal briefs expected from the court and more like a disjointed polemic that repeats rumors of criminal behavior and raises motives that are unsubstantiated , saying , for example , that his opponents had enormous cravings and appetites for power and control 'outright lies' justice larsen , 58 years old , who is second in seniority on the court , refers to his two colleagues as fix artists who are conspiring to push him out of the running for chief justice he even accuses news organizations of printing and broadcasting false facts and outright lies about him the two colleagues , justices ralph j cappy and stephen a zappala , both democrats , have denied all of the accusations legal experts say the onceprivate dispute has turned into a public furor that could provoke a constitutional crisis , with questions of who should discipline the state s judiciary under pennsylvania law , the attorney general says , the state has the power to investigate and prosecute accusations of criminal wrongdoing by any employee , including supreme court justices but , so far , the supreme court has refused to cooperate while it is still considering justice larsen s accusations the internecine warfare on the court has done little to enhance its credibility , said a leo levin , a professor at the university of pennsylvania law school and a specialist in legal ethics it is fair to say that this could create a crisis of public confidence in the court system , he said in his announcement today state attorney general ernest d preate jr said their charge from me is to go wherever the evidence leads , and let the chips fall where they may nothing is off limits nothing is preordained special prosecutors the prosecutors , who will be sworn in as special deputy attorneys general , are edward s g dennis jr , a philadelphia lawyer and a former united states deputy attorney general , and james e tierney , a lawyer in topsham , me , who served as that state s attorney general from 1980 to 1990 almost since justice larsen , a former state trial judge from pittsburgh , was elected to the supreme court in 1977 , he has been involved in bitter struggles with his colleagues in 1983 , for example , a judicial review board investigated the justice on charges of misusing his office for political purposes and using racial slurs to describe chief justice robert n c nix , the state s first black chief justice the board exonerated justice larsen , but the case left many bitter feelings the current dispute began in october , when justices cappy and zappala voted to publicly reprimand justice larsen for violating judicial ethics by privately advising a trial judge about a pending case justice larsen made his criminal accusations in a petition , which asks the court to reconsider the october decision by a threejudge panel of the supreme court that led to his censure the panel voted to accept the recommendation of the state judicial inquiry review board , which found that justice larsen had improperly advised a trial court judge about a estate case pending in her court in 1987 the board said justice larsen had acted without an apparent improper motive , but had nevertheless created the appearance of impropriety by discussing the case with the judge without all other parties in the case present after considering that recommendation , justices zappala and cappy voted to censure justice larsen and a third justice , nicholas p papadakos , voted against the censure on procedural grounds in his recent petition , justice larsen accused justices zappala and cappy with gross improprieties in an effort to have the court disqualify them from taking part in any future reconsideration of his case justice larsen s charges are short on specifics , but he accuses justices cappy and zappala of having such a lust for political advancement within the court and in state politics that it has rendered them incapable of acting impartially and without bias he said that they had improperly used their positions to influence the outcome of cases and that they were conspiring to take control of the state supreme court justice larsen accused justice zappala of using his influence in some municipal cases as a way to gain political support with local politicians justice larsen said justice cappy had acted improperly by giving a procedural advantage to a criminal defendant , who had at one time testified against justice larsen in an unrelated case before the state judicial review board
tokyo , sept 8 for weeks news organizations here have pursued the trail of cash from a moblinked trucking company to some of japan s leading politicians , but one of the most revealing aspects of this growing scandal has been the least discussed although the company went to extremes , it was regarded as simply doing what most big companies must to survive in an economy where even many routine business decisions require regulatory approval the trucking concern , tokyo sagawa kyubin , was part of an ambitious corporate group that surpassed many of its rivals , in part by evading a number of regulations in its effort to dominate its industry the one way to get around the powerful bureaucrats who administer the country s impenetrable tangle of regulations is to cultivate politicians , who often act as fixers in obtaining the permits , licenses and informal approvals required unquestionably , tokyo sagawa kyubin went beyond the need simply to open new routes or avoid penalties for overworking its drivers it is reported to have handed out more than 16 million in improper political contributions to an impressive array of the liberal democratic party s leading lights four million dollars went to the most powerful politician in japan , shin kanemaru , the head of the governing party s largest faction the prosecutors are reportedly close to indicting mr kanemaru , who acknowledged that his office took the cash , on charges that the contribution exceeded legal limits but some other politicians have been fighting back libel suits filed former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone , foreign minister michio watanabe and transportation minister keiwa okuda have filed libel suits against the newspapers and television stations that reported that those politicians , too , had accepted money from tokyo sagawa kyubin the reports have been particularly embarrassing because tokyo sagawa kyubin s top executives have been indicted on charges that they provided more than 1 billion in loans and loan guarantees to companies that were fronts for organized crime groups , the yakuza it was while investigating these loans , nearly all of which are now uncollectible , that the prosecutors apparently stumbled on the flow of cash to influential politicians no connection has yet been made between any of sagawa kyubin s improper contributions and specific favors but it is well known that the trucking industry , until a recent deregulation , was among the most tightly controlled businesses in the country the government had to approve every route a company operated , how long its drivers worked , what it could transport and how much it could charge if you were n't close to the politicians , you really could n't expect to get a license , said kumiko takare , a transportation industry analyst here with barclays de zoete wedd securities she added that obtaining all the approvals was so difficult that many japanese manufacturing or retailing companies abandoned the thought of delivering their own goods , relying instead on outsider truckers parcel deliveries soared tokyo sagawa kyubin was clearly encouraged , too , by the growing popularity in the 1980 s of a management technique known as justintime delivery with many businesses trimming costs by arranging dozens of smalllot deliveries a day rather than carrying expensive inventories , the parcel delivery business showed huge expansion in the 1980 s the sums the company spread around the governing party were dwarfed by the amounts it gave the yakuza , whose influence can also be essential to smooth business operations analysts and industry officials said the yakuza were often called in to mediate in traffic accidents or to insure that delivery trucks were not ticketed by the police for illegal parking an inside account of how the regulators must be handled was provided recently by masao ogura , a member of a government transportation advisory commission and a director at yamato transport company , another large delivery company in an interview with keiei juku , a magazine whose name might be translated as management cram school , mr ogura described somewhat bitterly how yamato was forced to expand by obtaining one license after another from each prefecture in which it wanted to operate the effort took years , he said , before the company obtained a national license reports still unproved meanwhile , sagawa kyubin expanded far more swiftly it also had to obtain individual licenses from each prefecture technically , that meant it was illegal for sagawa kyubin to move parcels from one prefecture to another without the national license , but it did so anyway , mr ogura said tokyo sagawa kyubin , the company linked to the political payoff scandal , was one of many regional affiliates of sagawa kyubin , which is based in kyoto none of these reports have been proved in fact , the prosecutors investigating the case have said nothing publicly about what role politicians might have played
the scalding racial tensions of crown heights have unfolded against the backdrop of next year s new york city mayoral race , and while none of the three announced candidates would put it this way , all are trying to turn the undercurrents of anger and recrimination to their political advantage mayor david n dinkins is hoping his reputation for dignity and conciliation can continue to serve him in the face of the bitter taunts of jewhater that a handful of hecklers spat at him last week , though he has found it hard to resist responding in a defensive tone of personal grievance it s like , how dare you \? he said of the attacks last week at the same time , the mayor s chief rivals , rudolph w giuliani and city council president andrew j stein , have each sought to ride the waves of frustration over mr dinkins s handling of the conflicts between blacks and jews , and to argue that criticism of his stewardship on the issue should be a fair topic of debate the mayor is almost trying to create a situation in which you ca n't run against him , mr giuliani complained last week , because he gets very sensitive whenever he gets criticized , and he begins to raise the notion that it has something to do with race or division mr stein , who said his phone was ringing off the hook with complaints about the mayor last week , said the issue should not be is david dinkins antisemitic he clearly is not the issue is , david dinkins provides weak leadership , and a large segment of the population feels they 're not being represented and protected clergyman becomes a symbol there may be no better symbol of the political football that crown heights has become than rabbi shea hecht , a spokesman for the lubavitch community there , who was invited to give an invocation at mr giuliani s fundraising dinner last week where he thanked mr giuliani for all he is doing for the jews of crown heights and who is to do the same thing at a fund raiser for mr stein tonight rabbi hecht said he was an old friend of both men and would have given an invocation for mr dinkins , too , if he had been asked i think it s very bad that it has become so politicized , because there s no longer focus on the issues , he said the only political statement i hope to make is that religious and community leaders have to be involved politically , because if you 're out of touch with the politicians , they do n't know your needs and your wants by his mere presence , rabbi hecht may already have made more of a political statement than that but any attempt to exploit such longstanding , multitextured tensions carries grave political risks for all three candidates you really have to be crazy to want to make this political now , said howard rubenstein , the publicrelations executive who is both an old friend and informal adviser to the mayor and an adviser to community leaders in crown heights it s like playing with a pet python he added that if you want to turn this to political advantage , no matter how subtle you are , it s transparent some of mr dinkins s friends say their biggest fear is that mr giuliani , mr stein and other critics may so rattle the mayor that he will do the one thing he has steadfastly refused to do in his three years as the city s first black mayor lash out at his critics as racist and make a coarse appeal to his base of support among blacks already he has dismissed the harshest of his critics on crown heights as racists and rabblerousers oratory that would have been unthinkably pointed for him just months ago mr dinkins often notes that black voters alone could never have elected him , and that remains true the genius of his 1989 campaign was his ability to portray himself as a fairminded healer who held the promise of uniting disparate groups whose nerves were frayed by 12 years of the outspoken incumbent , edward i koch jewish voters constituted mr dinkins s single largest bloc of support among whites , and he will need their backing again to win it is no comfort that mr giuliani s fellow republican , senator alfonse m d'amato , won 40 percent of the jewish vote in his recent reelection campaign against state attorney general robert abrams , perhaps the most prominent and religiously observant jewish politician in the state mr d'amato went often to crown heights , and on election night , norman rosenbaum , the brother of the australian hasidic scholar who was slain by a group of blacks there in 1991 , stood at the senator s side the support of the relatively small lubavitch community alone could probably never be decisive , but some of mr dinkins s backers worry that the anger of crown heights resonates more broadly i think they are both determined to strategize their way to victory , one of mr dinkins s jewish supporters said of mr stein and mr giuliani , speaking on condition of anonymity but i do n't think they have to do a lot of strategizing on this there are a lot of angry people out there , and all they have to do is turn 'em loose and hope a polarized city will help them , by making this mayor increasingly appear to be the mayor for only one group treading carefully yet neither mr giuliani nor mr stein can afford to be seen as inflaming the situation , so they , too , must choose their words carefully for his part , mr giuliani claims he does not want race to be an issue in the campaign , and he said at his fund raiser last week it s time to trump the racial card it s time to step beyond the politics of race and the politics of symbolism but mr giuliani made a symbolic statement of his own , including as a guest on the dais at his fund raiser assemblyman dov hikind of brooklyn , a politically conservative orthodox jew who supported mr giuliani s candidacy last time , and who led jewish protesters outside mr dinkins s fundraising dinner just two nights earlier mr hikind s brother , pincus , works as an aide to mr stein the mayor s press secretary , leland t jones , contended that by doing so , mr giuliani was slyly trying to exploit racial fears what mr giuliani is trying to do is say , 'race , race , race will not be an issue next year , and i am never going to raise race , race , race as an issue , ' mr jones said he can go ahead and try it it 'll make the campaign interesting but ugly in city hall , where mr stein and the mayor have offices at opposite ends of the building , there has been constant sniping for months mr dinkins never lets it be forgotten that mr stein was on vacation in wyoming during the initial

no economic issue seems hotter in russia this summer than the question of how quickly to force that nation s giant stateowned industrial enterprises to stand on their own , without government subsidies the issue comes up in various forms , the latest being a struggle over who should pay off 500 billion rubles in corporate debt the companies themselves or the government as usual , the proposed solution tries to have it both ways , with president boris n yeltsin neither cracking down on the companies nor paying all their bills the struggle over the corporate debt reflects a wider battle , of course the yeltsin administration , prodded by the west , is trying to speed up the transition to a market economy but a speedy transition might bankrupt many industrial enterprises suddenly cut off from subsidies naturally , their managers object , and increasingly they are getting their way all the managers of the industrial enterprises are enemies of gaidar , said aleksei titkov , a russian economist and sociologist , referring to mr yeltsin s economic czar , acting prime minister yegor t gaidar they understand that gaidar would bury them early this year , the gaidar team did cut government spending and the central bank made subsidized credit harder to get the upshot was a cash shortage for companies that employ millions of people and make everything from steel and aircraft to handkerchiefs and pillowcases without enough money , what the companies should have done , under the gaidar scenario , was to cut production , lay off workers or close altogether at the very least , a company that makes shoes , for example , should have raised money by cutting prices on unsold shoes thus luring customers and also helping to reduce inflation but the companies did none of these things they resisted our policies and created their own cheap credit by not paying their bills , said dimitri touline , deputy chairman of the central bank mostly , they did not pay each other a steel mill , for example , might have received , say , a 600 , 000 ruble shipment of coal , without paying the mining company the steel company , in turn , might have sent 300 , 000 rubles worth of steel beams to the mining company , to shore up mines , also without getting paid nearly 100 , 000 companies ran up bills in this way totaling 2 trillion rubles , or 20 billion the more important figure , however , is the net debt once the steel mill and the coal company , for example , cancel out their mutual debts , the steel mill still owes the coal company 300 , 000 rubles across thousands of state enterprises , the net debt was roughly 500 billion rubles , or 5 billion , on july 1 , government officials estimate that is a considerable sum for an economy whose gross domestic product is the ruble equivalent of 100 billion a year to avoid increasing this debt , the yeltsin administration is trying to change the system , effective this month companies are now supposed to pay for goods cod , although the russian banking system still lacks the mechanisms for such rapid payments as for the 500 billion rubles in past debt , the state enterprises want the government to pay most of it , through grants to the companies or lowinterest loans , and they are pressing their case through their supporters in parliament mr yeltsin is offering a compromise under a presidential decree signed this month , the deadlines for payment of all intercompany debt are being extended for one year as in bankruptcy procedure in the united states , the russian companies are getting a breather , said david lipton , an american economist employed as an adviser to the gaidar team simultaneously , the gaidar team and the parliament might agree to spending 100 billion to 150 billion rubles to pay some of the bills this year that bow to corporate pressure would sharply increase the government s budget deficit to keep deficit spending to a minimum , mr yeltsin has authorized the establishment of an agency that would take on the huge task of canceling offsetting debts , finally coming up with a list of net creditors and the specific amounts they are owed the creditor companies would turn over these unpaid bills to the new agency , which would try to collect payment more important , the agency might turn unpaid bills into securities and sell them at deep discounts to speculators , as if they were oneyear junk bonds the proceeds would also help to pay down corporate debt , and the speculators would take on the burden of collecting the bills , losing their investments if they failed clearly , the yeltsin plan gives corporate russia only the mildest shove toward a market economy there is a real political battle here , said jeffrey sachs , a harvard economist who advises the gaidar team the industrial lobby is pushing for concessions and the yeltsin administration is making some drawing
miami , jan 1 the suspense did not develop until late on new year s night there was none all evening , not in the orange bowl , where the miami hurricanes have been unbeatable for more than six years the hurricanes , a group with no audible shortage of confidence , surprised themselves with a defensive effort that became a memorable exclamation point miami raised its level from unbeatable to suffocating as it overpowered , outran and overwhelmed nebraska , 220 , in the 58th orange bowl miami \( 120 \) won at home for the 45th consecutive time , second to alabama among homefield streaks in the history of the majorcollege game the hurricanes completed a second perfect season and made an emphatic case for a fourth unofficial national championship in the last nine seasons miami s statement on the field was made with the same feeling as the one on the bedsheet in the west stands washington is 1 not ! ! ! nebraska \( 921 \) was shut out for the first time in 221 games over more than 18 years , since a 270 loss to oklahoma in 1973 , tom osborne s first season as husker coach nebraska s average of 413 points had been the third highest in the nation i could never ever dream of shutting them out , said rusty medearis , the sophomore defensive end who had four of miami s five sacks of nebraska quarterback keithen mccant they put up a lot of points on a lot of people , medearis said to shut them out is really a trophy to our defense miami s firm control was not lost until the final gun of its second perfect season in the last five only then did that control vanish , when the hurricanes first in the new york times computer rankings and the associated press poll and second to washington in the united press international poll were forced to wait until thursday for the outcome of college football s democratic process within hours , voters would evaluate and computers would determine the impact of washington s 3414 victory over michigan in the rose bowl washington , the only other unbeaten and untied majorcollege team , was fourth in the times s rankings and second in the ap poll i vote in the coaches' poll , said dennis erickson , the miami coach and i'm going to vote us one and washington two and i'm sure don james is going to do the same thing vote us one and washington two a stifling defense miami s defense , long an overlooked part of its championship tradition , stifled nebraska with a remarkably swift effort the huskers had averaged 5065 yards in their previous 11 games but tonight , before a loud and wet hurricane crowd of 77 , 747 , nebraska was held to 1 yard in the first quarter and 171 over all nebraska s 82 rushing yards were 271 below the average of the team that led the nation in rushing for the seventh time in 12 years larry jones , a freshman fullback who was thirdstring less than two months ago , gained 144 yards , including a 1yard touchdown that removed any doubt about the outcome at the start of the second half gino torretta passed for 257 yards and an 8yard touchdown to kevin williams 3 minutes 56 seconds into the game carlos huerta , in his final game with miami , kicked three field goals including a careerhigh 54yarder by the time the huskers gained that initial first down , miami held a 130 lead mccant , a senior who led the most successful nebraska passing game in 15 years , completed 6 of 18 passes for 80 yards jones s 1yard third quarter touchdown , at the end of a 66yard drive , gave miami a politically significant 190 lead for nebraska s only other defeat this season was a 3621 defeat to washington and the miami players understood that the way history reflected their 1991 season could depend in part on whether they could exceed washington s 15point margin of victory miami began quickly , with a pass on its second offensive play that created the first doubt of nebraska s ability to match up with the hurricane receivers williams , lining up on the right side of a spread offense without a running back behind torretta , ran up the right sideline past cornerback curtis cotton , who slipped near the line of scrimmage torretta s pass was underthrown , but williams made a leaping 36yard catch at the nebraska 9 three plays later , with nebraska caught in a blitz , the hurricanes managed to create a oneonone matchup williams , a 5foot9inch , 185pound sophomore with outstanding speed , was covered by 62 , 230pound sophomore linebacker mike anderson williams , starting from the right side , angled to the left to the inside , forcing anderson to turn completely around and chase in vain williams took torretta s pass inside the rear of the end zone for the 70 lead huerta comes through a series of small mistakes forced miami to depend on huerta , the kicker playing in his final collegiate game a 38yard pass to lamar thomas pushed the hurricanes to the nebraska 12 , but miami was stopped at the 7 and was forced to settle for huerta s 24yard field goal a fumble on nebraska s next offensive play , when mccant was pressured into a pitchout behind the left shoulder of iback derek brown , gave miami the ball at the nebraska 14 but an illegal procedure penalty led to a 24yard field goal , and a 130 lead if the huskers made any significant adjustments at halftime , jones s touchdown made nebraska s task that much more difficult huerta s 54yard field goal , his third of the game , gave the hurricanes a 220 lead the hurricanes seemed prepared for the possibility of a split in the polls of reporters and coaches , which would be the second in as many years and the third in 14 seasons both of us get a ring , said linebacker micheal barrow they both say 'national championship' they do n't say , split championship' i do n't think we 'd want to play

for years , elf aquitaine , the oil producer that is france s largest company , has confidently built service stations across europe , looking forward to the time late this decade when a single currency would make it as easy for a french company to pump gasoline in barcelona or berlin as in lyons but then this spring , loik le flochprigent , elf s chairman and chief executive , heard many of his own employees speak against the maastricht treaty that would bring about this unification some innocently asked him where he stood mr flochprigent , joining other french business leaders to found the yes committee , has since taken his cause to television , radio and newspapers , as well as his own refineries and plants the prosperity of their companies and their expansion across the continent , the business leaders say , rests on the referendum tomorrow a no vote , they say , would whipsaw them with continued currency turmoil and higher interest rates , as speculators rushed again into marks , weakening the franc the persistence of separate currencies would render some of their strategies through the end of the century obsolete no scenario for defeat under the sponsorship of merrill lynch company , the french executives gathered yesterday to promote their companies to investors at new york s metropolitan club , a gilded , frescoed palace where american plutocrats can feel like royalty from europe in interviews , all the business leaders expressed brave confidence , with none confessing to laying contingency plans in case the referendum fails there is no scenario for a no vote , said bernard thiolon , the president of credit lyonnais , france s largest bank , with a dismissive toss of his head you cannot prevent a bank like us from having a presence in every market a minute later , however , he worried that a rejection by voters would delay the unification of banking services for years , slowing his march into other countries the executives' support for the creation of a single currency by 1999 represents the latest stage in the turnabout of what was long one of europe s most protected business communities french governments have shielded their industries at least as far back as when jeanbaptiste colbert served as controller general to louis xiv now , the french say that dismantling europe s trade barriers has helped them export more per person than even the japanese several executives pointed to the currency crisis as one more reason for adopting a single currency only then , they said , could europe capably compete with japan and the united states if you had 50 different dollars a colorado dollar , a nevada dollar , a north carolina dollar you would be much weaker , mr flochprigent said rejection of the referendum , they said , would expose them to much greater risks or the expenses of hedging many of the executives would then welcome a unified currency covering just france , germany and a couple other countries with strong currencies most are set to erase the borders from the atlas bertrand collomb , the chairman and chief executive of lafarge coppee , the world s secondlargest cement company , stretched out his arms , as if holding up a map , to illustrate the stakes for a maker of building materials if you look at a map of europe , he said , there are no good connections between france and spain , between france and the netherlands you need more highspeed trains , highways , airports even the most ardent backers of unification shifted in their seats and frowned , however , when asked about meddling by eurobureaucrats from brussels referendum foes have warned that the stature of french industry , the distinctiveness of french culture , even the preeminence of french wine , would collapse under the weight of european regulation the bureaucrats have been irritating a lot of people , mr flochprigent of elf said many people in my company think , 'we will vote against the bureaucrats' patrick bompoint , executive vice president for finance at remy cointreau , said that the referendum s passage would in fact mean more uniform taxes and regulations for his company , which sells more liquor in germany than france in the short term , though , his company will reap some benefits no matter which side wins there will be a celebration , mr bompoint said with a generous chuckle , and that is an opportunity to drink cognac or champagne photos patrick bompoint executive vice president for finance at remy cointreau there will be a celebration , and that is an opportunity to drink cognac or champagne loik le flochprigent chairman and chief executive of elf aquitaine the bureaucrats have been irritating a lot of people many people in my company think , 'we will vote against the bureaucrats' bernard thiolon president of credit lyonnais there is no scenario for a no vote \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
sotheby s yesterday withdrew a painting whose provenance was questioned by dealers and auction house experts from its sale in london next wednesday last week , the auction house maintained that it had sworn evidence that the painting , by the 17thcentury dutch mannerist joachim wtewael , had been given to a russian soldier by residents of the schlossmuseum , a small museum in a castle in gotha in central germany during world war ii and that there was no legal barrier to its sale sotheby s had prominently displayed the painting , the holy family with saints john and elizabeth and angels , on the cover of its sale catalogue and estimated that the work would bring 1 million to 13 million the painting , 6 1 4 by 8 1 4 inches , is considered an excellent example of the work of wtewael \( pronounced ootvahl \) , an artist admired by experts on the old masters many experts say the wtewael work was stolen during world war ii , and yesterday sotheby s conceded that they may be right a letter on march 23 to sotheby s from dr morton shulman , a toronto physician who owns a clock from the schlossmuseum and who has researched the museum s history , said that when the us army withdrew from gotha in 1946 they did an inventory of all the artwork and nothing was missing the russian army arrived the next day and immediately ordered all members of the family and officials of the museum to get out and they all fled across the border to coburg , dr shulman added in a telephone interview yesterday , dr shulman said he learned from a former director of the schlossmuseum that the family living in the museum was ordered out at gunpoint and under the circumstances would certainly not have given a painting to any of the occupying soldiers i guess the speculator who owns the work had to get some legitimate story in order to sell the painting , dr shulman said michel hebecker , the director of the schlossmuseum , sent a letter to sotheby s last week refusing it permission to sell the painting the museum has also filed a criminal charge of theft against a person or persons unknown at the general prosecutor s office for the state of thuringia in erfurt , halfway between munich and berlin many prominent dealers both in london and new york say the owner , whom they describe as a european speculator , has been trying to sell the work for several years the painting was also offered to christie s in london , which declined to sell it none of us dared , said a london dealer who would speak only on condition of anonymity i do n't like the precedents it sets none of us want to be selling stolen plunder diana phillips , a spokeswoman at sotheby s , said yesterday that the auction house was starting another investigation into the painting s history we will have to be very satisfied that all questions about the painting s provenance have been fully answered and would of course have a discussion with the museum before we make any decisions to sell it , ms phillips said timothy llewellyn , sotheby s chief executive officer for london and asia , who had negotiated the sale , said last week from london that under british law it is the seller who guarantees the title of a work of art , not the auction house yesterday , ms phillips said mr llewellyn was traveling and could not be reached for comment in an interview last week , mr llewellyn said when we first learned the painting had disappeared from the schlossmuseum during the war , we told the vendor we could n't sell it unless it was cleared by the authorities we recommended the picture should be offered back to the museum we also informed the german cultural institute in the hopes that they could assist the museum in making the purchase we first offered the painting to the museum last november at the end of january , they wrote to us and said they could n't purchase the painting and that we could proceed with the sale we felt confident we had done all that was legally and practically necessary some members of the art world have said they were outraged by the planned sale and by sotheby s display of the painting on the cover of its sale catalogue they had to know they were on thin ice yet they still put it on the cover , jill newhouse , the president of the private art dealers association , said yesterday moral issues should not be set aside for the sake of aggressive business tactics it gives the art world a bad name ms phillips said in this case , as in all aspects of our business , moral issues are of enormous concern to sotheby s as well

moscow , jan 28 a middle east conference opened here today , with israel for the first time sitting down for talks on regional cooperation with saudi arabia and the other arab gulf countries , but the meeting was overshadowed by the palestinians' absence the palestinian spokeswoman , hanan ashrawi , said the palestinians were barred from the conference by the united states and russia , who objected to the presence of palestinians from east jerusalem and from outside the west bank and gaza strip secretary of state james a baker 3d said it was the palestinians who had refused to come according to the terms set out in the invitation , and he added that he was disappointed that they had missed yet another opportunity to advance their cause a lot of new faces the opening day of the conference was full of unusual scenes and contradictory emotions the setting of the meeting was bizarre 24 countries gathered in foodstrapped moscow in the dead of winter in the same hall of columns where the stalin show trials were conducted in 1938 to discuss regional development of the mideast the discussions themselves seemed to combine some strikingly dramatic signs that the ageold arabisraeli conflict was thawing and some very strained speeches that suggested it might not be changing much after all 'who would have imagined \? ' today s high point may have come when the cochairmen , mr baker and the russian foreign minister , andrei v kozyrev , gaveled the conference to order and looked out to see sitting before them around a rectangular table a lot of people who have never sat together before russians and americans cosponsoring a peace conference , the foreign ministers of saudi arabia and kuwait sitting alongside israelis , and china and japan for the first time joining mideast peace talks china s deputy foreign minister , yang fuchang , went out of his way to walk across the room and warmly embrace israel s foreign minister , david levy look around you , ladies and gentlemen , at the parties who are gathered at this table , secretary baker told his fellow delegates who would have imagined even five years ago that the united states would launch a new partnership with a democratizing russia \? the american and russian cosponsors envisaged this twoday conference as a vehicle to open a dialogue between israel and the wider circle of arab countries tunisia , mauritania , saudi arabia , qatar , oman , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates about regional problems like arms control , water , the environment , refugees and economic development algeria and yemen had planned to attend but did not show up once it became apparent the palestinians were not coming the syrians and lebanese had never planned to attend the meeting and urged the other arabs to join them , but they would not the hope of the cosponsors is that if israel can be drawn into negotiations with the wider arab world , this will demonstrate to the israeli public the potential for real acceptance around the region and therefore make israel more willing to trade land for peace with syria , lebanon , jordan and the palestinians in their separate negotiations , which were started in madrid and are being dealt with separately from this conference when the united states and the soviet union invited arabs and israelis to open direct peace talks in madrid last october , the invitation included plans for a multinational conference that would follow two weeks later it was also envisaged that it would be held in moscow , but because of several technical problems it was delayed in the meantime , the direct talks begun in madrid between israel and jordan , israel and syria , israel and lebanon , and israel and the palestinians were followed up by two rounds in washington , one in december and one in midjanuary moderation and stubbornness today s session was confined to 10minute speeches by each country , and the arab delegates made it immediately clear that they had no intention of engaging in any serious regional cooperation with israel until the palestinians were brought into the process and israel agreed to trade land for peace with its immediate neighbors saudi arabia s foreign minister , saud alfaisal , like all the arabs present , gave a lowkey , relatively moderate speech he nevertheless captured the mood of the arab delegations when he declared that no matter what statements were made here today , we cannot make or attain specific progress if arab lands continue to be occupied and the palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right of selfdetermination the speech by the israeli foreign minister , mr levy , was also generally conciliatory , but made clear that israel viewed regional cooperation with the arab world as something that could and should progress independently of talks over territory with israel s immediate neighbors levy , alone none of the arab ministers , save for egypt , applauded mr levy s speech , or spoke with him the standoffishness was symbolized by maj gen amram mitzna , chief of planning for the israeli army and a member of the israeli delegation , who was taking photographs with his instamatic camera of jordanians seated next to him , but was too uncertain to speak to them
washington , may 20 salomon brothers inc agreed today to pay 290 million to settle government charges that the investment house had systematically submitted billions of dollars in phony bids in the treasury auctions that finance the nation s public debt in a victory crucial for salomon s survival , the government also agreed not to bring criminal charges against the firm over its millions of dollars of illegal gain other large wall street firms involved in complex fraud cases , notably e f hutton and drexel burnham lambert , were unable to survive criminal cases but scores of salomon s customers municipalities , pension funds , mutual funds and states now will not have to reassess whether they can do business with an investment house facing criminal charges reaching crisis proportions the agreement ends a tumultuous chapter in the firm s 82year history that reached crisis proportions last summer in august , salomon acknowledged that it had occasionally submitted bogus bids to buy more treasury securities than federal regulations permit it then admitted that its senior executives , including the company s chairman and chief executive , john h gutfreund , knew for months about some of the phony bids but never told the public or government officials mr gutfreund , once a powerful figure on wall street , resigned as a result of the scandal he remains under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for possible civil violations , notably the failure to supervise the firm adequately other former senior executives and traders , particularly paul w mozer , the former head of the government bond trading desk , which executed the fraudulent bids , are under investigation by the commission and by the justice department for possible criminal violations a few smaller firms that may have illegally agreed to coordinate their trading activity may also face criminal or civil charges little criticism voiced there was little criticism of the settlement , even though lawyers and members of congress were in basic agreement that the government had been generous to salomon the favorable terms reflected the widely held view among government officials that the firm , after first misleading them , moved quickly to disclose what it knew of the scandal and took steps to prevent it from recurring , including the removal of senior management today s agreement was approved by officials at the highest levels of government , including the treasury secretary , the attorney general , the chairman of the federal reserve board and the securities and exchange c t ever assessed by securities regulators against an investment house , topped only by the 650 million penalties imposed on drexel in the drexel case , that firm s former junk bond financier , michael r milken , who is serving a 10year prison sentence in california , was also fined 900 million the money poses no financial jeopardy to salomon , which last quarter had a 190 million profit and whose brokerdealer affiliate alone has more than 2 billion in capital even before the settlement , the company had put 200 million in reserve against any government sanctions , and today it announced it would take a further 185 million charge for legal expenses and to fight dozens of other private lawsuits that have arisen from the scandal government officials said the settlement had vindicated the strategy of warren e buffett , who took control of the company as its new chairman and chief executive in the midst of the scandal in august , in large part to save his own substantial investment in it he quickly agreed to cooperate with the authorities and purged the company of the remaining senior executives who had known of several instances of phony bidding but failed to make it public or disclose it to the government in those instances where a corporation takes significant steps to right past wrongs , cooperates with the government and puts in place measures to avoid a recurrence , the government will look upon that corporation favorably , said otto g obermaier , the united states attorney in manhattan he called the steps taken by the firm following the disclosure of the phony bids unprecedented the company certainly revealed enough in its own statements that if one wanted to , there could have been a technically sufficient criminal charge care for financial system the settlement was also viewed as a statement that the government did not want to come down too onerously on an enormous and powerful investment house that had long been a valued customer of the treasury and whose collapse could be catastrophic for the financial system officials at the commission said they were particularly moved by the firm s pleas that harsher sanctions could spur regulators in britain , japan and germany to take strong steps against large salomon affiliates in those countries senior regulators went out of their way today to emphasize that the accord had provided the firm with what one official called a clean slate and that none of the infractions occurred after mr buffett had taken over

joyner in the places of those two are hubie brooks and von hayes , two veterans who had serious injuries and serious offensive deficiencies last year , and lee stevens , an unproven rookie the angels also have a new middle infield combination of bobby rose and gary disarcina in place of luis sojo and dick schofield key additions hayes , brooks and alvin davis , if he replaces stevens , are veterans whose production would be welcomed don robinson has brought his ancient knees and aging arm to the starting rotation key losses winfield and joyner were the angels offense last year , and kirk mccaskill s departure as a free agent prevented them from trading one of their three good starters key to season if mark langston , jim abbott and chuck finley pitch shutouts several times a week

descendant of tony la russa lamont , who succeeded jeff torborg , has the extra advantage of taking over a solid team general manager ron schueler made it more solid with an 11thhour trade for george

one of the most potent middle thirds of a lineup key additions steve sax will get on base , bell will drive him in , if he s still there , and kirk mccaskill , a 19game loser for california last season , will be one of the beneficiaries key loss they will miss sammy sosa , traded for bell , only if he rediscovers his hitting ability key to season jack mcdowell blossomed into a 17game winner last year , and now alex fernandez and greg hibbard have to join him as big winners the pitchers have to do their share because the hitters will kansas city royals the focus falls on their dramatic trade with the mets , which brought kevin mcreynolds , gregg jefferies and keith miller , and the trade will have an impact on the team but hal mcrae could have a greater impact because he showed signs last year of being an outstanding manager mcrae , as aggressive a player as this era has seen , has a vastly revised corps of players to work with , and the royals could be the surprise of the division their biggest need is for one of their starting pitchers to step forward and assume bret saberhagen s role as the staff leader key additions wally joyner , signed as a free agent , joins mcreynolds , jefferies and miller in giving the royals a new offense key losses anyone would miss saberhagen , but the royals concluded they were n't good enough to win with him so they decided to turn his arm into runs danny tartabull took many of those runs with him when he left as a free agent key to season the new hitters have to justify the moves , and the pitchers saberhagen left behind have to manufacture victories minnesota twins andy macphail and tom kelly have the best duet in baseball macphail , as general manager , gets the players , and kelly , as manager , leads them to a world series championship they have pulled off the act twice in the last five years , something no other general manager and manager have done last year , macphail signed jack morris and chili davis as free agents this year , morris moved to toronto , but macphail filled the gaping hole by acquiring john smiley , a 20game winner kelly s response to these moves is , andy makes me smarter key additions smiley pitched poorly in the playoffs , lasting only two and twothirds innings in two starts , but he gives a third solid starter to go with kevin tapani and scott erickson bill krueger was signed as a free agent to be a starter key losses they will miss morris , but they let dan gladden go because they wanted to use pedro munoz in the outfield key to season they have to avoid further injury kent hrbek suffered a dislocated shoulder in a foolish headfirst slide and mike pagliarulo incurred a perforated eardrum when he was hit by a practice changeup oakland athletics maybe they will muster the energy and talent to charge back to the top , but they have the look of a team that could just as easily pull a humpty dumpty it s not likely that tony la russa will allow his veteran players to quit a slow start , however , could prompt that kind of reaction
the justice department has ordered the fbi to take a new look at evidence used to convict a former immigration official imprisoned for conducting illegal searches of hispanicowned businesses in washington heights , senior lawenforcement officials in new york said the order , to reinterview at least a dozen witnesses , is the latest twist in an unusual legal case involving the former official , joseph occhipinti , who was convicted in june 1991 of violating the rights of shopkeepers during searches for illegal aliens who might be involved in the drug trade some witnesses testified that search warrants were never presented , and some who could not speak english said that mr occhipinti ordered them to sign forms written in english that said they had agreed to the searches 37month sentence the jury found the searches illegal but acquitted mr occhipinti , 42 years old , on charges that he stole money from the merchants he began serving a 37month jail sentence in may after losing an appeal before a federal court in new york amy kasner , a justice department spokeswoman , yesterday declined to comment on the case mr occhipinti s conviction drew strong criticism from the staten island borough president , guy v molinari , a frequent supporter of the police who said he had evidence that several witnesses in the trial had committed perjury two months ago , mr molinari , a republican and a longtime political associate of president bush , resigned as a super delegate and adviser to the president s reelection campaign , saying he was incensed by the justice department s refusal to reopen the case to many residents of washington heights , mr occhipinti , once a highly decorated veteran of the immigration and naturalization service , represents the harassment they say is a part of their lives to drug agents and police officers hundreds of whom held demonstrations in his support outside the federal courthouse in manhattan he is a martyr who was just doing his job aggressively , trying to root out drugs reluctant investigation the senior lawenforcement officials said that they were told recently to reinterview the witnesses in response to the charges made by mr molinari and that in the last few weeks they had begun doing so the officials , who insisted on anonymity , said that the fbi was proceeding reluctantly , in the face of what they called the politicizing of a closed case tony mitchell , the deputy press secretary for the bush campaign , declined to comment on the case james m fox , the head of the new york office of the fbi , also declined to discuss the case he said that it would be very unusual for the justice department to look into an investigation that has resulted in a conviction and has been affirmed on appeal it would normally take new evidence of significant weight to bring the department to that point , he said mr molinari said that he had affidavits from witnesses saying they committed perjury and that many of the witnesses were involved in drug dealing a possible return mr molinari declined yesterday to comment on the status of the case or whether his concerns had been met asked about his relationship to the bush campaign he said i'm hopeful that in the near future i can rejoin the campaign i 've been wrestling with my own conscience since i resigned why should i take out on the president whatever problems i had with the justice department \? the officials said that under pressure from mr molinari , the justice department took a cursory look at the case a few months ago , interviewing the prosecutors and defense lawyers , but did not proceed any further otto g obermaier , the united states attorney in manhattan , who tried the case , declined to comment jeh johnson , a former assistant attorney under mr obermaier , who is now at the law firm of paul weiss , rifkind , wharton garrison , confirmed that fbi investigators had questioned him about the case and that they indicated that they also planned to reinterview witnesses in response to mr molinari s charges that they committed perjury occhipinti and his supporters have been making this bogus claim for over a year , mr johnson said but they have never presented these witnesses to the judge who tried the case or the united states attorney in response to the charge that many of the witnesses were drug dealers who doubled as bodega owners , mr johnson said that s pure nonsense put out by the occhipinti propaganda machine he said that none of the witnesses had any convictions for narcotics , and that , in any case , 7 of the 36 witnesses called by the prosecution were lawenforcement officers who testified that mr occhipinti had denied the store owners their civil rights the charges against mr occhipinti centered on his actions during the course of project bodega , an operation devised to investigate allegations that a dominican drug cartel was using bodegas in washington heights to smuggle in aliens
the party the new york philharmonic gave itself on monday night for its 150th birthday began with an elephant from the big apple circus performing in the fountain plaza at lincoln center and ended with the audience at avery fisher hall offering a standing ovation and singing happy birthday just before it was showered with confetti shot from cannons the hall s balconies were draped with white cloth , with gold fringes that rustled lightly in front of the orchestra was a thick border of lilies and orchids a buffet preceded the event , and champagne followed it the entire concert \( except for the prefatory show on the plaza \) was also broadcast nationwide on pbs for the nation s oldest orchestra , it was a wholehearted celebration , seemingly not the sort of occasion for solemn assessment the musical festivities were meant to be as overwhelming as the confetti each of the three living conductors who have served as music directors of the philharmonic pierre boulez \( 1971 to 1977 \) , zubin mehta \( 1978 to 1991 \) and kurt masur , the incumbent conducted the orchestra in a signature piece that best served his strengths and represented his contributions to the new york philharmonic tradition this was an extraordinary idea unlike many other major orchestras in the united states , the new york philharmonic has lacked the longterm attentions of a single leader who might have given it a distinctive style and voice what better celebration could there be than a display of its multiple voices \? in la mer , by debussy , mr boulez would call upon the crystalline transparency he brought to the french impressionist repertory in till eulenspiegel s merry pranks , by richard strauss , mr mehta would show the vigorous energy he brought to the late romantic repertory and in dvorak s symphony no 9 \( from the new world \) , mr masur would revisit one of his interpretive triumphs from his first season , when he put his stamp on the orchestra with a rich , middleeuropean lyricism unfortunately , only mr masur s performance deserved the 10minute ovation that closed the concert despite some episodes of lapsed concentration , the dvorak was sweet , muscular and focused , showing the orchestra at its best mr mehta s performance provided a few intermittent glimpses of the fire that first brought him to the orchestra s attention , and at first his own episodic approach to the score seemed well suited to the music s sudden breaks and swoops and eccentric swagger but the performance soon became an assemblage of moments without much effect mr boulez was declared an honorary member of the philharmonic by stephen stamas , the chairman of the philharmonicsymphony society , in a presentation between performances but mr boulez , too , did not seem at his best debussy s sea , even in calm moments , was murky and unsettled there seemed to be little forward motion in its currents , and some of the sounds produced , while finely chiseled , were too weighty , sounding landlocked the orchestra paid an unusual tribute to another past music director , leonard bernstein , who would have relished the occasion if he were still alive after the opening signal from glenn dicterow , the concertmaster , the ensemble gave a brisk but uneventful reading of bernstein s candide overture , with the podium empty despite the festivities , a critic was tempted to be a bit churlish there must have been other ways to use the unusual gathering of talents after all , aside from the bernstein offering , all of the works were completed in a 12year period \( from 1893 to 1905 \) , all were programmatic , all were european , and none bore the weight and significance of the repertory that has lent its aura to organizations like the philharmonic this sense of uneasiness was amplified by the hourlong outdoor prelude lincoln center s own tribute to the orchestra with by al roker of wnbctv and paula zahn of wcbstv as hosts , the tribute was a television variety show , including christmas carols by singers from the juilliard school , a video publicizing the new york city ballet by imitating 1930 s dance films , and cesar the clown from the big apple circus , taking his invisible dog for a walk a 10minute video about the philharmonic was projected on a giant screen , and about a third of the plaza was filled with listeners in the frigid weather , but was this really the sort of public tribute , however wellmeaning , lincoln center should be offering \? it seemed a resolute refusal to see any difference between entertainment in its television guise and the real mission of organizations like the philharmonic from the outdoor balcony of avery fisher hall , it seemed as if the public were being offered circuses while nourishing bread was promised to those within there was also the condescending implication that there was no difference as it turned out , the bread inside seemed a bit stale , but mr masur s rousing performance of the new world was a sign that there were still offerings of substance to be made for that reason and for heralded achievements past one can only wish the orchestra another century and a half of musical exploration and interpretation
a trans world airlines jumbo jet taking off for san francisco veered from a runway in flames at kennedy international airport late yesterday afternoon , but the 291 passengers and crew members were swiftly evacuated and 57 people on board were reported to have sustained only minor injuries the fire , which was reported at 5 42 pm , apparently erupted in the cargo bay or tail engine , but its cause was not immediately determined passengers told of almost no panic , little screaming or pushing an almost eerie sense of order amid the glow of flames and the lifeordeath evacuation and aviation authorities later said a disaster that might have cost hundreds of lives had been averted with fire and heavy black smoke pouring from the fuselage of the l1011 jetliner , the plane crashed through a runway barrier , rolled 100 feet and came to a stop a mile south of the terminal area emergency exits were opened , yellow evacuation chutes popped out and those on board tumbled and slid to safety in what officials called a textbook example of proper crisis procedure amazingly rapid response a swarm of airportbased emergency vehicles and personnel surrounded the stricken jetliner in what witnesses called an amazingly rapid , threeminute response the passengers and crew were spirited out of danger and onto nearby buses , where they sat for an hour and watched their plane burn a bizarre sight that , to some , was like witnessing their own deaths and left many gasping and sobbing hysterically with pentup emotion it looked just like the hindenburg , said thomas price , a twa employee and witness who recalled the 1937 disaster in lakehurst , nj , where germany s airship burst into flames and burned on its maiden transatlantic voyage the flames yesterday eventually engulfed the widebody jet from wings to tail before being brought under control an hour after the aborted takeoff as night fell , the aircraft lay in ruins its midsection charred and broken , its tail tipped skyward and blackened , but its nose and wings intact , dipping forward and there were hundreds of stories a california writer who had lost all her copies \( paper and computer disk \) of her first novel a teacher from belgium who felt she had witnessed a movie tragedy a retired police officer who saw hysteria , but only after the danger was over a woman who said she was paralyzed with fear , but was saved by her levelheaded , 10yearold daughter and a flight attendant who led the way out despite pockets of smoldering flame , new york city firefighters boarded the aircraft finally and searched for any people who might have been trapped or left behind there were none , and aviation authorities expressed gratification with the outcome of an episode that could have resulted in hundreds of deaths they did a tremendous job , capt bob howell , a special assistant to the fire commissioner , said of the twa crew and other rescue personnel people are very fortunate to be alive , looking at this damage they had to be evacuated in a couple of minutes other officials affirmed that judgment a tragedy was averted , duncan pardue , a spokesman for the federal aviation administration , said as the injured 57 passengers and 11 rescue workers were taken to eight local hospitals and arrangements were made to provide hotel rooms and other assistance to travelers who had been on the plane asked if a bomb might have caused the fire , mr pardue said the question has been asked , but we have no information on that , one way or the other there s a belief it started in an engine , but we ca n't confirm that and we wo n't be able to for a couple of days mr pardue said he could not confirm reports that there had been radioactive materials on board , or that the pilot had been unaware of the fire until after it was seen by the airport control tower we have no information on that , the faa official said , although he noted that all such reports would be considered in an extensive investigation mr pardue said there had been no history of problems with the l1011 , a lockheedbuilt jet used on transcontinental and transoceanic flights it s a very reliable airplane , mr pardue said it has a good record trans world airlines , which has sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code , said the jet carried a near capacity load 275 passengers , 12 crew members and 4 nonworking employees of the airline , who were riding free to the west coast airport is shut down while the evacaution was apparently orderly , the incident created chaos at the airport

los angeles , may 20 when a suburban jury acquitted four los angeles police officers on nearly all charges of beating rodney g king three weeks ago , chief daryl f gates says , he was just as shocked as most other people who had followed the case the los angeles police chief said that while he had thought the jury might acquit or deadlock on three of the officers he thought the officer who rained the most blows on the prone mr king , laurence m powell , was certain to be convicted powell i thought was bought and paid for , chief gates said today in an interview i really believed that i was shocked but i did n't hear the evidence i did n't hear the defense chief gates , who has held the position for 14 years and who has been under fire since the beating of mr king on march 3 , 1991 , also said he would retire this summer i am not going to go beyond july 1 , he said they should not get so nervous the chief s retirement , in a sense , will bring an end to an era of law enforcement in urban america , an era when strongwilled police leaders like chief gates were the rule he will leave with his city in disarray and his reputation tattered in the aftermath of the riots that followed the verdict on april 29 missing the time to go even chief gates agrees that he stayed in office too long i keep thinking why did i stay so long , he said in his sixthfloor office at parker center , the police headquarters you keep thinking the probability of something like this happening in this business increases with the time you stay i knew that i could have left right after the olympics on a high note but i was n't ready i probably stayed at least three years too long then , the chief continued , he felt he could not leave in the midst of the upheaval over the king beating i could not run , he said thus , after the surprise verdict exploded in his face , the 65yearold chief will be leaving as a kind of tragic figure , a man whom many see as too proud for his own good he is a very articulate , welleducated professional , said his predecessor , tom reddin , but as he got deeper into his career he more and more reverted to old ways i really think it s a shame he can give 42 years of his life to the department and he is ending a career that was quite illustrious on a sour note after he retires , chief gates will go on tour to promote his new book , chief my life in the lapd \( bantam books , 1992 \) condemning an 'aberration' the book , written with diane k shah , a professional writer , was completed before the officers' trial began but in both the interview and the book , chief gates made clear that he had little sympathy for their behavior , which was captured on an amateur videotape , and expressed regret that he had not been more forceful in saying so from the outset rather than worrying about tainting the prosecution maybe i should have been far more candid about my feelings , the chief said maybe i should n't have worried about so much about due process from a politics standpoint , yeah , i should have come out swinging i should have let my feelings be known , no question about it beatings went out in 1856 this is not what we teach , not what we practice i said , 'this was an aberration that s not consistent with what we believe in this department' the politic thing would have been to express that feeling right from the outset , but i was overpowered by due process , which i sincerely believe in approval rating plummets in the book , chief gates described his first viewing of the videotape this way i stared at the screen in disbelief i played the oneminute fiftysecond tape again then again and again , until i had viewed it twentyfive times and still i could not believe what i was looking at to see my officers engaged in what appeared to be excessive use of force , possibly criminally excessive , to see them beat a man with their batons fiftysix times , to see a sergeant on scene who did nothing to seize control , was something i never dreamed i would witness it was a very , very extreme use of force extreme for any police department in america but for the lapd , considered by many to be perhaps the finest , most professional police department in the world , it was more than extreme it was impossible i sat there watching , terribly shocked feeling sick to my stomach , sick at heart the acquittals put chief gates in an awkward position at least one conviction might have validated his argument that the beating was an aberration within days of the beating , he urged criminal prosecutions , dismissed one of the four officers , a rookie , and brought administrative charges against nine other officers , including police bystanders at the scene chief gates said in the interview that there might not be time for him to preside over the administrative proceedings before he is succeeded by willie l williams , who is currently the police commissioner of philadelphia the police response to the riots , halting and disorganized at first , badly damaged the chief s reputation in a poll whose results were published friday , the los angeles times found that 81 percent of angelenos now disapproved of his performance as chief , compared with 16 percent in march 1988
tom seaver was up on a small platform at the new york sheraton , talking about what the baseball hall of fame meant to him my children , he said , will be able to take their children to the hall of fame and say 'there s your grandfather in his time , he was pretty good at what he did' now , noticing a small , grayhaired man in a camelhair overcoat near the rear of the room , tom seaver glanced at his watch this press conference started at 10 o'clock , he said with a sly smile , so i 'd like to thank phil rizzuto for showing up at 10 15 for three years , we 've worked together broadcasting yankee games on wpix and for three years he s called me seaver' from now on it s 'mr seaver' in the laughter , rizzuto chuckled and seaver cackled soon the now 47yearold treasure of the mets was asked about winning his 300th game in 1985 with the chicago white sox at yankee stadium it happened to be phil rizzuto day , seaver said you huckleberry , the familiar voice called out what do you know , he s still here , seaver said you huckleberry , said rizzuto , who is known for leaving yankee stadium before the game ends i got to get over the bridge you can call me 'mr huckleberry , ' seaver said call him mr highest percentage instead in the hall of fame election , his name was checked on a record 988 percent of the ballots , surpassing ty cobb s 982 percent in the original 1936 vote and henry aaron s 978 percent in 1982 among pitchers , bob feller s 937 percent in 1962 had been the high george thomas seaver was ignored on only 5 of the 430 ballots returned by the voting members of the baseball writers association of america three mailed in a blank ballot , protesting the hall of fame s edict that anybody on baseball s ineligible list , meaning pete rose , is ineligible for consideration one of the five does n't vote for firstyear eligibles one confessed to overlooking seaver shortly after openheart surgery but why the record landslide \? why was seaver virtually unanimous among voters often known for strange quirks of reasoning \? the answer seaver had no faults some voters look for a chink in the armor , but he had none he had the numbers 311 victories , 3 , 640 strikeouts , three cy young awards , a nohitter he had the world series ring , with the '69 mets he had class , smarts and good quotes as much as anything else , though , seaver projected the aura of being as pure a professional baseball player as there ever has been he had so much respect for baseball , it would have been disrespectful not to vote for him maybe it helped that seaver s highest salary , as he remembered yesterday , was only somewhere over one million in his last years with the white sox and the red sox nobody ever questioned that he was n't worth his contract he was a bargain and he was all business , all baseball , a trait he traces to a 1968 lecture from gil hodges , then the mets' new manager i was pitching against juan marichal at shea , he recalled i had an early lead and i was fiddling around on the mound , maybe in selfdefense of not wanting to get too tight i won the game , 76 , but gil told me that i had n't been professional , that a professional is the same in every game , 30 degrees or 90 degrees , 5 , 000 people or 50 , 000 people , sunday or wednesday , september or may he might have added , mets or reds , white sox or red sox some pitchers do n't always adjust to other teams in other cities in other leagues he adjusted when it was time for the writers to vote for tom seaver on the hall of fame ballot , there were no reasons not to vote for him and at the news conference yesterday for seaver and rollie fingers , the first pure relief pitcher in the cooperstown shrine , phil rizzuto was there even though he had a reason not to be the scooter should be in the hall of fame , but the veterans committee keeps ignoring him rizzuto could have stayed home yesterday , as his personal protest against the hall of fame , but he was there out of respect for a friend quietly now , the onetime yankee shortstop was talking about how bob feller was a little faster than seaver , but his control was n't half as good and about how seaver , always the pure professional , had helped him double his wpix salary just then , tom seaver came over to shake hands , smiling and saying , you still here \? not for long , phil rizzuto said another 2 minutes , it s 10 more for parking photo tom seaver \( reuters \)
munich , germany , july 7 behind their expressions of good intentions on world trade , the russian evolution and yugoslavia , president bush and president francois mitterrand of france danced a tense minuet today , with one eye on their own political problems and the other on an increasingly difficult transatlantic relationship carried out in dinners , formal meetings and ad hoc negotiations in the corridors of munich s residenz palace , the relationship between mr bush and mr mitterrand at the sevennation economic summit meeting seemed to crystallize the problems of the atlantic alliance as the united states and its european partners try to fit themselves into a postcoldwar order that none seems able to define clearly in public , the united states sought to give some credit to mr mitterrand , saying he had spurred the statement on yugoslavia that was issued by the seven leaders here today and that washington would continue to let him lead the european community s response to the war in bosnia and herzegovina like mr bush , mr mitterrand seems to be doing better abroad than at home he arrived here in the midst of a truckers' strike in france that has paralyzed roads and stranded travelers throughout the country officials from washington played down the notion that frenchamerican disputes were the major reason for the industrialized democracies' failure to reach an agreement on world trade that they have been promising for years private complaints but in private , united states officials complained about french intransigence in the trade talks the americans' public deference to mr mitterrand on yugoslavia was tempered by a political need to present mr bush as a strong leader and washington officials said privately that mr mitterrand was actually following mr bush s lead on the balkan fighting indeed , they said the communique was crafted in such a way as to take the issue out of the hands of the european community , where the united states is largely a bystander , and put it back in the united nations security council , which mr bush feels confident of dominating , if any largescale military action is needed for their part , the french signed a joint communique that spoke of an era where confrontation has given way to cooperation but they grumbled to reporters about washington s reluctance to agree to a new international conference on the balkans they said the americans were blocking for no good reason , as far as france was concerned a joint nuclear safety fund that would be administered by the frenchcontrolled european bank for reconstruction and development aides to mr bush and mr mitterrand said the two men get along well on a personal level , although mr bush s exuberant style clashes with mr mitterrand s more impassive demeanor both mr bush and secretary of state james a baker 3d are said to have a prickly relationship with the french foreign minister , roland dumas future us role questioned the two leaders' evident tensions spring in part from significant differences on global security issues , including the future of the north atlantic treaty organization and more broadly the future american role in europe the united states is trying to maintain the dominance of nato as the main european security force but france , which is not a member of the nato military structure , argues that the alliance is a coldwar institution and should evolve into something new they say the united states' influence in european affairs , which french officials resent , should be diminished france has been pressing for a new international conference on yugoslavia , and has been resisting american proposals that nato form a peacekeeping arm , on which the european countries could call in times of crisis through the 52member council on security and cooperation in europe paris wants the european security council to turn to individual countries for peacekeeping missions the united states can more easily control nato than the security council geopolitics and elections beyond these geopolitical considerations , the relationship between mr bush and mr mitterrand also reflects the extent to which the actions and statements of the two presidents and the five other leaders meeting here are colored by their political problems at home both presidents are facing crucial votes later this year on sept 20 , the french will vote in a referendum whether to approve the treaty on european union that mr mitterrand has staked his political standing on mr bush is facing his own political troubles in his battle to win a second term in november his political advisers want him to return from munich having demonstrated leadership in international affairs and a concern for american economic problems reaching a home audience when a reporter suggested this evening that mr bush had not put his stamp on the proceedings here , mr baker responded , i think you 're missing something i think that we as i said in the formal statement can and have served as a catalyst for action with respect to yugoslavia , mr baker said but leadership does n't mean doing it all by yourself it means doing it jointly with your partners where everyone can agree on what ought to be done and now we are in the happy circumstance of everyone agreeing on what ought to be done asked how much the 1992 election colored mr bush s actions here , mr baker , a seasoned political strategist who ran the president s 1988 campaign , said i do n't think to any extent at all i say with a very , very straight face the president is not here for domestic political reasons but mr baker hastened to connect the visit to the primary issue of the campaign the economy in terms of how it will impact economic growth at home , clearly we would love to see that enhanced , and the work that s done here by an american president can help in accomplishing that , he said
if it were possible to settle on a single great american opera , marc blitzstein s 1949 regina , a highly charged , musically inventive setting of lillian hellman s 1939 play the little foxes , would have to be a strong candidate for one thing , there are not that many works to consider \( though there are more than one might suppose , looking over schedules of american opera companies \) and few american works for the lyric stage have been more influential leonard bernstein and stephen sondheim are clearly indebted to blitzstein , who considered regina his masterpiece blitzstein s account of the corrupt wheeling and dealing of the greedy , soulless hubbard family will be seen in a new production at the new york city opera on friday evening it is as tautly suspenseful a piece of theater as the hellman original and at the same time a more serious and complex musical work than some early 20thcentury operas that have established themselves in the repertory as a result , regina has been seen as falling between two stools too operatic for the legitimate stage yet , until recently , too accessible perhaps even too american for success in the opera house though it has not suffered total neglect since its first presentation , neither has it become a repertory staple now , not only is city opera reviving regina , but decca london is also about to release a new recording of the work by the scottish opera and to complete what amounts to a blitzstein festival this month , on oct 14 the vineyard theater will present a new production of blitzstein s musical juno , the first new york revival of the work since its original broadway run 33 years ago in 1946 blitzstein was one of the most successful of the younger generation of american composers he had achieved enormous success 10 years before , at the age of 31 , with his politically radical musical the cradle will rock while none of his subsequent works for the stage had attained the same success , his symphonic compositions had won him prizes and international recognition energetic and ambitious , he wanted to write a big stage work that would secure him a position in the musical pantheon looking for a quintessentially american subject , he considered setting mark twain s gilded age and eugene o'neill s anna christie , among others , to music then hellman s little foxes was suggested according to eric gordon s recently published biography , mark the music , blitzstein thought it was the finest play written in america , and he hoped to transform it , he said , into something as real musically to americans as italian opera is to the italians the play s central theme , the destructive power of materialism , and its portrayal of the plight of blacks in the south , were tailormade for blitzstein s leftist convictions hellman gave him permission to use the work , with a proviso the composer would come to regret the opera would have to be subject to her approval set in turnofthecentury alabama , regina centers on the ambition of the ruthless title character and her brothers to build a series of sweatshops to close the deal , they must persuade regina s ailing husband , horace , to invest in the scheme when he refuses to have anything to do with it , the hubbard brothers steal bonds from him horace confronts regina , who tells him she has always loathed him he suffers a heart attack , and she coldly watches as he tries to crawl to his room for his medicine at opera s end , regina has her deal but is left alone the composition of regina took blitzstein three years substantial alterations were made in previews in new haven and boston at the insistence of the producer , cheryl crawford , who wanted the piece reduced from three acts to two and plentifully stocked with showstopping numbers , and of lillian hellman , who strenuously objected to alterations in her story , particularly the strengthening of the black characters , which she regarded as sentimentality the opera opened on broadway in october 1949 to mixed reviews virgil thomson was particularly acidulous still , it had intensely loyal adherents aaron copland was so excited by the piece that when asked his opinion immediately after seeing it , he replied , with 'regina , ' mr blitzstone has created a milestein in the theater the production closed after 56 performances a disappointment , but hardly a humiliation for a contemporary opera on broadway the current revival at city opera , directed by rosalind elias , is the company s third presentation of regina in 1953 it presented the work with the original sets on that occasion , the opera received an overwhelmingly favorable response while lillian hellman went on record approving of blitzstein s treatment of her most famous work , she never really forgave him for having such a success with it at a memorial service after his death in 1964 , she still carried on the feud eric gordon writes even in the hour of his death , she referred unrelentingly to the 'failure' of 'regina' city opera revived it again in 1956 , in a heavily cut production directed by herman shumlin and designed by howard bay , who had created the original production of the little foxes in 1939 shumlin , who had once been hellman s lover , eliminated the ragtime numbers blitzstein had written the material hellman had objected to most vehemently the production was recorded by cbs , and that set was the only recording of the opera until now for the new decca london release , john mauceri , the music director of the scottish opera , has restored all the material cut from the 1956 production as well as some music excised in previews since the cut version is the one everyone knows , mr mauceri said in a recent conversation , i thought it would be valuable to hear the complete version , one that would come as close as we could make it to the composer s original intentions it took us 15 years it s not as if everybody was dying to be helpful in restoring 'regina' there are many people who love it the way it was the restoration originated with leonard bernstein , a close friend of the composer s lenny told me that he had sworn an oath on marc blitzstein s grave that he would fix 'regina , ' said mr mauceri after some initial meetings , bernstein dropped out , and mr mauceri and the musicologist tommy krasker carried on the work , which was completed shortly before bernstein s death one of those who love the opera the way it was is ms elias , who is using the sets of a production she directed at the boston lyric opera the city opera production will rely on the reduced text of the 1956 revival , with a few additional cuts i 've tightened up the piece so that we get right to the theater part of it , ms elias said i really do believe that that s the way blitzstein wanted it so after a long period of deprivation , new yorkers now have the luxury of two competing versions of regina to choose from mr mauceri sees the need for reconsideration of the work in a larger context it is now time to look back through this century at the operas , the musicals and the things in between that have no name , he said , to reexamine them and see which ones we can take into the next century there must be 10 , 15 , maybe 20 of them there can be little doubt that regina will take a preeminent place on that list photos blitzstein , left , coaches priscilla

ayodhya , india , dec 6 a screaming mob of thousands of hindu militants stormed a 16thcentury mosque here today and demolished it with sledgehammers and their bare hands , plunging india into a political and religious crisis the destruction of the mosque , which has been a focus of tensions between hindus and muslims for several years , raised the danger of a renewal of the conflicts between the groups that have claimed tens of thousands of lives in the last four decades prime minister p v narasimha rao addressed the nation tonight , speaking , he said , under the grave threat that has been posed to the institutions , principles and ideals on which the constitutional structure of our republic has been built 'a matter of great shame' the destruction of the mosque , the prime minister said , is a matter of great shame and concern for all indians this is a betrayal of the nation and a confrontation with all that is sacred to all indians as the legacy which we have inherited as a part of our national ethos of india s 882 million people , 83 percent are hindus and 11 percent muslims when india and pakistan were created in the partition of british india in 1947 , india , unlike its islamic neighbor , was constituted as a secular state in which no religion was to exercise political dominance but over the years , tensions between hindus and muslims have erupted periodically , challenging india s viability as a secular society after hindu militants stormed the mosque in 1990 , about 1 , 000 people died in violence and the central government was brought down today s demolition was the first time hindus had razed a mosque since partition four hindus were killed and at least 100 were injured by falling debris , news reports said the attack came after hindu revivalist leaders from political and religious groups called for hindus from around india to come to ayodhya , in uttar pradesh state in northeastern india , to begin construction of a temple to the hindu god ram , also called rama , and to destroy the mosque of babar hindu fundamentalists say the mosque was built on a sacred hindu site , the very spot where ram was born the mosque has been an important holy site for muslims since it was built in 1528 by the emperor babar , who led the mogul conquest of india no longer in use the mosque was no longer used for prayers , but muslims had refused to relinquish control of the building , fearing that that could lead to the dispossession of muslim shrines throughout india india s supreme court ruled last week that there should be no construction of the hindu temple , which was to be built on the land occupied in part by the mosque , and that the mosque itself should remain undamaged several hindu religious leaders and the state government of uttar pradesh , which is run by the hindu fundamentalist political party , the bharatiya janata , said at times in the last week that they would obey the court s injunction as word of the mosque s destruction filtered out of this dusty holy city , the chief minister of the state announced his resignation , which came before his certain dismissal by prime minister rao for failing to protect the mosque immediately afterward , the president of india , shankar dayal sharma , took control of the state and dismissed the state legislature the central government also ordered security forces to move here to restore order army put on alert the indian army was put on alert in six states , and curfews were declared in many cities and towns with mixed populations of hindus and muslims for the last week , tens of thousands of hindus have been streaming into this town , sent from around the country by organizers from the national volunteer force , the world hindu council and the bharatiya janata party , which is the main opposition party in parliament they were told that they would begin building an immense temple to ram at precisely 12 26 pm today , a time deemed propitious by hindu holy men the hindus descended on this town of 15 , 000 , home to an 8 , 000 shrines , temples and other holy buildings , moving into tent cities , schools and public buildings taken over by the militant groups throughout the week , hindu leaders issued a stream of statements , sometimes vowing to abide by the court decision to desist from any construction work , at other times launching fiery broadsides at the court and the prime minister on saturday , hindu leaders met here to decide whether to proceed with the temple s construction or to engage in a symbolic exercise of clearing the ground on which the temple would be built , activity perhaps sufficient to placate the feverish passions militants defy leaders early this morning it appeared that the decision to conduct only a symbolic act had won the day the crowd s initial discipline , maintained in part by a network of whistleblowing marshals and underpinned by the assurances from hindu leaders that only ceremonial activities would be conducted , lent a sense of calm and lightness but some young militants said they would destroy the mosque and start work on the temple regardless of what their leaders said one , anu aggarwal , who said he was from new delhi , hurried by with a group of militants waving swords , clubs and iron pipes , and brandished an air pistol aggressively
the new hampshire presidential primary is still a week away but president bush has already frozen out his republican challenger patrick buchanan in the race to get on the ballot for new york s april 7 republican primary that means the primary is over mr bush has won it without the bother of an election sadly , his victory comes at the expense of voters , and democracy many states reserve a spot on the primary ballot for all nationally recognized candidates but not , alas , the empire state new york persists in forcing presidential candidates to spend scarce time and early resources collecting petition signatures in support of their delegate candidates a tedious process that puts a premium on clubhouse support and penalizes lesserknown contenders on top of that , william powers , the state republican party chairman and a strong supporter of mr bush , rigged the rules to protect his candidate the deadline for filing republican delegate petitions was last thursday a week earlier than the democratic deadline mr powers chose that date to minimize the ability of candidates without mr bush s organizational support to capitalize on momentum from iowa or new hampshire further , mr powers threatened to utilize nits in new york s nitpicking election law to challenge mr buchanan s petitions that threat hampered the buchanan camp s amateurish effort to find sufficient petition carriers and signers predictably , mr bush easily qualified delegate slates in each of the state s 34 congressional districts mr buchanan , meanwhile , did even worse than expected he qualified exactly none , thereby canceling the april 7 republican primary not even the most ardent opponent of mr buchanan s demagogic brand of politics can take pride in that result mr bush has won the state s 100 delegates four times the number at stake in the new hampshire balloting without a single vote being cast this national embarrassment casts shame on the state s republican leaders and strengthens the case for reform of the undemocratic state election law that invites such travesties
melissa lopez sat in the waiting room of the william f ryan community health care center yesterday , waiting for a pediatrician to examine her feverish niece she had heard , she said , about the health care plan proposed by mayor david n dinkins on monday , but she wondered what was new the mayor s proposal that each medicaid patient have a personal doctor sounded to her like the way care is already provided at the ryan center , where she has been going for nearly five years the dinkins administration s plan to eventually provide every poor person in the city with a family doctor is not new the concept has been discussed for decades in new york and around the country as the ideal approach to preventive health care similarly , the plan , known as managed care , is not untried already there are more than a dozen city clinics like the ryan center , on the upper west side of manhattan , which serve as models for the new clinics proposed by the mayor what is new , judging from the details released so far , is the scope of the plan s longterm goals most of the managedcare programs that already exist are private , providing care to the relatively small populations of their immediate neighborhoods the dinkins plan , in contrast , would be an ambitious attempt by government to coax a large number of medicaid patients to seek primary care in clinics rather than hospital emergency rooms , in effect returning to the way medical care used to be but has not been for a long time 'have to start somewhere' it s a new bottle , old wine , said dr merle c cunningham , medical director of the sunset park family health care center of the lutheran medical center in brooklyn , whose clinic assigns doctors for the continuous treatment of medicaid patients this was a great idea in the 60 s it was a great idea in the 70 s and in the 80 s , and it s still a great idea , just as long as the city does it right what it would take to do it right is the subject of much debate in announcing the program , cesar perales , deputy mayor for health and human services , said the goal was to provide doctors where there currently are none , giving patients an alternative to the emergency room for their basic medical care initially , he said , three new centers would be built and 17 existing clinics would be converted into fullservice 24hour health centers , at an estimated cost to the city of 20 million another 139 million would be spent to hire 600 doctors , nurses and other workers for those centers those 20 centers would only be able to meet about 5 percent of the need , mr perales said , but you have to start somewhere the centers would be run like health maintenance organizations and would be paid a flat monthly fee by medicaid for each patient patients who do not qualify for medicaid would be charged a sliding fee based on their incomes in exchange for that fee , the clinic would provide all the patient s care , including referrals to specialists when needed that approach is known as capitation , or perhead payment critics say it encourages doctors to undertreat patients because the fee remains the same regardless of how often a patient comes to the clinic supporters say that capitation encourages preventive care , because if a patient becomes sick he will be a greater economic drain on the clinic health care experts described the plan as a start , but only a start , toward better care for the poor there is concern that the announcement might be only a political move , one in a spate of proclamations of increases in city services as mr dinkins s reelection campaign nears if there s no longterm commitment , the program will die , said barry l liebowitz , president of the doctors council , which represents the 3 , 000 doctors employed by the city this ca n't just be the idea of the month mr perales , who calls the proposed plan my baby , said he regrets that the timing of the announcement came in the middle of good news week , at city hall the timing is unfortunate for me , he said but this has been in the works a long time and it represents a longterm commitment 'a little skeptical' there is concern , too , that the plan is too ambitious for the city s health and hospitals corporation and the department of health , which will run the new centers the city s municipal hospitals , run by the hospitals corporation , are currently overcrowded and financially troubled similarly , many health department clinics are inefficient and dingy reading what has been happening with the city hospitals , i feel a little skeptical about the city taking on this new plan , said dr pedro plamenco , the associate director of adult medicine at sunset park specifically , there are questions about whether the city can find enough doctors to staff the clinics both the hospitals corporation and the health department regularly have problems finding and retaining doctors dr liebowitz said the doctors would have to be paid enough to keep them , a figure he put at 100 , 000 a year at the ryan center , staff doctors are paid between 75 , 000 and 80 , 000 , said barbara minch , the deputy director turnover , she said , is not a problem mr perales said no salary has been set for the doctors dr emilio carrillo , who resigned as president of the health and hospitals corporation last year and who is now the medical director of the ryan center , said it would take more than money to find doctors for the new centers he said the city would have to rethink the entire relationship between the city hospitals and the private medical centers that staff them the medical centers must create more training programs in such primary care specialties as obstetrics , pediatrics and family medicine , dr carrillo said even skeptics agree , however , that when managedcare centers in poor neighborhoods work , they work well both the ryan center and the sunset park center are clean , modern places , with comfortable chairs and a cheerful staff recent visits found that patients wait longer than they might like but not as long as they would in a local emergency room you do have to wait , but you have to wait everyplace , said carmen ortiz , who was at sunset park with her 7monthold daughter , jennifer ms ortiz said she particularly likes that the same doctor sees her daughter at every checkup and that she was even allowed to change doctors when she did not feel comfortable with the first one assigned most patients said that they would prefer to have a private doctor in a small personal office , but that they could not afford that luxury the private doctor was more personal , said louis rodriguez , who lost his insurance recently when he lost his job now i have to resort to this generally it s not that bad the care i 've seen is ok photo the william f ryan community health care center in manhattan serves as a model for the new clinics proposed by mayor david n dinkins dr pleno moise examined megan edwards , as

the reaction to the criminal charges against sol wachtler , former chief judge of new york s judicial system , puts into bleak perspective the anniversary reviews of the lessons of anita hill the unmistakable conclusion is that established institutions of our society , most dismayingly the judiciary , still do not get it the case has been treated by the press , public opinion and the legal system as a tragedy , as if what mr wachtler is accused of a monthslong criminal campaign against his former lover , joy silverman , involving extortion , blackmail , a kidnapping threat and , yes , sexual harassment were a fatal but victimless error by contrast , ms silverman and her 14yearold daughter , who is said to have received a graphic sexual message and a condom along with a kidnapping threat from judge wachtler , have received none of the public sympathy and regret that have flowed to him everybody calls mr wachtler and says hello and just starts crying , a friend says of wachtler s reversal of fortune , to quote from a new york times article and headline of nov 11 and 9 , as though his predicament were foisted on him by the gods in previous national dramas involving a powerful man s fall from grace , the gods have been that sacred icon of our culture , the scorned woman just as this wicked but pitiable figure was invoked , fabulously , to anita hill , so did it propel fbi agents to first suspect the estranged wife of ms silverman s current boyfriend even though authorities say she too was tormented by the judge the former wife reportedly received none of the official courtesies that have been lavished on mr wachtler , leading one to wonder how ms silverman herself would have fared had she been jane doe rather than a generous republican fundraiser who could get the director of the fbi on the telephone in the wachtler affair , though , it was not the woman who was scorned the assumption behind the spurned man , however , is that the departing lover somehow provoked his fury the myth of male innocence is completed when the man s other victim , his wife , comes forward , as joan wachtler did , to declare her abiding love for her husband of course , no one is so politically incorrect as to assert this stereotype of woman as temptress who gets what s coming to her , except in rape trials instead , mr wachtler is morally absolved by some unidentified medical condition though a recent brain tumor theory cannot explain why his professional conduct appeared to his colleagues to be free of aberration beyond the narrow grievance of sexism , the behavior of mr wachtler s fellow judges on the new york court of appeals has insulted the principle of equal justice , the sacrament for which their court is supposedly the high church they refused to suspend him expressing not innocentuntilprovedguilty idealism , but what the acting chief judge , richard d simons , called deepest sympathy for judge wachtler and his family this raises alarm not only about their sensitivity to the appearance of impropriety \( not to mention , on a purely humane level , to the people mr wachtler is accused of harming \) but about their impartial regard of criminal suspects when the judge finally phoned in his resignation after tuesday s hearing before a federal magistrate , judge simons accepted this news reluctantly but necessarily , adding that it had been a very stressful time for both the court and the wachtler family who can look at the state s senior judges groveling before their former boss and not think invidiously of how the system they preside over treats the average defendant \( in whom sex outside of marriage is seen as a cultural pathology \) \? as public opinion and , seemingly , the courts appear to conspire with mr wachtler s lawyer to spare his client the humiliation of prison , one grieves for what may be the biggest victim of all , lady justice

nathaniel white , 32 years old , as an outandout vicious killer who had slain five people this summer they said mr white apparently met some of his victims in bars and that he knew the family of the

been reporting to parole officers since then he was taken into custody on monday for questioning in one disappearance and led the police to three of the bodies , two in goshen and one in wawayanda

of the killings , and that he has since confessed to all six examining other slayings the police said yesterday at a news conference in middletown that mr white had been charged with six counts of seconddegree murder they said they would look into other unsolved slayings to see if he might be involved with this kind of guy , you ca n't rule it out , said capt gregory c sitler of the state police a spokesman for the state division of parole said mr white had not set off any alarms in the parole system the spokesman , david ernst , said in an interview with the associated press what was in the man s background that would have suggested to us that he was a murderer \? there was none the victims were from central orange county , about an hour s drive from manhattan , from elmsford in westchester county and from the dutchess county city of poughkeepsie three of the victims were stabbed to death the cause of death of the other three has not yet been determined maj james d o 'donnell

husband of the county executive , mary mcphillips , a former coroner , said in an interview yesterday that until a few days ago , when the middletown record published a small article that described three murders and their similarities , there was little recognition that these deaths might be linked , especially since one of the killings occurred a year ago you start thinking , 'come on , this is little middletown , ' mr mcphillips said 'these kinds of things do n't happen here' middletown has a population of 24 , 000 the 14yearold , christine m klebbe of goshen , ny , was reported missing on july 1 in recounting what led to mr white s arrest , captain sitler said the first break in the case came on monday , when the police were told that mr white and an acquaintance , a relative of miss klebbe , had been in the company of two women who were then reported missing on july20 those two women , who were cousins , have been identified as angela hopkins , 23 , of poughkeepsie , and brenda l whiteside , 20 , of elmsford in westchester county captain sitler said that officers recognized the name of the suspect because of prior dealings he said that mr white , initially picked up for vehicle violations , gave an account that included inconsistencies and eventually provided information that led the police to the three bodies mr white was initially arrested in the slaying of adriane m hunter , a 27yearold middletown woman whose nude body was discovered on july 30 in a wooded area in goshen by a man walking his dog later , he was also charged in the killing of the teenager and the two cousins who had been listed as missing , and in the death of juliana r frank , 29 , of middletown , who was killed on march 25 , 1991 and whose body was later found in an unused railroad bed in middletown the sixth woman mr white was charged with killing was laurette huggins reviere , who was found nude after being stabbed to death in her middletown home on july 10 mr ernst , the parole agency s spokesman , said that mr white served two years in state prison for robbing three convenience stores in orange county and was paroled in november 1989 major o 'donnell of the state police said mr white was arrested again on april 17 , 1991 , for kidnapping and assault in an case involving the knifepoint abduction of a woman orange county prosecutors agreed to drop the felony charges against him in return for his pleading guilty to a misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment charge he was sentenced to nine months in prison and given an additional three months for violating parole defending parole decision he was paroled again on april 23 , 1992 parole board officials visited his home , and mr white himself reported to the local parole board office , mr ernst said mr ernst defended the decision to add just three months to mr white s sentence for violating parole he said mr white s behavior in custody and on parole did not suggest that he could have committed murder he had one robbery , he said how we or anyone else was supposed to know that he was involved in more serious violations is unknown to us mayor gertrude mokotoff of middletown said in an interview last night that officials had not wanted to turn it into a panic situation when people began to speculate about links between the murders now , she said , everybody will take a deep sigh of relief at the colonial diner in middletown last night , news of the killings and mr white s arrest spread from table to table , as police officers , taxi drivers and others compared notes most at the restaurant said that , before tuesday , they had not been aware of thekillings as they learned the names of the dead , they tried to remember their faces and to recall when they last had seen them around town but many said they had never heard of the the suspect while the arrest brought some r c e ou have to look behind you all the time , said kathi coates , 39 , a telephone operator for syndicate taxi in middletown , who had learned about the killings yesterday they kept it very hushhush , said her husband , ed , who drives a taxi for the same company jim wolfe , 52 , a highschool teacher , said that outsiders often mistake middletown for a small town something that it is not this is a small city with all the problems of a big city , he said photo nathaniel white with officers yesterday after he

wimbledon , england hair braided neatly , straight out of a robert herrick poem , a sprightly young ballgirl bent down for a loose tennis ball yesterday , only to encounter pure living terror , the yank from hell looming above her was the grim executioner himself , j p mcenroe jr , wielding a tennis racquet at the offending ball but about to clobber her directly on the wrist is this what americans do to us on their fourth of july \? the ballgirl may have thought as her life flashed before her eyes do they sever the hands of innocent ballgirls over some longago revolution \? fortunately , mcenroe stayed his weapon before doing any damage he later smashed a free ball in the general direction of an umpire who had displeased him , and he fired his racquet into the moist soil of center court , digging up a divot ultimately , mac flung his own skinny body on the ground , and simulated death throes for none of this was he penalized it was just good oldfashioned professional machoguy tennis most of junior s aggression was aural , as he and andre agassi grunted and groaned their way through three sets , with agassi taking all of them , 64 , 62 , 63 , to move into today s final with goran ivanisevic this could have been the noisiest wimbledon match in history , with both players exhaling loudly , straight from the diaphragm , on nearly every point mcenroe was dan aykroyd , and agassi was john belushi in the neverbeforereleased film samurai tennis they flailed imaginary swords , broke imaginary boards with flicks of their hands , emitting great screams aykroyd tried to slice belushi , but belushi stayed at the baseline and pounded the ball back this match could have been covered blindfolded a typical point sounded like this ugh ! oof ! argh ! aiee ! nooo ! usually , agassi had crushed a twohanded backhand a foot past mcenroe neither of these mighty warriors was served a summons by the all england club decibel police , which must surely exist , like the very real hemline truth squads at the henley rowing races women who show their kneecaps at henley are summarily executed , or haughtily scolded , whichever is worse you 've got to have standards particularly for women our two american samurai got away with the din because they are , to put it bluntly , men by contrast , monica seles has been hounded by the furies in the past two weeks of course , seles deserved all she got because she ducked wimbledon last year , merely because she had a hairline shin fracture from the moment seles arrived this year , she was pursued by rented decibel meters , which were soon labeled gruntometers in her first match , seles was measured at the noise level of the hornsey rise no 14 bus grinding gears in a roundabout the decibel journalists packed up their meters and went off to write an indepth 250 words for the next edition out came jimmy connors , same court , grunting like the concorde crashing into big ben nobody cared in her semifinal match , seles was cautioned twice by the chair umpire for emitting her bizarre twotone squeaks , which sometimes attract nearby flocks of bats after she lost to seles , martina navratilova complained she could not hear the ball since seles got rid of her selfconscious woody woodpecker giggle a few years back , it is assumed she can just stop the squeaking on the court , but it may not be that simple the whole point of women s tennis in the last generation has been that women are free to be powerful , competitive , sweaty , noisy jocks , just like the men yesterday , steffi graf pounded seles , 62 , 61 , and even graf thought seles had been inhibited there was so much about the grunting , maybe it got to her , graf said seles , still only 18 , has had to think about ghastly warfare in her old home , what used to be yugoslavia , she has had to sweat out a bomb threat here , and the swarms of gruntologists , plus the trauma of growing up rich and famous i thought i could really start today , seles said , meaning she tried to tone down her noise i 've been getting letters , and 95 percent of them say , 'do n't listen to them' i'm in the middle now i think mcenroe was grunting today he sure was it would be a shame if , through some reverse gamesmanship , they took away her squeak photo john mcenroe \( reuters \)

niagara falls , ontario , sept 30 like many of the thousands of people who make their livings off niagara falls , nick ricci , who owns a hotel on a wooded ridge overlooking the falls , now wants the canadian and american governments to regulate the sightseeing helicopters that churn through the skies overhead at a rate of nearly one every five minutes watching the thundering greenblue waters of the falls today , mr ricci noted that the collision of two of the helicopters on tuesday caused one to crash just 200 yards from his building if the wind had been blowing in toward the hotel instead of out , that copter could have hit us , he said it s pretty unsettling three passengers two from brooklyn and one from queens and the pilot of one of the helicopters were killed none of the five people on the other helicopter were seriously injured long ignored as noisy nuisances or grudgingly accepted as necessary evils in the allimportant tourist trade , the helicopters have suddenly become threatening and unwanted to many residents including many who know their economic value in a recessionstrapped region tourist tapes sought moreover , the crash , the cause of which was still undetermined today , has raised questions about whether the aviation authorities on both sides of the border should start restricting when , where and how many helicopters can tour the falls at least three companies operate a total of 200 or more sightseeing flights daily during peak season as many as five helicopters have been known to be airborne above the falls simultaneously this is going to change everyone s thinking about the helicopters , said mr ricci , 33 , a former professional hockey player who now owns the oakes inn they fly overhead constantly and i never thought about them now , i realize it s just too dangerous in essence , anyone with a pilot s license can cruise the congested area along any route they choose , officials said all we do is recommend an altitude and flight pattern , said david tomczak , an air traffic controller at niagara falls international airport but there is nothing that says they have to do anything the crash victims were identified today as ben poprawski of north tonawanda , ny , 42 years old , the pilot orna levy , 19 , of queens esther zarian , 23 , of brooklyn , and amnon sarfate , 26 , of brooklyn investigators from the canadian transportation safety board continued inspecting pieces of the crumpled mcdonnell douglas 500e helicopter , which remained at the crash site the canadian authorities have asked tourists who might have videotaped the collision to submit their tapes to investigators there were hundreds of sightseers in the area at the time because helicopters do n't have flight data recorders , we do n't know what actually happened , said jim harris , a spokesman for the canadian transportation safety board flights are suspended sightseeing flights have been suspended indefinitely while the investigation , which could take months , continues though there has been no shortage of accounts from witnesses , many of them conflict the survivors of the crash made no public statements yesterday but most accounts agree that the smaller helicopter , owned by rainbow helicopters of niagara falls , ny , lost control when one or both of its rotor blades were clipped by the other helicopter , owned by niagara helicopters ltd of niagara falls , ontario after the collision , the american helicopter plummeted into the wooded ridge below mr ricci s hotel the second helicopter landed a mile away the question about regulating the helicopters has stirred debate scott b hughes , general manager of rainbow helicopters , said pilots could easily avoid each other if they maintained radio contact over the open frequency used by helicopter pilots there s no doubt in my mind that our pilot was in continuous radio contact with the other pilot , he said today so what happened \? damned if i know passengers can distract but harold bucholtz , who owns another americanbased helicopter company , said pilots were often distracted by the excited chatter of their passengers for sure , the guy sitting next to you is going to be asking questions about you altitude , where you 're going to turn and what s that thing on the left , he said you can lose 200 feet in altitude in a few seconds if you 're not paying attention mr bucholtz said the federal aviation administration and its canadian counterpart should begin setting mandatory flight patterns and altitudes for the helicopter flights in the wake of the crash in niagara falls , momentum has built on both sides of the border for banning or severely restricting helicopter flights two weeks ago , rob nicholson , the member of parliament representing niagara falls , introduced legislation banning lowaltitude flights over the falls and on the american side , barbara a geracitano , a niagara falls city councilwoman , said she plans to reintroduce a bill to ban helicopters from taking off inside the city limits the bill was narrowly defeated two years ago amid fears it would hurt the local tourist trade but now , ms geracitano said , the tide of opinion has shifted people will still come they 'll just get a great view from the ground , she said dependence on tourism along main street in niagara falls on the american side , where scores of vacant stores stand in bleak testimony to the bad economic times , the debate over helicopters was on many residents' minds yesterday it s such a racket you ca n't talk over it , said ruth hooker , 59 , whose apartment building overlooks the niagara river gorge the wind catches their blades and all you hear is bang , bang , bang , chop , chop , chop but in norm s bar across the street , the thought of banning a tourist attraction put a scare into marla fadel , who owns the tavern the industries are gone , we 're really depressed here , she said the helicopters are good for business they should stay
woodbourne , n , y , dec 9 among the ways of retribution inside the winered walls of the state prison here , none is felt as dearly as the simple breezes from the outside world that regularly tease john massey , dean of the lifers , as he attends to his duties near the exit of the departure center and says goodbye to fellow convicts whose prison time is done i'm looking at that door and i'm getting that breeze every time the door is opened , says mr massey , a 48yearold convicted murderer , kidnapper and robber now in the third decade of a sentence of 25 years to life and there i am , with the door constantly being shut in my face , he says , talking evenly , patiently with eight other longterm convicts about surviving atop the glacier of time they have amassed for themselves mindful of how indulging rage and ennui can simply compound the experience of prison , the nine men have organized as the longtermers committee at the woodbourne correctional facility they busily search for the best ways of fulfilling their sentences and convincing authorities that despite current sentencing and parole practices , they deserve a fresh chance sooner rather than later a hopehungry fraternity the men are part of a lifers' network scattered across the 67prison state system , a hopehungry fraternity of some of society s more horrific criminals who nevertheless , prison officials say , are probably the most rehabilitationminded convicts and the strongest leaders i find in my experience murderers are the best bet , the state commissioner of corrections , thomas a coughlin 3d , flatly attests , supporting a legislative proposal he and others have made it would allow such prisoners time off for good behavior , giving them a chance of parole before they finish serving their minimum sentences the proposal might not go down easily in a society more inclined to crack down on violent criminals it is intended to provide prisoners , particularly those with terms of 15 years and more , with some outside , reliable incentive for early rehabilitation , and to create a distinction between the prisoner who advances in education and behavior and the one who lounges at the television set or card table a lot of time , people do n't want to hear this sort of talk about murderers , said commissioner coughlin his goodbehavior proposal would essentially restore an approach that had been in effect until 1965 when tighter power was accorded to parole officials twentyfive other states have similar plans 'not going to kill again' after they get their head together , these people are not going to kill again , said mr coughlin it s interesting in the first seven or eight years inside they can be the biggest pains of all , but then they 're no trouble they become introspective , go to college , join organizations and from maybe years 12 to 25 , they are very productive they 're the ones , if i got a problem inside , i talk to them even so , the proposal for mercy would seem to have little chance before a legislature well committed to increased incarceration as the chief method of meeting the modern wave of violent crime that method , which includes making it harder to be paroled , has seen the prison population triple to more than 60 , 000 in the last 20 years the proposal would let prisoners who behave well become eligible for their first parole hearing up to onethird sooner after 10 years for the 15yearsto life prisoner and after 16 years and eight months for the 25yearstolifer it s time to inject a healthy dose of realism into our sentencing policies , declared state senator joseph l galiber , the bronx democrat who is a chief proponent of the change some prisoners are incorrigible , but it is equally true that others are able to turn their lives around one reason for change , he argues , is that the prison budget is excessively swollen by a crackdown strategy and has begun eating up scarce state money for education and other needs snows and sugarplum dreams such a proposal is the stuff of sugarplum dreams for lifers here inside woodbourne prison , where holiday snows in the catskills can be contemplated from the barred windows , dusting the cow pastures that stretch toward the open horizon the prisoners have their hopes up , as well , for a shift in the criminal justice mood once presidentelect bill clinton takes office they speculate that since mr clinton supported capital punishment as governor of arkansas and thereby avoided being labeled as soft on crime , he might be freer to speak up now for other prison revisions this would reverse what prisoners and some professionals say is new york s paradox gov mario m cuomo is known for staunchly opposing capital punishment but also for avoiding executive clemency and for upholding rigorous life sentences as his demonstrated alternative to the death penalty as spokesman for the longtermers , mr massey was recently let out for a few hours to testify at sing sing prison at an unusual legislative hearing held by mr galiber there , lifers and several wardens and prison administrators from around the state complained of the openended vagueness of current procedures that allow parole officials to simply extend sentences indefinitely in twoyear intervals once the lifers have passed 15 or 25year minimums raul russi , chairman of the state board of parale , has said that officials must heed the vibes of the community in focusing more on the original crime than on a prisoner s progress in rehabilitation 'man can change if he wants'

more than 200 people representing small businesses , the sick and the elderly crowded into an auditorium in manhattan yesterday to assail rate increases requested by empire blue cross and blue shield , new york state s largest health insurer , saying that if the increases were granted tens of thousands of people might be forced to drop coverage altogether the ailing company has asked the state to approve rate increases as of jan 1 , ranging from 20 percent to 53 percent for its 15 million individual and smallgroup subscribers those customers who are selfinsured or who work in companies that have from 3 to 50 employees empire says it is losing money so rapidly that its cash reserve will dwindle to just 30 million by the end of the month but some of empire s customers , who have absorbed steep increases every year for the last five years , said the newest proposal could finally drive them over the edge among these are lisa kristal burgman of manhattan , whose family of four now pays about 9 , 000 a year to empire and whose rates would increase under the proposal by about 3 , 000 a year , she said affects the sickest my daughter already pays more for health insurance than she does for rent , said ms kristal burgman s mother , karen kristal , who spoke on her behalf at the hearing her husband makes 550 a week after taxes how are they supposed to pay for an increase \? the company is asking for an average increase of 255 percent for all its smallgroup and individual subscribers , with different increases for different policies for a family with empire s wraparound plus plan that now pays 7 , 22880 a year , for instance , the company is requesting an increase of 1 , 63140 , making the proposed cost 8 , 86020 a year yesterday s was the second of three public hearings on the rate request the state insurance superintendent , salvatore r curiale , is to rule on the application before the new year , and he has the choice of granting all , some or none of it he has not yet said what he plans to do , although gov mario m cuomo said earlier this week that we do n't expect the rate increase that they 're asking for to occur the increase would affect some of empire s sickest subscribers in the new york , midhudson valley and albany areas , many of whom buy insurance from empire because other insurance companies refuse to insure highrisk applicants many of these subscribers have extremely high medical bills and have contributed to the current fiscal problems of empire , a nonprofit company that has traditionally insured people whom no one else would accept subscribers lost in 1992 , said empire s chairman , albert a cardone , the company has lost 2688 million in its individual and smallgroup plans , mostly because the state s commercial insurance companies empire s competitors woo away younger , healthier subscribers with promises of lower rates , leaving the older , sicker ones for empire legislation passed by the state legislature last summer and signed by the governor this fall would help remedy that situation by requiring commercial insurance companies to accept everyone who applies , regardless of medical condition , and forbidding them to set rates based on factors like age , sex and prior health condition but the legislation does not take effect until april 1 , 1993 , and mr cardone said that empire s condition is deteriorating rapidly although no one doubts that empire is in trouble , the company is receiving little sympathy from either its subscribers or state legislators , many of whom were persuaded to support last spring s legislation only because of empire s tacit promise that if the bill passed , the company would no longer need enormous rate increases this company s duplicitous actions will not help the tens of thousands of empire subscribers facing increases , said peter newell , an aide to assemblyman alexander b grannis , a manhattan democrat who is chairman of the assembly insurance committee robert fasano of the national transplant support network , which represents people with organ transplants , said the increase would be devastating for members of his group we ca n't bear the burden you would impose on us by approving this rate increase , he said at the hearing photo representatives of small businesses , the sick and the elderly protested yesterday against rate increases by empire blue cross and blue shield they were outside a hearing at new york university medical center \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
nanuet , ny , nov 24 spurred by the state senate s concern about welfare fraud , two counties , rockland and onondaga , have begun fingerprinting some welfare applicants and recipients the only other county in the nation to employ fingerprinting is los angeles county , where enthusiastic officials say 54 million was saved in the first six months after the program began in june 1991 they say the savings resulted after 297 welfare recipients were caught , through their fingerprints , trying to apply for duplicate benefits , and after 3 , 010 applicants refused to be fingerprinted and were dropped from the welfare system the los angeles experience served as a model for state senate republicans , who pushed for the experimental program in budget negotiations last spring but some advocates for the poor in rockland and in onondaga , echoing the sentiments of critics in california , argue that fingerprinting makes the already humiliating process of applying for welfare even more unpleasant , putting the needy through a process that many people associate with criminals it is dehumanizing , demeaning and will most certainly discourage people from applying , said pat feeley , cochairwoman of the rockland county coalition for the homeless , especially those who have never dealt with the system and now desperately need those services ms feeley joined a handful of other advocates for the poor at a news conference here today , at which they condemned the program in a statement signed by three dozen social workers , religious leaders and county residents a similar statement was released at a news conference in syracuse in onondaga county the program applies only to new applicants in the two counties seeking to enroll in home relief , a state program that provides assistance to single adults and childless couples by the new year , the department of social services will begin fingerprinting all home relief recipients in the two counties 4 , 000 people in onondaga and 620 in rockland there are almost 379 , 000 people on home relief statewide and 11 million people on other public assistance programs the 150 , 000 fingerprinting program has only been mandated by the legislature through march 31 , the end of the fiscal year state senate republicans had hoped to begin a fingerprinting project statewide , particularly in new york city , last spring as part of a crackdown on welfare recipients who use multiple identities to bilk the system although the cost of such fraud has not been determined , the new york city department of investigation issued criminal warrants last year for the arrests of more than 100 people using false documents to collect welfare , at a cost to the system of 45 million over five years , city officials said the assembly democrats , many of whom represent new york city , where twothirds of the state s welfare recipients live , balked at the idea of statewide fingerprinting , with some assemblymen saying it equated welfare recipients with criminals a compromise reached during the budget negotiations last april limited the program to the two counties casting aside messy pads of ink in favor of technology , the demonstration program uses a computer and scanner to read a person s fingerprints , translate them into a mathematical formula and compare them with other prints in a data bank of welfare recipients the legislature has barred welfare officials from sharing the prints with the criminal justice system , but critics say they fear breaches in confidentiality one of the chief architects of the experiment , state senator joseph r holland , a republican from new city in rockland , said he had little patience for the arguments of those who contend fingerprinting will scare off innocent people who need help it should not be a problem for any honest , upstanding citizens , said senator holland , the chairman of the senate social services committee only the bad guys will worry about it anybody who goes into the military , anyone who becomes an attorney , lots of people have to have their fingerprints taken , he added if senator holland and critics of the program agree on one issue , it is that the program is not likely to catch many welfare cheats in rockland and onondaga counties the problem is most common , the senator said , in cities , where people might register in several welfare offices , using different forms of identification rockland and onondaga have one welfare office each the small data bank of fingerprints will only include applicants from those two counties nevertheless , senator holland argues that the experimental project will demonstrate how functional the computer equipment is and whether such a program would be feasible on a larger scale hopefully we 'll be able to convince both houses that it should be expanded , he said , adding that the program will be reviewed next march since the program began in syracuse on friday , 60 applicants for home relief in the two counties have been fingerprinted , officials said none were determined to be cheaters officials said they knew of only one person who had withdrawn his application when told of the fingerprinting requirement recently separated from her husband , michelle conklin , 31 years old , smoked a cigarette yesterday outside the rockland county welfare office in pomona as she waited for an appointment to ask to go back on welfare , for the first time in three and a half years , she said although she was unsure which welfare program applied to her , she said she would agree to be

faced with two choices , going on the dole or being a petty thief , the protagonist of tony kavanagh s down the flats decides the second is the more remunerative and even the more selfrespecting option pc s , professional criminals , that s our trade , this exconvict says with pride to his street crony there is , of course , a third possibility , to leave dublin and emigrate to the united states , a course eventually taken by the playwright the substance of down the flats \( at the irish arts center \) has been frequently encountered in theater and in life mr kavanagh s distinction , like that of miguel pinero , is that he himself exchanged a career in crime for one as a playwright , and in his first play seems to have a natural affinity for the theater and an instinct for writing dialogue although the play takes place entirely within the confines of a single room in a threadbare family flat , it exudes authenticity and a feeling of a city outside its walls , a dublin where endurance depends on desensitizing oneself to reality the father of the family is a meanspirited street sweeper who keeps taking the pledge to give up drinking , and breaking it by nightfall his forlorn wife is quietly acquiescent to the family s collapse , and their two adult offspring are defeated by the lack of opportunity and the decay that surrounds them like a dense cloud in outline , the characters may seem as dreary as their environment , but mr kavanagh communicates their earthy humor call it bleak comedy , as in the son s tale of how he and his friend robbed an undertaker s parlor or the father s casual statement that he always had time to admire a man who escapes from jail for all its atmosphere , down the flats is clearly an apprentice effort the playwright has problems shaping his plot and is arbitrary in how he ends both the first and second acts this is scarcely more than an extended slice of life but mr kavanagh has promise , and nye heron has given the play a solid , roughhewn production the actors , many of them former dubliners , clearly know the territory , the talk , the brogue and even the slouch that comes from years of being beaten down none of them plead for our empathy , but most of them earn it there are evocative performances by chris o'neill and caroline winterson as the parents marian quinn as the young daughter already past her prime , and jim smallhorne as the daughter s druggy boyfriend who says everything about his character simply through his woefully shabby appearance donal j sheehan is the sturdy center of the play as the son and surrogate of the playwright there is hardly a glimmer of irish poetry in this character , but there are signs of a growing selfknowledge that offer hope for the son on his road away from dublin and for the playwright himself in his newly acquired profession down the flats by tony kavanagh directed by nye heron produced by marianne delaney music written by john doyle music performed by the chanting house susan mckeown and john doyle with jimmy daley set by david raphel costumes by carla gant lighting by jonathan sprouse stage manager , freda grealy presented by the irish arts center , 553 west 51st street henry donald creedon fran donal j sheehan mother caroline winterson may carmel o'brien father chris o'neill bridie marian quinn margaret susan mckeown paul jim smallhorne
baseball has shown uncommon statesmanship in permitting a japanese millionaire to invest a considerable amount of his money but apparently none of his expertise in the ailing seattle franchise the influx of 75 million from hiroshi yamauchi of the nintendo corporation will help keep the mariners in the pacific northwest , and without any foreign influence what a deal commissioner fay vincent and the owners are not in unanimity on all matters a few impetuous homegrown owners have apparently failed to move some of vincent s power over to richard ravitch , who was brought in to handle the owners' most important business , which is labor negotiations but vincent and all the owners seem to agree japanese money is ok but japanese presence is not ok this is the first time baseball has permitted ownership from outside north america , but the sport of turner and busch and autry will remain safe and strong and insular this venture is not going to be controlled outside north america , vincent reassured an anxious american public yesterday this venture is going to be controlled in seattle if yamauchi , president of nintendo co ltd of kyoto , was ever allowed to attend the inner councils of baseball , he would surely be polite and discreet if somebody asked his opinion , he just might point out that management and labor have a common stake in this lucrative field of sports and entertainment , and that there should be plenty of money to go around , if everybody works hard and cooperates and does n't treat the other side like a class enemy we hear this is how it works in large japanese industries cooperation , however , is a disturbing concept that owners and player associations \( except for the national basketball association \) do not want to hear , which is why the nba is going to be the first truly international professional sports league , during david stern s regime they are already playing league games in tokyo , and sending the big team to the summer games in barcelona , spain , and running a nifty tournament in europe every october stay tuned for the ultimate big league baseball is still in its isolationist stage , secure in its own world series the worstcase scenario for vincent would appear to be a franchise being moved to japan , but how bad would that be \? the most logical site for ailing franchises is the world s worst dome , located in a leveled section of st petersburg , fla a road trip to tokyo sounds better all the time in fact , the nintendo people probably could not move a north american franchise to japan because the japanese have their own league going and are not about to disrupt its health for one rogue owner but what is so harmful in a wealthy foreigner investing in a baseball team here \? baseball had to confront its phobia when jeff smulyan , the owner of the mariners , proposed selling 60 percent of the club to the nintendo group yamauchi s soninlaw , minoru arakawa , has lived in seattle for 15 years , and was to be a major executive in the new order , but vincent blocked the sale yesterday , vincent announced that john ellis , the chairman of puget sound power light , would become the mariners' chief executive officer running a monopoly utility is surely more closely akin to baseball s way of thinking than running a worldwide video corporation mr ellis has the total authority to run this business , vincent said , soothing our deepest fears by saying that yamauchi s role would be limited to the power to approve certain transactions in the realm of extraordinary events yamauchi s status is very much like that of another owner who may be neither seen nor heard this other owner is also of the absentee variety , by the name of steinbrenner , residing in tampa , fla , and owning the new york yankees , but still banned from running the team after being caught consorting with an admitted gambler two years ago some time soon , steinbrenner is expected to be reinstated by vincent , probably to take place at the start of next year , which means we should all experience a kinder and gentler yankee stadium while we still have the chance because he holds an american passport , george is ultimately safe and acceptable , even though he has his own bizarre way of dealing with failure sometimes when the yankees lost a big game , he would insist that his general manager be confined to quarters for the evening if a trade went sour , he would blame his baseball people if a runner was thrown out at home , steinbrenner would hector his thirdbase coach in front of national television steinbrenner believed in making his employees fall on their swords , or his sword we need more owners like him photo hiroshi yamauchi \( associated press \)

until recently , people were asking joan baez , do you still sing \? at first i was furious , she says then i thought , 'well , how are they supposed to know \? ' one of the defining voices of the 1960 s , ms baez acknowledges that she had become musically frozen in time , devoting most of her energy to humanrights causes but when she signed with virgin records two years ago , she realized that a retread of the old baez would not do the resulting album , play me backwards , her 28th album and first majorlabel recording since 1979 , finds her in a biting , contemporary setting , accented by latin and africanflavored percussion and the twangy sound of the dobro , a steel slide guitar her pure , throbbing and once serenely detached voice now has a sting alongside new numbers by marychapin carpenter , janis ian and others , the album contains a set of ms baez s own songs , all shining with an autumnal wisdom in late october , she played the bitter end in manhattan as part of a twomonth world tour , focusing atypically on music , not politics standing in front of a young audience and flanked by a hippieish guitarist and bass player , the 51yearold singer described herself as den mother to romper room the gray in her dark crew cut may have suited a den mother , but not the skinny braid that trailed down her back and her patter was far from maternal she praised sinead o'connor she had the courage to screw up and ms baez also had a few laughs at her own expense i said in concert once , 'in my humble opinion ' and burst out laughing i 've never had a humble opinion in my life if you 're going to have one , why bother to be humble about it \? over lunch the next day , ms baez discussed the identity crisis that has plagued her since her emergence at the newport folk festival in 1959 you take this little pickle at age 17 1 2 who s given a mantle and an identity at a time when i still thought of myself as a dumb mexican from southern california , she says then here i was , the virgin mary pronounced the queen of the folk revival and the budding peace movement , she placed her soaring , untrained soprano at the service of one cause after another whenever anyone said , so and so s starving , so and so s in prison , ' i assumed it was my responsibility , she recalls many of those who loved her singing complained about its increasingly political nature , but few doubted her personal integrity joan s motives were always good , says the poet allen ginsberg , who has known ms baez since the early 60 s she sacrificed a lot of time , effort and money to do something useful with her fame and her beauty after the vietnam war and the dissolution of a brief marriage to david harris , who served a sentence for draft evasion , ms baez s values began to seem antiquated an early attempt to take the politics out of her music , in the 1975 album diamonds and rust , gave her career a temporary boost but thereafter , her album sales dwindled , and around 1978 she realized that her soprano was turning into a scratchy alto singing was something i 'd never had to think about , she says i just opened up my trap and music poured out but gravity takes over everything in 1979 she found a coach who helped her repair the damage by that time , however , she was perilously close to being a hasbeen for a long time all i got at my concerts were the people who had grown up with me , only now they were bringing their miserable children who did n't want to be there , she says i felt like rescuing them and running out in the lobby to play bingo or something ms baez spent most of the 80 s singing on behalf of causes like disarmament , the antiapartheid movement and the mistreatment of political prisoners in concerts , she recycled her signature tunes over and over about five years ago i started to realize that the concerts had become boring to me , she says i do n't know why they were n't boring to everybody else maybe they were after eight years without an american record contract , she signed with gold castle , a small folkoriented label , and recorded three albums that were poorly distributed and scarcely noticed when asked why virgin a label that records janet jackson and paula abdul would be interested in her , ms baez points to the success of folkish singersongwriters like suzanne vega and tracy chapman on other labels they 've carved out a way for the circle to come back round , she says i do n't think anybody can pretend that folk music is coming back , but there seems to be an appetite for music you have to listen to with a more careful ear jeff ayeroff , cochairman of virgin , says of her music , intelligent people of all ages will be attracted to joan baez the label spent months sending her contemporary rock songs , none of which she thought she could sing she agreed to try writing with her producers , the nashvillebased songwriters kenny greenberg and wally wilson , who she says helped break her out of the artsong mold into a more universal style i went into it kicking and screaming , but as soon as i saw we were getting somewhere i 'd go deal with my ego and get over it the new material ranges from i'm with you , a song of farewell dedicated to her 22yearold son gabriel , to the title number , which casts her as a teller of ominous truths marychapin carpenter s stones in the road , a cynical tale of fallen innocence , has become ms baez s debut video it makes me laugh , she says , because there s something so corny and ironic about making your first video at age 51 but ms baez has no illusions about regaining the old mantle most of her current dates are in clubs and small concert halls rather than the larger venues she once played my manager said , 'nothing s going to happen overnight or in three weeks' it s much better to be very conservative about our hopes and dreams right now in the meantime , the woman who once made every appearance a political forum is now airing her views more selectively at the bitter end , she even resisted any temptation to comment on the presidential election we 've done all the whining and badmouthing and accusing that could possibly be done , she says it would be very wise to just shut up for a little while unlike other singers who cling desperately to performing , ms baez looks forward to the day when she can devote her time to social activism , prose writing or just catching her breath at her home outside san francisco i think that in a few years , if somebody comes up and says , 'are you still singing \? ' i will happily say , 'not really' pretty soon i 'll be able to say that i 've given 40 years of my life to this now i need a break photo joan baez on her new album , play me backwards , she has broken out of her artsong mold into a more universal style \( edward keating the new york times \)
phenix city , ala , jan 29 thanks largely to the voting rights act of 1965 , alabama has 706 black elected officials , more than any other state in the nation but when two of them , russell county commissioners ed mack and nathaniel gosha , lost an appeal citing that law to the united states supreme court this week , it raised a vexing question can the law guarantee the right to govern in the same way it protects the right to vote \? the first blacks elected to the county board of commissioners here asserted that white commissioners had violated the voting rights act by changing administrative procedures in a way that took power away from them to control street repair budgets in their own districts a black official in etowah county , about 120 miles to the north , made similar accusations the supreme court ruled on monday that the changes had to do with governing , not with voting , and did not need clearance from the justice department struggle for power but beyond the legal issue is a more fundamental struggle for power and influence being played out across the south between blacks and whites , a contest that has little of the stark moral clarity of the dramatic civil rights battles of two decades ago for example , in russell county , the changes in the commissioners' duties were made years before the black commissioners were elected mr mack and mr gosha , who got together today at a front table at mr mack s l m barbecue restaurant here , say their being elected has not translated to effective power because the county engineer , who is white , now makes decisions once made by individual commissioners you have influence , but power \? none , said mr gosha \( pronounced goshay \) a lot of folks think you have power , but you really do n't have any you 're voted down on almost everything you try to do if it concerns black representation but white commissioners say that mr gosha and mr mack want the ability to dispense political favors more than justice and want to go back to an ineffective patronage system that has long been criticized by advocates of more honest and effective government it s called porkbarreling , is what it s called , said billy belk , chairman of the russell county board of commissioners and that s exactly what they want is porkbarrel money they do n't want it called that , of course politics of past and present county government in largely rural russell county , which has its old brick courthouse here just across the chattahoochee river from fort benning and columbus , ga , is much like that in the rest of alabama caught somewhere between the allwhite , goodoldboy politics of the past and increasing black demands of the present blacks account for about 18 , 000 of the county s 47 , 000 residents in the mid1980 s , the commission was one of about 200 local bodies in alabama ordered by the courts to go from electing members at large a system that often resulted in allwhite boards to members elected from districts , a system that meant increased black representation in 1986 mr gosha and mr mack became the first black county commissioners , sitting alongside five whites , four of whom had been on the board for more than 16 years but they say they soon found that white commissioners largely ignored requests for recreation buildings , bus service or road repairs in their districts system changed in 1979 mr mack particularly wanted to pave some of the unpaved red clay roads that wind through his district about half the 600 miles of road in the county is unpaved in 1979 the county changed its system from one where each commissioner was in charge of a proportion of the county s roads to a unit system , in which a county engineer assessed needs and resources throughout the county the system is favored by many civic experts as more cost effective and less political than the old district system but the black commissioners say that the county officials had another motive for adopting the unit system they knew it was just a matter of time before the commission would be racially integrated in fact , they say , the old rules still informally apply , with the white commissioners and county engineer pretty much setting priorities as they have in the past and the road crews and garages still located in the white commissioners' districts they also say they are skeptical of what they call the county s sudden devotion to more efficient government it s amazing how black folks are such an impetus to good government , said edward still , a lawyer for the black commissioners more than the paving of roads is at issue the black commissioners say they have been unsuccessful in other efforts to establish county bus service or obtain recreational buildings the white commissioners say the proposals , like bus service in a largely rural county , are beyond the financial resources of the county both sides agree that what is really at stake is political clout , the ability to horse trade and bring something home to the voters white commissioners say that the decisions now are made fairly and that taxpayers would be the real losers if specific resources were allocated for each district we 've got the best system and the only system that we can afford , commissioner claude parkman said but the blacks and their lawyers say the whites have come around to accept blacks' right to vote but not their right to govern in alabama , it s no longer possible to deny blacks the vote or the opportunity to get elected , said jim blackshear , another lawyer for the black plaintiffs it s when blacks start handling our money that we start circling the wagons the legal case is not dead in its ruling , the supreme court said only that the county did not need to obtain justice department approval for changes in the commission s operating procedures under the voting rights act the plaintiffs now plan to file suit in federal court , contending that the changes illegally diminish their authority to govern in violation of the 14th amendment , the civil rights act of 1964 and a different section of the voting rights act the supreme court s decision was cheered by officials here and in other southern states who have chafed under the provisions of the voting rights act that require justice department intervention i'm very pleased with the outcome of it because it would have brought county government in the state of alabama to its knees , mr belk said mr blackshear saw the 6to3 ruling , with justice clarence thomas concurring , entirely differently it s a clear and undeniable signal the courts are no longer where the leading edge of justice is going to occur , he said for thomas , in particular , it was an absolute betrayal of the black community that pulled his fortunes out of the fire in fact , like a lot of things in the south , the case has been a striking reminder of remarkable change among rocksolid constancy there is a vivid glimpse of how far alabama has progressed when mr mack , who grew up in the days of segregation , checks in as a county commissioner to oversee a local county utility office there is an equally vivid glimpse of what has not changed when a young white man outside mr mack s restaurant breezily dismisses the controversy white people run this county , and that s the way it is , said the young man , who refused to give his name photo the first blacks elected to the russell county board of commissioners in alabama , nathaniel gosha , left , and ed mack , say their being elected has not translated

to janet roberts , the tiny age cracks that mar her collection of chinese export porcelain are no more disturbing than laugh lines on the face of an old friend a lot of people would scoff at what i have , says roberts , a semiretired theatrical and literary agent whose small manhattan apartment is crammed with antiques but to me , it s all so gallant i feel that if these pieces have lasted 200 years , they deserve to be loved purists might also look askance at the iconoclastic habits of ivan and marilynn karp , who collect everything from washboards and mechanical toys to such bizarre items as naughty nellies \( 19thcentury bootjacks in the form of scantily clad women \) and prohibitionera flasks in the shape of dancing couples we were never drawn to things with an official , effete aura , says ivan c karp , who owns the ok harris gallery in soho and whose wife recently established the master s degree program in art dealership and collecting at new york university nor are we concerned with the traditions of elegance we like a kind of toughness and vitality he picks up a 19thcentury slipware dish on which most of the slip \( the clay mixture used for decoration \) has come off , and compares it with one that is intact this dish only cost about 16 , he says of the worn one , but it has a great deal more sculptural character for people like roberts and the karps , collecting is a deeply personal adventure , a quest where passion matters more than provenance and while an object s rarity or condition may still play a role in what they choose , they buy first because of their love for the piece and the meaning it carries even if what they own appreciates to a staggering level , their typical refrain is , but that is n't why i bought it like itinerant actors who can perform shakespeare on a bare stage , these men and women believe that the message is far more important than the vehicle invariably , that message is a personal statement , which , for the most fortunate collectors , may someday have meaning for the wider world as well consider , for example , herbert vogel , a retired new york city postal clerk , and his wife , dorothy , a retired librarian , who 30 years ago began collecting minimalist and conceptual works by then littleknown artists like sol lewitt and robert mangold aspiring artists themselves , they bought the inexpensive pieces only because they liked them after a few years , we realized we were better at collecting than painting , says dorothy vogel so accomplished were they at this secondary vocation that they recently made headlines for pledging their 2 , 500 or so works to the national gallery of art nevertheless , the vogels do n't seem disingenuous when they claim they do not recall how much they paid for the pieces and that they are unaware of their current worth \( just five years ago , a robert mangold painting went at auction for 80 , 000 \) to them , the collection remains a form of selfexpression , one they 're now willing to share we feel that it s our work of art , says dorothy vogel one reason we gave it to the national gallery is because it does n't deaccession , so the collection will always be ours it s like our legacy to the country another legacy from the vogels and others like them is the wisdom that making a statement does not first require making a fortune intriguing work by young , unknown artists will always be affordable worn but distinctive slipware is less expensive than a topquality piece cracked porcelain has a history even when it lacks pricey perfection in fact , steven m brier , a new york financier and a founder of artamerica , a company that leases artwork to corporations , believes that if a collector wishes to make a truly original statement , a lack of wealth and status is more a help than a hindrance in a culture like ours , it s very hard to see with your own eyes , he says if you 're in the mainstream , the media and social pressures to collect a certain way are enormous if you 're an outsider , then you can collect personally brier himself is a collector of objects that relate intimately to his own concerns at first glance , the manhattan apartment he shares with his wife , carol , appears filled with antiquities and asian art but a closer look reveals that the king midas head on a pedestal is actually plastered with dollar bills , and the dragon painting over the fireplace is a collage of shells , beads and chinese currency barton lidice benes , the contemporary artist who created the works , was dealing with a lot of the same issues i was , says brier he makes icons that deal with the meaning of money on a lot of different levels , and the ironies and psychological projections that go with it some of brier s other pieces evoke a painful period in his past a neurological problem left him unable to speak for a few years , and when he first began collecting , he could see only in black and white he found himself inexorably drawn to photographs bill brandt was my favorite photographer , he says his work has never appreciated enormously , but that had nothing to do with my response to him because of the work s high contrast , it was immediate to me , in a special way
belgrade , yugoslavia , aug 26 three months after the united nations imposed sanctions on yugoslavia , the country s economy has begun to collapse in a way that many believe can lead to political confrontation before the end of the year most large factories are closed , hundreds of thousands of workers are receiving reduced wages or none at all , inflation is surging , and shortages are spreading it s working about as well as any embargo can be expected to work , said a diplomat who closely watches the yugoslav economy but despite signs that the shock of sanctions is turning into the pain of economic decline , it is not clear that this will force a change in the policies of the serbiandominated belgrade government in time to save neighboring bosnia and herzegovina , which is beleaguered by serbian forces huge garment factory idled the impact of sanctions is unmistakable at large businesses like kluz , a textile concern on the edge of belgrade its workers had turned out hundreds of men s suits each week , to be sold with labels like hugo boss and yves st laurent in germany , belgium and italy now the doors are locked , lights are off , and dust is gathering i do n't like the embargo because it s affecting my people , who are poor , said dragoslav kojic , the company s senior manager we 're talking about 6 , 000 women , about half of them without husbands , who are raising more than 11 , 000 kids their lives have become very difficult , and i hate to think what might happen if this keeps on much longer but although mr kojic resents the sanctions , he acknowledged that they were turning some serbs against their hardline leaders , just as united nations planners had hoped if the aim is to cause social unrest by hurting civilians , then the aim is being achieved , he said when the weather gets cold , people here are going to start getting angry the sanctions , which were imposed on may 30 by the united nations security council , forbid almost all trade with yugoslavia they also require other nations to exclude yugoslav athletes from sports events , suspend exchange programs , and reduce their diplomatic missions in belgrade in addition , foreign airlines are forbidden to land in belgrade , and yugoslav planes are banned abroad taken together , these sanctions have isolated yugoslavia a harsh blow to a nation that has been closely tied to europe the government of serbia , the more powerful of the two republics that remain in a new yugoslav federation , is the main target of the sanctions foreign leaders hold serbia principally responsible for the war in bosnia and herzegovina , and hope that the sanctions will cause enough pain to force the hardline nationalist serbian president , slobodan milosevic , to change his policies , or perhaps even fall mr milosevic , whose power has been sufficient to thwart the compromises espoused by his prime minister , milan panic , has called on yugoslavs to adopt a survival strategy by finding ways to live at reduced levels until world pressure against them ends but some influential political and business leaders have rejected that approach and are backing mr panic s demand that belgrade do whatever is necessary to have the sanctions lifted the weapon of patriotism i am against the survival strategy , said slobodan anjic , president of the yugoslav export system , a former state conglomerate whose dozens of companies make everything from film to furniture to food products that s for the jungle we are part of europe , part of the world we do n't just want to survive we want to live and prosper like many other yugoslavs , mr anjic expects organized protests in belgrade later this year if policies do not change but he is not sure which political direction such protests would take the government is skillful in manipulating nationalist sentiment , he said , and may present this as a situation where anyone who opposes them is unpatriotic if there is too much polarization , we could have a civil war here in serbia to a visitor , evidence of the embargo s effectiveness comes in the lack of traffic on belgrade s normally choked streets owners of private cars are restricted to gasoline rations of only 35 gallons a month most grocery stores and markets are still wellstocked , reflecting yugoslavia s status as a major food producer but costs are steeply climbing , and it is not uncommon for the price of an essential item like bread to double in a few days even overnight this creates opportunities for profit , and smugglers are taking advantage of them , quietly moving a stream of goods in and out of the country each day , barges carrying oil , steel , coal and other products steam along the danube toward yugoslavia according to romanian officials , many of these barges are privately owned and based in russia and ukraine they carry bills of lading saying that their cargo is destined for macedonia , but the volume is greater than the republic could absorb oil is also reportedly entering yugoslavia in greek tanker trucks by way of macedonia the smuggling is not on a large enough scale to significantly spur the economy of a modern , exportoriented country like yugoslavia
throughout new york state yesterday , pharmacists locked their doors and traveled to albany to protest changes in medicaid reimbursement that they said could force them to close their doors permanently many other pharmacists who remained open refused to fill medicaid prescriptions at a time when curbing medicaid costs has become a priority across the country , yesterday s protests were meant to remind legislators that numbers on a ledger sheet represent income to independent pharmacists , who dispense medication to poor patients there was no official count of how many of the state s 4 , 000 pharmacies were closed as part of the oneday protest , but trade association officials contended that 850 pharmacists spent the day in the state capital rather than behind the counter , an estimate that several state officials said they believed was somewhat high whatever the number , in some of new york city s poor neighborhoods , where pharmacists depend heavily on medicaid , it was difficult to get a prescription filled in corona , queens , a woman running low on heart medicine searched all day for a pharmacist who would accept medicaid along 125th street in manhattan , from the west side highway exit to broadway , about a halfdozen pharmacies were closed a sign attached to the metal security gate at the better buy pharmacy near lenox avenue said , we must get paid fairly or we ca n't provide our services to you in the bronx , a random spot check of a dozen pharmacies found that eight were refusing to fill medicaid prescriptions and one was closed for the day of a dozen pharmacies in queens , nine were not filling medicaid prescriptions , but none had closed the pharmacists are protesting several simultaneous changes in medicaid reimbursement rules , which they say will cause them to lose money or barely make a profit on prescriptions state officials say the changes are necessary to comply with federal regulations , which set the price of medicaid reimbursements , and with the budget agreement passed by the legislature earlier this month , which trimmed medicaid payments by 11 billion in addition , federal and state surveys have suggested that some pharmacies , by buying drugs at sharp discounts from manufacturers , make big profits on medicaid prescriptions complaints by pharmacists that the new regulations will bankrupt them exaggerate the situation , said michael falzano , who heads the pharmacy reimbursement section of the state department of social services they are business people and they see their profit margins going down , he said but jerome sager , general counsel and executive director of the 1 , 100member empire state pharmaceutical society disagreed there s been no increase in reimbursement for pharmacies under medicaid in 14 years , he said now they say we have to take a substantial cut it s crazy the chain stores can absorb it , but the independents ca n't and there are no chain stores in the poorest areas that take the most medicaid antitrust implications other pharmacy trade groups have condemned the protest , saying any organized boycott violates the state s antitrust laws state officials said yesterday that attorney general robert abrams is investigating whether today s actions are in violation of those laws because the pharmacists are forbidden to take part in organized efforts to refuse to provide medication medicaid reimbursement is a complex system based on the average wholesale price of a drug a pharmacy purchases drugs from a wholesaler at a discount of 8 to 12 percent off the average wholesale price larger pharmacies and chains receive bigger discounts for the past 14 years , new york reimbursed pharmacists for the average wholesale price of a medicaid prescription , meaning the pharmacist s profit was the amount of the discount in addition , the state paid a dispensing fee to pharmacists for each prescription , which has been 260 for the past 14 years under the system approved as part of the budget package on april 1 , the state would reimburse pharmacists at a rate of 8 percent less than the average wholesale price , which would sharply decrease , if not eliminate , the profit to pharmacists at the same time , the dispensing fee would increase twice over the coming months , reaching 360 next january withdraw from medicaid those provisions represent a softening of the state s previous position the earlier measure , which was to have taken effect in february , would have set the reimbursement rate at 10 percent less than the average wholesale price with a dispensing fee of 260 , which would be in keeping with a federal district court order that allowed such a reduction when pharmacists threatened to withdraw from medicaid immediately and permanently , gov mario m cuomo ordered a freeze on the cuts by april , the 8 percent cut and increase in the dispensing fee had become part of the budget agreement i feel the state has been more than reasonable particularly given the fiscal climate , mr falzano said pharmacists do not think so the 8 percent cut , they say , is not offset by the increase in the dispensing fee john p navarra , the owner of three pharmacies in manhattan around morningside heights , where 60 percent of the customers are on medicaid , gave the example of the drug epogen , which is widely used to fight anemia in aids patients the average wholesale price of a twoweek supply , he said is 360 he pays 320 and under the old rules was reimbursed 36260 by the state under the new rules , however , he would be reimbursed 33360 , including the dispensing fee , meaning he would make a profit of about 14 , or 4 percent most of the pharmacies where customers were turned away today were in new york city , mr sager said , an impression confirmed by spot checks elsewhere in the state those pharmacists who were not filling medicaid prescriptions said it was a difficult thing to do krishna polavarapu , for instance , had turned away a halfdozen customers at v p pharmacy in corona , queens , by 2 pm yesterday
jerusalem , may 12 the sturdy young canadian thought he was samson , and went on to prove it by smashing through a wall to escape the other week from kfar shaul , the government psychiatric hospital on jerusalem s western reaches he was our first samson , dr yair barel , the hospital director , said as an aside before continuing to tell how the young man had got as far as the nearest bus stop when a nurse caught up with him samson , you must come back to the hospital , she called out mollified by being addressed by what he considered his true name , the patient docilely returned , one more visitor who had succumbed to a form of disorientation that psychiatrists here label the jerusalem syndrome across the length of israel , hotel keepers and restaurant owners are delighted that tourists are turning up in nearrecord numbers as persian gulf war memories fade and the palestinian uprising no longer scares away as many people as it once did but for dr barel and his kfar shaul staff , the boom is no blessing if it continues , they say , they can count on having to treat a bumper crop of messiahs , john the baptists and king davids wandering the narrow lanes of the old city and proclaiming that the end , or perhaps the beginning , is near echoes of history every year , dozens of foreign tourists overwhelmed by the religious and historic weight of this ancient city are driven mad for many it is a short trip they arrive with a bagful of mental troubles , including in some cases a conviction that they are biblical characters or that they alone hold the key to world peace and must reveal it at jerusalem s walls but also each year , dr barel says , there are travelers with no recorded psychiatric histories who find themselves suddenly in the grips of delusion , often within days of arrival samsons may be rare , but there has been no shortage of other biblical figures , including god and satan the virgin mary crossed my path in july two years ago , said the very rev john peterson , dean of st george s college in east jerusalem she was an elderly american woman studying at the college who really snapped , he said she went to bethlehem to look for the baby jesus and invited everyone to go to his birthday party generally , according to dr barel , jerusalem syndrome victims stick to their own kind christians tend to identify themselves as jesus or the virgin or , most commonly , john the baptist , often breaking down at places associated with jesus like via dolorosa and the garden tomb jews lean toward moses , king david and other old testament figures , and come apart on the mount of olives or at the western wall \( muslim tourists from overseas are so few that they are not statistically significant to students of the malady \) the syndrome has come under new scrutiny after an englishspeaking tourist ran amok this month in the church of the holy sepulcher , built on what many christians believe to be the site of jesus' tomb as a female companion looked on silently , he shattered lamps , yanked down a wooden cross and tried to smash a statue of the madonna while shouting , according to witnesses suffer the little children do not worship idols both the man and woman were taken to kfar shaul , where they have since uttered few words , dr barel said but they apparently are american christians , he said , adding that an attack of jerusalem syndrome must be considered a possibility those looking for prophet motive admit to being stumped about what specifically rockets some visitors into delusionary flight all that is clear , experts say , is that the center does not hold for these people they come as pilgrims , said dr eliezer witztum , a jerusalem psychiatrist who has studied the syndrome jerusalem for them is a core of absolute reality they feel they will change and that something will happen to them some simply cannot handle the situation , and become manic a western diplomat who has dealt with troubled compatriots says some come to the holy city expecting to find a city of peace , where they can put aside their troubles , and they find that it is filled with tension that s when there s the disconnect , he said another jerusalem psychiatrist , dr jordan m scher , has seen young jews from overseas who are directed here by families convinced that an infusion of religion will focus them instead , many end up wandering the streets , visiting reality only as tourists problems in other places jerusalem is hardly the only place where travelers become disturbed the problem is familiar to the miracle town of lourdes and the artrich center of florence , where visitors have fallen apart in the presence of provocative paintings a phenomenon dubbed the stendhal syndrome , after the french writer who succumbed to it on a journey to the city in 1817 but for sheer religious power , jerusalem is unrivaled kfar shaul has received disoriented travelers regularly since 1979 , with numbers ranging from 50 to 200 a year , depending on the tourist flow not that the problem is only 13 years old city lore is filled with tales like that of the english woman in the 1930 s who went daily to mount scopus to welcome the lord s return with a nice cup of tea in a study published last year , dr witztum examined 177 kfar shaul patients , 89 of whom filled out questionnaires a number that was not higher , he said , because messiahs are not the types to stick around filling out forms he found that syndrome victims were in the main unmarried , in their 20 s and 30 s , from north america and western europe and reared in religious homes , whether jewish or christian men outnumbered women by nearly 2 to 1 , and those with psychiatric histories outnumbered those without by 4 to 1 dr scher strongly dissents , saying no victim arrives here normal and none leave normal either but dr barel insists that most snap out of it after a few days and are then sent home later , he says , they do not remember it as a terrible or painful experience , although he acknowledges that serious followup studies are rare over the years , says dr barel \( whose name means son of god in hebrew \) , he has found little point in aggressively trying to persuade deluded souls that they are not who they think they are a few years ago , kfar shaul had at the same time two patients convinced that they were the messiah he put them together , the hospital director recalls , but it did n't work out they spoke , and they discussed , he said and finally , each decided that the other was an imposter

following is a transcript of the presidential debate at michigan state university in east lansing last night between president bush , gov bill clinton and ross perot , as recorded by the new york times credibility and believability q gentlemen , again , welcome and again good evening it seems from what those voters said at your richmond debate and from polling and other data that each of you fairly or not faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next four years governor clinton , in accordance with the draw , those concerns about you are first you are promising to create jobs , reduce the deficit , reform the health care system , rebuild the infrastructure , guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified among many other things all with financial pain only for the very rich some people are having trouble , apparently , believing that is possible should they have that concern \? clinton no there are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more but the truth is that middleclass americans are basically the only group of americans who have been taxed more in the 1980 s and during the last 12 years even though their incomes have gone down the wealthiest americans have been taxed much less even though their incomes have gone up middleclass people will have their fair share of changing to do and many challenges to face , including the challenge of becoming constantly reeducated but my plan is a departure from trickledown economics , just cutting taxes on the wealthiest americans and getting out of the way it s also a departure from taxandspend economics because you ca n't tax and divide an economy that is n't growing i propose an american version of what works in other countries i think we can do it better , invest and grow i believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time if we not only ask the wealthiest americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share we also provide over 100 billion in tax relief in terms of incentives for new plants , new small businesses , new technologies , new housing and for middleclass families and we have 140 billion of spending cuts , invest and grow raise some more money , spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector , take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental cleanup systems this will work on this , as on so many other issues , i have a fundamental difference from the present administration i do n't believe trickledown economics will work unemployment is up most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago i think we can do better if we have the courage to change q mr president , a response specifically bush there s one minute now , just the ground rules here q well , yes , roughly one minute we can loosen that up a little bit , but go ahead bush he does n't like trickledown government , but i think he s talking about the reaganbush years where we created 15 million jobs the rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden and what i do n't like is trickledown government and therein i think governor clinton keeps talking about trickle down , trickle down , and he s still talking about spending more and taxing more government , he says , invest government , grow government government does n't create jobs if they do , they 're makework jobs it s the private sector that creates jobs and , yes , we 've got too many taxes on the american people and we 're spending too much and that s why i want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending it wo n't be painless i think mr perot put his finger on something there it wo n't be painless , but we 've got to get the job done but not by raising taxes mr and mrs america , when you hear him say 'we 're going to tax only the rich , ' watch your wallet because his figures do n't add up and he s going to sock it right to the middleclass taxpayer and lower , if he s going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes so we have a big difference on this trickledown theory i do not want any more trickledown government it s gotten too big i want to do something about that q mr perot , what do you think of the governor s approach , what he just laid out \? perot the basic problem with it , it does n't balance the budget if you forecast it out we 'll still have a significant deficit under each of their plans as i understand them our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding if you take a patient into the hospital that s bleeding arterially , step one is to stop the bleeding and we are bleeding arterially there s only one way out of this and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base , to have a growing , expanding job base to give us the tax base see , balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the 4 trillion debt and leaving our children the american dream intact we have spent their money , we 've got to pay it back this is going to take fair , shared sacrifice my plan balances the budget within six years we did n't do it faster than that because we did n't want to disrupt the economy we gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover
leslie s illustrated civil war introduction by john e stanchak illustrated 256 pp jackson university press of mississippi 50 in wartime , people back home have an insatiable appetite for news from the front we need only recall the hours spent glued to our television sets during the persian gulf war the eagerness for news was perhaps more intense during the civil war than at any other time in american history almost every family in the north or south had relatives in uniform during a conflict that mobilized a larger portion of the population for combat duty and resulted in more american deaths than any other war this country has fought with the survival of the union and confederacy as well as the lives of their menfolk at stake , people crowded around telegraph offices or snapped up newspaper extras to glean information about military campaigns and battles they were also hungry for images of war photography was two decades old by the 1860 s , and some of our most unforgettable images of death and destruction from that most destructive of wars come down to us in the photographs of alexander gardner , timothy o sullivan , mathew brady and others but the time exposure necessary for photography made action pictures impossible , and the technology for printing photographs in newspapers or magazines did not yet exist into this vacuum moved the illustrated weeklies , chiefly frank leslie s illustrated newspaper and harper s weekly they recruited an army of artists and illustrators who accompanied the troops into the field and made pencil drawings of soldiers in camp , on the march and in battle these drawings were rushed by mail or courier to new york , where engravers traced them onto wood blocks for printing in the next issue of leslie s or harper s from these illustrations millions of americans \( some copies were smuggled into the south \) gained their picture of war leslie s illustrated civil war is a new facsimile edition of a postwar publication of the best drawings from leslie s it presents to the modern reader some 300 of these graphic illustrations , with brief captions to explain the context of time , place and event frank leslie was born in england in 1821 as henry carter learning his craft as an engraver on the london illustrated news in the 1840 s , he signed his work with the nom de plume frank leslie he changed his name legally after immigrating to the united states and founding his own illustrated weekly in 1855 leslie got the jump on fletcher harper when war erupted in 1861 , having two artists in charleston who sent exclusive drawings of the firing on fort sumter thereafter a bidding war broke out between leslie s and harper s for the best artists and the highest circulation harper s pulled ahead in 1863 after luring william waud from leslie s to join his brother , alfred , on the harper s staff in his introduction to this facsimile reprinting , john e stanchak , a historian who edits civil war times illustrated , a sort of modern descendant of leslie s , tells the story of leslie s illustrators and their sometimes perilous experiences two were captured , one wounded , and one \( a soldier who was a parttime artist \) was killed in his analysis of the leslie sharper s rivalry , though , mr stanchak curiously neglects to mention one harper s illustrator who turned out to be the best of all winslow homer , whose wartime sketches of camp and field scenes in the army of the potomac provided the basis for his first oil paintings as mr stanchak notes , another reason why leslie s began to lag behind harper s was ideological as northern war aims escalated from restoring the old union to abolishing slavery and building a new union of universal freedom by a war of massive force and destruction , leslie s fell out of phase with the policy it opposed both the draft and the emancipation proclamation frank leslie had little sympathy with slaves , whom he described as sensual , gluttonous , thievish and hopelessly lazy few illustrations of blacks appear here , and those that do are mostly caricatures by contrast , harper s was radical in editorial policy by 1863 its treatment of slavery , emancipation and black soldiers was more consonant with the increasing radicalism of northern opinion and union war aims the illustrations in both leslie s and harper s reflected the union perspective and because both weeklies were published in new york , they concentrated on the eastern theater of the war to the neglect of the west many of the drawings are idealized and artificial soldiers advance in ordered , serried drillfield ranks rather than in the confused and disorderly chaos of real combat not only are the smells and noise of the battlefield absent , but so also are some of the sights this was not always the fault of the artists editorial orders sometimes caused engravers to remove dead and putrefying bodies from their battlefield scenes the very images that give the gardner and o sullivan photographs such power and otherwise to clean up the scenery illustrators and editors alike seem to have preferred broad , panoramic battle scenes crowded with soldiers against a dramatic backdrop of mountains or rolling , open fields this causes some ludicrous flights of fancy , such as two drawings of the battle of the wilderness that portray a sweeping view of an almost treeless landscape instead of the thickly wooded terrain in which that engagement was fought so popular were these illustrations that both harper s and leslie s issued many compilations of them under various titles during the three decades after the war more recently , reprint houses have published facsimile copies of some of these editions all of these except one version of harper s pictorial history of the civil war have gone out of print , so this new edition of leslie s published by the university press of mississippi on highquality acidfree paper will be welcomed by civil war fans the book is a facsimile of an 1894 volume with the original title the soldier in our civil war this implies a theme , but , in fact , there is no thematic structure in the volume rather , it is characterized by a frustrating randomness the pictures are printed in no particular order , with no logical connection between one and the next least of all a chronological sequence illustrations leap haphazardly from 1863 to 1861 to 1865 , from virginia to south carolina to tennessee to maryland this contrasts with other facsimile reprints of harper s and leslie s , which contain a substantial narrative text that connects illustrations in chronological order , enabling the reader to follow the course of the war one wishes that mr stanchak had noted and , if possible , explained in his introduction this perplexing absence of sequence and structure he leaves the reader with another puzzle as well he discusses at considerable length the artist arthur lumley and particularly his aerial sketches made from the union observation balloon intrepid his drawings of the craft , aloft , being towed from below by a union navy vessel on virginia s james river , make him perhaps the first man ever to produce a picture of an aircraft carrier , he writes but none of lumley s pictures from the intrepid are reproduced in this volume indeed , not a single example of his work appears in it similarly , six paragraphs of the introduction discuss two famous drawings of generals philip sheridan and stephen ramseur by the artist james e taylor that are purportedly printed in this volume but they too are nowhere to be found this disjuncture between introduction and text , and the baffling randomness of the illustrations , make the volume less valuable than it might have been nevertheless , civil war aficionados and students of the history of popular media will find much to engage their interest photo recruiting in the new york city hall park in 1864 \(

boston , july 10 in the shadow of the procession of tall ships that moved on from new york to boston this week , the boat yard that produced some of america s first and fastest clipper ships stands abandoned today , its place in history all but forgotten donald mckay of the atlantic works shipyard was the most prominent builder of wooden ships in the 19th century yet city tours and harbor cruises will not stop at his old shipyard overlooking boston harbor now an overgrown , 45acre lot littered with rusted ship parts even as two million visitors gather along the waterfront this weekend to watch the parade of more than 200 ships but one new england sea captain is trying to change that capt charles quinlan wants to resurrect mckay s legacy by restoring the shipyard , establishing a maritime museum there and building the first american clipper ship to sail since 1920 it s a sad irony and a sad commentary that this port is being overlooked during the commemoration of christopher columbus s discovery of america , said mr quinlan , a licensed tall ship captain from portsmouth , nh , who makes his living as a marine surveyor and consultant the clipper ships , built by men like donald mckay , foretold the strength and energy of this nation when the yankee clippers were introduced by american builders in the 1840 s , replacing huskier , slower merchant ships , the rest of the world was stunned by the beauty of their finelined hulls , historians say prospectors eager to get to california during the gold rush were probably more appreciative of the clippers' speed mckay s flying cloud set a world record when it sailed from new york to san francisco in 89 days in 1854 replaced by the even faster and more dependable steamship toward midcentury , many clippers were raided and burned at sea during the civil war , and others disappeared in the treacherous waters off cape horn none of the 350 yankee clipper ships built can be found today the atlantic works shipyard converted to other types of boats as the wooden clippers fell out of favor but the business , taken over by other owners , experienced hard times and was closed 30 years ago today , the united states has no sailing ships longer than 170 feet , a type known as the class a tall ship a coast guard training bark that is representing the united states in the parade , the eagle , was built by germans at 236 feet , the new clipper , which captain quinlan calls the shining sea , would be the first class a ship to represent america in exhibitions and races captain quinlan faces two major hurdles he must raise 35 million to pay for the project , and he must strike a deal for the land , which he now rents from the city captain quinlan said city officials have told him that they would like to see him raise more money before they are willing to pledge the property to his project so far , he said , he has raised close to 1 million from corporations and individuals captain quinlan hopes to finish the project in 1994 , and he expects the clipper , a composite of four mckay clippers including the flying cloud , to attract at least 500 , 000 visitors , half the number who visit the uss constitution in nearby charlestown navy yard each year it is expected to bring at least 700 jobs to the area , and captain quinlan hopes to restore ferry service that once tied the yard to boston s historic district for their part , east boston residents hope the ship will bring recognition to a neighborhood that has been virtually taken over for a newer form of travel the city s airport occupies twothirds of east boston s land it would put east boston in historical perspective , said john ribeiro jr , a community organizer east boston is not on some maps it s only listed as logan airport it s time the nation and the world recognizes this area s rich maritime history
what do we know about presidentelect clinton s national security team \? what do these choices tell us about clinton policies and how they will be made \? the short answer is that the expected appointees warren christopher for secretary of state , les aspin for defense secretary and anthony lake for national security adviser are highly experienced problem solvers like almost all their predecessors when they took office , these three are untested at the highest levels they like president bush s newworldorder rhetoric about standing for american values , paying more attention to international economics and using force for humanitarian as well as strategic reasons but unlike mr bush , they take those words seriously and will try energetically to turn rhetoric into reality none of the trio seeks the limelight , and all will fit comfortably with mr clinton s plan to make policy in the white house contrary to comment , the trio bring to their posts as much highlevel government experience as most of their predecessors mr christopher has held the number two jobs in the justice and state departments mr aspin , a pentagon alumnus , has served in congress for two decades and for eight years as chairman of the house armed services committee mr lake started as a career foreign service officer , worked for henry kissinger and directed the state department s policy planning under president carter they know where the land mines are all three have their roots in the liberal wing of the democratic party but have evolved into pragmatists of different sorts mr christopher is a cautious liberal , mr aspin a conservative activist and mr lake an eclectic pushing toward the new world order he helped sketch in mr clinton s campaign speeches if they have a weakness as a group , it is their lack of precooked clout none brings commanding stature to his job or possesses a moviestar personality each will have to fight to prove he s tough and worthy also they have little expertise in foreign economic policy , the area mr clinton rightly made so much of during the campaign mr lake will turn to the muchrespected samuel berger , expected to be his deputy the others will turn to their deputies mr christopher was one of my bosses in carter s state department he is no less stiff and formal privately than publicly his jacket is always buttoned he listens impassively , nodding uhhuh , uhhuh , and says little ever the worldclass lawyer , he is exceedingly careful , tidy , disciplined , precise no mistakes when troubles came , mr carter and secretary of state vance usually turned to him chris , as he is called , is a brilliant political tactician and negotiator he helped to gain senate approval of the panama canal treaties and negotiated the release of the american hostages from iran mr christopher is not a policy maker and has no known policy agenda , though he himself wrote that the secretary of state must be the architect of us policy he thinks case by case but he can take any policy paper and find its flaws and make it viable mr aspin and i first worked together in the pentagon in the johnson administration he is disheveled , folksy , informal at the same time , he is often detached and abstract in the manner of a policy wonk or intellectual mr aspin is a defense intellectual that is his life no one has thought harder or better about the military power the us will need in the decade ahead and when to use it he would make do with somewhat fewer forces than the bush team , yet be more willing to use force in places like bosnia and would have used it sooner in somalia he strongly backed the persian gulf war \( mr lake supported the basic war policy also there is no record of mr christopher s position \) mr lake s office adjoined mine in the vance state department , and before and after that we cowrote articles and books tony is puckish and deeply committed to traditional liberal values , yet power oriented and a careful bureaucrat sometimes hawkish , sometimes dovish , he is as tough and aggressive as his smile is cherubic mr clinton will almost certainly turn to him and mr berger to shape an overall strategy for a world that seems to defy one but mr clinton , by far the strongest personality of the lot , will shape the trio more than they shape him
michael chang , careful to a fault , let himself be pushed to the limit last night by 12thseeded wayne ferreira of south africa , an incorrigible risktaker , in their lengthy united states open quarterfinal last night on the grandstand court this was a classic contest between tortoise and hare , and somehow , in the space of its 4hour 17minute duration , the hare walloped out 104 unforced errors to give the tortoise little alternative but to hold his breath and hang on for a 75 , 26 , 63 , 67 \( 47 \) , 61 victory to me , it s important not to go into the next match satisfied , said chang i have to keep my head down , keep working at it , and give myself a chance to win this tournament to be continued meanwhile , the defending champion , stefan edberg , made last night one to remember for all the wrong reasons when , on the brink of victory , he misplaced his killer instinct and watched his twosetstonone lead turn into a hairraising deadlock that was left unresolved because of latenight showers edberg pulverized ivan lendl in the first two sets of their quarterfinal and let him make it a fairer fight in the third then , after fumbling away four match points in the fourth set , edberg lost his serve and gave lendl a 65 lead that , after a 70minute rain stoppage , set up lendl to serve out the set but their venture into the fifthset zone ended after three games when more midnight mist wafted onto the stadium court the partial score when things were curtailed with lendl set to serve to even the final set at two games apiece two 63 sets for edberg , two more for lendl \( 63 and 75 \) sticking to his game plan that chang was battling an injured sprinter last night in ferreira , who began icing his injured left quadricep muscle in the fifth game of the fourth set , did n't make matters simpler although chang noticed that his frecklefaced opponent seemed to wince at the prospect of tackling overheads , he was loathe to try and tamper with his own game , which relied heavily on low and lethal passing shots , to exploit ferreira s discomfort i did n't want to change my game too much because he s a good player , and if he gets the right ball , whether injured or not , he can hit it , said chang i tried not to let the injury thing bother my performance a costly double fault chang discovered he was right to be wary of ferreira s explosive potential , regardless of his pain , in the fourthset tie breaker the south african put on a sound performance and improved his already impressive 1992 tiebreaker record to 1310 a service winner gave ferreira a 54 lead , and he reached set point after chang , overly aggressive at the wrong instant , blasted a downtheline backhand just wide of both ferreira and the sideline chang , whose second serve was pillaged with the greatest of relish by ferreira all night long , not only missed his first at set point , but doublefaulted to even the match at two sets apiece he held serve throughout that set and he played a good tie breaker he deserved to win that set , chang allowed this was the first open quarterfinal for both 20yearolds , but chang possessed double the experience in conjuring slam victories , not to mention a 124 record in fivesetters chang was a victim of fiveset losses at both the australian and french open this year , but he corrected that last night to move into his first open semifinal and first semifinal of any slam since his stunning climb to the 1989 french open championship as an unsung , baselinebound 17yearold keeping them honest now ranked a careerhigh fourth in the world on the strength of his earlyyear skein of three tournament titles and steady if modest success thereafter , chang considers himself ready to pose a threat here he actually outaced malivai washington by 40 in their fourthround match and later said his recently cultivated volley had begun to provide an added dimension unpredictability with which to rattle his opponents as i play the tougher guys , the guys who are always coming in , i have to be able to mix it up i have to be able to kind of keep them honest , said chang , whose whitesoftheeyes glare at crucial points has often been enough in itself to accomplish that chang handled ferreira , and the power he gleans from his widebody racquet , with increasing ease in the opening set , where he rebounded from a 53 deficit and won the last eight points in quick succession but the balance of power changed in the second set there ferreira , helped by a strong firstserve , firstvolley combination , began to put chang on his heels judging from the smile that began to cross his face , ferreira , whose best previous slam result came this year in the australian open s semifinals , realized that he had chang figured out but ferriera , with his gateswinging forehand blasts , did n't figure on pulling a muscle in his thigh , and when trouble hit , so did chang after being manhandled in the second set , chang struck back in the third and after experiencing the indignity of doublefaulting away a break and set point in the tie breaker , he roared back in the fifth match points john mcenroe and michael stich , who won at wimbledon two months ago in their second outing as doubles partners , were eliminated in the open semifinals yesterday by the same pair they defeated in the wimbledon final , which took two days and a 1917 fifth set to complete with their 36 , 75 , 76 \( 72 \) , 46 , 62 victory , jim grabb and richey reneberg advanced to the final against kelly jones and rick leach photo michael

meribel , france john ziegler , president national hockey league planet of the goons dear john just thought i 'd write to say hello again from the winter olympics , where hockey is played the way it s meant to be played apparently you never received the letter i wrote to you on this same subject from calgary four years ago but maybe i mailed it to the nhl office i'm told you 're mostly at the above address whenever i write to you , i always think of the leatherlunged ranger fans in the old madison square garden whenever your predecessor , clarence campbell , would attend a game there every so often those leather lungs a few rows away would growl , hey , clarence , you 're missing a great game so are you if you 've watched the olympic tournament , which now moves into the medal round with the united states opposing france , maybe you 've noticed the difference between international hockey in the olympics and what passes for hockey in the nhl in the olympics , hockey is played the way it oughta be skating , passing , shooting , checking and concentration if you watched the united states preserve first place in the a pool with a 33 tie with sweden last night after wasting a 30 lead , you saw mats naslund , once a lady byng trophy winner with the montreal canadiens , banished with a game misconduct for bloodying the face of american defenseman greg brown early in the first period in the nhl , what naslund did would have detonated a brawl , maybe a series of brawls , with gloves and sticks strewn over the ice but in the olympics , where goonism is not tolerated , it remained a hockey game i know you 're busy with the booming sales of san jose sharks sweatshirts , but you keep missing the reason why there are no brawls and no goons in olympic hockey it s that simple sentence in the international rules if you fight , you 're ejected as a result , a fight in the olympic hockey tournament here is as rare as a napa valley wine do n't worry , it s still a collision sport the sound of some of the body checks is louder than the rap music in the french discos but the players here know that if they get into a fight , they 're gone so they do n't fight as simple as that if the same rule were in the nhl , the players would n't fight either and there would be no need for all those goons who do n't know anything else i know you think the goons sell tickets , but i think you 'd find that without the goons , your teams might sell more tickets without the goons , you might even get a decent united states network television contract until the kremlin collapsed , it was unamerican and uncanadian to praise the soviet hockey players oops , i mean unified team players but to just about everybody here , they 're still the soviets or the russians just like to some people , the pro football los angeles raiders will always be the oakland raiders anyway , the soviets just play hockey skate swiftly , pass crisply , shoot accurately , check bodily hockey like it oughta be even when eric lindros , the 18yearold canadian center who does n't want to play for your quebec nordiques , slashed a unified team player , he was merely glared at none of the soviets swung a stick or swung a glove the way the soviets think , if lindros is dumb enough to do that , they 're not dumb enough to retaliate with your allegiance to goons , you 'll be glad to know that some of the united states players do chestbump an opponent and snarl before the linesmen separate them but they do n't dare drop their gloves and throw a punch if they do , they know the referee will wave bon soir , baby there s talk over here that with the soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states , and with one germany , the nhl is thinking of developing a european hockey league with franchises in major cities like moscow , berlin , prague , stockholm , oslo , helsinki , paris , milan , warsaw and bern it s a great idea imagine a stanley cup final between the nhl champions and the ehl champions one of the networks might even go for it but do n't spoil a great idea if you help create the ehl , please , no goons allowed after watching hockey the way it ought to be , the fans over here would n't understand it any other way and if the ehl did n't allow goons , the nhl could n't allow goons not if you wanted the same rules to apply to a stanley cup final between the nhl and the ehl wish you were here , john you 're missing a great game yours for hockey as it oughta be , photo greg brown \( mike powell allsport \)
washington , june 16 it took a crowd of tourists to do it , but the russianamerican summit meeting finally generated some public excitement in washington this evening for much of the day , washington residents had gone about their business seeming more or less oblivious to the presence of president boris n yeltsin of russia a few people ran up to the back gate of the white house when he and president bush appeared there briefly , but they were mostly from hong kong and germany the yeltsin trip did not seem to be generating anything like the enthusiasm that the last soviet leader , president mikhail s gorbachev , used to produce in the capital mr gorbachev , after all , was able to wow washington simply by stepping out of his limousine so for a time it seemed as if they were going to give a summit and nobody would care until , that is , mr yeltsin turned up at the air and space museum after posing under the model commemorating the 1975 apollosoyuz mission and giving a little talk about the importance of cooperation in space , mr yeltsin climbed the stairs and headed along a balcony to an official reception as he did so , he passed over a room in which hundreds of people were gathered always sensitive to a crowd , mr yeltsin paused a moment and his audience exploded into applause , snapped pictures and shouted , hip , hip , hooray ! washington unimpressed if mr yeltsin seemed taken aback , nobody could blame him , given the rather hohum response he had been getting earlier in the day in the morning , as the two presidents discussed the future of the world inside the white house , a crowd of spectators gathered across the street outside mr yeltsin s guest quarters at blair house it was a crowd that said everything about how washington was viewing this russianamerican summit meeting it was a crowd of eight people while two young women rode their bicycles past the sidewalk barricade outside blair house , one asked the other , what are all these police for \? that guy yeltsin is here , the other said oh yah , yah , said the first woman with a mixture of boredom and recognition like dozens of others , george e hicho , a metallurgical engineer , just happened to be passing by when the police froze traffic as the russian leader emerged from his morning white house talks he had seen real russians before , scary ones i got a glimpse of khrushchev when he came to the university of pittsburgh in 1960 , he recalled boy , i remember the crowd was 10 rows deep on both sides of the street khrushchev scared us , he said he was the leader of a country and could just wipe us out he said , 'i'm here to fight you' now on the other hand this guy yeltsin , he s begging he just wants our help to pull his country out of the ditches a white house feast while the yeltsin summit meeting may be lacking the sweep and drama of the oldstyle sovietamerican summitry , the white house was sparing none of the diplomatic trappings , including a state dinner laid on at the white house tonight , with the soprano carol vaness booked to entertain the dinner , served on the johnson china on pink tablecloths , was the usual nouvelle institutional , with a heavy emphasis on american dishes and american wines \( cakebread sauvignon blanc 1990 and sanford barrel select pinot noir 1989 \) the overlays on the tables were hot pink while the united states marine orchestra played from the grand foyer , the guests had sturgeon , roast loin of veal , potatoes , asparagus , baby carrots , summer salad , herbed capri cheese , caramel mousse with roasted dried pears and orange sauce and cookies the centerpieces were crystal bowls with pink peonies and hot pink roses and hot pink gerbera the campanula were white mr bush gave mr yeltsin one of those machines that fire tennis balls relentlessly across the net and mr yeltsin responded with a large brass vase decorated with silver filigree and a sample of russian handiwork barbara bush and naina yeltsin exchanged porcelain pieces mrs bush s present was a boehm egg with mock orange blossoms and hearts and a gold rabbit inside no pink no ringers for yeltsin mr bush , who often says he likes to get the measure of his fellow world leaders before he can do real business with them , was making a point of getting some quality time with the russian president just as he took president francois mitterrand of france on a walk on a maine beach , and president hosni mubarak of egypt to a baseball game , mr bush planned to take mr yeltsin on a boat tour of chesapeake bay on wednesday before the formal ceremony at the white house at which they are to sign an armscontrol document and other agreements today , he took mr yeltsin for a stroll around the white house grounds mr bush showed him the putting green , explaining that that is where he practices his golf game he showed mr yeltsin , a tennis player , the white house courts and the two leaders chanced on a group of white house electricians who were having a tournament at mr bush s horseshoe pit , where mr gorbachev thrilled the president once by scoring a ringer mr yeltsin stripped off his coat , and tried his hand at the game , but did not fare as well at first , his pitches did not even reach the post mr bush coached him a little , and the russian did a little better , but there were no ringers today russian s 'certain spirit' at the white house dinner tonight , president bush noted that many had applied an american term , maverick , to president yeltsin , and he carried the image further by saying , you possess a certain spirit that we find on the plains of the west president bush lifted his wine glass and toasted , to the new partnership between our people mr yeltsin responded by saying , this is the best day in my life it was so , he said , because of the reduction of nuclear missiles agreed to earlier in the day my friend george , we have done it today , president yeltsin said as mr yeltsin neared the end of his remarks and prepared to make his toast , president bush rose , signaled for the guests to rise , and president yeltsin offered a toast to the people of great russia and great america photo president bush and president boris n yeltsin toasting each other last night during a state dinner in mr yeltsin s honor at the white house \( associated press \)
washington , june 29 following are excerpts from the supreme court s ruling today in the pennsylvania abortion case , planned parenthood v casey justices sandra day o'connor , anthony m kennedy , and david h souter jointly wrote an opinion for the court upholding a portion of the regulations an informed consent provision and a 24hour waiting period and reaffirming the 1973 roe v wade ruling that legalized abortion , but declaring unconstitutional a requirement that women seeking abortions notify their husbands justices john paul stevens and harry a blackmun each wrote an opinion arguing that all the restrictions should have been found unconstitutional chief justice william h rehnquist and justice antonin scalia each wrote dissenting opinions , joined in both instances by justices byron r white and clarence thomas , arguing that the court should have overturned roe v wade from the decision by justices o'connor , kennedy and souter liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt yet 19 years after our holding that the constitution protects a woman s right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages , roe v wade , 410 u s 113 \( 1973 \) , that definition of liberty is still questioned joining the respondents as amicus curiae , the united states , as it has done in five other cases in the last decade , again asks us to overrule roe at issue in these cases are five provisions of the pennsylvania abortion control act of 1982 as amended in 1988 and 1989 the act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure , and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed for a minor to obtain an abortion , the act requires the informed consent of one of her parents , but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent s consent another provision of the act requires that , unless certain exceptions apply , a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion the act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a medical emergency , which is defined in sections 3203 of the act in addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions , the act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services before any of these provisions took effect , the petitioners , who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services , brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face the district court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations , and , after a 3day bench trial , held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional , entering a permanent injunction against pennsylvania s enforcement of them the court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part , upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement and at oral argument in this court , the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling roe v wade we disagree with that analysis but we acknowledge that our decisions after roe cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding further , the chief justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of roe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality state and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the constitution given these premises , we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the state respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures after considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by roe , principles of institutional integrity , and the rule of stare decisis , we are led to conclude this the essential holding of roe v wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed it must be stated at the outset and with clarity that roe s essential holding , the holding we reaffirm , has three parts first is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state before viability , the state s interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman s effective right to elect the procedure second is a confirmation of the state s power to restrict abortions after fetal viability , if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman s life or health and third is the principle that the state has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child these principles do not contradict one another and we adhere to each
the guitarist john mclaughlin s set on wednesday at the blue note picked up for a moment during the second song a duet between mr mclaughlin and his percussionist , trilok gurtu , the tune mined the similarities in flamenco and elements of indian music , with rapid flurries and carefully bent and slurred notes the piece was built around exchanges , and mr mclaughlin , who had toned down the electronic effects he used for most of the set , and mr gurtu carried on a long conversation , full of puns and asides and digressions it was the last elevated moment of the set , and the last intimate one as well mr mclaughlin has never been a warm improviser , but at this stage of his long and varied career he has exaggerated his distance from the audience by adding loads of electronic devices to his sound playing an acoustic guitar , and backed by the bassist dominique di piazza and mr gurtu , he added enough echo to make the whole thing seem as if it were emanating from a cave somewhere north of the arctic circle mr di piazza did the same at times , synthesized keyboard sounds appropriate to an airport lounge added a kitsch humor the band probably did n't intend it s a truism that vanguardism vanishes with age , that radicals become conservatives mr mclauglin , who in the 1960 s introduced a radical conception of the guitar , has drifted toward newage music either he s become entirely cynical , playing the audience for fools , or he s become a pure sentimentalist in tune after tune , the most banal fusion harmonies , passing as adventurous or emotional , but drenched in echo , passed as invention there s nothing intrinsically wrong with the electronic modification of an instrument s sound , but to use the result as a sign of emotional integrity when none exists is false advertisment
to the editor edward rothstein s assessment of john cage s contributions to 20thcentury music cage played his anarchy by the rules , sept 20 , although refreshing in its refusal to accept the cage myth on its own terms , makes the mistake of seeing contradiction where none exists cage s acceptance of rules for composition does not reveal him as a closet totalitarian , but simply extends his creative power into the realms of order and form cage s adoption of rules was not monolithic each creation of new sound was also a creation of rules , part of a continual breaking of commandments similarly , cage s desire to upset the musical establishment in no way contradicts his stance of innocence \( if it can really be called that \) the polemical and the visionary , the liberational and the confrontative , are not mutually distorting musics but merely two complementary noises in the broad cagean soundscape nick williams bloomington , ind
baidoa , somalia , july 17 in the damp , gray dawn in this remote somali bush town , 25 , 000 men , women and children , their rib cages protruding , their eyes listless , shuffled with their last bit of strength today toward outdoor kitchens for a scoop of food hundreds , too feeble to eat , died while they waited their bodies were hastily lowered into fresh graves hacked in the red soil as cooks boiled water inside to make a dollop of corn and sugar gruel for those who were still alive as those waiting for food huddled in silence , without a sound from anybody , the body of a teenage boy who had just died was pushed under a bush until the feeding was over her whole family lost outside one center , fatima mumin sheik wept over the last of her five children , a 10yearold girl , ruquia , whose platethin body was tied in cloth , ready for burial this is the last , she said i 've lost my husband too in the last month , a red cross official estimated , about 7 , 000 people have died of hunger in baidoa , a town with an oftenshifting population of about 40 , 000 many more died the month before in this place 150 miles northwest of the capital , mogadishu , and similar numbers of deaths are occurring in half a dozen rural somali towns , said the official , geoff loane , coordinator of the organization s relief in somalia here is hell , said mr loane , who worked in ethiopia during the 198485 famine i thought i would never see ethiopia again , and i did n't think we would allow it to happen again red cross officials say they believe that about onethird of somalia s people , estimated to number anywhere from 45 million to 6 million , are likely to die in the next six months unless more food is pumped into the country a mostly desert nation on the eastern edge of the horn of africa , somalia has been torn by fierce fighting since the ouster of the president of 21 years , mohammed siad barre , in january 1991 when the warfare among militias increased last november in mogadishu , about 30 , 000 people , most of them civilians , were killed relief officials predicted then that a deep famine would strike somalia because the intense fighting made the delivery of food extremely difficult and dangerous since then , continued warfare has driven people from their homes and fields , destroyed the nation s agriculture , and brought desperate hunger and want to the capital as well as to the countryside despite the efforts of the international committee of the red cross , which says it is mounting the biggest operation in its history , the famine predicted six months ago has arrived , they say the magnitude of the problem staggers even the disasterhardened officials of the red cross , an organization that is managing a 100 million sea , air and land operation to deliver food to somalia during the ethiopian famine , about one million of the country s 40 million people are thought to have died the director general of the red cross , peter fuchs , said in a telephone interview from geneva that somalia might well suffer more in absolute and proportional numbers third of people threatened unless we step up our efforts , onethird of the people are in acute danger of disappearing , dr fuchs said those we are reaching can just survive they are not out of danger one factor in this famine is the drought that is affecting a vast swath of eastern africa , which has threatened ethiopia , kenya and other countries with famine but none of the other countries also faces a continuing war noting the high percentage of deaths in baidoa , mr loane said , you ca n't deal with it he added that there were similar death rates in gelib , near kismayo on the southern coast in corioley , near merca , also in the south in beladwane , on the ethiopian border , and in bardera , east of the kenyan border these are just the places i 've seen , he said i'm told by the governor that bakhool north of here is worse here in baidoa , the director of the three centers of the united nations children s fund , dr siad muse aden , pointed to countless children he said would die in the next few days , despite the one feeding a day provided by unicef dr aden gestured toward one child , a shriveled 5yearold named manour , whose father tried to warm him with the embers from a kerchiefsized fire in the grounds of the feeding center he will die , dr aden said there is no hope , a footlong grave an hour earlier , 4monthold mahoumoud abdul , the first and only child of 22yearold kuresh mohamed , died his tiny body , first tied in his mother s shawl and then swathed in a white scarf scrounged from somewhere for burial , was lowered into a deep but only footlong grave by a grieving mrs mohamed she and her husband , mohamed abdi , had walked to town from their village 30 miles away after their sheep , cattle and grain were stolen by armed gangs , she said she came to the feeding center this morning for help for her child , but buried him instead among the dozens of mounds of red soil that signified graves the red cross is seeking to arrange safe passage from marauding gangs for more food for the 22 red cross kitchens , where huge vats of rice , beans and oil were being stirred today for distribution at noon the supervisor , mohamed betar , said one graveyard of the weak who had died there was already filled

cooler at reading s spanking new 114 , 000squarefoot walmart out on perkiomen avenue indeed , it was with a certain satisfaction that she emerged from the discount colossus , having spent just 1488 for an item that had been marked 1797 at a kmart no slouch at pricecutting itself near her home in pottstown mrs startzel , who with her husband usually spends a week each year vacationing in cancun , mexico , is not by nature a skinflint it s just that the startzels are trying to save some money , since they feel none too secure about their jobs both work at bell atlantic and face the possibility of a strike this summer to the dismay of merchants , there seem to be all too many startzels around these days people are value conscious , looking for basic value rather than frills , said edwin lakin , president of boscov s , a mediumsized regional departmentstore chain that has its headquarters and three stores here questions about recovery this do n't spend more than you must attitude threatens not only merchants in reading and surrounding berks county , where the new york times has taken seven soundings of business conditions over the last 18 months it implies a reshaping of american retailing and raises questions about the nation s economic recovery while consumers do not usually initiate recoveries , consumer spending representing twothirds of the nation s economy has traditionally fueled recoveries but this recession , if reading is any indication , has trained consumers to pinch their pennies this reluctance to spend also tends to be a strong antidote to inflation irwin l kellner , chief economist at the chemical bank in new york , finds consumers these days nothing less than defiant about price increases , which during the recession they have learned can often be resisted successfully with job security increasingly problematic and income growth slowing , costconscious consumers are embracing retailing discounters with unabashed enthusiasm , mr kellner said , noting that discounters now account for more than 40 percent of general merchandise business and onethird of apparel sales discounters probably do not pose a severe threat to retailers like boscov s the chain is said to enjoy a loyal following of wellserved , middleincome customers , and after a flat period earlier in the year it reported a mayjune sales pickup to levels about 5 percent above those of a year earlier but traditional stores like boscov s are finding that the range of goods in which they can be competitive is narrowing increasingly , according to joseph b siegel , a merchandising specialist and vice president of the national retail federation , department stores are being limited to apparel and related soft goods while ceding the massproduced hard goods like snow blowers and tennis balls to the discounters they 've got to hurt some businesses there , mr siegel said when asked about the effect on reading of two recently opened walmarts and a sam s club , a walmart affiliate while moderate and better consumers , to use the industry s classifications , will not start buying clothes at a discounter , they very well may join budget and bargain customers buying picnic coolers and antifreeze there talk to almost any business person hereabouts and tales of thrifty or cautious customers come pouring out take , for example , mike zdunowski , who owns both a sizable tire dealership and a local beer distributor and who sees no inkling of economic recovery this is the most discouraging june we 've had in 10 years , he said in his gritty garage on south ninth street , with sales 20 percent below those of june 1991 , a comparison far worse than may s mr zdunowski , who is fixing more flats and selling more used tires these days , manages a wry smile when reminded that treasury secretary nicholas f brady spoke in february about tires being a good economic indicator and seeing robins on the lawn that he said portended recovery getting the last mile people are trying to get the last mile out of their tires , which over the years have become a bigticket item , mr zdunowski added that s how people cope as for the beer business , consumers are drinking just as much as ever but are presumably enjoying it less since they have switched to cheaper brands , shunning imports people are shopping price with beer , ' mr zdunowski says , shaking his head as if he could never have imagined such a situation , which he says is partly because of the federal tax increase at the beginning of 1991 that forced his prices up 175 a case profits , he says , have shrunk by half or talk to daniel l schmehl jr , proprietor of the iron horse hobby house , a downtown fixture since 1938 , which traditionally has flourished in recessions but which has suffered

pat riley visited with magic johnson last week in los angeles there was no need to pop the question the gleam in johnson s eyes was a happy announcement that he would be returning to the lakers how many games \? said riley johnson told him exactly what he told yesterday s news conference he would begin with a foundation of 50 , all home games , a selected few on the road , but none back to back then what about new york \? said riley you know i'm gonna play new york , johnson said riley shook his head how can you when you guys are in detroit the night before \? johnson , out of lansing , mich , thought a few seconds about this choice between playing his home territory on march 9 and in madison square garden against his former coach and the rising knicks the next night for you , he told riley , i'm gonna play riley , who still keeps his watch on west coast time and his finger on the the lakers' pulse , laughed yesterday as he recreated this conversation , but he told the story with a dual purpose rigors of the road of course magic johnson , who is drawn to attention like a moth to light , would play both the suburbs of detroit and new york but the coach and pragmatist in riley also recognizes the rigors there will be once johnson is back , as magic said yesterday , where he belongs riley knows that yesterday s lightheartedness might weigh a lot heavier on his close friend as magic johnson s comeback season moves from the freshness of autumn into the cold , stark reality of winter he knows how grueling this is , riley said the olympics and the allstar game do n't even compare to what he s coming back to it s going to be hard , different , especially for what he puts into it he knows that i think that s why he vacillated for as long as he did however stretched out and melodramatic the wait , however many questions regarding his health and even what s left of his game the comeback raises , it is johnson s personal decision , based on consultation with family and physicians all jerry west and the lakers can say is that they 're thrilled , no matter how shortterm a panacea he is for the team and how complicated an environment his limited schedule will create but as heroic returns go , this one is not likely to end with johnson being mobbed in the middle of the court , the way he was after the clean swish of a heavenly , allstar gameending , threepoint shot , or on a pedestal with a flag on his shoulder , a bouquet in his hand and a gold medal around his neck , as it was on the night the dream team fulfilled its olympic destiny last month in barcelona , spain these lakers may be greatly improved with johnson but they are no one s fantasy team the national basketball association season is no storybook it is basketball s version of real life , a sixmonth rat race to the playoffs there was a time , months before the shocking announcement last november that he had hiv , the virus that causes aids , when johnson seemed to be thinking that five championships might be enough he had carried the lakers into the nba finals two seasons ago , finishing off the portland trail blazers for the western conference title with one of his most brilliant strokes of genius a bounce pass to no one , the length of the court , eating away the final seconds of a 1point game an hour passed before he limped to his locker that night , huge ice packs on his worndown knees the spectacle of a meeting with michael jordan in the finals brought forth the famous and beatific smile the subsequent fivegame beating the chicago bulls administered to the lakers made him think out loud , however briefly , that he did n't need to be chasing after tim hardaway and kevin johnson , much less jordan , anymore he s used to winning , and that , riley said , will be how johnson measures future success he could be only 75 percent of what he was , average 11 points and 7 assists , riley said if the w s are there , that 'll be good enough 'nothing to prove' the questions , then , are not so much about how good johnson plays , as much as they are about how the lakers do if james worthy , sam perkins and vlade divac are healthy , they , with a c green , elden campbell and james edwards , would , in riley s opinion , form a formidable frontline and give the lakers a solid opportunity in the west and the concern is that the more serious a contender the lakers become , the more difficult it would be for johnson to regulate his time how could he stay home from the trip to seattle if , say , a crucial extra playoff game at home were at stake \? and the game after that in phoenix \? how does coach randy pfund regulate johnson s minutes when it is his nature to be in total control of the show \? since 1979 , the lakers have been magic johnson s show he could no more pass up an important road game in san antonio as he could a chance to make this historic return , or even attempt to ruin a march 10 night for riley in new york he has nothing to prove , said riley , but he s going to be more motivated than ever that may not be as good as it sounds photo magic johnson with his wife , cookie , as he announced his return to the nba at a news conference at the forum yesterday \( associated press \)

george brett said it best before the game even started who cares who wins these ones \? the royals are out of it the yankees are out of it reaching the 500 mark means little , winning one game against another losing team even less there must be other things to bring someone out to the ball park for brett , it is the pursuit of hit no 3 , 000 a milestone that sits 22 hits away for the yankees , the interest lies in their young pitchers like sam militello and bob wickman and sterling hitchcock , the lefthander who jumped from class aa straight to yankee stadium last night for his major league debut hitchcock might be wellserved to make friends with melido perez perez is the man who could write volumes about pitching without run support something hitchcock faced often playing with albany , and something he experienced last night five in a row the yankees managed to win the game , 21 , when danny tartabull hit a twoout single to right , scoring randy velarde in the eighth inning the yanks have won five consecutive games and have moved to five under 500 with 21 left to play but they did n't give much support to hitchcock , who went six innings without a run being scored in his behalf hitchcock gave up six hits and one run , walked one and struck out two he was pulled after throwing 103 pitches , 12 shy of the 115pitch limit he had worked under at albany this year i was impressed with his stuff , yankees manager buck showalter said he did n't seem in awe or intimidated by the situation he could easily have come out of the outing without giving up any runs the first thing you notice about hitchcock , though , was not the odd leglift delivery , or the forkball which he did n't have last night or his apparent poise on the mound no , first off , you notice the socks hitchcock wears them nearly to his knees , the pinstripes of his pants giving way to a solid block of navy blue that probably has n't been seen since gil mcdougald wore them that way in 1960 on the mound , he looks like a kid in knee socks and knickers , perhaps headed off to some oldfashioned preparatory school and his baby face does n't help matters much hitchcock is 21 years , four months and 13 days old , but is rarely able to buy a drink without showing an id he looks perhaps 18 or 19 17 when he s wearing his glasses and he s the youngest pitcher to start for the yanks since jose rijo in 1984 back in albany , my teammates used to call me the babe because of the socks and because i'm a little chunky , i guess , said hitchcock , who has always worn his socks high in was in albany , too , where hitchcock got used to pitching without the benefit of runs he had but six victories in 24 starts there , despite leading the eastern league in strikeouts and putting together a 258 earned run average miscommunication last night in new york , none of that changed twice , the yanks stuck him with a baserunner because of an error , and the run the royals scored on him was the result of a miscommunication between roberto kelly and bernie williams in the outfield wally joyner got a double out of a fly ball to leftcenter that both outfielders called but neither fielded , and scored two batters later on mike macfarlane s single to left i 've had some close ones , but i think i 'll have a lot fewer here , said hitchcock , whose next start depends on how sam militello looks when he throws tomorrow on the side these guys here can hit inside pitch former met kevin mcreynolds caught his left foot in the leftfield padding while catching a deep drive by mike stanley in the seventh he suffered a jammed left ankle and is daytoday george brett went 0for3 last night and has 22 games left to reach the 3 , 000hit milestone this season
rome , july 28 openly scorning the government s deployment of 7 , 000 soldiers to fight the mafia in sicily , mobsters have gunned down a third foe of organized crime on the island prime minister giuliano amato , facing a sea of troubles after only a month in office , said today that the government s credibility had been lost we are going through a phase when everything seems to be stacked against us the economy , finances , the foreign exchange market , the mafia , the crisis of our political parties , mr amato said in a television interview his unusually blunt and pessimistic assessment came hours after assassins pumped eight bullets into giovanni lizzio , head of antiextortion investigations in catania , sicily s second city , as he drove home monday night he was the first senior police officer to be killed in a city that has long resisted the mob the 47yearold investigator died even as authorities in the city were discussing how to use the troops sent there after the mafia killings of giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino in palermo earlier this summer mr amato s reference to economic problems coincided with a drive by his fragile coalition to push an emergency budget through parliament before its summer recess next week the government also decided today to call a vote of confidence on its proposal to cut italy s huge budget deficit , which is europe s biggest \( at 130 billion this year \) and 50 percent higher per capita than the united states deficit the government proposal calls for reducing the deficit by 27 billion through tax increases and spending cuts under italian parliamentary procedures , opposition parties may not demand changes in proposed legislation before a vote of confidence , but the government must resign if it loses a new terrorism mr amato s government has only a slender majority in the traditionally volatile parliament , and is apparently calculating that none of its adversaries want to risk another political crisis at a time of such economic turmoil and such brazen challenges from organized crime the loss of international confidence in italy has also been weakening the lira steadily for weeks it is essential that the budget package be approved by both houses before the summer break , said finance minister giovanni goria we do n't have much time because there is a need to give a signal to the markets if italy does not heal its economy , it faces exclusion from some key decisions as the european community begins integration next year but mr amato s effort to make the economy the first priority has been sabotaged by the mafia s campaign of killings and the resulting political pressure to curb organized crime such is the mood of desperation that mr amato called today for other countries and italy s own secret service to join battle against the mafia terrorism , for years the enemy of our intelligence services , no longer exists , he said in the broadcast interview what is the purpose of our intelligence services now unless they start infiltrating organized crime \? we know why it s called cosa nostra , but it s not something only italian cosa nostra means our thing and has been used by organized crime figures to emphasize a mob s exclusivity pervasiveness of mob while mr lizzio , the latest victim of mob violence , did not enjoy the same national status as mr falcone and mr borsellino , who were killed in carbomb attacks , his death nonetheless showed how the mob , known in italy as the octopus , had spread its tentacles until recent years catania had withstood mafia infiltration , but , according to store owners there , up to half of them pay extortion money to the mob , more than in palermo , which is regarded as the mafia s fief mr lizzio was in charge of investigating protection rackets the police , moreover , say a clan war is raging over control of the narcotics trade it remains unclear whether the catania killing was ordered by the mafia clans that killed mr falcone and mr borsellino mafia specialists had assumed that the assassination of the two judges was a collective decision by the mafia s highest bosses , those in the cupola , or dome some specialists said the catania killing may have been decided at a lower level but , coming two days after troops in full battlegear began arriving in sicily to help the police hunt mobsters , it showed the same disregard for the authorities photos police investigators surrounding the car of giovanni lizzio , head of antiextortion investigations in catania , sicily mr lizzio was shot and killed by gunmen as he drove home monday night giovanni lizzio had been in charge of investigating protection rackets in catania , a city that had until recently withstood mafia infiltration \( associated press \) \( pg a2 \) map of italy showing location of catania \( pg a2 \)
tigre , argentina the river reconquista meanders through the countryside just north of buenos aires and eventually empties into the parana delta , which encompasses this city of picturesque river boats , island restaurants , shaded cottages and summer homes but the reconquista is not the kind of river people want flowing past their homes it fouls the air with putrid odors and its waters bring to the parana river pieces of cow hide , animal hearts , lungs and intestines , mercury , lead , sulphuric acid , chrome , typhus and other diseases upstream along the river s banks are more than 1 , 000 small and large plants and factories , a dozen shantytowns and a host of garbage dumps that make it probably the most polluted river in this country recently , the reconquista has become a parable for argentina s ecological struggle in april , a local judge , roberto marquevich , began closing some of the largest factories along the river , charging the owners with dumping poisons and other pollutants into the water and spreading contagious diseases within weeks , he had shut down 17 factories and placed 32 executives and plant managers in jail what i am saying is that we have to start to do something , or we wo n't do anything , judge marquevich said in a recent interview i am not saying we are going to have a perfect river , but nothing was being done the inertia was tremendous while most of the plants have reopened and the executives are out of jail , having posted more than 6 million in bail , the judge s actions have shaken both the political and business establishment still , the episode illustrates how difficult it will be for argentina to deal with its pollution problems special cabinet meeting for one thing , many of the business executives had strong ties to the political establishment , and the reaction against the judge was immediate the crackdown was the primary subject of a cabinet meeting presided over by president carlos saul menem i was told that one government official present at the meeting said they should take all the industrial waste and put it at the door of my house , judge marquevich said what that person did not know was that i do n't have a house one senior government official , who insisted on anonymity , said for years these companies have been dumping this stuff you just ca n't come in and change the rules overnight , even though we might agree with him luis j prado , owner of la flourhidrica , one plant that was shut down , said none of us are against what the judge is trying to do we all realize that the river is terribly polluted but you just ca n't do it overnight perhaps most threatening for both the menem government and argentine industry is the idea that strong environmental enforcement measures could jeopardize the country s remarkable economic turnaround even the economy and public works minister , domingo cavallo , warned recently that such judicial actions are an issue of concern that could put the brakes on foreign and local investment the case has highlighted the woesome state of the reconquista and the riachuelo , which form a ring around buenos aires the area is home to much of the country s industry , including large meatpacking plants and chemical , rubber and paint factories to many here , it is an unsettling paradox that argentina has shown itself to be environmentally aware in other areas last year , after it was found that hundreds of tons of waste was being imported every month from the united states and europe , it passed a tough environmental law banning such imports but when environmental issues clash with its own economic program , the response is less aggressive , judge marquevich said map of argentina showing location of river reconquista
toulon , france from her restaurant in the port of toulon , genevieve navarro can see the haze coming off the mediterranean and the ships arriving from a country of which she can hardly bear to speak i wo n't go back there , ever , she said of algeria , the land of her birth her friends have returned there to find their former homes in ruins , their neighborhoods rundown , and , most heartwrenching , their parents' and grandparents' graves desecrated mrs navarro was 13 years old when france abandoned its fight to hold on to algeria , exactly 30 years ago with reluctance she recalled those final days , her terror , the random bombings and finally the airlift , the moment when she became one of that day s 10 , 000 refugees by the time algeria declared independence , on july 3 , 1962 , more than a million french citizens had fled and poured into france they found safety and built new lives but the trauma of the unpopular war and the humiliating way france ended its 132year presence left a legacy of pain and bitterness that has still not disappeared 'part of the defeat' the loss of algeria was in some ways like the end of the vietnam war , said jeanmarie martinez , who , at the age of 17 , was part of the flood of refugees many frenchmen wanted the war to end because their sons were dying there as in vietnam , this war was lost politically and they hated the refugees because we were part of the defeat the eightyear algerian war tore france apart in often violent disputes between those resigned to giving up and those who insisted that the land should remain french some historians argue that the algerian conflict still haunts this country as much as another modern trauma france s collaboration with the nazis in world war ii while hardly comparable , both episodes continue to come under public scrutiny and today the frenchalgerian war still incites political debate heartfelt enough to bring renewed charges of french military brutality and bitter fingerpointing by people on opposing sides the commemoration has come with exhibits and documentaries investigating those years thousands of returnees and algerian war veterans also staged a rally at vincennes , outside paris mr martinez , today the town clerk of toulon , said he had overcome his old anger at paris for giving up a war it could have won and at the french for despising the repatriated refugees and branding ordinary workers' families like his own as dirty colonialists eventually , he said , he understood that only a decade earlier france had lost its colonies in indochina and the country was psychologically beaten down , filled with guilt therefore , he said , many frenchmen idealized the algerian rebellion , even though french civilians were often the victims of atrocities , terrorist bombs and assassinations behind this reasoning lies another that is less charitable that many frenchmen opposed risking french lives to defend algeria s europeans many of them were descendants of settlers from spain , italy , corsica and malta , and frenchmen saw them not as compatriots but as colonists who had picked up french nationality but culturally were not recognizably french cultural gaps still exists in many cases , that cultural gap still exists today , say refugees who take pride in calling themselves pieds noirs , or black feet , the onceabusive epithet often attributed to the black boots of the 19thcentury french troops many pieds noirs have integrated and succeeded in french society , among them yves saintlaurent , the couturier , and bernard attali , the president of air france but here in southern france , where the majority settled , they often stick together in associations and clubs and meet for evenings of their own food and music they find the french cold and distant at the repatriates' house , a center for 17 pieds noirs associations around toulon , louis boutigny said that members met to commemorate the dead , sometimes to celebrate , more often to defend people who after all these years have not yet been indemnified some have gone on missions to algeria to restore the french cemeteries politicians are learning to reckon with the votes of the pieds noirs and their descendants many support the farright national front party which has grown by campaigning against arab immigration in france here in toulon , a city of many pieds noirs , the front won 29 percent of the vote in the march regional elections mrs navarro explained this by saying that none of her friends could reconcile the past blood bath against the french in algeria with france s recent immigration policy after all that happened , algerians have a right to come here , she snapped if we protest , everybody screams we are racists 'our government is blind' robert mouton , a retired marine who fought in indochina , madagascar and algeria , said , our government is blind as an intelligence officer in algeria , he said , he lost all respect for france s politicians first they bungled the algerian war , he said , and now , with their liberal immigration policies , they are causing racial tensions in the country today mr mouton directs a social center for the socalled harkis from algeria , muslims who fought on the french side in the war this is teaching him to take advantage of the policies he criticizes france s great shame , he said , is the fate of the 60 , 000 harkis , the veterans who were received here first as liberators and then abandoned many are isolated , uneducated and living on minute pensions but our government loves immigrants , he said with a smile so when a harki family needs help , i send them to one of the offices that give immigrants assistance and i tell them 'do n't say you 're a harki tell them you 're an immigrant' photo thirty years after france abandoned its fight to hold on to algeria , the pain and bitterness of that unpopular war still have not disappeared thousands of refugees and war veterans , who proudly refer to themselves as black feet , staged a rally at vincennes , outside paris , to observe the anniversary \( agence francepresse \)
banja luka , bosnia and herzegovina , aug 15 in the months since serbian forces began seizing huge swaths of bosnia and herzegovina , the territory under their control has become a patchwork of rival serbian fiefs consumed by lawlessness and economic collapse stark images of violence and near anarchy can be seen throughout this newly proclaimed country , which calls itself the serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina and covers roughly twothirds of what was once one of the republics of yugoslavia serbian militiamen , wearing khaki or camouflage uniforms or street clothes with boots or athletic shoes , drive freely around this town , sometimes firing into the air families have been burned out of their homes and civilians have been killed in reprisal for the deaths of relatives at the front shortages , a result of economic disruptions caused by the fighting as well as the international embargo against the serbs , have led to long lines of people from every ethnic group outside bakeries , banks and aid centers the people complain of water shutoffs and days with no electricity , and they fear enduring these hardships as winter approaches 'we have no income' everyone in the family is out of work , said a muslim from celinac , a mostly serbian district about 10 miles from banja luka , the largest city in the serbheld area and a major military center winter is coming , and we have no income we have to figure out how to keep ourselves warm and fed he added that his family had no money for transportation out and nowhere to go the garden is n't enough to feed all six of us for the winter , he said we ca n't store enough because there is n't enough electricity for the freezer many serbian civilians , trying to escape the misery of their lives , have begun voluntarily joining the muslims and croats who were forced out in the serbs' campaign of ethnic cleansing they can be seen aboard columns of buses that grind over dustchoked roads past bombed mosques and churches , homes and factories muslims desperately seeking to escape have even risked their lives walking across perilous battlefronts although the serbian forces have in some senses won their war and now control most of the territory where serbian populations dominate , the fighting continues as they lay siege to muslimheld pockets and put pressure on nonserbs to give up their property and leave they are also fighting forces from croatia that are seeking to seize large parts of the republic nominal control of the new country proclaimed here lies with radovan karadzic , a former psychiatrist , who as president of the serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina shuttles by helicopter at treetop level from his mountainside headquarters in pale , just outside sarajevo , to belgrade and banja luka the helicopter , like all of the arms and equipment used by serbian forces , was provided originally by the yugoslav army when it abandoned the area in may warlords compete for authority bosnia and herzegovina is like switzerland 200 years ago , mr karadzic said in a recent interview , alluding to the professed desire of serbs for ethnic cantons in bosnia and herzegovina two centuries from now , we 'll be as peaceful as switzerland two centuries from now , we 'll kiss each other the local retort is the difference between switzerland and bosnia and herzegovina is that there are no swiss in bosnia and herzegovina the area controlled by serbs is actually a patchwork of territories under the authority of various independent or semiindependent forces , and citizens traveling across what was once a unified area now must pass checkpoints that seem not even to communicate with one another some of these fiefs are controlled by warlords who compete for authority with mr karadzic the most powerful warlord in the prijedor area is the local police chief , simo drljaca , who runs the militia and has reportedly had serious clashes with local army officers mr karadzic said mr drljaca was responsible for the inhumane conditions in prijedor s notorious detention centers and transit camps , which hold thousands of civilians alongside men who dared resist the serbs the camps under his control include omarska and keraterm undercutting denials by serbian leaders that there is no official policy behind the forced expulsion of muslims and croats , mr drljaca speaks frankly of how to cleanse undesirables with their mosques , you must not just break the minarets , he said you 've got to shake up the foundations because that means they cannot build another do that , and they 'll want to go they 'll just leave by themselves in celinac , witnesses said serbian extremists set off five charges to jar a new mosque from its foundation local serbian leaders , however , have decreed a series of special measures because , they say , they want the muslims to remain the measures have led to house arrest for 34 muslims who refused mobilization orders all other nonserbs are confined to their homes from 4 pm to 6 am and forbidden to make contact with relatives outside the district without permission or to ride in a car or to bathe or fish in nearby rivers
marlene dietrich life and legend by steven bach illustrated 626 pp new york william morrow company 25 a day with tallulah bankhead , someone once said \( we did n't talk about nights back then \) , is equal to a month in the country on this scale , a week spent reading about marlene dietrich may be the most exhausting year i have ever spent following her up and down the charts and round and round the globe , the reader runs out of gas long before the subject does , and i have no trouble believing that this napoleon of publicity and greatest of german generals is still orchestrating our response to her from the grave through a series of timerelease confidences to special friends , of which she had more than the grains of sand on the shore more soberly speaking , dietrich , who died in may , could not have planned the first two posthumous books about her better first donald spoto s relative quickie , blue angel , to catch our attention with plenty of big names and bedhopping , and now steven bach s marlene dietrich life and legend , an encyclopedic meditation on her show business career , which simply as a historical landmark deserves all the space it can get although such a book inevitably provides much quibbling material , length is not among the more pressing quibbles if you can stand dietrich at all , you can probably stand a lot of her and when even she palls , you can just stare at the backgrounds berlin in the 20 s , hollywood in the 30 s and after that paris , london and anywhere you 'd go to outrun boredom in all her 90 improbable years on earth , there is almost no record of marlene dietrich herself ever having bored anyone but mr bach s takenoprisoners research reveals one instructive exception it seems that someone had made a tape of the ovations that crowned and sealed her concerts , and in a curious lapse of showmanship , she was wont to play the tape for guests , supposing that they would hear in it at least onetenth of what she heard the sound of a million people saying , it worked for us too , confirming that all that ferocious lovemaking had not been in vain unique among superstars , dietrich gave at least as good as she got , emotionally speaking , somehow transferring her extraordinary gift for personal friendship to vast herds of people at a time and making each of them feel , as the screenwriter and novelist william goldman reports , as if he or she had spent the whole evening alone with her so the explosion of individual raptures at the end of each session would presumably have satisfied catherine the great herself at least until tomorrow night , as the song says one rather special virtue of this book is that if you open it to the right pages in the right mood , you can practically hear the applause still ringing , as if the author were as pleased about it as the subject , and as relieved dietrich s career was something of a highwire act , a prolonged feat of audacity , so it is thrilling , in an adventureserial kind of way , to read of how she came through time after time with stunning and unexpected performances and such is mr bach s artfulness or lack of it that one imagines oneself in the dressing room each time , murmuring , thank god in other words , mr bach is , with all reservations sternly noted , a fan , which seems entirely appropriate to his subject there is no point being impartial about dietrich you find her either magnificent or preposterous or both , and that s that and there s certainly no point wasting more time at the keyhole the scurviest journalist could never hope to expose her more thoroughly than she exposed herself the only possible fresh news about dietrich would be definite word that she did n't sleep with someone , and this mr bach mildly brings us she could n't stand ray milland , for instance , and one or two other unfortunates of either sex among her costars , fred macmurray was happily married , so she did n't go after him too hard a girl had her code what mr bach does do , if only by sheer attrition , is to cut her sex life down to size \( her lovemaking often seems to have constituted not much more than a berlin hello an ardent embrace plus an agreeable solution to the formidable problem of making small talk with gary cooper and john wayne , the slowest tongues in the west \) and simultaneously to place it in the larger context of who she thought she was and what she thought she was doing as irwin shaw once said apropos of helen lawrenson , the only thing most women could be adventurous about in those days was sex , and there s no doubt dietrich saw herself as a queen of conquistadors , conquering and sparing her victims for the sheer sport and practice of it sex may have been the guiding force in her life , but

toronto , july 30 all of the favored teams survived in the spingold knockout team championship here on tuesday as the field was cut to 32 from 64 but in the other major event at the american contract bridge league s summer national championships the women s knockout teams there were two major upsets the topseeded group of nancy passell of dallas , nell cahn of shreveport , la , stasha cohen of glen ridge , nj , and susan green of alexandria , va , were defending champions , and the first three won the world title in yokohama , japan , last october teamed with them were pam wittes of los alamitos , calif , and randi montin of alamo , calif , who won the pan american title in corpus christi , tex , last month they were heavily favored in their secondround match , but they lost by the substantial margin of 69 imps to an unheralded foursome roni gitchel and florine walters , both of pittsburgh jan shane of white plains and joan eaton of toronto equally surprising was the defeat of the fifthseeded squad that had won the national women s swiss team title four months ago gail greenberg and judy tucker , both of manhattan , and dorothy truscott of the bronx , lisa berkowitz of old tappan , nj , and sandra landy and michele handley , both from england greenberg , truscott and landy are former world champions , and the four americans were pan american winners last month with wittes and montin their team lost here by 21 imps to peggy sutherlin of dallas , broma lou reed of boulder , colo , ellasue chaitt of gaithersburg , md , brenda keller of boise , idaho , judy cody of annandale , va , and renee mancuso of los angeles one of the best bidding efforts in the early rounds of the spingold was produced by the polish partnership of piotr gawrys and krzysztof lasocki on the diagramed deal many pairs would bid to six clubs , which has no chance even with the trumps breaking normally , there is no way to make more than 11 tricks using a strong club system , lasocki opened two clubs , a natural opening north s first two bids asked south to describe his hand further , and he showed four spades and three hearts the partnership was using a variety of roman keycard blackwood in which the fivediamond response showed either three key cards or none , counting the club king as a key card gawrys as north now had a perfect picture of his partner s hand , and bid a grand slam not in clubs , but in hearts he had visualized that there would be two diamond ruffs available in the closed hand and so it proved south took the ruffs as quickly as possible , drew trumps and claimed the grand slam when the clubs divided normally their team gained 14 imps when the rival northsouth rested in three notrump diagram
miami , sept 4 the scope of the crisis that faced the florida power and light company after hurricane andrew knocked out electricity to more than 14 million customers and demolished mile after mile of its delivery network is best grasped in its particulars there was the severalmile stretch of 152d avenue near princeton choked off by dozens of steelreinforced concrete utility poles that had crashed across traffic lanes installed just three weeks before , the 65foot , 5 , 000 poles broke clean at the base and toppled in the storm there were the vast stretches of us route 1 that sounded like a washboard under car tires as drivers rattled over the downed power lines that littered the roadway from coconut grove to florida city , 40 miles to the south perhaps most telling of all , there was a humming sound at the utility s princeton substation , which usually pumps out power to about 20 , 000 customers in south dade county until today , the substation was reduced to drawing power for its own lights , air conditioner and coffee makers not from the maze of transmission lines that crisscrossed the skies overhead , but from that new friend to south florida a grinding , portable generator that could power only a fraction of the substation s own needs the power company itself was without power for the first 30 hours after the storm some company buildings were dark for 12 days stoneage conditions most residents could not grasp the extent of the damage they knew only one thing about the power company s troubles when they flipped a switch , nothing happened radio announcers have joked all week about south dade county s having been thrust back into the stone age but in some ways the adjustment was even harder than it sounded in the stone age , no one ever counted on electricity to transform a slab of meat into a meal and generators did not malfunction and blow out refrigerators , television sets and the other fragile impedimenta of modern life nor did people fume at the suddenly miserable interconnectedness of things , how everything , from the bank machines to gas stations to the electric doors at supermarkets , this week responded to only one position off for company officials focusing on the devastation south of kendall drive , the dimensions of the restart effort were overwhelming basically , we have to rebuild a system that took us 50 years to put together , bob marshall , the company s vice president for power distribution , said at the utility s headquarters after the lights came back on the only thing is , we 've got to rebuild it in a matter of weeks already , the company has restored about 90 percent of its service but the last miles of this marathon will be the hardest some devastated areas around homestead have not even been surveyed for damage yet , though company officials are working on the assumption that destruction there was total today , more than 140 , 000 customers in south florida were still waiting for service some may have to wait two months or more even then , all the usual safeguards and backup systems will not be in place for months , leaving the whole electrical system vulnerable to annoying problems in even minor storms right now , we are building a fragile system , said larry taylor , vice president in charge of power delivery he noted that south florida s rainy season is just beginning and that power demands are at their peak , with temperatures routinely soaring into the 90 s it s like a house of cards , mr taylor said a good lightning storm that would usually just leave you with a little flicker now will be able to black out a whole area the summer squalls that stuck florida last saturday were a case in point some residents whose power had been restored were left in the dark for the second time in less than a week getting the electricity back on is the power company s first priority , but it is hardly the only one restoration of the entire system will not be completed for at least six months once power is restored , workers must go back and examine bent poles and damaged equipment to see if they , too , must be repaired or replaced we 've got one section that runs about six miles long where there is damage to every single pole , mr taylor said that is 60 to 70 50ton structures that are bent and twisted up some whole lines are all listing 5 or 10 degrees there s miles of that some can stand for now , but we 'll have to get to it later the cost of restoring service to the level that existed the day before hurricane andrew is not yet known but it is clearly staggering the only financial discussions that i have had so far have been about our insurance , james l broadhead , the utility s chief executive officer , said thursday other than that , so far we have just been in a war where the enemy is sending wave after wave of soldiers to the ramparts and we are just trying to beat them back we just have n't had time to total anything up when the company does add up its losses , most will be probably be covered florida power and light is insured for 350 million against damage to its transmission and distribution systems the damaged generating plants at turkey point and cutler are covered for 6 billion the utility s 20 million deductible will be paid from a 70 million storm fund kept for that purpose , mr broadhead said
vernon , nj , aug 6 the only heavy trucks and buses that have hurtled down route 515 recently into this small mountain community were in the nightmares of local emergency workers police patrols have kept vehicles weighing more than four tons off route 515 since a gasoline tanker truck and a chartered bus , in separate accidents occurring within 10 days in july , went out of control on the steep mountain road and crashed with awful results on the outskirts of vernon , near the new york state border but it is difficult to erase the terrible memories of mangled men , women and children from the minds of the volunteer rescue workers who rushed to help them , though psychologists are trying to do just that scenes of horror the psychologists came to vernon to help more than 100 firefighters , emergency medical workers and police officers in the township cope with scenes of horror and feelings of powerlessness that many of them felt after the two accidents were cleared and everyone went home popular realitybased television shows about emergency workers do not have unhappy endings the victims are rescued and the rescuers never cry but in vernon last month , the reality was that a lot of people were hurt , some died and rescuers were left both proud and heartbroken new jersey is one of 28 states that in recent years has created criticalincidence stress debriefing teams that can move quickly to assist emergency workers traumatized by disasters and other troubling events parts of 16 other states have similar teams talking out feelings the idea behind the teams , composed mostly of volunteers with backgrounds in psychology , therapy and emergency work , is that people exposed to extreme stress can escape serious emotional disorders if they are assisted in talking out their feelings in the days after the trauma otherwise , such normal reactions as interrupted sleep , substance abuse , indecisiveness and flashbacks can lead to persistent personal turmoil these lessons were learned , in large part , by the military after vietnam and more recently by professional police and fire departments that have organizational support systems to combat job stress members of volunteer departments tend to go their separate ways until their lives are interrupted by emergencies , and few volunteer fire departments and rescue squads ever confront the degree of stress those in the vernon area had to handle twice in 10 days none of us ever saw anything like the magnitude of the bus crash as we drove up and people were crawling on the road toward us with missing arms and horrible wounds and burns , said paul mele of the vernon ambulance service six passengers died and 48 others aboard the bus , including children and young adults , were injured in the july 29 accident investigators said bad brakes were a factor in the accident in some ways , the july 16 crash of the gasoline truck , whose cause has yet to be determined , was a more difficult emotional experience for some of the firefighters and rescue squad members who worked at both crashes in that accident , with 9 , 000 gallons of volatile gasoline puddling on the ground and streaming into a nearby brook , rescuers were prevented from cutting open the truck s crushed cab to remove the injured driver because the slightest spark could have meant a conflagration by the time the area was made safe hours later , the driver , michael scotto , 25 , of brooklyn , was dead 'would 've given anything' personally , i would 've given anything to save that guy , said cal farber , the owner of a local welding business and head of the vernon fire department s hazardous material unit veron is better prepared than most volunteer departments the company owns 250 , 000 of special equipment to combat dangerous spills and has a contract with the nearby railroad line to handle accidents in which volatile chemicals and gasses are present it was a really tough call , said mr farber , to pull everyone back to clean up the area first before we dared use power tools or anything that would have caused a spark dr jeffrey t mitchell , clinical associate professor of emergency health services at the university of maryland who helped establish criticalincidence debriefing teams in the east , said that standing by unable to help a slowly dying victim might be one of the most stressful events in a rescue worker s life we usually see higher numbers of emergency workers with this type of experience develop fullblown posttraumatic stress disorders than even those exposed to more horrific accidents , dr mitchell said the experience was compounded for the vernon squads by criticism that they had not tried hard enough to save the dying truck driver in fact , several area truck drivers were holding a small demonstration on route 515 several hundred feet away when the bus crashed on july 29 the crash site is about six miles north of route 23 , and the last three miles of route 515 is a steep , twisting twolane road that drops from a treecovered ridge line into this crossroads community the gasoline tanker and the bus crashed within 50 feet of one another at the intersection with breakneck road , which angles off to hidden valley ski resort burst into flames the tour bus , carrying families from brooklyn to action park , a nearby amusement park , hit a car , rolled over several times and slammed into another car before stopping upright on the roadway passengers thrown from the bus lay dazed on the pavement as others struggled to get out of it and the smoking engine burst into flames ten days earlier , the gasoline truck driven by mr scotto smashed a car trying to enter route 515 from breakneck road and then plunged down a wooded ravine one spark and the whole mountain would 've gone up boom ! said mr mele , 26 , one of the first rescuers to reach the scene we could hear him but could n't find him , said mr mele , who with a firefighter descended into the ravine to determine the driver s condition the cab was plowed under the chassis and the truck tank it like was getting a ball of metal foil and rolling it up with him inside it i talked with him his main concern was getting out i asked him what hurt he was very vague he was obviously in shock fire officials , knowing that one cup of gasoline and its fumes can pack the punch of dynamite , feared that a spark could kill everyone in the vicinity mr farber , the hazardous materials unit leader , had to make the call to move everyone back until the gasoline threat was neutralized that did not occur until nearly dawn , too late to save mr scotto , who died , apparently well before midnight both mr farber and mr mele still looked drawn and tired this week you wonder , said mr farber , a barrelchested man in faded blue jeans and cowboy boots , if it was possible that some other decision was possible mr mele joined other volunteers in a counseling session , mr farber did not mr farber knows from his training he was right , but the wondering goes on nearly a month after the truck accident he is still uncertain if he should see the team of psychologists about the turmoil that persists in his mind
orlando , fla , nov 11 already and forever , shaquille o'neal has provided telling moments of what could be the impossible whirl in the paint that creates space in a human forest , the ballistic extension that erases a sure layup , the postup move that overtakes a defender like a tidal wave in those instants , any of the doubts about how the 20yearold would do in the national basketball association simply fall away in the imagination , he becomes a player for the ages , surpassing even the current ewingrobinsonolajuwon axis the historical company of bill russell , wilt chamberlain and kareem abduljabbar seems more suitable only three games into the new season , the orlando magic s 7foot1inch , 303pound center has further pushed the envelope of what is possible for a professional basketball player most experts agree that never before in the history of the sport has so much size , strength and agility been wrapped up in one package 'a truly unique player' shaq s got an explosiveness that no one that big has ever had , said pete newell , the 77yearold yoda of the game , who tutored o'neal at his preseason camp for centers and forwards he has a chance to be a truly unique player but great art lies in the details and , despite his granitelike 10 percent body fat , it is o'neal s burden that he is still eons away from being sculpted into a finished work for all his raw gifts , he is foul prone , a poor freethrow shooter , unsure in his recognition of defenses , a mediocre passer and lacks a breadandbutter offensive move those current shortcomings likely will keep the magic from immediately turning into a 500 team , and makes team officials quick to keep expectations understated they point out that o'neal is surrounded by young players , that centers traditionally develop slowly and that none of the other top centers that have come into the league in the last decade ralph sampson , hakeem olajuwon , patrick ewing , david robinson and brad daugherty have won a championship he has already made us a much better team , but the process is going to take time , said magic general manager pat williams , who negotiated o'neal s sevenyear , 40 million contract our job is just to keep a lid on all this , not expect instant results , and let shaq be who is going to be at new jersey on saturday who o'neal is right now is seductive after three games , he is averaging 23 points and 153 rebounds for the magic , who will try to raise their record to 31 thursday at home against washington before traveling to new jersey to play the nets on saturday night the following saturday , nov 21 , o'neal will give metropolitan new york fans another dose when orlando visits the knicks at madison square garden veteran opponents , who are normally slow with superlatives , have been uninhibited there is no doubt he is going to be a monster , said miami heat center rony seikaly , who guarded o'neal in a loss to orlando last friday that s like the understatement he palms the ball like a grapefruit he s as big as mark eaton , and seven times as quick and he s only 20 give me a break o'neal has heard the praise , and felt the respect on the court removing his size 20 basketball shoes in the magic locker room , he said he is happy with his decision to leave after his junior year at louisana state university , where he was beginning to feel his game was stagnating in the face of zone defenses and tripleteaming yeah , i definitely feel more suited to the pro games , he said in college they would n't let me do anything when i would post a guy up , he would throw down a little marlon brando act and referees would make a call against me up here , the players are more my size , and they let you play more physically a numbers game it s about as close to being boastful as o'neal comes these days one of his priorities is to blend with his teammates , no easy task while carrying a sevenyear , 40 million contract that required other players to restructure their pay for the magic to remain under the league s salary cap but the no 1 pick in the lottery and his representatives helped the magic by working to hammer out an agreement before the start of training camp and o'neal also resolved an awkward situation by deferring to veteran terry catledge and surrendering the no 33 jersey that he was originally told he would wear o'neal took no 32 , saying , a number s not important he was brought up with discipline and respect , and shaq knows you have to respect your teammates to get their respect , said newell for a kid 20 years old , he is incredibly mature he likes basketball , he wants to play it a long time , and that is a big plus he has a good work ethic , he picks things up quickly , and he s got ambition that attitude has been reflected in o'neal s work in practice , where he runs the court hard , sometimes diving for loose balls , and takes instruction attentively he knows he is going to make mistakes , but he also knows he is building toward something that is going to take time , said magic coach matt goukas we want shaq to be as sound a player as possible , and he knows that being as good as you can be does n't come with shortcuts at the end of practices , o'neal works with shooting coach buzz braman , a freethrow wizard who once made 738 in a row at lsu , o'neal shot 57 percent from the line , but braman firmly believes he will be a 75 percent shooter in the pros he has a great attitude , particularly considering the brink s truck he just unloaded , said braman right now , he is learning why he misses he now knows that about 70 percent of his misses are occurring on his second free throw , which he shoots while stepping back , which kills consistency he realizes that he is going to be living at that freethrow line , so it has to become a friend having it his way for three quarters on tuesday night against the charlotte hornets , the whole court was o'neal s friend against the 68 kenny gattison and the 69 j r reid , o'neal was having his way on both ends of the court after three quarters , he had 35 points and 10 rebounds i do n't think even he knows how strong he is , said gattison he s so agile , he just goes where he pleases darn , he threw my stuff to tampa , said reid after the game , in reference to two aweinspiring blocks o'neal administered he is a big boy but when the fourth quarter came , o'neal looked slightly lost he had trouble getting his position in the low post , and rushed three shots when he did he failed to score in the final quarter as the magic lost , 112108 it was a performance somewhat reminiscent of games at lsu where o'neal dominated , but the team did n't win we 're making a big mistake if we are going to put all our eggs in shaq s basket , said orlando guard scott skiles after the game even though we see him do some amazing things , he is going to have periods during games where he is not doing the right things we ca n't ask a 20yearold to carry us o'neal agreed with that assessment , and looked forward to the next game i played pretty good , i have no excuses , he said i just want to be part of the team and help us win it s going to be a long season , and a long career photo shaquille o'neal , who has averaged 23 points and 153 rebounds in his first three games for the magic , scoring against charlotte \( ben van hook for the new york times \)
washington , jan 25 six democratic presidential candidates met with the rev jesse jackson s national rainbow coalition today , hoping to tap the grassroots support that fueled mr jackson s own 1988 bid for the nomination but if any hoped to capture the whole rainbow , he was disappointed , as support was fragmented all the candidates had a similar message but spent considerable time trying to demonstrate their differences , and that led to some prickly responses gov bill clinton of arkansas was booed when he spoke in support of righttowork laws edmund g brown jr , former governor of california , swiped at mr clinton by calling for a moment of silence for a man whom the governor allowed to be executed in arkansas on friday night and senator bob kerrey of nebraska got enthusiastic applause for his national health care plan paul e tsongas , the former senator from massachusetts , outlined his toughlove economic message senator tom harkin of iowa captivated the audience with his unabashedly liberal oratory , and eugene mccarthy , the former senator from wisconsin , told charming stories of his previous runs for president thoughts on candidates among the roughly 500 delegates , there were those who said they liked the message of mr brown but said they did not think he was electable others said they thought mr clinton looked and sounded presidential but wondered if questions about his personal life could harm him in voters' eyes still others said they thought that senator kerrey , with his emphasis on health care and his personal attractiveness , looked like a winner but as mr jackson pointed out , immediate support was not the reason for the forum the coalition will not endorse any particular candidate , though mr jackson said he would endorse a candidate at some point in the future this is the broadest based forum the candidates can appear before , mr jackson said here you have mayors of big cities and small , women , hispanics , gays , native americans asking the questions these are the people who have to be energized and i think there has been a message gap in the debates my sense is that people are looking for concrete plans panel questions candidates each of the candidates gave a short speech and was then questioned by a panel of labor , civic and education experts and officials the forum was held in an auditorium at the omni shoreham hotel here mr brown got a standing ovation for his support of statehood for the district of columbia and his suggestion that mr jackson would make a good running mate but afterward several delegates who said they agreed with many of mr brown s views expressed doubt that he could be elected i like brown s philosophy , but , really , who is going to vote for him \? said mel fallis , a vice president of marketing for american visions magazine mr clinton s presentation was upbeat and appeared to capture the audience s attention , until he ran into criticism for his positions on a middleclass tax cut , the death penalty and support for righttowork laws mr clinton defended his support for a tax cut for middleclass taxpayers , saying that only by expanding the middle class could the poor be helped and he seemed to win the sympathy of the audience when he talked about his emotional turmoil when he decided to allow the execution of rickey ray rector , a black mentally impaired murderer , to proceed mr clinton , however , ran afoul of some members of the audience when he said he would not oppose righttowork laws he said that the issue was divisive and that it was one of the reasons that democrats had not won recent presidential elections a handful of people stood up and booed and then walked out of the hall he can forget about support from trade unionists , said ron richardson , vice president of the hotel employees restaurant employees international union , who had asked the question mr kerrey , who spoke about education , health care and his experience in the vietnam war , appeared to win the most enthusiasm from the audience his platform is more about my concerns , said andre thompson , from glen arden , md , who said he was put off by mr clinton s smooth delivery he s too plastic mr tsongas gave his economic bootstrapping message , something that appealed to christine welch , a representative of the american federation of government employees he s truthful , she said he s upfront mr harkin lashed out at republicans in general and president bush in particular , promising that if he won the democratic nomination he would not hold mr bush s feet to the fire in the general election campaign i'm going to put his feet in fire , he said , adding , i'm going to make them accountable for the despair and the depression we have in the land mr harkin also took mr clinton to task on his record on issues like education , civil rights and employment he said mr kerrey was for health care , but none of his employees have it by the end of his speech , some of the delegates were chanting the senator s name annette rainwater of detroit said she was leaning toward senator harkin but had not made up her mind something is missing , i do n't know what , ms rainwater said maybe i'm looking for the excitement i had with jesse but when the dust settles , i think i 'll be going with a winner photo edmund g brown jr , right , democratic candidate for president , greeting mayor david n dinkins and representative charles b rangel , center , before the national rainbow coalition meeting in washington \( george tames for the new york times \)

chicago , sept 20 in their first game this season , the giants allowed 31 points to the san francisco 49ers in their second , they gave up 34 points to the dallas cowboys in their third game , monday night against the bears , their defense might be in trouble again , even though the bears are not that explosive or even necessarily that good the giants' defense is not what it was in the glory years of the last decade it is getting old , individually and as a unit its tackling is sometimes shoddy , and tackling has more to do with intensity than age rod rust , the team s new defensive coordinator , is teaching new defensive techniques to complement the old , and he has not been especially successful the old dogs do n't want to learn new tricks and seem to spend as much energy repudiating the new defense as mastering it and by football standards , the old dogs , while not creaking , are still aging of the usual defensive starters or parttime starters , lawrence taylor is 33 , everson walls 32 , perry williams 31 and leonard marshall and carl banks 30 some defensive regulars , including taylor and walls , have lost speed or quickness or both some are probably playing their last seasons i see it , said harry carson , the former pro bowl inside linebacker for the giants i see them getting older , and older players are more hesitant to stick their nose in there and really hit people older guys know that when they throw their bodies around , they get hurt and get concussions younger guys do n't have that regard for their body i see guys not being as quick , not getting off blocks i do n't think any of them are as fast as they were , and i think artificial turf has something to do with it artificial turf takes a toll on your knees , ankles and toes , so you do n't maintain the same kind of speed and quickness as younger players walls , in his 12th season as a national football league defensive back , defended the defense i do n't see signs of aging , he said i think guys are making plays the same as they did john washington , a 29yearold defensive lineman , disagreed we 're aging , washington said but last year , we had a lot of injuries on defense last year , erik howard missed 10 games because of an ailing back , eric dorsey missed five because of arthroscopic knee surgery , and washington , banks and taylor were slowed by injuries but the year before , when banks and mark collins suffered major injuries , the giants went on to win the super bowl 'there s no mystery' there s no mystery , said steve deossie , the 29yearold inside linebacker we have a bunch of older guys out there i prefer to call it experience rather than age call it what you will , but the defense is aging that is partly because the giants , since the 1986 draft that brought dorsey , johnson , collins , howard and washington on the first three rounds , have drafted mostly for offense they did draft promising young defensive players in kanavis mcghee , corey miller and lamar mcgriggs last year and phillippi sparks , keith hamilton and george rooks and corey widmer this year , but none seem ready for primetime duty mcghee is much improved , but his pass rush is sometimes ineffective miller , a former inside linebacker , is still learning to play outside mcgriggs has sometimes been out of position in the new defensive schemes preseason injuries have set back sparks , although he may become a starter by next year but ready or not , some of these young players may be thrown into the lineup soon if the giants lose to the bears and the los angeles raiders in their next two games , their record will be 04 the team s management may then be tempted to trade or waive one or more aging player on the theory that it will get a young player on the field sooner and , at the same time , send a message to other older players these giants may survive their defensive shortcomings if they accept rust s new defensive schemes from the start of training camp , they have had nine weeks to work on it they are still learning , but they are still fighting it , still hoping to go back to the old bill parcells bill belichick rock'em , sock'em defense that defense remains in the giants' playbook , and it was highly successful in the second half against the cowboys but the new parts of the defense the requirement that linebackers and defensive backs read the offense before they react have not come easily the players feel their hands are being tied , that they are not being allowed to do what they do best each week , the defensive game plan incorporates parts of the old and the new the players want more of the old they want to see taylor rushing the passer more instead of dropping back in pass coverage , for instance they feel they cannot make big plays , and the giants' defense has always thrived on big plays the defense believed in belichick when he left before last season to become head coach of the cleveland browns , al groh succeeded him , and many defenders felt groh made the defense too complicated now , they feel rust is not letting them play the physical defense they think they need in their division ray handley , the head coach , hired rust and says he believes in rust and his teaching i know what i expect of the players and the system , handley said we 're not asking the players to do something they 're not capable of doing it s not a system breakdown carson said he had little sympathy for complaining giants they 're making excuses , he said they 're not being responsible if you 're not playing well , fess up to it and do n't keep blaming the scheme no system is going to work unless you hustle and tackle , deossie said you have to throw yourself around the way we did in the second half against the cowboys pepper johnson , the other inside linebacker , agreed it s not like high school or college , he said , where you win 9 or 10 games with a defense that just holds its own you have to do things on defense , and we have n't been doing them they have not been doing them because , so far , the defense rests photos giants' jim burt knocking the 49ers' joe montana out of the game during the playoffs after the 1986 season

when the final buzzer sounded , everyone in madison square garden was staring at the referees , who had gathered in a huddle at midcourt if xavier mcdaniel s 20footer had beaten the buzzer , a sensational game was going into overtime if mcdaniel s shot was ruled late , the knicks would lose finally , after about 10 seconds , referee darell garretson waved his arm , ruling that mcdaniel s shot was no good mcdaniel fell to the court in disappointment while the los angeles lakers hugged one another in jubilation after an emotional 106104 victory last night both teams and the capacity crowd of 19 , 763 will remember this game for a long time a game with everything it had everything spectacular plays , superb individual performances , and controversy but in the end , it was a heartbreaking loss for the knicks \( 3924 \) , who saw their fourgame winning streak come to a disappointing end lakers' point guard sedale threatt finished with a careerhigh 42 points , including 22 points in the third quarter this loss was like taking one through the heart , said knicks coach pat riley but it was a great game sam perkins of the lakers made the winning basket , a 25foot 3pointer from behind the key with 23 seconds remaining the play was set up by threatt , who drove to the basket on mark jackson , forcing patrick ewing to leave perkins and help jackson with two defenders on him , threatt passed to a wideopen perkins , who caught the ball and had time to set his feet i was so far out there , i did n't know where i was , perkins said i just stepped back , took my time , and hit the shot i felt great but somehow , the knicks almost tied it charles oakley inbounded to jackson , who passed to mcdaniel who was streaking downcourt mcdaniel stopped and let his shot go , but television replays showed that mcdaniel had not released the ball when the clock struck 0 00 , supporting the referees' decision that the shot was late neither riley nor mcdaniel seriously disputed the call no complaint if the referees say it was no good , it was no good , mcdaniel said i did n't have time to look at the clock you ca n't cry over spilled milk when told that the replays supported the referees , riley said well , that s good , it was very close to tell you truth , i did n't think we 'd even get that kind of a shot off had the lakers lost , they would have been upset about a controversial foul called against threatt with 116 seconds remaining with the knicks trailing by 1 point , jackson threw in an errant pass to john starks in the right corner as starks tried to save the ball , threatt and starks made contact threatt was called for a foul , and starks made both free throws to give new york a 104103 lead it was a tough call , but he pushed me , starks said but that was one of the few things threatt did wrong all night threatt found himself in one of those special zones when it seems like the rim has expanded to twice its normal size and every shot that goes up will find its way in threatt is a streak shooter , but unlike some streak shooters , his shot can be deadly either from a standstill , or off the dribble the knicks tried four different defenders on threatt , bu none could contain him for one night , threatt was magic , said lakers coach mike dunleavy , referring to magic johnson ewing \( who had 37 points \) was distraught at missing two free throws with 528 seconds left that could have given new york a 1point lead on the second shot , i leaned back and that made it fall short , ewing said to be honest with you , i do n't even remember the first free throw i'm very disappointed it was the kind of game a fan would love to have taped with his vcr , but the knicks probably would want to erase the ending for the lakers \( 3229 \) , it was their eighth consecutive victory in new york , and probably their most special we hit the big shots , dunleavy said threatt was incredible he really put the show on and the show ended a second too soon for the knicks rebounds do you think the lakers \( 3229 \) like playing teams from the new york area \? last night s victory was only the lakers' third in their last 14 games two have come against the knicks and the other against the nets the earlier victory against the knicks was a low point for new york that time the knicks managed 68 points , a franchise low with the shot clock james worthy , the lakers' allstar forward , missed his fourth consecutive game and was placed on the injured list because of persistent swelling in his left knee the lakers are unsure when worthy will return photo the knicks' xavier mcdaniel lying on the court after the referee ruled his shot late the basket would have sent the game into overtime as patrick ewing left the court , sedale threatt \( 3 \) and sam perkins \( 14 \) of the lakers rejoiced the lakers' sedale threatt , who scored 42 points , taking a shot in the second half \( barton silverman the new york times \)
denver , oct 28 trying to put his populist campaign back on track , ross perot used a rocky mountain stemwinder tonight to rally his troops , to assert that president bush is the candidate who cannot win and to declare that he and his supporters had revolutionized american politics the hourlong speech to a wildly enthusiastic crowd of about 5 , 000 supporters here had a sharper edge than previous ones by mr perot , whose campaign has been notable for its efforts to stay on the issues and away from attacks on his rivals mr perot repeatedly portrayed mr bush as a washedup candidate and ridiculed gov bill clinton s experience as a smallstate governor mr perot made only passing reference to the firestorm he created last weekend by accusing the republicans of plotting a campaign of dirty tricks against him new questions arose today when the dallas morning news reported that mr perot had encouraged the dallas police to ensnare the texas chairman of the bushquayle campaign , jim oberwetter , in a sting operation the chief of police , bill rathburn , and the general counsel of the perot campaign , clayton mulford , denied the charges defending his integrity mr perot did not directly address either that article or the criticism he has received for charging , without substantiation , that the bush campaign was planning to smear his daughter , carolyn , by releasing a doctored photograph of her and by disrupting her august wedding there s an interesting thing happening this week that i just find fascinating , mr perot said day after day after day , somebody comes up with some excuse to attack my integrity my integrity is a matter of record my integrity was never questioned until the republican dirty tricks guys started after it in june but , since we 're talking about polls , i think you will find it interesting people are taking polls and they find the american people believe me and do n't believe bush and so their solution is to intensify the attack let me just say this it s all silly putty it s nothing to do with anything that concerns the american people and i just look at it and marvel the rally took on a convention atmosphere , vibrant with chants of we want ross and shaking placards , when mr perot issued a simple declaration let me just go on record one time tonight we can win ! no gloves on now mr perot dropped any pretense of avoiding personal attacks you 've got one candidate from a rural state whose principal industry is raising chickens , he said you 've got another candidate whose philosophy is if you do n't do anything , things will get better you 've got two candidates who were funded and paid for by pac money , foreign lobbyists and special interests and your candidate does n't belong to anybody but you in an unusual display of public selfcongratulation , mr perot also paid tribute to how quickly he had changed the practice of politics win , lose or draw , we could probably get a television series next year , mr perot said , commenting on the large and loyal audiences drawn by his 30minute presentations on the networks had you noticed that dan quayle was using charts on the larry king show last night \? you realize none of those fellas ever went on these onehour talk shows until just this year they thought i was crazy they finally figured out that it was free the report in today s the dallas morning news quoted unidentified sources as saying that mr perot had james j siano , a private investigator , meet with chief rathburn in august to urge that the police try to lure mr oberwetter into buying documents purported to be stolen from mr perot s office bush aide threatens lawsuit after speaking with mr perot by telephone on tuesday night , chief rathburn confirmed meeting with mr siano but denied discussing a sting operation when mr siano told him of mr perot s suspicions that the bush campaign had planned to tap his phones , chief rathburn said , he directed mr siano to the federal bureau of investigation the dallas office of the fbi later set up an unsuccessful sting operation against mr oberwetter mr oberwetter today called on mr perot to apologize and threatened legal action i'm chapped like riding a horse all day , he said trying to soothe the animosity between mr bush and mr perot , senator bob dole , the republican minority leader , spoke to both men by phone on tuesday , said walt riker , mr dole s press secretary he did not say whether mr dole felt he had succeeded strength in the west mr perot s rally here was only the third of his campaign , which began anew on oct 1 but his aides announced that he also would campaign in tampa and kansas city , mo , on saturday and in both northern and southern california on sunday the day before election day , he will wrap up his campaign with a lunchtime rally in dallas recent polls show that colorado is mr perot s strongest state and that he could finish second there the places where mr perot is given the best chances , according to a survey published today in the campaign hotline , an electronic newsletter , are alaska , colorado , connecticut , the district of columbia , hawaii , maine , massachusetts , montana , oregon , rhode island , and wisconsin mr perot will appear on either network or cable television every night until the election , either on interview shows or in halfhour presentations he has paid for himself
tie domi had been invited by the rangers' coaching staff to dress for only 12 hockey games this season , but the right wing represented something that went well beyond his two goals and no assists domi , with impudent swagger and 95 penalty minutes , liked to think of himself as a true heavyweight , one of the last honorable pugilists in the national hockey league but yesterday , the rangers traded domi and another popular , tough forward , kris king , to the winnipeg jets for ed olczyk , a pure scorer who is unlikely to tangle with bob probert or anybody else neil smith , the rangers' general manager , said he traded domi because he needed more skill players to beat the champion pittsburgh penguins , and because stricter rules this season had rendered domi all but obsolete domi went out punching , as always , blaming ranger assistant coach colin campbell for his departure and possibly planting the seeds for dissension colin campbell is negative toward the players here , said domi he turned on me , and suddenly i did n't play for 10 games the same thing happened to mike richter and phil bourque i did n't get the opportunity to show i could play , and it came to the point where i had to be asked to be moved campbell denied he had anything to do with domi s trade , saying i do n't have those powers if i did , i 'd be paid a lot more campbell said he had sat down with domi two weeks ago and lectured him after sensing that the player was giving up i spent more time with tie in two and a half years here than i did with any other player , said campbell it s called tough love a shooter , not a playmaker the 26yearold olczyk , a perennial 30goal scorer who will never be confused for a playmaker , is expected to play left wing for the rangers he is a lefthanded shooter , so he does not completely answer all of the team s needs for its foundering power play he also is not an offensive defenseman , arguably the rangers' greatest need but smith said that his team must stockpile skill players at all positions in its pursuit of the pittsburgh penguins , and that olczyk would give the team more flexibility on the ice and in the trade market there s a lot more skill and a faster tempo in our division , and we have to keep pace , smith said our sport is changing , and we 're going to have to change and adjust to it with all due respect to everybody , smith said , tie could n't get into our lineup you can be popular , but you have to be able to dress for games i did n't think tie would serve much of a purpose the way we were using him this did not make the deal any easier for smith or coach roger neilson , both of whom had personal attachments to domi , 23 , and king , 26 smith had signed both players to their original contracts , and thought enough about domi to offer him a retroactive fouryear , 16 million pact before the start of this season neilson liked king s presence in the locker room , where he was deeply respected by the players kris king was a very loyal player and a leader , neilson said he always came up big in the playoffs i think i took this one tougher than kris the times are changing but neilson , known in the past for his desire to field a physical lineup , agreed that the time had come to rethink past philosophies this year , the legislation has scared off players , and all of a sudden there s very little fighting , neilson said there s none in the playoffs , either , so it did n't make sense to carry both tie and joey kocur the ranger lineup is still infused with enforcers and tough guys , including kocur , adam graves , jeff beukeboom and jay wells the jets , however , had nobody to protect their more valuable players recently , rookie teemu selanne had been targeted for some high sticks , and john paddock , the jets' coach , was not enjoying the rinkside view he will team domi on the same line with selanne nobody is going to run around on the jets now , domi said both kinger and i would go through a wall for any team we 're on olczyk , the jets' leading scorer last season , struggled in winnipeg this season before a knee sprain forced him to miss nine games he has 8 goals and 12 assists in 25 games he said that he was honored to become a ranger , but that he would be unable to join the team until new year s eve in buffalo olczyk s motherinlaw suffered a stroke during the holiday season , and he does not want to leave his wife since entering the league in 1984 with chicago , olczyk has been traded three times , despite some impressive statistics he took the jets to salary arbitration this fall , an issue that has yet to be resolved and one that might have contributed to his departure i'm going to be nervous , olczyk said about his coming debut but i can play anywhere slap shots tie domi and kris king will return to madison square garden on jan 27 , in the only visit here by the jets this season me on the power play will shock roger neilson , king said the rangers begin a threegame road trip tonight at the capital centre against washington their three opponents washington , buffalo , and pittsburgh have a combined record of 604012 the rangers returned steven king to binghamton to further reduce their roster fans at the open practice at rye , ny , unaware of the domi trade , chanted his name when he appeared near the bench a lot of jealousy happened here because of my popularity , domi said sobering thought for domi and king it was 30 degrees below zero yesterday in winnipeg
with the 1992 presidential race in ferment once more , both parties began intensive bids for former supporters of ross perot yesterday , and a new new york times cbs news poll showed the democratic nominee , bill clinton , as the main beneficiary of the independent candidate s sudden withdrawal the survey , taken thursday evening as the democratic national convention was ending , and yesterday as the delegates began leaving town , showed mr clinton gaining the biggest postconvention bounce in the 50 years such measurements have been taken he now leads president bush among registered voters by 55 percent to 31 percent , with 13 percent undecided other flags of warning for mr bush abound in the poll , including a 63 percent disapproval rating , his highest ever among erstwhile backers of mr perot the figure is 73 percent , which is a major reason that 45 percent of perot adherents now say they will back mr clinton and only 26 percent say they will vote for mr bush wooing the working class joe madden , a maintenance supervisor in hometown , ill , a workingclass suburb southwest of chicago , offers a telling example of a democrat at heart who was stolen away by the republicans many elections ago i feel he s going to bring the country together , mr madden said of mr clinton today we 're deep in the hole if he can do half of what he said , four years from now we 'll be a much better country page 8 still , mr clinton scoffed at the latest polls with the comment , we came to fight until november he set off from new york at once in pursuit of crucial rust belt votes , forgoing a vacation like the one former gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts took after his nomination in 1988 ronald h brown , the democratic national chairman , said there would be no hiatus between now and november and no going off to a distant site to figure out strategy fresh appeal from bush ending a brief fishing holiday in wyoming , the president issued a fresh appeal to the perot camp , telling the texan s backers do n't run away from the system i hear you , and you come through loud and clear there were no signs of any move by mr perot s volunteer coordinators to try to deliver his support to any other candidate , despite his tantalizing reference to a revitalized democratic party managers of perot operations in at least 30 states headed for dallas for a meeting today to consider what to do next , and several said they would urge mr perot to reconsider the times cbs news poll may have caught the democratic nominee at a highwater mark it was taken in a shorter time , with a somewhat smaller sample \( and a higher margin of sampling error \) than most times cbs news surveys in only a month , moreover , the president , not mr clinton , will be at the center of attention as the republican national convention opens in houston , with former president ronald reagan as the main firstnight speaker between now and then , the white house will open the throttle on its attack machine in the campaigns of the last decade the advantage produced by intensive convention coverage has often proved ephemeral in 1984 , former vice president walter f mondale registered a doubledigit gain that gave him a tenuous lead , but he fell back after a week four years later mr dukakis jumped to a 17point lead , but that vanished by the time the republican convention had ended still , the new figures suggest how steep a mountain mr bush must climb to win a second term in modern times harry s truman , lyndon b johnson , richard m nixon and jimmy carter have experienced the kind of unpopularity the poll shows for mr bush now only mr truman managed to win another term after hitting the skids robert m teeter , mr bush s campaign chairman , called the results of the times cbs poll and others very artificial but a sense of foreboding spread among some republicans , beginning with the president s intimation on thursday that he might yet summon secretary of state james a baker 3d to head his campaign a republican senator from the west , speaking on condition of anonymity , said it was conceivable , if things continued to deteriorate , that the renomination of vice president dan quayle something that has been taken as a certainty within the party could be jeopardized but as mr clinton and his running mate , senator al gore of tennessee , began a ninestate , fiveday bus trip that will end in st louis , mr quayle was busy with damage control stumping in kentucky , mississippi and florida , he mocked mr clinton s acceptance speech and said the democrat would raise your taxes mr quayle met in louisville , ky , with local officials of the defunct perot campaign but won no pledge of support still , he urged voters unhappy with the status quo , like perot backers , to cast votes not only for mr bush but also for a republican senate we 're the ones who can change things if we can change the congress , mr quayle said he also said he was sure he would stay on the ticket the times cbs news poll involved 615 adults , of whom 477 were registered voters the margin of sampling error was plus or minus five percentage points for registered voters it showed a bounce of 24 percentage points for mr clinton , compared with 9 points for mr dukakis in 1988 , 16 for mr mondale in 1984 and 17 for mr carter in 1980 earlier candidates have benefited from the same phenomenon adlai e stevenson got a 21point lift after the 1952 democratic convention but never before has one candidate pulled out of a race just as another was being nominated , and that may have affected the results of the survey in the last times cbs news poll before the convention , which was taken july 811 , mr clinton tied with mr bush at 43 percent thus the new 24point lead for the democrat represents a 24point bounce , composed of a 12point gain for him and a simultaneous 12point loss for the president for the first time this year , a preponderance of the respondents to a times cbs news poll said they expected mr bush to lose , regardless of how they intended to vote as recently as april , 68 percent of those taking part in such a survey said they believed the president would be reelected in the latest study , many perot backers said they felt jilted by their hero seventy percent said he should have stayed in the race , 58 percent said he had just walked away before he accomplished much , and 41 percent said they believed he had deserted them not surprisingly , perot voters are unenthusiastic about either of the majorparty candidates , the survey found only 16 percent have a favorable view of the president , and only 12 percent have a favorable view of mr clinton but mr bush has the higher negatives 54 percent of the perot voters see him in unfavorable terms , compared with 32 percent who hold a jaundiced view of mr clinton perhaps significantly , 29 percent offered no opinion about mr bush and 57 percent offered none about mr clinton , which suggests that both men still have much to play for it also suggests that a large number of the perot backers might well end up staying at home in november , as many of them have reported doing in most of the recent presidential elections the bleakest figures for mr bush in the entire survey are his job ratings among all voters , 30 percent approve and 63 percent disapprove among perot supporters , only 22 percent approve and 73 percent disapprove the last president with such a low figure was mr carter , who in july 1980 had a 33 percent job approval figure in the gallup poll four months later

to the editor as a ghanaian , i am dismayed by partners in the slave trade , \( oped , july 10 \) by caroline alexander ms alexander is correct to assert that slavery existed in africa before the arrival of whites but by pushing her argument to the extreme , rather than correcting common misperceptions , she has helped perpetuate a false picture of one of history s greatest criminal enterprises my country stands in stark contrast to her prevailing image of whites waiting benignly offshore while deep in the interior , in places like equatorial africa , indigenous slave traders were generating the bulk of the continent s human export not those farflung outposts , but coastal west africa and the adjacent savannahland in places like ghana and presentday benin , togo and nigeria , supplied most of the black peoples who now populate the americas in ghana one can still find the ruins of some 50 forts and elaborate castles that line a 300mile coastline these most eloquently attest to a much greater white involvement than ms alexander suggests in generating and transforming , if not exclusively operating or dominating the slave trade the earliest of these forts , elmina el mina , or the mine was established by the portuguese in 1481 , and was likely visited by columbus before his voyage to the americas these fortifications served as powerful magnets for the slave trade , an effect further strengthened by the exchange of guns , cloth and other early industrial goods but not gold as ms alexander suggests , because it was this area , known as the gold coast , that supplied european coffers from its rich alluvial mines the strong commercial incentives to coastal peoples to produce slaves also dramatically transformed the nature of slavery in africa no slavery is defensible , to be sure , but african slavery had often been a matter of warfare and conquest between rival neighboring kingdoms the slave trade as practiced by the europeans was strictly mercantile typically , healthy males were all they desired once their bondage was consummated , there was almost never any avenue toward freedom short of revolt contrast this to the females left behind , who married into conquering ethnic groups , traumatizing for themselves certainly , but leaving none of the deep historical stigmas for their children that we can see in the descendants of american slaves even today koffi avouka agnes coral gables , fla , july 14 , 1992 drawing
after spending almost two weeks on the road and traveling back from minnesota to new york in the early hours of the morning , roger neilson of the rangers did what any reasonable coach would have done yesterday he got up early and went back to work before noon he viewed videotape and read scouting reports he answered the telephone in the team s headquarters had the team practiced , he might have driven the zamboni to resurface the ice when a team is as hot as the rangers , work is play and who wants to stop \? neilson s rangers are on a remarkable run they concluded a fivegame western trip with a 21 victory in minnesota saturday night on the trip , the rangers went 401 in their last seven games , they are 601 they lead the patrick division by six points they have the best overall record in the league they are in relatively good health and they have a favorable schedule for the last third of the regular season their biggest challenge now is to maintain their position at the peak while awaiting the stanley cup playoffs , still two months away it s true , neilson said once you 're on top , everyone is gunning for you every game you have a tougher time your biggest test is are you good enough to stay \? we have a good schedule coming down the stretch , we have only 10 road games left no veteran coach would be without worry , and neilson said he was concerned about a slump one seems to visit every team , he said , and we have n't had one yet next game is wednesday they do n't play again until wednesday , when the pittsburgh penguins visit madison square garden of the 10 road games , four are against local rivals , the devils and islanders none are west of st louis and no trip is for more than one night in saturday night s game in minnesota , the star was john vanbiesbrouck , in goal again because mike richter is recovering from a right thigh bruise vanbiesbrouck not only made 41 saves , but also set up the winning goal , by darren turcotte , with a bounce pass off the boards that triggered a rush at 13 17 of the second period even the veteran rangers are impressed with the recent streak , which has left the team 17 games over 500 for the first time since march 1974 'turning point' obviously , this is great , said mike gartner , who leads the team in goals with 29 i do n't think i 've ever been on a team in my career when we got 9 of 10 points on a fivegame road trip we feel very , very good we 're hoping that , at the end of the season , we can look back at this as the turning point that got us into first place over all it certainly is easier for us to have achieved first place over all than to stay there , but we 're sure going to try we 're gearing up for the remainder of the season after mike modano gave minnesota a 10 lead at 8 39 of the first period , the rangers tied the score at 13 27 on a shorthanded goal by jan erixon this is unbelievable , erixon said we just hoped to play 500 hockey on this trip you ca n't do much better than this it s very exciting to be up here we 're real excited about it , but we have a lot of tough games coming up and we ca n't relax now it s going to be tough , but we think we can stay here earlier in saturday s game , officials disallowed an apparent goal by brian bellows because a videotape review showed that it was kicked in that would have made the score 20 the north stars outshot the rangers by 4222 , over all and by 206 , in the third period vanbiesbrouck preserved the tie with a glove save on brian propp with 73 seconds left leafs trip up devils toronto , feb 2 \( special to the new york times \) the devils fell behind by four goals and although they rallied for three , they never quite recovered saturday night and suffered a 64 loss to toronto at maple leaf gardens it was the devils' first loss in five games on the road the devils' undefeated stretch on the road started with a tie against the islanders before victories at pittsburgh , washington , montreal and detroit two goals by claude lemieux and one by bruce driver with less than four minutes left in the second brought the devils \( 25177 \) to within a goal , but that was the closest they could come
new york s newest united states senate candidate officially began his campaign yesterday with a jerry brownstyle appeal for volunteers to call a tollfree number and a vow to shun television commercials in his bid to oust the republican incumbent , alfonse m d'amato fortysevenyearold laurance rockefeller , who said voters should think of him as larry as much as they think of him as a rockefeller , is a political novice , an environmental lawyer with the natural resources defense council and a nephew of the late governor and vice president , nelson a rockefeller in announcing his candidacy yesterday , he pledged to spend no more than 250 , 000 of the family wealth on the campaign and he said that if he won , he would serve no more than two sixyear terms in the senate because he was bothered by the unhealthy preoccupation of many politicians with their own reelections mr rockefeller s appearance on the republican primary ballot sept 15 which will not be assured unless he and his volunteers gather 10 , 000 signatures on petitions from voters in the next two weeks adds a measure of intrigue to a primary that until now was an unopposed race given the new candidate s quiet , almost halting speaking style and his ready concession that he is no professional politician , the leg up in the contest clearly belongs to senator d'amato , who was out attacking mr rockefeller for past contributions to democrats even before mr rockefeller entered the race mr rockefeller s announcement has been expected in republican party circles for several days mr d'amato has raised 8 million for his reelection bid and has virtually all of the state party apparatus at his disposal a different course but mr rockefeller , who made announcements in manhattan and buffalo yesterday and will do so later in the week in several other cities , nonetheless predicted that he would win an upset , in part because his liberal themes and grassroots campaign represent an idea whose time has come and in part because of voter disgust with mr d'amato the republican party of recent years has veered sharply to the right , mr rockefeller said in manhattan , where he was joined at the roosevelt hotel for his campaign kickoff by his wife , wendy gordon , who heads a group called mothers and others for a livable planet it is time to reassert its progressive traditions , he said , invoking the names of such republicans as lincoln , theodore roosevelt , senator jacob k javits and his uncle nelson rockefeller a call to mr rockefeller s campaign number yesterday \( 800 tochange \) yielded a taped message from him , explaining that the recording was less expensive than live operators enrolled republicans willing to sign petitions were asked to press 1 , volunteers to press 2 and financial contributors to press 3 people calling from a rotarydial telephone were told the campaign was not equipped to handle such calls quicklearning novice mr rockefeller is strongly for abortion rights , sharply critical of what he cast as president bush s retreat on environmental principles and said he would have supported the congressional resolution authorizing the dispatch of troops to the persian gulf last year although he has never run for political office before , he did duck several questions from reporters like an old political hand for one thing , he declined to say whether he would endorse either mr d'amato , should he win the primary , or president bush , his party s standard bearer , in the general election and although he said he would air none of the traditional 30second or 60second political commercials an affront to voters' intelligence , an attempt to substitute emotion for reason he called them he hedged on whether he might buy larger blocks of television time photo laurance rockefeller , who likes to be known as larry , talking with wellwishers yesterday at the roosevelt hotel , where he celebrated the kickoff of his campaign for the united states senate \( marilynn k yee the new york times \)
the belief in a flat earth is a modern invention , a myth that reveals a good deal about the underlying dogma of an age claiming to be scientific only in the last century did the idea spread that when christopher columbus set sail he was challenging a belief , entrenched in theology and enforced by the church , that the world was flat that belief , the story goes , was questioned only by a rebellious or scientifically advanced minority none of the documents from columbus s day or the early accounts of his labors suggest that there was any debate about the roundness of the earth yet by the end of the 19th century , the drama of columbus versus the flatearth believers had become a staple of textbooks even today , although many standard histories have corrected the error , the idea that christiandom had suppressed or forgotten the greek philosophers' discovery of a spherical world remains a fixture in educated minds and regularly reemerges in the works of eminent scholars for example , a section in the discoverers , a popular book \( random house , 1983 \) by daniel j boorstin , the former librarian of congress , says that christian faith and dogma had inflicted on europe at least 1 , 000 years of amnesia about the world s shape how did such a palpable error arise , and why did it persist \? jeffrey burton russell , a professor of history at the university of california in santa barbara , has addressed this puzzle in a small gem of scholarship written for the 500th anniversary of columbus s voyage the book , inventing the flat earth \( praeger , 1991 \) , is more than an investigation into a quirk of intellectual history it effectively reverses an old question instead of asking why medieval thinkers so dogmatically insisted that the earth was flat , it says we must ask why modern thinkers , in the face of so much contrary evidence , dogmatically insisted on a flatearth consensus that never existed professor russell makes clear that whatever the conceptions of the earth s shape found in genesis and the other books of the bible , not only in antiquity but throughout the first 15 centuries of christianity , nearly unanimous scholarly opinion pronounced the earth spherical the scholars who offered that opinion included augustine , venerable bede and thomas aquinas a few figures , like the influential isidore of seville , were ambiguous on the matter , and many , of course , were not interested in geographical issues the uneducated may have entertained all sorts of vague beliefs , but that was true for the classical era as well only five christian writers , according to professor russell s scorecard , seem to have been outandout believers in a flat earth one was lactantius , a thirdcentury convert to christianity who was posthumously condemned as a heretic , although his latin style brought him renewed attention during the renaissance another was cosmas indicopleustes , a sixthcentury greek writer whose work was reviled in his own time , ignored for most of the middle ages and not even translated into latin until 1706 these two eccentrics would become the chief exhibits for the flatearth mythology of the 19th century oddly enough , a major source of that mythology was the genial american creator of rip van winkle and ichabod crane in 1828 , washington irving published a novelistic biography of columbus featuring a fictitious confrontation between the brave explorer and inquisitionridden clerics and professors from the university of salamanca they pelted columbus with quotations from the bible and church fathers to prove that the earth was flat samuel eliot morison , in his biography of columbus , calls the episode pure moonshine irving the storyteller had his academic counterpart in the french historian antoinejean letronne letronne s influential 1834 study , on the cosmographical opinions of the church fathers , was shaped by anticlericalism just as irving s imagination was colored by angloamerican anticatholic and antispanish feeling letronne acknowledged evidence that appeared to contradict his thesis but promptly buried it as untypical church fathers and medieval christians simply must have been hidebound by prejudice and a literal reading of the bible the seeds of this premise had been planted in the 16thcentury controversies over copernicus s theory putting the sun rather than the earth at the center of the planetary system but copernicus s opponents nonetheless thought the earth was ballshaped , and for two centuries afterward the defenders of copernicus and galileo , as well as the many fierce critics of religion , hardly ever added belief in a flat earth to the accusations they made against church authorities the heyday of the flatearth mythology , in fact , did not arrive until the halfcentury of 1870 to 1920 the reason had nothing to do with facts and everything to do with the ideological atmosphere created by the struggles over evolution that atmosphere led authors like john w draper \( the history of the conflict between religion and science , 1874 \) and andrew dickson white \( a history of the warfare of science and theology in christendom , 1896 \) to recast all the past in terms of the contemporary antagonism between biblical literalism and science repeatedly , these authors , like letronne before them , treated lactantius and cosmas indicopleustes as representative while minimizing or misrepresenting all the thinkers who affirmed a spherical earth the curious result , professor russell writes , is that these modern writers ended up by doing what they accused the church fathers of , namely , creating a body of false knowledge by consulting one another instead of the evidence myths frequently operate to confirm the mythmakers' claims of superiority , to lend legitimacy to their ouster of other groups from political or cultural power the flatearth mythology , it turns out , is not a case of medieval certainty about the literal truth of the bible it arose as an expression of modernity s faith in scientific progress it dramatized the claim that the intelligence of a religious past could be dismissed in the name of a scientific present
wendy kaminer s new book , i'm dysfunctional , you 're dysfunctional , takes on america s obsession with selfhelp widely and prominently reviewed , it dissects the recovery movement , the need of more and more people to address past experiences and present addictions that hold them prisoner the book is satisfying in its debunking of the stream of selfhelp books and extremely public confessions just how did we get to the point that it has become fashionable for people to wail dark and delicate secrets to the largest possible audience \? but it also slams alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous , groups that have become sacrosanct in this staggeringly addicted society they have helped millions to tame debilitating addictions , though ms kaminer is correct in observing that nobody knows exactly how many her objections are that aa and na require a spiritless conformity , are boring and repetitive , wallow in simplistic religion , are intellectually vapid and politically retrograde the counterargument is that they save people s lives jose , a recovering cocaine and heroin addict , has been to many , many na meetings during his recovery program at the salvation army i got my family back and my life , jose said his wife , the mother of their five children , is more effusive i still ca n't believe it s him , i really ca n't , she said monica wright can see both sides of this discussion , though the alcoholism counselor sides firmly with jose through her own efforts and counselors she has trained , she has helped 30 , 000 chemically addicted people get on the road to recovery she remembers the first time she went to an aa meeting i felt the same thing she did , she said of ms kaminer who went as an observer this is too trite i am too smart to be sitting in this room so she went back to her long island life of maids , furs and cadillacs and of hidden bottles and lost days one day , she remembered aa , then dismissed them as those sweet , adorable , little people in the sweet adorable little organization then she had a second thought somehow or other i remembered that they were all sober , she said so she went back to the group and went to work this child of an alcoholic father and wife of another was able to stop drinking and begin dealing with the mess her life had become ultimately , all six of her children would become alcoholics or drug addicts each , in turn , would save himself through the trite little selfhelp groups ending her drinking hardly ended ms wright s problems , but it enabled her to see them she was separated from a husband who paid no child support , and selling antiques onebyone was not a recipe for financial health friends suggested she learn to type but it was 1963 and alcoholism counseling was just emerging as a specialty she began taking courses in psychology and human dynamics at local universities , and finally landed a job counseling substance abusers at a long island hospital nobody believed i needed a job because i still looked rich , she said her luck changed , though wealth has remained a memory an aging philanthropist , paul genoa , decided he wanted to finance an alcoholism program at a private new york city psychiatric hospital they wrote around , and gracie square hospital at 420 east 76th street accepted the challenge in 1980 the program , which operates as a separate private business called breakthrough , began with 10 beds and grew to 110 more than 2 , 000 patients are treated annually ms wright , now 65 years old , is in the process of selling breakthrough , though she will remain as a consultant she is also chairwoman of the new york state association of treatment providers for alcoholics and substance abusers works for a number of community organizations , and lately has been busily collecting awards from employee assistance professionals and others who have appreciated her work the paradox , perhaps , is that ms wright agrees with ms kaminer s point that too many people try to escape personal responsibility by citing dysfunctional backgrounds i'm so sick of that word 'dysfunctional , ' she said it has been tagged on to everything from cats to sex this , along with unscrupulous people with something to sell , can lead to awful results there s a lot of bad treatment out there , ms wright said the effect , she suggests , is to keep people sick but she was a leader in the movement to look at alcoholism in the context of families and this involves coming to terms with one s own history blaming parents , the alcoholism expert insists , is part of the process until all of us look at ourselves and what our character defects are , ms wright said , none of us has much of a chance jose and his wife would agree drawing
rome , sept 14 after a weekend of high financial drama that culminated in a 7 percent devaluation of the lira , prime minister giuliano amato of italy gained no relief today from a chorus of demands that he do what none of his predecessors has done stop the nation from living beyond its means mr amato , less than three months in office , sought to depict the drop in the lira s worth as anything but a devaluation , saying this is not a lira devaluation this is a revaluation of the mark and an agreement by germany to cut its interest rates still , he came under attack today from bankers , political opponents , industrialists and others either for not acting sooner or for shying from hard measures to reduce the country s crippling budget deficit devaluation , said luigi abete , head of italy s industrialists' organization , is a drug and now concrete provisions are needed on pensions , health , local finances and privatization more worrisome , some labor leaders suggested they no longer felt bound by a june agreement to stop indexing wage increases to inflation italy s financial crisis has long been brewing because of its domestic finances what is needed now is that the negotiation between government , labor and industry on the cost of labor goes the way it should and that the necessary measures are taken on pensions and health , gianni agnelli , head of fiat , italy s biggest private conglomerate , complained in an interview published in his newspaper , la stampa as the lira collapsed last week , authorities spent more than 34 billion in a vain attempt to support it a step that drew further criticism today the intervention , said giorgio la malfa , head of the small but influential republican party , drew the country s blood and mario monti , a leading economic commentator , said , what has fallen is not a tile or a chimney but the central pillar of italian economic policy a stable exchange rate
washington , march 19 with the abrupt withdrawal of paul e tsongas from the contest for the democratic nomination , the likely shape of the 1992 presidential race has suddenly come into sharper focus a long , fierce and possibly close fight is in prospect between president bush and gov bill clinton of arkansas election day is more than seven months away , but a few things can be said with confidence it will be a fight between a selfdescribed agent of fundamental change and a longtime champion of the status quo , a fight between an older generation \( mr bush is 67 years old and fought in world war ii \) and a new one \( mr clinton is 45 and graduated from college in the year of the big tet offensive in vietnam \) it will also be a fight between two men who have spent almost their whole adult lives in politics mr clinton calls himself an outsider , but he is as much a part of the democratic establishment as mr bush is a member of the republican hierarchy not for 50 years , what s more , have the habitually fractious democrats settled so early on their nominee not since john f kennedy was chosen in 1960 have they done so with so little bad feeling and so few overt concessions to specialinterest groups of the kind that then hurt them in the fall perhaps the oldest of political maxims holds that elections are won or lost in the middle , not on the extremes , and mr clinton seems positioned to challenge mr bush on that ground , as jimmy carter successfully challenged gerald r ford in 1976 , the last time the democrats won the white house mr carter , a moderate southerner without washington experience , like mr clinton , ran against a wounded republican incumbent , like mr bush , although the opprobrium of having pardoned richard m nixon was small potatoes compared with mr bush s economic woes , which have driven his overall approval rating down to 40 percent character issue the arkansas governor remains vulnerable , of course , to fresh accusations about his private life , of the kind that have plagued him for months , and former gov edmund g brown jr of california , his sole remaining democratic rival , intends to keep pressing his attacks on the man he calls the scandal a week candidate the white house is expected to take up where mr brown eventually leaves off we 've been keeping track this winter , said a bush campaign official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified , and you can rest assured that we will be exploring the nature of mr clinton s character political prognostication is a mug s game in the best of times few will attempt it with conviction this year , when bitter , frustrated voters have turned vindictively upon a president they lionized a few months ago still , because of mr bush s lack of popularity , the broad appeal to the traditional democratic constituencies that mr clinton has demonstrated in the primaries , and the political moxie the governor demonstrated in holding his campaign together when he was under constant attack , he is widely considered in both parties to be the democrats' strongest candidate since the vietnam era if always that if if he does not selfdestruct there are other ifs as well if the economy bounces back , as some statistics published on wednesday suggested it might be doing , and if it does so in a way that becomes palpable to the voters , the advantages that typically accrue to a president seeking reelection should reassert themselves liability of incumbency among those , the capacity to focus the nation s attention is primary the mere arrival of a president and his big red , white and blue airplane are enough to dominate the news in most cities and states in a communications era , the power to command audiences is very serious political magic if , on the other hand , mr bush allows himself to be defined as the incumbent in chief in a year when incumbents as powerful as representative dan rostenkowski of illinois , the chairman of the house ways and means committee , have to fight for their political lives , the trappings , powers and perquisites of high office could turn out to unexpected liabilities the key for mr bush , said ed rollins , a white house political director under ronald reagan , is not asking people whether they are better off than they were four years ago , but telling them where they are going , explaining what you want the bush administration to be remembered for in the history books and not just trying to get your ticket punched again so far , he said , not only has the white house not developed a plan of action for the next four years , it has not begun to think about one for mr clinton , said paul tully , the political director of the democratic national committee , the key is making himself better known to the hundreds of thousands of democrats and independents who still do not know much about him or his ideas needing more exposure we 're trying to invent a new generation of democratic leadership , mr tully said none of our guys had ever run for national office before , so clinton is still a stick figure to a lot of people , a cartoon figure who s a bit better defined for a lot more and a fully rounded person only in the states where he s run
week 12 once in a blue moon , or about every four seasons or so , the american football conference sweeps the national football conference , as the afc did on sunday for the third time in 12 years and the first since 1988 the 40 afc record included only one real upset , the 54 oilers over the 72 vikings , which is all it will take for the afc to do it again this sunday the 73 vikings versus the 55 browns is the only one of four interconference games in which the nfc team has the better record the rams' upset of the cowboys dropped dallas from the sole league lead to a threeway tie at 82 , along with the bills and the 49ers with five teams at 72 , none of the top eight teams play another team in the top eight this weekend record by record , miami \( 73 \) versus houston \( 64 \) and new orleans \( 73 \) versus the redskins \( 64 \) should be the weekend s top games while the cowboys \( 82 \) versus the cardinals \( 37 \) seems to be the mismatch of the week dallas cowboys the cowboys could certainly use a pushover after their 2723 loss to the hitherto undistinguished rams \( 46 \) they could also use a fast , aggressive pass rush specialist , somebody , come to think of it , like charles haley , the 245pound defensive end who was obtained from the 49ers during training camp and immediately became a mainstay of the league s toprated defense , harrying quarterbacks to distraction , forcing fumbles and setting up sacks haley , alas , was hobbled by a painful groin injury on sunday , and his ineffective play was considered a major factor in the loss los angeles quarterback jim everett escaped with a single sack and the rams passed and ran at will now it appears that haley s injury is worse than had been thought , and he may not play at all against the cardinals if not , jim jeffcoat will start , leon lett will also see action and the cowboys will count on a comeback attitude to score their second victory over the cardinals phoenix cardinals not so fast true , the cardinals \( 37 \) lost the first dallas game , 3120 , in irving , tex , and have n't beaten the cowboys in phoenix since 1990 , but with haley on the sideline the cardinals have hope , especially since quarterback chris chandler is rated higher than everett and had a careerhigh 383 yards in the first game against dallas indianapolis colts a year after they lost every game except one to the jets , the resurgent colts \( 46 \) found a new route to ignominy on sunday when they became the only team to lose to the patriots facing the 73 steelers in pittsburgh on sunday , the colts , who now have a threegame losing streak , will rely on an old road to facesaving success , or for what passes for it in indianapolis with jeff george sidelined with a broken bone in his passing hand , old semireliable himself , jack trudeau , will be the starting quarterback trudeau , who has never begun a season as a colts starter , has , nevertheless , more starts \( 39 \) and more victories \( 14 \) than any other indianapolis starter since his arrival in 1986 he also has a herewegoagain attitude i 've been put in this situation so many times in my career , having to play when i have n't played for a while , that i'm not worried about it , he said i feel good about it new england patriots scott zolak has never started an nfl game without winning playeroftheweek honors , so it should come as no surprise that he was named the afc offensive player of the week after leading the patriots to a 3734 overtime victory over the colts then again , maybe it should the colt game was not only the patriots' first victory of the season , it was also zolak s first start ever but after completing 20 of 29 passes for 261 yards and 2 touchdowns with considerable poise and no little panache , it is not expected to be his last san francisco 49ers quarterback steve young has not won playeroftheweek honors after every start , but his 24of37 performance for 205 yards and two fourth quarter touchdowns in the 2120 victory over the saints was good enough to make him the nfc offensive player of the week for the fourth time in his career it also helped break a tie with new orleans and put san francisco in sole possession of first place in the nfc west buffalo bills the nfl defines a superlative performance as 100 yards rushing or receiving a game or 300 yards passing so does it help to have a few big guns rather than a more balanced attack \? apparently after 10 games , the bills , one of three 82 teams and the toprated afc team on total offense , have had more superlative performances \( 14 \) than any other team in the league \( also apparently not pittsburgh \( 73 \) , houston \( 64 \) and detroit \( 28 \) are tied for second with 10 each , while 82 dallas is fourth with 9 and the 82 49ers , the league s toprated team on total offense , are next with 8 along with the 64 chiefs and the 55 chargers \) denver broncos john elway said his bruised shoulder was a little better yesterday , but coach dan reeves was n't sure the quarterback would be able to start against the raiders on sunday who cares \? after the way rookie tommy maddox stepped in and led the broncos to a 2713 victory over the giants , elway might seem expendable not to reeves sure , reeves says maddox is calm , poised , cool under fire , eventempered and seems a little bit older than his 21 years , but he s no john elway and the raiders are not the giants 'if john is the quarterback , we 've got to play as well as we can play to beat them , he said if tommy s the quarterback , we 've got to play better than we can play if that makes any sense
ernie accorsi , cleveland s executive vice president , survived four head coaching changes in eight years with the browns , which makes his resignation wednesday all the more intriguing but accorsi cautioned not to read anything into his resignation , such as there being a rift with coach bill belichick , who was hired last season i was going to do this before we hired bill , accorsi said so , this had nothing to do with anyone squeezing me out of my responsibilities or me not getting along with anyone accorsi said he tried to resign four or five times before , but the browns' president , art modell , would not accept the resignation accorsi insists that he did not resign because his duties were being taken over by belichick , who has become more involved with the makeup of the team , particularly the players who were drafted this year but that is an area that was once under the complete control of accorsi for example , belichick personally scouted more than 200 college athletes this year , cutting into the number of scouting trips made by accorsi on most of those trips belichick was accompanied by assistant coaches and ernie adams , an offensive assistant who joined the browns in 1991 adams and belichick had worked together before belichick was the giants' defensive coordinator before taking the job with the browns and adams was the giants' pro personnel director from 1982 to 1985 modell said no replacement for accorsi will be named , which means there are people already in place to handle the responsibilities it could mean that adams and mike lombardi , director of pro personnel , will split accorsi s duties modell said that he and his son , david , who is the browns' vice president of marketing , will assume some of accorsi s duties the browns went to the playoffs five times under accorsi s eightyear tenure his crowning acheivement might have been the acquisition of quarterback bernie kosar in the 1985 supplemental draft none of the browns' firstround picks since then have had as much impact accorsi , 49 years old , said he would like to go to one more nfl team before abandoning his career he said planned to move to baltimore in the meantime making the athlete a student a group of california businessmen have come up with a concept for a football league that will give young men leaving high school an alternative to college and could give some colleges with football programs headaches the proposal is being called the corporate football foundation , and it is now trying to line up 8 to 12 businesses to sponsor teams in major american cities made up of 18 to 23yearold men not bound for college each team will have about 50 players , who will earn 24 , 000 a year while also participating in an educational program set up by the foundation and administered by the team john ralston , a former stanford coach , is the foundation s commissioner ralston said he and his group had spoken to university presidents and several community colleges and had gotten positive response on the idea he likens the foundation s concept to that of high school athletes who opt to play baseball in the minor leagues rather than attend college but he said that unlike minor league baseball , football players competing for foundation teams will be require to participate in the educational program a college education is not for everyone , but a high school education is and they should take full advantage of that , ralston said we 're losing some of the basics of education it s a travesty to have a guy like dexter manley go to oklahoma state for four years and be in nfl for seven years and then say he ca n't read and write shame on us expect jets to be there last year , during the screening of jets highlight film from their 412 1990 season , coach bruce coslet went out on a limb and predicted that the team would go 106 and make the playoffs in 1991 he was off by two victories , but the team did make the playoffs the jets screened their 20minute highlight film from the 1991 season wednesday at a manhattan sports bar what was coslet s prediction for the 1992 season \? this year we play 16 games , coslet said , pausing for effect and we 'll show up for all 16 i may be stupid , but i'm not dumb coslet said he thought the team should do better than it did last year and he again expected it to make the playoffs some numbers cited by coslet as significant in the jets' rise in the last two years there are 19 players with two years or less experience , 27 players have three years or less experience sacks have increased by 25 percent , sacks allowed have decreased by 47 percent and the turnover ratio has shown a 170 percent improvement perhaps the most significant number is that the jets have won 100 percent more games than they did two years ago high stepping into the world some of the nflallocated players are making their mark in the world league orlando s roger vick , a former jets running back , is the world league s no 3 rusher with 315 yards on 84 carries san antonio s ivory lee brown , allocated by phoenix , leads the league in rushing with 91 carries for 425 yards receiver joe howard johnson , the only player from the super bowl champion redskins , has caught 27 passes for 383 and 4 touchdowns he made 9 catches for 156 yards and 2 touchdowns last week against frankfurt san antonio s defense leads the league with 20 sacks and 228 total yards a game knights quarterback reggie slack , allocated by houston , is the league s thirdrated passer despite sitting out a game slack has completed 77 of 126 passes for 958 yards , 6 touchdowns , 5 interceptions , and has a passer rating of 840 last week he completed 19 of 25 passes he set a world league record of 16 consecutive complete passes , completing 7 for 7 against orlando on april 12 , and 9 for 9 against montreal on april 26 in between , he sat the april 18 game against frankfurt with a shoulder injury teams are n't looking to future you think nfl owners are nervous about the future of the league s college draft \?

serbs and croats the struggle in yugoslavia by alex n dragnich maps 202 pp new york harcourt brace jovanovich five years ago , when the beast of serbian nationalism was beginning to stir after a long hibernation , aleksandr nenadovic , a farsighted belgrade journalist , remarked in yugoslavia you can do many things against serbia , but you cannot do anything without serbia this aphorism about the largest of the south slav nations has been grimly borne out in the brutal fighting of the last 16 months , which has destroyed the second yugoslav state of this century it also provides a subtext for serbs and croats , alex n dragnich s attempt to elucidate the principal antagonism leading to the current war in the balkans the long rivalry between two historically related peoples reduced to its simplest element , the problem has been this the nine million serbs are spread all over the region only twothirds of them reside inside the republic of serbia a large number of the 45 million croats also reside beyond the frontiers of croatia , even in belgrade , the serbian capital as long as autocratic regimes ruled all of yugoslavia monarchs from 1918 to 1941 and communists from 1945 to 1990 this lack of cohesive ethnic communities remained a secondary issue in fact , fruitful blending took place in the period after world war ii , with millions of ethnically mixed couples getting married and more than one million citizens declaring their nationality to be yugoslav but none of this sufficed to defang the vampires of balkan nationalism once released at the beginning of the 1990 s by a combination of economic decline and the fragmentation of central political authority , nationalist passions emerged with a force redoubled by long suppression under the communists serbia revived its 19thcentury aspiration to gather all serbs under one national roof , as preached by the current serbian president , slobodan milosevic croatia dreamed of reestablishing an independent croatian state , as preached by the current croatian president , franjo tudjman together , mr milosevic and mr tudjman represented a surefire recipe for bloody conflict indeed , many specialists believe the two could not have survived in their respective capitals without the war mr dragnich , the author of several books about yugoslavia , is quite weak in his account of the latterday events leading to the outbreak of hostilities at the end of june 1991 some of his time sequences are out of order , for instance in his discussion of marshal tito s rise and he gives short shrift to the arguments not only of croatian but also of slovenian politicians in their contest with the milosevic regime in sum , the author , who is of serbian origin , is too soft on serbs and too hard on croats he is much stronger in delineating the maneuvers of the serbian and croatian politicians during world war i , when , from exile , they negotiated the slapdash basis for the first , royal yugoslavia , which emerged from the collapse of european empires in 1918 one piquant detail underscores the perhaps justifiable fears even then of south slavs trying to create a state of their own in 1917 , serbian , slovenian and croatian deputies in the imperial parliament in vienna urged a union under the scepter of the hapsburg dynasty mr dragnich also touches , too lightly in my opinion , on the key point of agreement between the croatian leader vladko macek and the serbian leader dragisa cvetkovic in the fateful month of august 1939 to carve up bosnia and herzegovina between croatia and serbia the map of their proposed territorial division is virtually identical to the land grabs in bosnia and herzegovina achieved by serbian and croatian forces today and beggar the poor slavic muslims
hot springs , va , may 7 top executives from a dozen of the nation s largest corporations said this evening that with the exception of riottorn los angeles , the united states appeared to have begun a slow recovery from last year s recession all the executives who spoke this evening thought that an economic recovery had begun , but they differed on whether its progress was assured the most optimistic was robert e allen , the chairman and chief executive of the american telephone and telegraph company i do n't think we 're going to have a booming recovery , but i think it may exceed most economists' expectations , he said one of the most pessimistic executives was john f welch jr , the chairman and chief executive of the general electric company , who said that while the longterm competitiveness of american industry was improving , the recovery appeared to have been less strong last month than in the three preceding months no enthusiasm for cities however , none of the executives expressed any enthusiasm when asked if they had any immediate interest in investing in inner cities after a moment of silence , walter v shipley , the president and chief operating officer of the chemical banking corporation , pointed out that some areas in newark and washington that were damaged in riots years ago had never been rebuilt howard p allen , chairman of the executive committee of the southern california edison company , said that until the riots his region had appeared to be slowly following the rest of the country into recovery but a significant pause is likely now before tourism and investment recover the riots put a cloud not only on other things but on the economy of the southern california area , mr allen said the answer , mr allen said , was a national experiment in creating free enterprise zones , cultural centers and other programs in los angeles to persuade businesses that investments there would be safe and at least somewhat profitable with such assurances , businesses might be willing to invest even for returns below those available elsewhere , mr allen insisted more jobs are needed mr welch said that businesses' main response to the riots should be to create more jobs and increase the diversity of the american work place mr welch heads the business council , a group of 100 chief executives of large corporations who are meeting here over the next two days to discuss the economy and foreign trade carla a hills , the united states trade representative , will address the group friday in an effort to rally support for the administration s attempts to negotiate a freetrade agreement with mexico and a global freetrade pact the chief executives spoke after reviewing a very cautious report on the nation s economy by chief economists from 19 large corporations the economists' views are important not only as an indication of the economy s direction , but also because they influence the assumptions being made by america s corporate leaders as they decide whether to expand investment and other spending this year or remain cautious slow , halting progress the recession appears to have ended last year , they said , but the recovery will be slow and halting , and the economies of other industrialized countries are growing more slowly than expected last autumn the weakening of the japanese , german and other european economies is hurting american exports but the economists also drew some optimism from the steep fall in interest rates late last year , the wider availability of credit and , above all , increasing consumer confidence they predicted 25 percent economic growth through the rest of this year the prediction , is faster than the meager growth actually achieved during the past year , the economists said in their report to the chief executives but it remains well below the pace typical of previous economic recoveries
it was breakfast time at the youth hostel at amsterdam avenue and 103d street , and a few dozen mostly foreign travelers were writing postcards and discussing sightseeing plans stefan krumrei , a 29yearold berliner starting his third day in the city , mentioned that he had walked down broadway to south ferry , seen fifth avenue and lincoln center what i really would like to do now is visit harlem and the bronx , he said 'but i am not so crazy to go alone when none of the other tourists took up the idea , this columnist , who was hanging around in search of material , volunteered to provide company and transportation and we will come back \? mr krumrei asked along the first leg , through east harlem and up to 125th street , he elaborated on his trepidations in germany there are guidebooks that say you must never go to the bronx harlem is described as dangerous but going to the bronx they say is like going to war also people who were in america told me the bronx was in perpetual revolution some said if you go there you will never come back mr krumrei , a doctoral candidate , admitted he half believed these stories and it was clear he was not fully at ease about the tour is it true that there are places in the bronx where white people would be shot if they walked on the streets \? asked the traveler , who is writing his dissertation on 19th century efforts to bring theater to german workers this is very nice , he said , referring to harlem streets of gray and brownstone buildings there is a higher percentage of american cars here than there are downtown , he observed passing a store advertising dream books he said , the only dream book i know is by sigmund freud the harlem dream books limited their interpretation to suggesting that specific objects or themes in dreams indicated which numbers should be played in lotteries in front of the apollo theater on 125th street , mr krumrei was approached by thomas kendrick wie gehts \? said mr kendrick after he had correctly guessed mr krumrei s origins mr kendrick , a harlem resident and a retired contractor , said he had been in stuttgart in 1948 with the army he said harlem , like everything else in new york , was changing every day and he wished the tourist a good visit later mr krumrei said that except for a romanian immigrant who had directed him to a bus at kennedy international airport , his chat with mr kendrick was his only spontaneous encounter with a new yorker but people are very friendly , i think , he said happy about harlem , mr krumrei was still plainly apprehensive about what lay ahead in the bronx it is worse there , no \? he asked on the drive across the willis avenue bridge he said he had traveled through much of europe , usually alone i like to see how people live , he said only once had i a problem on the ferry from sweden to finland someone stole things from my knapsack it was time for lunch and tony s seafood restaurant at the far end of city island seemed like a sensible first stop the panorama from the parking lot arced from long island sound southward past streets of wellmaintained homes with the manhattan skyline as a backdrop are you sure this is the bronx \? mr krumrei asked suddenly gunfire sounded from across a narrow arm of pelham bay it turned out to be coming from the police department firing range no other shots were heard during the day s excursion after fried clams and beer the search continued for scenes more in keeping with the stereotypes mr krumrie had been exposed to back home but in fact after two hours of walking through the melrose and mott haven sections of the south bronx nothing turned up to match those fearful imported visions on several corners groups of young men , some wearing electronic beepers , clustered conspiratorially around pay phones some drunks were sitting on stoops some cars drove by with their soupedup radios blaring loudly several burnedout houses and a few blocks of razed buildings were plainly visible but these were exceptions in generally benign streetscapes shoppers on 149th street , children coming out school , people walking their dogs , and antique dealers trying to make a go of things in a row of recently renovated buildings within the decay of bruckner boulevard a few neighborhood gardens the only instance of outright violence occurred at crimmins avenue near 141st street when a short young woman ran at and angrily slapped a tall man the man did not fight back and minutes later the two were kissing mr krumrei said this area looked more like what he had expected but that it appeared happier and tamer than he had imagined i do not think people at home will believe me when i describe it , he said i do not even think they will believe me when i tell them that i went to the bronx and returned and that nothing bad happened drawing
the boston red sox have become the boston no sox a team long feared for its ferocity at fenway park , the no sox have become harmless gnats with their bats there and everywhere mark mcgwire has hit more home runs than all of the boston batters combined entering their game yesterday against the angels , the no sox had hit 12 home runs , lowest total in the major leagues the texas rangers hit 12 home runs in the first seven games of the season the detroit tigers hit 12 home runs in a sixgame span april 1924 they hit 21 in the 14 games before yesterday i'm not worried so much about home runs but driving in runs , general manager lou gorman said we 're leaving 10 , 11 on each game just one base hit would have won a game for us five times our problem is driving in runs the no sox have scored fewer runs than anyone but kansas city , and they have left more runners on base than anyone but oakland the absence of home runs epitomizes their struggles they hit two home runs on opening day , then slugged three more in their third game in their next 24 games , though , they hit only two home runs , which , until friday night , had been the only two they had hit at fenway , their supposedly friendly home ellis burks took the team lead by hitting his third home run friday night he had been tied with mo vaughn and jack clark , even though vaughn is back in the minors and clark did n't hit a home run until the 28th game vaughn hit his two in the first three games clark hit both of his in the same game burks has spread his out over a longer period we sent vaughn down because he was n't hitting and he was pressing so badly , gorman said the first baseman was hitting 185 , had only three extrabase hits and had struck out once every three times at bat everyone had ballyhooed him and built him up , he put so much pressure on himself it began to eat away at him he lost his confidence so we sent him to pawtucket to try to turn him around and relax him clark is an enigma unto himself just as he did last year , his first in boston , the designated hitter has started slowly , struggling to hit 200 before the allstar game last year , clark batted 216 , hit 11 home runs and drove in 36 runs after it , he hit 282 with 17 homers and 51 rbi clark does everything in the second half , gorman said he gets hot in the second half and he can carry youbut when you get him not hitting and plantier , vaughn and burks struggling , it hurts in slightly less than half a season last year , phil plantier batted 331 with 11 home runs and 35 rbi this season , he has batted in the low 200 s , hitting one homer , driving in 10 runs even more conspicuous for his lack of punch is mike greenwell , who came off the disabled yesterday after suffering from an ailing arm greenwell has a perfect hitting record 14 hits , 14 singles his batting average is 226 , and he has driven in only 5 runs at the corresponding time last year , the red sox had hit 24 home runs greenwell had three of those , wade boggs four between them this year , they have none tom brunansky was the team leader with six he hit his first this season last wednesday brunansky at least has an excuse he has n't been playing much in the first 31 games last year , he had 105 times at bat , this year 45 of the 24 home runs hit last year , 15 cleared the fences at fenway tony pena and burks have been the only boston players who have hit homegame home runs this season we should be a much better offensive club than we have been , gorman said watching us play has been frustrating and dull waiting for mattingly despite the uncomfortable question his offensive performance raises , the yankees' don mattingly apparently is in no danger of losing his job , not even temporarily some might ask why not a player of lesser stature would already have been given a seat in the dugout mattingly has continued to play through his seasonlong slump , but he has shown no signs of emerging from it always a slow starter , he has started more slowly than usual before this season , mattingly s career batting average for april was 278 not only was it significantly lower this april , 241 , but it also had dropped to 217 midway through may furthermore , he is striking out more often than ever to be even respectable , the yankees need a productive mattingly or they need someone who can produce in his place kevin maas , playing sporadically , has indicated he can produce , driving in one run every 54 times at bat that would seem to be the dilemma confronting manager buck showalter does he keep mattingly in the lineup , hoping he will begin hitting and driving in runs , or does he give maas a chance at first base \? i have a lot of faith in donny , showalter said he brings so much to our club his presence and his defense alone he does a lot more than what shows up in the offensive stats his track record shows he s going to do some things for us we 're willing to be patient tewksbury is under control bob tewksbury of st louis has walked two batters \( larry walker of montreal and greg olson of atlanta \) in 52 innings to understand how remarkable his control is , consider that al osuna of houston has walked 16 batters in 15 innings and mark davis of kansas city 19 in 20 innings
to understand why the music jury for this year s pulitzer prize is angry and why its anger should not be ignored , one need only listen to ralph shapey s hourlong concerto fantastique the fourmovement work , which was first performed last december , by the chicago symphony orchestra under mr shapey s direction , deserves a commercial recording it begins with pungent brass proclamations alternating with fervently declaimed timpani solos it ends in a rondo that furiously strains at one s sense of order through a mass of sound one hears , glinting , fragments of the timpani theme the music is obsessional it screams , mourns and sighs , using a distinctive and powerful language the concerto is at once overwhelmingly intricate and brutally simple it sometimes recalls the music of shostakovich the pulitzer jury , composed of george perle , roger reynolds and harvey sollberger , unanimously chose the concerto fantastique for the pulitzer long the creator of original and visionary works in a wide range of musical media , the jury explained , mr shapey has in this work achieved a striking summation that integrates the craggy and uncompromising materials of a very personal language on a grand scale the honor was long due but now it will have to wait for the first time in the distinguished history of the pulitzer prize in music , the pulitzer board rejected the jury s recommendation , choosing instead the face of the night , the heart of the dark , by wayne peterson there is nothing wrong with mr peterson s work the jury praised it and said it would have won in any other year though he is little known , mr peterson has created an effective , impressionistic showpiece for orchestra , a nocturnal meditation that is at times delicately atmospheric and at others anxious and dissonant elements of jazz mix with invocations of the american symphonic school the work , like its title , is divided into two sections one suggests the night s somber pastoral character the other seems to move into more disturbing psychological darkness conceivably , the board chose the peterson work simply to assert its rights \( there were procedural disputes about the jury s prerogative to select a single work \) jury verdicts have also been overturned in other disciplines there were reports this year , in fact , that the criticism prize was not awarded because none of the three jury choices was deemed suitable but in music , the choice raised broader issues the jury responded to the overturned verdict with a public statement written as if through clenched teeth there had been no consultation with the jury moreover , the board was not professionally qualified to make such a judgment one board member , walter rugaber , publisher of the roanoke times and world news , countered , saying that the board should take into account the layman s or consumer s point of view since these compositions will be performed for a public , he continued , it is not inappropriate for people who are not professional musicians , composers or performers to listen to the best that the professionals recommend , and to express an opinion that one is more interesting than the other this comment invokes the rift that has haunted music in this century between the disgruntled public , often unhappy with new works , and composers who are seen to award grants to one another with utter disregard for unwashed nonprofessionals the peterson work was used to assert listeners' rights in this battle the issue is intricate but the pulitzer prize in music is not based on popularity it is a professional award certifying a high level of achievement its track record is astonishing it has missed fewer notables and honored fewer clinkers than the nobel prize in literature and as mr sollberger pointed out in conversation , even the journalistic pulitzers are professional and judged by colleagues the music prize marks a composer s entry into a particular tradition that tradition s continuity is partly insured by using jurors who have previously been winners since 1982 , such jurors have included charles wuorinen , dominick argento , richard wernick , leon kirchner , robert ward , jacob druckman , milton babbitt , joseph schwantner , william schuman , ellen taaffe zwilich , donald martino , mr reynolds and mr perle for all the stylistic variety suggested by these names , they demarcate a modern tradition of serious composition , within which the pulitzer prize remains the highest professional honor it confers the highest public honor as well there is , surely , an esthetic perspective in this list there are no avantgardists or minimalists , for example and as mr reynolds said in conversation , the pulitzer expresses a subconscious tendency of the field to conserve its deepest values but this conservatism does n't mean ideological absolutism jurors have made surprising stylistic choices serving on the jury , one composer said , focuses the mind it is treated as a high and important task despite the wider problems in musical life , that high and important task should not be changed in character popular works can indeed win a pulitzer , but popularity should not affect the award it is important for composers to be reminded that a public exists but composers like mr shapey remind us what is possible when the art is not just professional but also uncompromisingly powerful photo ralph shapey his powerful concerto was rejected
warsaw , feb 5 a recent national poll sums up the gloomy , foreboding mood these days in poland , the country that was the first in eastern europe to reject the communist system asked to pick the bestqualified person to lead the nation from among six wellknown figures in recent polish history , a substantial majority favored none of the above president lech walesa , who came to prominence as the leader of the solidarity union movement , placed behind gen wojciech jaruzelski , the last communist leader from the cabarets to the newspapers to parliament , the prevailing talk these days is of strikes , social unrest and even some sort of return to authoritarian rule euphoria over toppling communism , and the initial pleasures of being able to buy bananas on every street corner , have been supplanted by uncertainty over the future , anxiety on unemployment and the fear of exploitation by foreign investors support for poland s economic reform plan , long regarded as the region s boldest , has seriously eroded , another survey indicated this one showed that only 25 percent of those asked supported faster privatization down from 50 percent in november budget cuts have forced schools to raise money from parents funds are so short that the government is starting to default on some debts president walesa addressed a meeting of the council of europe in strasbourg , france , this week his gloomy remarks reflected the solemn feeling that pervades warsaw these days our own people are not getting the feeling that they are better off , he said the fruits of victory have turned sour already , one can hear some people wondering why we have ever done it democracy is losing its supporters some people say , 'all right , let s go back to authoritarian rule' the polish leader assailed western europeans for flooding his country with products while keeping their own markets closed , and he warned that instability in the east would inevitably harm the west from the outset , when poland launched its program of economic shock therapy on jan 1 , 1990 , the main question was whether the people would be able to stomach the long , painful process of restructuring this , after all , was a country with a history of bread riots and popular uprisings unquestionably , the initial phase brought fast results prices were freed from controls , the borders opened to imports , and lines disappeared as goods filled longempty store shelves it is the next step in the economic changes layoffs , the planned closing of unproductive coal mines , and the sale of staterun industries to foreign investors that has been harder to hurdle this painful phase is a long one , and it will last for years , said leszek balcerowicz , former finance minister and the architect of these freemarket steps that s our big political challenge as we know from history , the sequence has always been different , he continued capitalism first , mass democracy second we 're trying to combine mass democracy and capitalism , and it s never been done the unease so apparent these days seems to stem more from people s perceptions than any appreciable shift in the economic situation polish unemployment , now above 11 percent , has been in double digits since the middle of last year , while price increases have produced an annual inflation rate of 70 percent wages have been rising faster than productivity workers and union officials seem to recognize that the recently installed cabinet of prime minister jan ol szewski can be persuaded to vary the basic plan , its members having sought election to parliament on a platform of easing austerity nonetheless , aides to mr olszewski said there is no intention of printing more money , and the cabinet endorsed , if reluctantly , a tight firstquarter budget that still runs a deficit of 16 billion thus far , mr olszweski s officials have done little to assuage fears of economic and labor instability one new minister declared that all workers' demands were justified , seemingly inviting more strikes another raised the possibility of renegotiating already concluded sales of businesses to american companies , a statement that other officials retracted the next day some of the gloom in this country can be understood in light of the poles' chronic pessimism many solidarity leaders , for example , predicted that they would lose the june 1989 election against the communists they won 99 of 100 seats jadwiga staniszkis , a warsaw sociologist , said the major risk for politicians lies in raising people s hopes for a better life , only to disappoint them this politics of expectation can lead to bizarre perceptions miss staniszkis noted that reports of the constitutional coup in algeria last month were prominently carried here on state television , and recalled marshal josef pilsudski s 1926 military takeover of the polish government of that day recently , when mr walesa named a historian of the pilsudski period as an adviser , a new round of rumors circulated in warsaw all eyes are on olszewski s performance in the next two to three weeks , she said if he tries to mix populism with the balcerowicz plan , it will be a disaster a survey published on tuesday by the newspaper gazeta wyborcza indicated deep reservations about the pace and extent of privatization of industry only about a quarter of those asked agreed with the proposition that stateowned enterprises should be allowed to fail and the country to rely principally on private business asked whether foreign capital should be brought to poland as quickly as possible , only 25 percent concurred , while 51 percent said they agreed that foreign capital should be prevented from buying up poland
sussex , nj , march 18 years back , tiny sussex was the bustling commercial hub of the dairy industry in surrounding wantage township but the farms are fading and sussex s good fortunes are ebbing now , deep in the countryside of northwestern new jersey , far from any urban center , it is wrestling with its own version of bigcity woes the state has ordered the town s aging sewer plant replaced at a potential cost of 10 million sussex has to build a 2 million water filtration plant and it faces a 1 million bill to rebuild a rickety dam so that clove lake , now a marshy shadow of its old self , can be refilled and residents can fish , swim and boat in it again such costs are nothing to bigcity mayors but they are overwhelming for sussex , where the municipal budget is just 12 million and bluecollar workers and the elderly , who are dominant in the population of 2 , 200 , already grumble about being overtaxed sussex , only threequarters of a square mile , has no room left for big new taxable developments that would ease the residential tax burden the town has already foreclosed on a former halfway house for discharged psychiatric patients and the land under a closed lumber yard for nonpayment of taxes a 40unit town house project , only a quarter complete , sits mostly weedfilled and empty on a hilltop , a victim of financing troubles then there is the crime burglaries rose to 22 in 1990 from 7 in 1989 car thefts jumped to 19 from 12 , and larcencies rose to 42 from 32 minuscule figures , certainly , compared to innercity crime but they help give sussex the highest crime rate in its county , also named sussex sussex s population fell to 2 , 201 in the 1980 s , down by 217 , while surrounding wantage township , 68 square miles of fields and woods , grew to nearly 9 , 500 from 7 , 268 with growth came two new strip malls on route 23 they are less than five miles south of sussex s old business center and compete for its customers experts say sussex is not alone we have a number of market towns or market centers that in an agricultural economy had very significant roles , said james w hughes , professor of urban planning at rutgers university and director of the rutgers regional report , which studies housing , demographics and the economy as the agricultural economy has waned , their historical function declined pre world war ii , they were affluent parents now they 're sort of destitute relatives the great construction wave of the 1980 s , the office building boom , bypassed these older centers this is prototypical of the economic change that has swept through the region during the past generation hovering over everything else here now is the takeover of the fourman police department by the sussex county prosecutor , dennis o'leary , at 1 am on feb 29 he suspended the chief , mark van engelen , and his three officers with pay , replacing them with county detectives and sheriff s deputies no charges have been filed , and mr o'leary has declined to discuss the reasons for the takeover or his investigation of the department , which is continuing a day before the takeover , members of the department removed 34 items from the police evidence room and burned them , including a marijuana plant and some small amounts of marijuana , in a hole near the public works garage mr o'leary s investigators dug up the site of the fire on march 6 he declined to discuss what if anything was found chief van engelen s lawyer , kevin kelly , said the items that were burned were all from cases completed long ago none of the items involved pending cases or investigations , he said mr kelly said the burning was done during the day , was videotaped and involved evidence in nonindictable offenses , some dating from the late 1970 s he said mr o'leary s office approved the burning mr o'leary said the question of permission was in dispute , but declined to make any other comment mayor peter horvath and other town officials have refused to discuss the investigation but many merchants say the police takeover has cleared main street of what they variously call loiterers , bums , riffraff and biker types to an outsider , main street looks pleasant and relatively prosperous , with a chinese restaurant , appliance store , pharmacy , bank , jeweler , hobby store , newsstand and vestpocket park a bagel shop has just opened , a new pizza parlor is going in , and negotiations have started about turning the old 5 10 building into professional offices and apartments for the elderly no lack of churches we 're still a viable town , mayor horvath said , pointing out that sussex has seven churches , a volunteer fire department , and new offices and apartments in a converted creamery the trick now is finding the millions for better sewage treatment , water filtering and the clove lake dam we do n't have the ability to expand the tax base , and the municipal leaders recognize the limited ability of the people to pay more , said charles m kuperus , president of the town council and owner of a plant nursery there s a commitment to improve we 're going after every grant we can get
when gasoline cars are converted to run on another fuel , they usually wind up cleaner and more environmentally correct , but , well , more sedate not so joe mezquita s natural gasser the car , a 1987 buick somerset , has a fiberglass body and a 468cubicinch engine that was designed to run on gasoline it is now a dragster on the north american circuit , with this legend painted on the trunk lid natural gas it cooks your dogs hauls your buns there are about 30 , 000 natural gas vehicles on the road in this country , most owned by utility companies mr mezquita says his is the only racer its top speed is 142 miles an hour , and its best elapsed time from a standing start , over a standard 1 , 280foot course , is a respectable 938 seconds the natural gasser uses a 225cubicfoot tank that holds gas at 2 , 400 pounds of pressure the pressure is reduced , in two stages , to 3 ounces none of this is unusual for natural gas vehicles but the engine s adjustment is unusual the race car runs at a compression ratio of 14 to 1 most cars on the street , whether they burn gasoline or have been converted to natural gas , have ratios of 8 to 1 or 9 to 1 natural gas , mr mezquita pointed out , has an octane of 130 , allowing higher compression without knocking that extra compression means more horsepower in another move to squeeze out horsepower , mr mezquita adjusted the timing to fire the spark plug earlier , allowing more burn time this is possible only because natural gas detonates a bit more slowly than gasoline mr mezquita , 51 years old , is a production supervisor for east ohio gas , which produces gas from wells in the area , and he raced conventional stock cars in the early 1960 s he has been racing the natural gasser since 1987 , but it took a year , he said , to find the optimum compression ratio and spark timing the car runs more cleanly than a gasoline car , he said , with no carbon buildup or oil contamination he would like to convert the gmc truck that he uses to haul the natural gasser to races , he said , but cannot figure out where he would get fuel en route photo joe mezquita with his natural gasser , a 1987 buick converted to run on natural gas

portland , ore , march 29 the knicks ended a perfect threegame west coast trip tonight with their most satisfying victory winning for just the second time in their last 12 games at portland , new york defeated the trail blazers , 10796 , at memorial coliseum it was the knicks' seventh consecutive triumph , their longest winning streak of the season and it kept new york \( 4625 \) 41 2 games in front of the boston celtics in the atlantic division with only 11 games left to play we 're making some giant steps , we 're building resolve , some real character and some resiliency , said coach pat riley our poise is a lot better right now the deck was stacked against us on this trip , but we raised our level of play patrick ewing \( 33 points , 14 rebounds \) led new york to victory , scoring 17 points in the final quarter the trail blazers \( 5121 \) have the secondbest record in the national basketball association , but the knicks proved they are playing well enough to beat anyone clyde drexler led portland with 22 points while buck williams had 20 , but the trail blazers hurt their chances by taking many longrange shots portland attempted 19 threepoint shots and made only 7 of them after terry porter tied the game with a threepoint jumper , ewing answered with a key play he made an eightfoot turnaround baseline jumper while being fouled by cliff robinson , and ewing s free throw gave new york a 9188 lead with 3 minutes 23 seconds left then , after drexler missed a threepointer , new york called time out to set up a play the ball went to ewing again , and he made another eightfoot turnaround jumper over robinson that gave the knicks a 9388 lead after williams responded with a layup , mark jackson was fouled on a drive to the basket jackson made both free throws with 2 43 left , giving new york a 5point lead again then , after drexler missed a leaning layup , ewing was fouled by robinson ewing made 1 of 2 free throws to put new york ahead , 9690 , with 2 18 left the trail blazers never threatened again we wanted this win badly , said jackson a lot of people questioned us as a basketball team , talking about us not beating quality teams this win really means something we played against one of the best teams in the league and we controlled the game the knicks entered the fourth quarter with a 7473 lead , thanks to an offbalance , 24foot 3pointer by john starks at the thirdquarter buzzer it was an acrobatic shot by starks , who made it despite being sandwiched between robert pack and williams and the knicks withstood a thirdquarter surge by the trail blazers , who raised their intensity after halftime give the knicks credit , said portland coach rick adelman they took it to us they controlled this game they hurt us on the boards , defensively and shooting patrick had a great game the officials did n't have an effect on this game we just got beat new york led at halftime , 5352 , as neither team was able to establish control portland s biggest problem was its failure to get back quickly on defense gerald wilkins had two breakaway dunks in the first quarter , and the knicks had a steady diet of twoonone and threeontwo fast breaks throughout the first half ewing gave kevin duckworth fits , finishing the first half with 14 points and 8 rebounds ewing s mobility was too much for the 7foot duckworth , who is listed at 260 pounds but who probably weighs at least 275 ewing s last basket of the first half was sensational a onehanded dunk off of a missed shot by xavier mcdaniel flurry of threepointers but while the trail blazers had trouble on defense , there was nothing wrong with their offense portland made six threepoint shots in the first half drexler made three 3pointers in the first half , but wilkins did a solid defensive job on drexler , who came into the game averaging 252 points drexler had 11 points in the first half but none in the second quarter jackson continued his torrid shooting , making all five of his firsthalf fieldgoal attempts the many hours jackson has spent working on his jumper has paid off he is often left unguarded when opponents doubleteam ewing now jackson s shooting has given opponents something else to worry about rebounds kiki vandeweghe , who played in portland before being traded to the knicks in 1989 , received a warm ovation from the fans before the game xavier mcdaniel suffered a cut under his right eye in the second quarter when he took an elbow in the face mcdaniel returned to the game wearing a bandaid new york , which beat denver and seattle in the other games on the road trip , is host to the chicago bulls on tuesday
the city of st petersburg , fla , obviously belongs in major league baseball officials from that heretofore deprived city came to new york the other day and displayed its credentials , the only ones needed these days to show that a city or an owner is ready for the major leagues they invoked the word lawsuit the st petersburg people said they would sue if anyone interfered with the contractual rights granted them by bob lurie , owner of the san francisco giants , in the prospective purchase of the giants by a group of florida investors they were n't threatening anyone , the st petersburg people said , they just wanted to be prepared , and anyway , if everything is approved , they would have no reason to pursue legal action baseball had the dead ball era followed by the live ball era this is the litigious era babe ruth had nothing on baseball lawyers neither do the ryne sandbergs and their 6 million or 7 million salaries given lawyers' hourly fees , their bills get to those levels without free agency the old saying about hitting was take two and hit to right now it s take two and sue the st petersburg people have done their homework they know that the owners will have greater respect for them if they show they know how to sue baseball everyone else does it today a person s or a club s status is measured by the number of briefs the lawyers file in court pete rose sued the commissioner so did two of the yankees' limited partners and leonard kleinman , both suits stemming from the george steinbrenner case steinbrenner himself was n't allowed to sue , so he sued a court stenographer instead the city of seattle , which sued after losing its first major league team in 1970 , threatened to sue if a prospective buyer was rejected and the mariners allowed to move the lawsuit in the batter s box now is the chicago cubs' challenge to commissionerordered realignment of the national league it could turn out to be the father of all lawsuits because a judge has granted the cubs at least a temporary victory over the commissioner if the appellate court allows that decision to stand , it could prompt lawsuits every time anything happens in baseball legal anarchy would hit the major leagues the expansion teams do n't like the players made available to them in the november draft \? sue to have fewer players placed on the protected lists the american league does n't like the absence of the designated hitter from its teams' lineups at world series games played in national league parks \? sue to get him into the lineup every game the milwaukee brewers do n't like being the swing team in the al schedule \? sue ten american league teams do n't like the commissioner s decision to allow steinbrenner back on march 1 \? sue to keep him out for life buck showalter , gene michael and the yankee players do n't like the commissioner s decison to let steinbrenner back \? file a class action suit to keep him out for life plus a year so many lawsuits could be filed that baseball could be paralyzed neither the commissioner nor anyone else could move forward the cubs filed their suit purely out of selfinterest the folly of their effort to use the courts to remain in the national league east can be seen in the possible move of the giants to st petersburg at first glance , the sale of the giants to a florida group appeared to confuse the realignment issue but upon reflection , the possible move clearly shows the need for someone , such as the commissioner , to be able to tell teams what to do approval of the giants' move is by no means a certainty , but assuming the owners allow the transfer , it would make no sense for the giants to remain in the nl west unless the owners would make it a condition of their approval , though , the giants could refuse to move to the nl east if , on the other hand , the giants agreed to the division switch , an east division team would have to go to the west the cubs have already refused the st louis cardinals would refuse to go without the cubs that leaves four teams in the northeast and one in the southeast it would make no sense for any of them to change divisions , and none would agree so where would that leave the league \? in a mess , of course atlanta and st petersburg , not to mention cincinnati , would be in the nl west the florida marlins would be in the east , where the cubs and the cardinals would remain but st petersburg could always sue to be allowed to play in the east its lawyers are going through spring training right now to prepare for that possibility

sarajevo , bosnia and herzogovina , july 17 after weeks of pinning their hopes on western military intervention against the serbian nationalist forces besieging this city , the people of sarajevo were told bluntly today that no western country has any intention of getting involved in rescuing the city with military force , even if the fall of the city seems imminent douglas hurd , the british foreign secretary , ruled out any western military action to save sarajevo when he spoke to reporters here after a twohour visit to the city at one point , replying to a question from an american reporter about the possibility of widespread loss of life if sarajevo should fall to the serbian forces , he singled out the united states as being among the countries that had decided not to take military action even on your hypothesis , no country , even your country , is willing to contemplate military intervention , mr hurd said the british official spoke shortly before the announcement in london that the bosnian government and the rebellious serbian and croatian forces had agreed on a new ceasefire to begin on sunday evening the announcement was greeted with deep skepticism here , since none of a succession of ceasefire agreements have halted the serbian bombardments of sarajevo s 400 , 000 residents for more than a few hours senior officials of the bosnian government , led by muslims but also including serbs and croats , said that the government gave no credence to the undertakings given in london by radovan karadzic , leader of the serbian forces attacking sarajevo they said that the only reason the bosnian government signed the london accord was that failure to do so would have allowed the serbian leaders to present the government as the party obstructing peace , and because western nations , including the united states , had placed intense pressure on bosnian officials to go along with the ceasefire alija izetbegovic , the bosnian president , said shortly before the london agreement was signed that he held out no hope that the serbian forces would break from their past pattern of accepting ceasefire agreements then proceeding to pound sarajevo with artillery , mortar and rocket fire no , i do n't believe karadzic , he said , after bidding farewell to mr hurd at the united nations headquarters here karadzic has talked many times about a ceasefire , and he did n't respect here the 66yearold bosnian leader became testy when reporters pursued the matter have you been in sarajevo last night \? he said , in english , referring to heavy bombardments that caused widespread damage and several deaths in the city center and old muslim quarter yes \? then you heard the shelling compare these words about peace , about a ceasefire , with this shelling new version of old truce the ceasefire agreed in london is a broader version of one signed by the bosnian government and serbian forces six weeks ago the truce was ignored by the serbs , but it was renewed four weeks later when the serbian forces surrendered sarajevo airport to united nations forces for an international relief airlift although the airlift has been in full swing for two weeks , the fighting around sarajevo has never stopped the new ceasefire also includes an agreement by all sides in the fighting to place heavy weapons like artillery guns , mortars and rocketlaunchers under united nations supervision throughout bosnia and herzegovina but this , too , was greeted dismissively here earlier ceasefire accords have stipulated that united nations monitors be posted at the site of all the heavy guns within reach of sarajevo airport although united nations monitors have been placed at serbian gun sites overlooking sarajevo , and at one government gun site in the city , heavy serbian bombardments of sarajevo have continued , and have even intensified , since the airlift began maj gen lewis w mackenzie of canada , the united nations commander here , has accused both sides of cheating , saying that they have heavy guns that they have not declared mr hurd appeared unimpressed by bosnian government warnings that sarajevo could fall within a month if western nations take no action to help the government militarily the warnings were put to president bush in helsinki last week by mr izetbegovic , but mr hurd said that there were very widely differing analyses of the military situation around sarajevo this appeared to be a reference to speculation on the possibility that croatian forces under the command of mate boban , who signed the ceasefire accord in london today on behalf of bosnia s croatian population , might assist the bosnian government forces by attacking the serbian positions but according to croatian forces in sarajevo , mr boban s forces have continued to reject pleas to help lift the siege , and have even helped the serbian attackers by seizing clandestine shipments of arms and ammunition destined for sarajevo s defenders in a lastditch attempt to get mr boban to unblock ammunition supplies , mr izetbegovic is planning to hold talks next week with president franjo tudjman of croatia photos serbian forces have destroyed or damaged the hearts of metropolitan areas and have besieged civilian populations of croats and muslims during the war in bosnia and herzegovina refugees sought sanctuary from the shelling recently in a heavily damaged section of mostar \( rebecca kaufman for the new york times \) a woman waiting yesterday in a long line for food in sarajevo \( associated press \)
charging that corrupt labor officials and the mafia have controlled the newspaper and magazine delivery industry in new york city for decades , prosecutors yesterday began legal action for the appointment of an independent trustee to run the newspaper deliverers' union the move by robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , marked the first time that state prosecutors have used an antiorganizedcrime law to seek the takeover of a union mr morgenthau said the indictment also represented the first time that a labor union had been accused of state or federal criminal charges in asking for the ouster of the leadership of the newspaper and mail deliverers' union of new york and vicinity , mr morgenthau filed a petition in state supreme court saying that the union had forfeited its right to independence because it had violated the state s organized crime control act most powerful newspaper union the union represents 2 , 100 truck drivers and employees who bundle newspapers at the new york times , the daily news , the new york post and wholesale companies in the new york metropolitan area it is considered the most powerful labor force in the city s newspaper industry because it is the only union with the power to stop delivery of the newspaper during a strike to have a court receiver or master appointed to run the union , prosecutors will have to prove that it is in the grips of organized crime , as well as that it has violated its own constitution by engaging in a criminal enterprise and that it has abused the rights of its members a lawyer for the union , j kenneth o'connor , denied that the current leadership was affiliated with mobsters he said the union s executive board would meet today before determining whether to oppose or consent to the takeover i think the initial reaction of the union would be to oppose that kind of remedy , mr o'connor said the proposed court seizure of the union under the criminal provisions of the organized crime control act would be similar to steps taken by federal prosecutors for the appointment of administrators for national unions under the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act , known as rico in the last decade , federal courts have designated trustees to oversee several unions , including the international brotherhood of teamsters and the international longshoremen s association but where the seeking of a special administrator under rico is a civil procedure , mr morgenthau is seeking to take over the drivers' union through a criminal procedure in civil cases , a preponderance of evidence is required to prevail in a criminal proceeding , proof beyond a reasonable doubt is necessary , thus making the criminal case harder to prove prosecutors in mr morgenthau s office acknowledged that they were charting a new legal ground since the organized crime control act was enacted in 1986 to crack down on mob activities , there have been successful prosecutions for enterprise crimes against individuals but no previous attempt to use the statute to replace the leadership of a union because the issue has not been resolved by any previous hearing or ruling , it is unclear whether the act empowers a judge to appoint a trustee the prosecutors contended that the forfeiture provisions of the state act allow a judge to order the seizure of the union as a property because it was a party to an illegal criminal enterprise mr morgenthau , at a news conference in his office in lower manhattan , said corruption has been entrenched in the union since 1976 the mob has been in control so long that it will take a special master with special powers to clean up the union , he added new wave of indictments the call for a court administrator came in tandem with a new wave of indictments accusing the union and 12 more people on state charges of belonging to a criminal enterprise , racketeering , stealing newspapers , bribery and criminal contempt a former official of the union , michael diana , was accused of diverting more than 3 , 000 from a strike benefit fund in 1990 for himself and a girlfriend since june , 26 union officials , members and relatives and three men identified as mafia members have been indicted by a manhattan grand jury in connection with a twoyear investigation of the union the union s top officials could not be reached for comment on the legal actions yesterday the president of the drivers' union , douglas lachance , was arrested last month on charges of violating his federal parole by failing a cocaine test he had been convicted of racketeering and extortion in 1980 and served five years of a 12year sentence when he was released in 1985 robert paletta , the union s vice president , who is the top executive while mr lachance is in jail , did not return telephone calls to his office in long island city mr o'connor said that the accusations in eight separate indictments since june involved union officials who were in power before mr lachance and his administration were elected in may 1991 two crime families none of the charges in these indictments can apply to the current administration , mr o'connor said mr lachance was not accused of a crime in the indictments but he and two former presidents , jerry cronin and michael j alvino , were cited as unindicted coconspirators mr alvino was indicted on six counts of criminal contempt for refusing to answer questions before the grand jury previous indictments and yesterday s charges asserted that members of the lucchese and the bonanno crime families controlled rackets in the unions that led to increased operating costs for the city s three major daily newspapers michael g cherkasky , the chief of the investigations division in the district attorney s office , said the inquiry had found some indications that circulation figures had been inflated at the daily news but no charges had been brought in june , as a spinoff to the investigation , the post was

beijing , sept 1 the police today detained a prominent chinese student leader who had returned from exile in the united states and was preparing to meet with foreign reporters to discuss his plans for setting up a chapter in china of the prodemocracy organization he heads the security forces seized shen tong , a 24yearold graduate student at boston university , at 12 30 this morning at his family home in beijing two other chinese , qi dafeng and qian liyun , were taken away with mr shen at about 4 am and none of the three have been seen since three french television journalists were escorted from mr shen s home and then expelled today ross g terrill , an american writer of several books on china , was detained at his hotel room for a few hours in connection with mr shen s press conference , but he was allowed to move freely after united states embassy officials intervened embassy expresses 'concern' i was pushed into my room and then i tried to get out and was stopped , said mr terrill they said i was in violation of the rules several guards were posted outside his room during the day the american embassy submitted a protest on mr terrill s behalf to the foreign ministry it also expressed concern over the detention of mr shen , who holds a chinese passport the detentions seemed to arise from mr shen s plans to hold a press conference to discuss his decision to set up a local chapter of the democracy for china fund , which he heads mr terrill , who is on the fund s advisory board , tried to preside over the conference instead , until the police detained him mr shen s mother , li yixian , said the police passed her a note written by her son that said he was being questioned at a hotel , but did not give the location the police gave no reason why mr shen was detained , but they confiscated his computer disks , notebooks and other materials collected during travels throughout china this past month they did n't show us any identification , said miss li , his mother then one of the policemen took my son away visit kept quiet mr shen was one of the top leaders in the 1989 tiananmen democracy movement and then fled to the united states and became active in lobbying for more attention to human rights violations in china he also wrote a book about his experiences in china although mr shen returned to china about a month ago , he kept his visit quiet he apparently is the most prominent democracy leader to return to china from exile mr qi , who lives in china and was jailed for 20 months after the tiananmen square military crackdown , traveled with mr shen and worked closely with the democracy for china fund miss qian , the wife of another student leader , xiong yan , was apparently also helping mr shen the materials confiscated could presumably be used to incriminate other chinese whom mr shen met during his journey in a statement released to the press before his detention , mr shen said he conducted interviews with intellectuals , workers , peasants and bureaucrats across the nation on behalf of the fund mr shen apparently also met with dissidents belonging to underground prodemocracy groups that the government bans outright the authorities gave no indication whether they detained him for the materials he gathered or solely for his plans to hold a press conference whether the government knew he had been traveling and interviewing people across the country is not clear mr shen flew from hong kong to the southern city of guilin and then traveled freely to cities and the countryside others in danger in four weeks i have seen things which encouraged me and others which made me sad , mr shen said in his statement mr shen and his assistants had notified official chinese news organizations about the press conference this may be how the authorities discovered his plans robin munro , a researcher at asia watch , a division of human rights watch , said that the authorities were likely to be much harsher toward mr qi and other lesswellknown figures than to mr shen himself , who is partly protected by his prominence in the united states there s a fear that the real victims of this debacle are the lesserknown people involved in the shen tong project , mr munro said photo shen tong , a graduate student at boston university , who was seized yesterday at his family home in beijing mr shen , shown in june 1990 , was one of the leaders in the 1989 tiananmen democracy movement \( reuters \)
in the days since the rev al sharpton announced that he was going to throw his hair into the ring and enter the democratic primary for the united states senate , the reaction as always seems to be the case with mr sharpton has been divided from the camps of the four previously declared candidates all longtime democratic standardbearers , none of whom is black the public response has not risen above the shrug level as a practical matter , we do n't see sharpton s entering the race as making a difference one way or the other , said john e burke , the campaign manager for state attorney general robert abrams , in a typical comment he is a person who is adept at attracting publicity to himself and will do everything to do that , but we do n't think he will attract that many votes in the black press , however , mr sharpton s announcement , on the city hall steps on martin luther king day , was front page news sharpton has one of the best political heads in the country , said wilbert a tatum , editor in chief of the amsterdam news , a black weekly he s been able to attract media attention to his every effort , thus making him a valuable political property just how valuable will perhaps finally be tested after years of enormous news coverage for mr sharpton s marches and demonstrations that frequently attracted no more than a few hundred participants critics have charged that he is more a flamboyant media creation than a leader with a wide following and his opposition will be daunting in addition to mr abrams , who has brought two indictments against him and who was his major adversary on the tawana brawley case , the candidates are geraldine r ferraro , the former congresswoman and democratic vicepresidential candidate , city comptroller elizabeth holtzman , who came within a hairbreadth of being elected to the senate in 1980 , and representative robert a mrazek of long island mr sharpton himself says he has no chance of winning but if he drew , say , 100 , 000 votes , which would probably be less then 10 percent of the turnout , he would pick up a powerful argument for his legitimacy he would also be likely to engage his opponents , particularly mr abrams , in potentially explosive debates and he would have a chance to inflict some wounds on one of his traditional , if overlooked , targets , the city s established black politicians he recently said i think i will beat a lot of black officials in their own districts it could really end up being a serious showdown on black leadership in this state to get to that point , mr sharpton would have to overcome a lot his perceived core of support comes from poor , disaffected blacks , who do n't vote heavily in democratic primaries he has never been through a political campaign , in which the first hurdle is just getting on the ballot to qualify , he must either get at least 25 percent of the votes at the democratic state convention this spring , which he says he wo n't even try to do , or collect a minimum of 20 , 000 valid signatures on nominating petitions over a few weeks in june and july more daunting , he would have to get at least 100 signatures each in half of the state s 33 congressional districts mr sharpton s difficulties would not stop there , even discounting his often gratingly unpopular stands for one thing , he lives with his wife and two daughters in a garden apartment in englewood , nj , although he says he also shares a residence with one of his aides , anthony charles , in crown heights for another , he endorsed the republican incumbent , alfonse m d'amato , during his 1986 reelection campaign , a move mr sharpton now characterizes as the worst mistake of his life then there is his pending indictment on state incometax evasion charges , which was brought by mr abrams s office and there is also the new alliance party , a political splinter group that has been accused of operating in a cultlike manner the group has championed mr sharpton s causes , and he also relies on it and its supporters for legal , public relations and financial help 'i know every activist' state democratic chairman john marino cited that association in deciding not to have the state committee act as host to an issues forum to let mr sharpton present his views to party insiders the notion that he s a democrat is questionable , he said that he s associated with the new alliance party makes it even more suspect mr sharpton said he would rely on a strategy modeled on the rev jesse jackson s 1984 presidential campaign , in which he got little support from established black politicians but built a formidable campaign largely off black churches i have been meeting with ministers all over the state and i know every activist there is , he said mr sharpton says he did not discuss the race with new alliance leaders , but would not keep them from helping his campaign his new jersey residency would not preclude him from running the only residency requirement governing the election for senate is that the winner be a resident of new york at the time of victory and his rejection of mr d'amato is oftstated mr sharpton is far from popular with many blacks ministers , elected officials and poor people included effect on black politicians there is some question about how his entrance into the race will affect black politicians many of the most prominent ones mayor david n dinkins excepted have endorsed either ms holtzman or mr abrams but some question whether they will work as hard for their candidates if a black politican is in the race and whether others might stay on the sidelines basil a paterson and representative charles b rangel of manhattan have endorsed mr abrams representative major r owens of brooklyn , state assemblyman herman d farrell jr , who is the manhattan county leader , and councilwoman c virginia fields , among others , have endorsed ms holtzman , according to ms holtzman s staff
buffalo , oct 21 here in erie county , many reagan democrats are finally drifting back to their party in this presidential election but a hardier species , which also came to life in 1980 , survives the d'amato democrat a striking number of democrats who plan to vote for bill clinton on nov 3 , after supporting ronald reagan and george bush , say they will switch over to the gop column to vote for senator alfonse m d'amato the reasons vary some people say they simply believe in mr d'amato s selfcharacterization as the senator pothole who has gotten things done , while others say they like the idea of backing a republican to keep an eye on what they assume will be a democratic white house and one man here laughingly but favorably likened mr d'amato s bombastic tenure to getting to watch your crazy uncle go to the senate many of the voters say they blame president bush for the state of the economy but there appears to be less inclination to fault senator d'amato personally , even though he has generally supported republican policies for 12 years now not inspiring trust and many say they are d'amato democrats by default less from any continuing ardor for the senator than from distaste for his opponent , attorney general robert abrams mr abrams has had to contend throughout this campaign with a cease less wave of commercials from the d'amato camp , seeking to transform him from a mildmannered public servant into a vicious mudslinger who is hopelessly liberal do n't ask me what it is , i just do n't trust abrams anymore , said betty a sienkiewicz of buffalo , and if anybody should like him , it s me my maiden name is abrams \( she is no relation \) frank mulderig , a laborer for the city buildings department , said of mr abrams , he s the kind of a guy who , if you told him he had 200 to spend on a problem , he 'd figure out a way to spend 250 said jack giardina , owner of the basilica diner in lackawanna , when it comes to holding the line on spending , you just need a more conservative guy than abrams none of these comments , of course , can be taken as any indication that mr d'amato will win the election in a state where democrats outnumber republicans by nearly three to two , and where mr clinton could attract a huge democratic turnout , mr abrams could probably prevail in this election even if a substantial number of conservative democrats defect to mr d'amato still a chance certainly there are plenty of reagan democrats here who say that their refound allegiance to the democratic party will include a vote for mr abrams and mr abrams could win back many more conservative democrats in the coming days vastly outfinanced by mr d'amato , he is just beginning to unleash the advertising blitz his aides have promised for the final days of the campaign but interviews with more than 80 registered voters and recent polls indicate that with less than two weeks until election day , mr d'amato is running a far more competitive race against mr abrams here than president bush is against mr clinton they also suggest that one important part of mr d'amato s strategy holding on to many of the conservative democrats who helped him squeak into the senate in 1980 and win comfortably in 1986 could well be successful his opposition to higher taxes and higher spending and support for the death penalty all classic reagan democrat issues have figured prominently in his ad campaign there is probably no better place to find the d'amato democrats than in largely bluecollar erie county , which consists of buffalo and its outlying suburbs and factory towns many voters here combine a virtually genetic registration in the democratic party with conservative values that have led many in recent years to vote for republicans anyway in mr d'amato s case , the numbers here are clear enough there are 269 , 737 registered democrats in erie county and 165 , 190 republicans , a margin that has persisted through the decade , and yet mr d'amato handily won the county in elections in 1980 and 1986 mr d'amato got 168 , 641 votes in 1986 to 116 , 357 for the democratic nominee , mark green in 1980 , he beat elizabeth holtzman 207 , 292 to 144 , 207 issues , not insults one remarkable undercurrent of this election season , in which mr clinton may have successfully fended off queries about extramarital relations and his draft status by challenging voters to stick to the real issues , like the economy , is that candidates like mr d'amato may succeed in doing the same thing with questions that would seem to go to the heart of the public trust the senator has been the subject of numerous investigations into allegations that he improperly intervened on behalf of his financial supporters , and a senate ethics committee report said he improperly allowed his brother , who has since been indicted , to use his office for lobbying activities but in a series of preemptive strikes , mr d'amato has attacked mr abrams s ethics in a series of television advertisements that seem to have helped the senator by fueling the disgust of many voters with mudslinging many people here reacted with hostility when asked whether they were concerned about mr d'amato s ethics
manchester , nh , jan 10 the candidate of political incorrectness was on a tear speaking to a packed auditorium of largely appreciative dartmouth students in hanover , nh , the other night , patrick j buchanan called the senior leader of china , deng xiaoping , an 85yearold chainsmoking communist dwarf he skewered charles r black jr , the bush campaign strategist who has been lobbying for a japanese consortium seeking american business , as a geisha girl of the new world order he mocked jack f kemp , the secretary of housing and urban development who has been the administration s chief advocate for the poor and minorities , saying he had gone native 'none of the above' to a young woman who complained about his jagged edge , mr buchanan replied in this campaign , i have been called an antisemite , a homophobe , a racist , a sexist , a nativist , a protectionist , an isolationist , a social fascist and a beerhall conservative and then sam donaldson had the nerve on the brinkley show to ask me if i was insensitive , too i am none of the above mr buchanan s comments on sensitive issues from immigration to israel to the homeless to foreign trade are not gaffes they are , in a way , the whole point of his america first campaign over the years , through his newspaper columns and television commentary , mr buchanan has become a wealthy celebrity by wrapping his rightwing views in spicy rhetoric indeed , he is wellheeled enough to drive a mercedesbenz and wear a hermes tie , possessions that might go better with a germany first or france first campaign the brawling teenager from northwest washington , who grew up in a world of clarity and absolutes where his father s political holy trinity was francisco franco , joseph r mccarthy and douglas macarthur , has turned into a brawling candidate seeking the presidency , or more realistically , the leadership of the conservative movement there is no conservative party in washington today , mr buchanan says there is a oneparty government the biggovernment republicans and the bigspending democrats have gotten together to raise taxes the country did n't want , to vote quotas the country did n't want , to vote congress a 40to50 percent pay raise that everybody in america said they did n't want mr buchanan openly longs for a return to the values and mores he grew up with in the cloistered world of 1950 s middleclass catholicism , days of latin masses and disciplinarian fathers who took off their leather belts to deal with smartmouthed children , days when no one had heard of cocaine or marijuana and the fights were usually over some girl , as mr buchanan recalled william buchanan , an accountant known as pop , taught his strapping sons to fight early , hanging a punching bag in the basement and telling the boys to hit the bag four times a week , 100 times with the left hand , 100 with the right , 200 with the onetwo by the time patrick buchanan and his brothers were teenagers , they were spoken of among washington catholic high school students with the same awe and fear with which romanian peasants spoke of vampires on monday mornings , in catholic high schools throughout the city , clusters of boys would gather to swap stories about what trouble the buchanan boys had wrought over the weekend , and to trade advice about avoiding the hooligans at all cost in his memoir , right from the beginning , mr buchanan recalls how he was suspended from georgetown university after he assaulted a couple of washington police officers who had stopped his car after he tried to pass them he wrote that he attacked one of the officers by putting a size 10 1 2cordovan where i thought it might do some good and vaulted him into the street mr buchanan still likes to poke people in the nose and kick them where he thinks it might do some good he just uses words now certainly , his strength is that he offers no weasel words he says things that many americans believe but are reluctant to say except in the privacy of their own homes a very smart person with very simple beliefs can be extremely effective , said michael kinsley , mr buchanan s former partner on the political television show crossfire mr buchanan s campaign slogan , america first , harks back to an isolationist movement before world war ii , several of whose leaders were considered german sympathizers gauging new hampshire but as he travels about new hampshire , it is clear that mr buchanan has correctly gauged voters' deep anger at president bush for staying too long at the global ball skull and bones international , as mr buchanan calls the bush presidency while middleclass americans were slipping into a deep recession touring a gun factory in claremont , one of the few new hampshire industries that has not been hit hard by the recession , mr buchanan told jim lavigne , you vote for me , my friend , and there wo n't be all those foreign trips japan , china , korea and germany we 've been supporting them for so long and they 're putting nothing back
the share of america s work force covered by company pensions is shrinking , reversing a decadesold trend of steady growth last year , an estimated 43 percent of workers participated in company pension plans , down from a peak of 49 percent in 1979 while women s participation in pension plans held almost steady , the drop for younger bluecollar men was far steeper than for the work force as a whole pensions are an important part of the private safety net , said david e bloom , an economist at columbia university that safety net seems to have developed a tear that got wider during the 1980 s a frayed safety net the pension safety net is being frayed by the same powerful forces paltry growth in productivity , the globalization of industry , the computer revolution that have slowed average gains in wages , sharply widened income disparities and produced an outright decline in bluecollar pay and union membership the groups that were hurt worst in terms of pension coverage the young , the male , the less educated were those whose real wages and employment fell most , mr bloom said he and richard b freeman , an economist at harvard university , have recently completed a study , the fall in private pension coverage in the us , that is about to be published in the proceedings of the american economics association william e even , associate director of the center for pension and retirement research at miami university in oxford , ohio , said , the decline increases the likelihood that these workers will postpone retirement , be poorer when they do retire and rely more heavily on social security and other government transfers changing labor market to be sure , the decline in pension coverage could turn around before most of today s workers retire , should the broad trends that have been buffeting the united states labor market change direction but there are few strong reasons to anticipate such a reversal in the meantime , the pool of money available for business investment could become more limited if a smaller proportion of the work force is enrolled in pension plans such a decline would further depress america s low saving rate and compound the problem of slow productivity and wage growth pensions are the way americans save , said john b shoven , an economist at stanford university , noting that twothirds of americans have no savings other than the equity in their homes and pensions in the last decade , pension assets tripled in dollar terms , thanks entirely to the rise in the stock market that rise equals the entire increase in the nation s wealth the broadest measure of savings for that period on average , company pensions now provide 17 percent of the income of people 55 and older , while social security provides 38 percent and personal savings 25 percent that portion provided by pensions has more than doubled from 30 years ago , and it has been growing faster than income from social security , which , in any case , was never meant to be the sole , or even main , source of support for elderly people the average includes people without pensions , wealthy people with large investment incomes and people who continue to work proposals in congress one measure of the concern in washington over receding pension coverage is that a halfdozen bills have been introduced in congress , all primarily intended to make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to offer pensions small businesses created most of the 20 million new jobs in the 1980 s expansion it s hard to find anyone in this town who is unconcerned , said richard ippolito , chief economist of the pension benefit guaranty corporation , the government agency that insures company plans to most people , the turnabout in pension coverage has come as something of a surprise not so many years ago , peter drucker , the management consultant , was predicting an era of pension socialism when workers would wind up owning most of the nation s wealth but by the end of the 1980 s , the average paycheck , adjusted for inflation , was no bigger than a typical worker s pay in 1979 pay declined outright for that half of the work force with only high school educations or less while the earnings of young white women with college degrees rose 14 percent a year during the 1980 s , for example , those of young white men with high school degrees , whose pay still exceeds that of their female counterparts , fell by roughly the same amount what workers prefer if you earn less , you want to save less , said professor bloom , who , like other labor economists , thinks of the compensation mix how much cash , how much in deferred forms like health coverage or pensions as a reflection of workers' preferences by the same token , companies had less incentive to offer pensions most companies in my industries have only union employees on a pension plan and most nonunion companies have none , said henry s hilaire , the owner of central connecticut acoustics inc , a commercial construction contractor , in wallingford quality people are standing in line to get work you can get them without offering a pension
albertville , france , feb 23 the xvi winter olympics ended today , just about the way they opened , with a curious but entertaining , tres francaise ceremony celebrating the games , the savoy region of france and the olympic spirit amid hundreds of local children , singers , dancers and olympic athletes , juan antonio samaranch , the president of the international olympic committee , beckoned the youth of the world to reconvene in lillehammer , norway , two years from now for the start of the winter olympics' new quadrennial cycle and would n't it be a treat if those games turned out as successfully as these \? for all the anxieties associated with organizing winter games spread across 600 square miles of mountainous terrain and holding a 16day party for a reconfigured world , the albertville olympics worked the glorious french alps became a warm and welcoming maitre d' in sight , sound and emotion so often , the french get a bad rap beyond their borders maybe in paris , the reputation is justified not here there was not a hint of haughtiness in the haut savoie as the games unfolded , the organizers and their volunteer staff of thousands could not have been friendlier or more accommodating for that , they deserved to celebrate themselves we delivered what we promised , jeanclaude killy , the 1968 olympic ski champion who served as copresident of the 1992 winter games organizing committee , said today in a final news conference he was ebullient , proud , even jocular , admitting that we still have not found our colombian athletes colombia became the running joke of these games that country s athletes were on the entry lists but never appeared to compete anyway , 2 , 174 athletes did compete , a record for the winter games , and so did 64 countries that was a record , too in the grandest way , friendliness and accommodation became the themes of these games with the recent melting away of political philosophies that used athletes as propaganda tools , the albertville olympics became the first devoid of any major usversusthem mentality there were new divisions , like separate teams from slovenia , croatia and yugoslavia and something called a unified team , a combination of athletes from five former soviet republics , and separate teams from three other former soviet republics , independent estonia , latvia and lithuania not that it all made much of a difference in practice the unified team finished second in the overall medal standing , with 23 to germany s 26 , and the independents won none nor did yugoslavia or any of its former republics a world turned upside down more change was evident at the microlevel vyacheslav tretiak , a goalie for the soviet union through four olympics , 19721984 , watched ray leblanc of the united states playing well in goal one night and turned to edwin moses , the american hurdler that s my boy , said tretiak , now a goalie coach for the chicago blackhawks leblanc is a minor leaguer in the chicago system germany s success 10 gold medals , 10 silver , 6 bronze was another reflection of new relationships the team arrived at the games as a nervous mix of athletes from vastly different political systems and made the best of it in 1988 , with nearly twice as many athletes , east germany and west germany had a combined total of 33 medals in their new forms , germany and the unified team kept touch with tradition as two of the leading medalwinners the united states held the same place it did four years ago , fifth , but with more medals , 11 , compared with the 6 it garnered in 1988 in calgary , alberta but four of those 11 medals came in sports that were not on the 1988 program , which means the 10 million more in financial support that american athletes training for albertville had over their counterparts preparing for calgary produced exactly one more medal at least no american athletes embarrassed themselves , as several did at the summer games in south korea in 1988 , when several swimmers were caught shoplifting this time the bad behavior came from a coach dave peterson , who led the hockey team to a fourthplace finish , refused to shake hands with the swedish coach and one of his assistants after the teams tied , 33 if the medal chart reflected disappointments , like switzerland s drop to 3 medals from 15 in calgary , it also showed other countries filling the breech norway jumped from 5 to 20 , with 9 golds , and 9 over all in crosscountry skiing events austria increased from 10 to 21 , dominating alpine ski events with 8 medals as the host country , france won more medals , 9 , than any previous host since the united states won 12 medals at the 1980 lake placid games and over all , 20 countries won medals , 2 more than in calgary the games also produced a snowfall of poignant moments cbs sports always made sure nancy kerrigan s mother had a monitor to watch her daugher skate brenda kerrigan is nearly blind and must sit with her nose to the screen the night her daughter won the bronze medal , she was at rinkside , cheering , in front of her set when dan jansen finished his 500meter speedskating race , albeit in a time that won him only fourth place , his mother , gerry jensen , looked as if she were finally drained of tension four years before in the same event , on the same day his sister died of cancer , jansen had fallen and there on the podium stood viktor petrenko , the new men s champion in figure skating , an athlete from ukraine , a former soviet republic that is part of the commonwealth of independent states as a flag bearing the olympic rings was raised and the olympic anthem was played , as agreed upon last month by officials of the unified team , his face was blank if it had been his flag and anthem , said paul wylie of denver , the silvermedalist , he 'd have bawled the sadness of russia was evident elsewhere athletes were selling their training suits and competition uniforms , some bearing the cyrillic letters cccp that stood for ussr and as their events ended , they left their olympic villages immediately , rather than spend more hard currency , so precious now in all the republics but then there was the french hockey team , whose practice the day after the team clinched a place in the medal round was canceled because of too much celebrating the night before in the end , the french had much to celebrate , and not just the hockey players by any measure , the albertville olympics , a risky gamble for their disparate nature , were a resounding triumph they brought the savoy region the new roads it needed they brought alpine resort owners exposure of inestimable value through worldwide television and for 16 days , at least , they brought a fastchanging world together in the

sevastopol , ukraine , april 11 the ukrainian government is quietly taking steps to build its own naval force as ukrainians and russians await a political decision on the future of the black sea fleet , which has been a major point of contention between them ukrainian military representatives have set up a temporary base in an old training school for ensigns troops in training at the school have started clearing out a building for the new fleet command , carrying out busts of lenin and billboards touting the glories of the old soviet system we need to remove the symbols of the old system , capt viktor karendovych said friday president boris n yeltsin of russia and president leonid m kravchuk of ukraine had both laid claim to the black sea fleet in a dispute that threatened to open up divisions over military policy in the new commonwealth of independent states as well as raising the potentially bitter question of the ownership of the crimea the black sea peninsula has belonged to ukraine since 1954 , although russia feels a deep historical claim and ethnic russians are a majority in the peninsula monday meeting is planned on thursday , mr yeltsin and mr kravchuk backed away from a confrontation by agreeing to set up a commission on the fleet s fate ukrainian and russian officials are to meet in odessa on monday to discuss the issue and as a visit to this port city showed today , ukraine is moving ahead with creating an administrative command structure for its own navy military officials here say that ukraine does not want the entire black sea fleet , but that its naval force will be based on part of the existing fleet at a news conference friday , the commander of the ukrainian naval fleet , vice adm boris kozhyn , said that while he has no fleet , no administrative structure and none of the powers needed to build his force , he was confident that the issue would soon be resolved ukraine has the right to have a fleet , he said , adding that even admiral igor kasatonov , the commander of the fleet , has acknowledged this admiral kasatonov has said that if the fleet is divided , he would serve russia in january , ukraine ordered the fleet s officers and sailors to take a loyalty oath to the new and independent ukraine some complied , but many refused some who wanted to take the oath say they were blocked by officers opinions of the sailors sailors on a few of the ships docked in sevastopol have their own opinions on resolving the controversy and for many , the issue is determined by nationality most russian sailors say they feel that the fleet should stay whole and should belong to the commonwealth on the antisubmarine cruiser red crimea , which carries about 300 sailors , andrei prisyakov said that if the fleet is divided , he hopes his ship will fall under russia s jurisdiction it s been under russia s command for 70 years and it should stay that way , he said if i'm forced to choose , i 'll only serve russia another sailor , 20yearold dmitri polyak , said that he plans to take the ukrainian oath but that his colleagues on the ship have ridiculed him and called him names even the officers have said it s foolish to take the oath a second time , he said they tell us , 'do n't waste your time' a few sailors , however , say the issue is simpler their oath of allegiance to the soviet union no longer holds because the country no longer exists grigory garnitsky said i made my mind up a long time ago i'm just waiting for the right time to take the oath again i do n't feel like a traitor because when i took the oath to the soviet union , i knew ukraine was a part of it now the union no longer exists and i'm still serving ukraine map of ukraine , indicating sevastopol on the black sea
do we need to know that arthur ashe has aids \? the question , perhaps journalistically incorrect , bubbled up on wednesday afternoon during his news conference my first answer to myself was an emotional no here was a man whose public life has been about fairness , responsibility , respect and selfcontrol for the last three years he had tightly gripped the fraying corners of his life now they were being torn from his hands ashe has always been good at being private , keeping secrets and his composure he had to be , the first and only black american man to succeed in tennis , and to do it at a time of racial turbulence when both radicals and reactionaries demanded that he front for them he fronted only for his own beliefs , once he had thoughtfully come to them he began to lose some control of his life after his heart attack and major surgeries he lost more in 1988 when he learned he had aids but he controlled his public persona until wednesday now , he would no longer be unfettered , free to act and react without being judged and assaulted by yet another broadside of other people s assumptions and demands i have an inkling of what he has been going through fourteen years ago , after a cancer diagnosis , my first reaction was to bury the story before it buried me the word was still whispered then , people s eyes changed at the news who would give me a longterm book contract \? the big c on my forehead would immediately change the context in which people would see me and my work my second reaction was ask national public radio , for whom i was then doing commentaries , to let me broadcast from my hospital bed , combat reports from the cancer zone we 'll break down the barriers , demystify the disease , give comfort to my afflicted brothers and sisters , make it harder for government to ignore us let s rock , said npr i never did it i got better who needs the aggravation \? who wants to be defined by a disease \? i have work to do , a family to be with i do n't need to be burdened by other people s fears , by the obligations other people will load on me small potatoes compared to what ashe is going through yet why is his privacy more vulnerable than mine or yours \? because he is a public figure , proven by his power to summon 24 cameras , at least a couple of them transmitting live \? was that his faustian bargain \? in return for being able to break his bad news on cnn , he cannot stop usa today from printing it in return for being able to market his causes , his books , his tv appearances , his newspaper columns , he cannot secure the most intimate secrets of his life , ones that such professionals as lawyers and doctors are sworn to keep , from being cast out between ads and commercials to be clucked and commented over by you and me which brings us to the mets the investigation against three of them accused of sexual assault was officially ended yesterday no charges will be filed the assumption , at least for now , is that nothing , at least nothing actionable , happened but along the way , their three names , and the name of another met accused in a civil suit , were dragged through media offal if arthur ashe s privacy is to somehow be respected , if not actually protected , then the mets deserve no less these stories , journalists say , are newsworthy does that mean the public needs to know them or we need to produce them to stay in business \? it may be easier for the new york times to take a sanctimonious position on this than for a paper or tv show that can only survive with sensational speculation this is an old story in sports as elsewhere almost 80 years ago , a young newspaper reporter agonized for almost six months before revealing that the olympic champion , jim thorpe , had taken money to play minor league baseball the reporter considered himself a man of integrity he was doing his job what about the people who knew ashe was sick , including one of the best and most respected sports journalists , frank deford , who wrote a book with him deford kept the secret as a friend , a business partner , a responsible journalist \? does it matter \? is every story , every subject , case by case \? should a good person such as ashe be protected more than a bad person such as mike tyson \? was thorpe good or bad \? the questions are lurking out there in ambush , beyond breastbeating or fingerpointing or the convocation of yet another ethics seminar meanwhile , do we need to know that arthur ashe has aids \? for now , my gut answer is still no
miami , april 4 after a heated legal dispute that was resolved at the last minute this morning , the fate of gen manuel antonio noriega , the former maximum leader of panama who has spent the last two years as a prisoner in a jail cell here , has at last been placed in the hands of an american jury but the nine women and three men are deliberating on a case of such volume and complexity that they face a formidable task in deciding whether the general should remain behind bars for the rest of his life in terms of interest , various problems , hard work and frustration , this case is no 1 , judge william m hoeveler told reporters at a news conference today visibly relieved that the charges of cocaine trafficking , racketeering and money laundering against general noriega were now up to others to deal with , he described the sevenmonth trial as a demanding test of the american legal system because of the personalities and the issues involved even this morning , more than 12 hours after the charges had formally been handed over to the jury for deliberation , haggling continued at an unusual hearing before judge hoeveler , prosecution and defense lawyers fought over which version of the indictment should be submitted to the jury , with general noriega himself getting into the act to remind the judge that the charges against him had led to fire , blood and tears between two countries the dispute delayed the start of deliberations by keeping the the jury from having a copy of an indictment on which to base its decision after hearing arguments , judge hoeveler made a compromise ruling that he described as a bit of babysplitting , removing two counts that had been dropped before the trial but retaining all other material fewer fireworks in many respects , the first trial of a foreign head of state in an american courtroom failed to live up to the predictions made for it when when general noriega gave himself up to united states military authorities in panama in january 1990 in the end , the trial proved to be less an examination of the darkest areas of american foreign policy than what prosecutors described as just another drug case , albeit one with an unusually prominent defendant virtually without exception , defense efforts to introduce evidence that would show general noriega worked closely with and was supported by american military and intelligence agencies for much of his career were rebuffed on grounds of national security or irrelevance to the 10 counts of cocaine trafficking , money laundering and racketeering with which the panamanian leader has been charged nevertheless , an acquittal of general noriega , who would face as much as 160 years in prison if convicted of all charges , would be a significant embarrassment for the bush administration , which is already under attack in an election year for its failure to oust saddam hussein as president of iraq hundreds of panamanians and two dozen americans died in the december 1989 invasion of panama , and more than 1 billion in damages were inflicted on the tiny isthmus nation and with a witness list that ranged from carlos lehder rivas , one of the founders of the medellin cocaine cartel , to adm daniel murphy , who was chief of staff for george bush during the reagan administration , the trial could not help but provide bizarre juxtapositions that brought the worlds of statecraft and drug trafficking together there were also any number of unusual legal situations that found lawyers and judge alike on uncertain ground a slimmer indictment in this morning s final courtroom battle , prosecution lawyers argued that the original version of the indictment handed down in february 1988 , which mentions incidents and witnesses never discussed in the trial , should be streamlined so jurors would not be confused but the defense counsel maintained that the jury ought to be allowed to see the complete indictment , through which it would learn that several of the accusations against general noriega were so lacking in evidence that they had to be dropped i wait until this moment to see evidence of these and other charges , general noriega told judge hoeveler , in his first public comment on the accusations against him since the trial began last september therefore , i am respectfully asking you that these charges go in their complete form to the jury or that none of them go at all regardless of its outcome , the noriega case is sure to provide legal scholars fodder for years to come issues that were ignored during the trial itself , such as the legal basis for trying a foreign head of state taken into custody as part of an american military invasion and who claims to be a prisoner of war , are likely to be raised on appeal if general noriega is convicted then there was the government s novel argument that the sixth amendment right to a fair trial does not protect foreigners until they are in the jurisdiction of the united states until the panamanian leader arrived here , they contended , he was in a nonconstitutional relationship with the american lawyers he hired after he was first indicted in february 1988 , and therefore not entitled to lawyerclient secrecy and other rights guaranteed to americans charged with crimes questions about witnesses
newark , nov 30 defense lawyers in the glen ridge sex assault trial have tried to paint two images of the mildly retarded woman whom the state says was assaulted with a broomstick and a narrow bat by four former football teammates one picture is of an overly sexed , sexually aggressive teenage girl , who , at ages 15 and 16 , peeked at naked boys in a locker room , propositioned a boy at a summer camp as well as a group of athletes in a high school lunch room and enjoyed the sex acts the state has charged were crimes that depiction is the defense counterpoint to the prosecution s portrayal of her as an easily manipulated , vulnerable and friendless girl who was mocked from childhood and whose mental impairment and iq of 64 left her incapable of consenting to sex the other defense image is of a young woman of questionable veracity who cannot be believed as a witness against the four defendants none of the four defense lawyers has called her sexcrazed or a liar directly , but their implications during seven weeks of the trial have been none too subtle the first image has been built in a torrent of questions about the young woman s birth control pills , her sexual attitudes and thoughts , her expulsion from a camp for the handicapped and her removal from a high school the questions were put to her mother , her older sister , a friend , a former basketball teammate at glen ridge high and the basketball team s former manager to raise the image of doubtful credibility , the defense team has sprinkled amid its torrent of questions about the woman s sexual past a few about her understanding of the concepts of truth and lying and of a trial witness s sworn oath a psychologist testifying for the prosecution , dr susan esquilin , told louis esposito , who represents kyle scherzer , the twin brother of kevin scherzer , another defendant , that the young woman understands the difference between a lie and the truth yet , she testified , i do n't know how much she understands the consequences of lying the psychologist also told the defense lawyer that the young woman s memory of time and sequencing is very confused and that she could have problems recalling and sorting out details of the alleged assault will accuser testify \? the veracity issue seems to be the underpinning for a defense motion to prevent the young woman from testifying on the grounds that she is incompetent judge r benjamin cohen has granted the defense a hearing on the question of disqualifying her the hearing was to have been held tuesday morning , but a few hours after court ended today the prosecution canceled its plans to have the young woman appear the prosecutors , robert laurino and glenn d goldberg , decided to reschedule her appearance on the competency issue for the same day she is scheduled to appear as a witness against the four defendants that is expected to occur sometime next week loss of the young woman as a witness would be a serious blow to the prosecution until 1967 , when rules governing witness disqualification were tightened in new jersey , trial judges had greater latitude in barring witnesses with mental disabilities now there are basically only two grounds for disqualifying witnesses as incompetent that they cannot express themselves understandably and that they are incapable of understanding the obligation to tell the truth in this case , the defense must prove one of the two alan zegas , lawyer for bryant grober , now 21 , is leading the effort for disqualification the question that has to be answered in the end is whether she understands the oath and the consequences of lying , mr zegas said outside court the other day we have reasons from testimony to raise the question a friend s recollections until today , all that the jury has heard about the sexual episode in the scherzer basement is cursory descriptions of the beginning of an act of fellatio involving mr grober the descriptions came from three of six teenage boys who were in the basement but said they left moments after seven teammates on the 1988 glen ridge football team gathered around the young woman and she began undressing in testimony today , the young woman s best friend , jennifer lipinski , a 21yearold senior at the university of delaware , said the woman told her three or four days after the episode that she had been assaulted in the scherzer twins' home with a little bat she said she went to the scherzer basement , miss lipinski said there was a little bat that was used vaseline was also used and they stuck it up her she said she was coerced into going down there and was forced into doing it miss lipinski said the young woman told her there were a lot of youths in the basement but she did not identify any of them to her , miss lipinski said before the jurors were dismissed for the day , judge cohen told them that miss lipinski s testimony was not proof any sexual act occurred her statement was admitted only to prevent the jury from falsely assuming the young woman did not complain to anyone , the judge said variations in memory during her testimony , the mother said that her daughter had told her in may 1990 , a few days after the first indictment was issued in the case , that she had lied about the involvement of another young man , richard corcoran , who is awaiting a separate trial in the case her daughter , the woman said , said she did not tell the truth about the boy she added , she said he did n't do it a short while before this testimony , the mother had said her daughter was incapable of telling a major lie but she later acknowledged to thomas ford , who represents christopher archer , the fourth defendant in the trial , that her daughter s statement about mr corcoran was a major lie the mother also told defense lawyers that her daughter has difficulty telling a complete story in one sitting you have to draw it out from her , she said
for all the contempt in which gounod s faust is now generally held , the stubborn fact remains that the opera refuses to go away it s startling to realize that with the latest influx of releases , all six stereo recordings are available on cd from toulouse comes emi s latest attempt at the opera , conducted by michel plasson \( cdcc 54228 cd \) then there s a midprice reissue of erato s 1976 strasbourg recording , conducted by alain lombard \( 2292 456852 cd \) finally , there s a faust installment in the great operas at the met series 144 minutes' worth of commercially recorded excerpts , spanning the period 1905 to 1978 , by artists who sang these roles with the company \( met 513 cd and cassette available from the metropolitan opera guild , 70 lincoln center plaza , new york , ny 10023 \) the problem for the collector is that the complete recordings give such a sketchy idea of what makes faust not only durable , but also a great piece of music theater consider the two versions at hand , made in similar , seemingly sensible ways plausiblelooking international casts were brought together with the lombardstrasbourgerato and plassontoulouseemi teams , which had both produced bodies of honorable recorded work in the finished product , however , hardly anyone seems to have a clue true , the singers are under pressure with writing that takes for granted voices that are strong , limber , wideranging and beautiful their insufficiencies are spotlighted , and their limited vocal options minimize the possibilities for making the music personally compelling but this still does n't explain the blankness of the results number after number is dutifully discharged without the simplest level of belief and faust under these conditions lives down to the image of its detractors as a padded collection of salonsuitable set pieces what s more , both performances succumb to the mystifying trend toward slower tempos for faust the erato recording can be leaden , dragging the singers down montserrat caballe sounds physically weighted , with frequent pitch sag and an exposed slow beat in the tone giacomo aragall , whose bigscaled tenor might have created some excitement in faust s music , is n't in good focus vocally or for that matter dramatically philippe huttenlocher , a likable mediumrange baritone , does seem to have an idea of what the music is about but does n't have the freedom of vocal expression needed to bring valentin to life paul plishka comes closer to the mark despite the noise components in the voice , this is an apt mephistophelean bass , and some of his singing as in the nuit de walpurgis is straightforwardly persuasive the emi recording , while less stretched out , is often stuck in an even less mobile , notebynote slog both the singers and the conductor seem to have lost the sense that the music is sprung by the rhythms of human experience and need while tenors no more robust vocally than richard leech have done great things with faust , he does n't do more than sing the role moderately well jose van dam s unbasslike bassbaritone is an improbable instrument for mephisto , but his unforced approach yields a firm , lovely serenade recessiveness is an odd quality for a devil , though , and , surprisingly , he does n't rise to the challenge of the highlying invocation to the night two singers are in fact heard to betterthanusual advantage , and it still does n't seem to help cheryl studer s soprano scales down rather attractively , and she can negotiate marguerite without having to integrate this sound with the full weight of which her voice should be , and sometimes is , capable but this also means that a major part of her potential expressive vocabulary has been lopped off similarly , the high lie of valentin s writing keeps thomas hampson better anchored than more comfortably placed music , which allows him to slide over the surface , or music that demands fuller vocal integration and thereby ties him in knots his excellent french might be genuinely communicative if there were evidence that he had something more than generalized energy to communicate still , the vigorous middle section of his aria and the ringing intensity of his death scene are as close as these performances get to presenting a real character in vocal pursuit of real needs but listen to mr hampson s anti climactic sword chorale , and then listen to some of the competing valentins ernest blanc , pavel lisitsian , henri legay or note the concentration and intensity of pasquale amato , thundering forth not only his solo lines but also those shared by the chorus in his 1912 recording , included in the met faust compilation almost everything in the met set is worth hearing , and a lot of it is wonderful there s a sprinkling of welcome offbeat material , like the 1940 final trio with the young eleanor steber , armand tokatyan and norman cordon , from the world s greatest operas series \( steber is also heard in two excerpts from columbia s quite solid 1951 met faust recording with eugene conley and cesare siepi , currently unavailable \) the technical quality is high , and david hamilton s fastidious editorial hand extends to the presentation , which features complete texts arranged in sequential form , including even texts for selections sung in wrong languages unfortunately , faust is more problematic than the 13 other operas so far covered in the series \( next up is der rosenkav alier \) , and this set does n't plug the gaps in the complete recordings as well as might be hoped it is , of course , limited by what was recorded commercially for example , you would never imagine from giuseppe di stefano s oddly interesting 1959 salut , demeure the communicative hunger as well as vocal brilliance of his 1949 met broadcast performance and while ezio pinza made better commercial faust recordings than the welcomely unfamiliar 1952 serenade heard here \( with a bawling jan peerce in the leadin scene \) , even they do n't suggest his knockout mephisto in the 1940 met broadcast in addition , the met series avoids duplicating selections from its other reissue projects so jussi bjoerling , for one , is n't here at all his stunning recordings of salut , demeure the entire commercial discography of one of his greatest roles were understandably both issued previously then , a fair number of prominent singers are off form or do n't have much to say about faust which leads inescapably to the subjective question of what there is to say about faust and a set that has four versions of valentin s aria and none of the second half of the opening scene \( faust s summons of mephisto \) is n't aiming for my idea of faust to be sure , if you search for it , you will find the first half of the opening scene , faust s great monologue preparing for his intended suicide , and in the stupendous recording by georges thill a reissue of all of thill s faust excerpts would be a primary recommendation , as would the excerpts recorded by caruso and his illustrious playmates \( some of them in the met compilation \) as impressive as thill is cesar vezzani , in the 1932 emi faust with marcel journet as mephisto \( available on cd \) among the stereo sets , a case of sorts can be made for any except philips s in the matter of performing text \( and is this a nightmare ! \) , both erato and emi offer generous editions emi also appends four numbers 14 minutes' worth of music cut from the opera in its early stages photos ezio pinza s great mephisto at the metropolitan opera is evoked , if only indirectly , in a cd anthology \( the new york times \) \( pg 27 \) georges thill is represented in a metropolitan opera reissue set of cd s by his recording of faust s great act i monologue \( carlo edwards \) \( pg 32 \)
the late summer fields are filled now with a pretty and graceful wildflower that has given a kind of botanical immortality to a queen who was not at all pretty queen anne of england , whose only recorded grace was a harmonious voice , was fat and plain her namesake , queen anne s lace , is delicate and a marvel of floral intricacy the large umbrellalike flower is a cluster of clusters hundreds of fivepetal florets arranged in small clumps on top of tall stems with finely cut foliage the white blossoms wave in the slightest breeze , drawing the attention of bees and butterflies when they have finished the job of fertilizing , the flower closes up to protect its seeds from birds and gives off a faint turpentine odor to keep mice away queen anne s lace is called an escape , a cultivated flower that left the garden to live in the wilds , as did day lilies , tansy and honeysuckle the virginia colonists brought it to america for their elegant flower beds the puritans used it as a medicinal herb but not , as the ancient greeks andromans did , for a love potion the puritans would have none of that pagan nonsense they prescribed the plant for dropsy , bladder problems and flatulence officially the plant is called daucus carota and it is a wild carrot , the stringy ancestor of today s edible root but the flower s familiar name came , according to royal story , when anne challenged her ladies in waiting to make an embroidery that was as exquisite as the flower since no one could outdo the queen , she won her own competition , and the worthy vegetable won its royal name drawing

tokyo , monday , july 27 japan s governing liberal democratic party rebounded from its worst setback in postwar history , winning more than half the seats in a parliamentary election on sunday and apparently securing prime minister kiichi miyazawa s hold on office but the victory was ambiguous , filled with signs that voters were returning to the conservative party fold more because of a perceived lack of alternatives than because of enthusiasm according to nhk , the governmentaffiliated broadcaster , the liberal democrats won at least 68 seats , or 54 percent of the 127 up for election in the upper house , a huge increase over the 36 seats it won in 1989 voter turnout , at 507 percent , was the lowest in postwar history , and polls indicated that at a time of economic downturn and plunging stock prices , voters were in a particularly cautious mood still needs a coalition even with the victory , mr miyazawa s party will not regain control of the 252member upper house , which it lost three years ago because of an influencepeddling scandal and intense voter resentment over a new sales tax it will still be forced to cobble together majorities with the smaller parties , as it did last month to pass a bill authorizing japan to send troops abroad for the first time since world war ii , as a part of united nations peacekeeping forces party leaders were quick to declare the election a successful referendum on the peacekeeping bill i think we were successful in letting people understand that without the prosperity of the world , there is no prosperity in japan , said tamisuke watanuki , the secretary general of the party candidates who opposed the peacekeeping bill , however , did well in hiroshima and in okinawa those areas suffered the heaviest casualties in japan during world war ii , and opposition to reinterpreting the constitution to allow troops to be sent abroad ran strong defeat for the socialists if the current voting trends continue , the party should regain its majority in the upper house three years from now , in the next upper house election sometime in the next year and a half the government must also hold elections for the more powerful lower house , where the liberal democrats have a significant majority the big loser was the socialist party , which took 22 seats , or fewer than half of the number it won three years ago at that time the party seemed to pose a major threat to the liberal democrats but its star has faded quickly , with many of those who supported the party in the last election concluding that it had failed to deliver on its promise to reinvigorate japanese politics another sign of dissatisfaction lay in the surprisingly strong support for the japan new party , formed just a few months ago the party , which maintains that the government has grown far too powerful , won four seats while the percentage was small , it was a strong start in the end it seemed that the economy played to the ruling party s advantage by united states standards the current downturn is relatively mild , with the economy still growing by 2 to 3 percent a year and unemployment rates seemingly unaffected but companies have severely cut back overtime and reduced parttime hiring moreover , the huge fall in stock prices , to a sixyear low , has led to a sharp decline in consumer spending as a result , even though the governing party has been plagued by scandals and has fulfilled none of its pledges for political reform , voters associated it with japan s economic rise it sounds strange , but while people say we need a drastic change , in politics and the economy , they reach for stability , said yuichi ichikawa , the secretary general of the komeito or clean government party the komeito did better than expected , winning 14 seats , and another centrist party , the democratic socialists , won three the communist party took six seats but mr miyazawa s influence within the party seemed subtly undercut by the election sixty percent of the seats up for election represent specific districts but the remaining seats are at large , apportioned according to the nationwide vote the parties are free to award those seats to whomever they wish the majority of the liberal democrats' seats were secured by the party s largest faction , followers of noboru takeshita , a former prime minister he was forced to resign as premier in 1989 , just a few months before the last election , when he was tainted by an influencepeddling scandal thus he took a low profile during the campaign , but he remains a major behindthescenes player with his faction bolstered , he seems likely to gain considerable power perhaps the most striking statistic was the 507 percent voter turnout three years ago , 65 percent of the 94 million voters went to the polls one reason may have been the weather central japan was gripped by humid weather that made standing in unairconditioned school gymnasiums less than attractive many may have stayed home to watch the opening of the olympics , and others left town at the beginning of the summer vacation but many others told poll takers they were just frustrated by their choices , and did not see the point photo prime minister kiichi miyazawa painting the second eye on a traditional daruma doll as a sign of victory last night after his liberal democratic party s

montreal cecil smith sat in claude robillard center on thursday afternoon , discussing canada s olympic hopefuls as he watched athletes compete on the first day of trials for the canadian olympic track team when ben johnson s name came up , smith , the president of the ontario track and field federation , smiled , then grunted it will soon be over , smith said , referring to johnson s career soon that is generally the reaction johnson has received since being stripped of his olympic gold medal and banned for two years from international competition for testing positive for steroids during the 1988 seoul olympics almost overnight , johnson tumbled from canadian national hero to pariah on wednesday , johnson had been an unexpected , uninvited guest at a news conference being held to promote this week s trials the 30yearold sprinter boldly predicted that he would make the canadian team as a sprinter and then raised some eyebrows by saying that he would not go to barcelona just to run on the relay team in the next day s papers , columnists ridiculed johnson s arrogance one referred to him as a demon and asked why he did n't just go away nearly four years after his fall , ben johnson is still the canadian story , perhaps because he is canada s persistent nightmare none of the penalties johnson received in 1988 will remove the embarrassment and deeper , gnawing sense of complicity many canadians felt in the wake of the steroid scandal smith said the basis of the venom toward johnson is a feeling that he conned the public , conned officials , conned everyone but johnson did n't con anyone they conned themselves smith conceded that everyone , including himself , suspected that johnson and several other athletes were using steroids but the suspicions were overwhelmed by the deluge of prestige and revenue being generated by johnson s fame psychologically , johnson had been the perfect antidote for canada s anemic view of itself as an international sports entity dr george m \( jamie \) astaphan , the physician who was accused of administering anabolic steroids to a number of canadian athletes including johnson , was asked how he thought canadians would fare competing clean against other nations here we are , he said , 112 canadian athletes , all clean , all welldressed and they 'll all do boo they wo n't even come in last compared with the relative ambivalence toward performanceenhancing drugs in the united states , canadian indignation over johnson s ban is almost amusing the united states is a labyrinth of minds that produce , with the eager help of parents , healthy bodies for a sprawling sports industry basketball , baseball , football , hockey , boxing , tennis each sport begins with hundreds of thousands of children , eliminating the less competent at each level until finally producing a small elite corps the insanity is rooted in the athletes' willingness to do anything to advance to the next level occasionally there is a highly publicized tragedy a hank gathers , fully aware of a hazardous heart condition , dies on the basketball court or a lyle alzado dies of brain cancer that he says was caused by prolonged use of anabolic steroids the public thinks about it and moves on we never seriously consider that the same warped priorities that would prompt gathers to play with his heart condition or alzado to ravage his body with steroids also allow us to make millionaires out of athletes while seriously devaluing teachers perhaps the impassioned support for professional sports in this country is simply our way of acknowledging certain sorrowful compromises we have made in exchange for success for all the public hand wringing about steroids , the truth is that we do n't really care how an athlete gets to wimbledon or barcelona or to the super bowl or the national basketball association finals just hit the winners , set the records , score touchdowns and dunk canadian ambitions do n't run nearly so deep but johnson s rise and fall provide alarming evidence that even here there is a distinct national appetite for success at any cost cecil smith said the tragedy of ben johnson is that johnson could have been good without drugs he could have competed against himself , smith said instead , he chose to compete against the rest of the world how good could he have been \? he 'll look into the mirror now and never know and for several years to come , canadians will look into their mirrors and see ben johnson he is the good thing that wo n't go away photo ben johnson \( canadian press \)

when the jets open training camp on wednesday in preparation for the third season under coach bruce coslet and general manager dick steinberg , they will be looking for ways to break away from the pack of playoff pretenders all players under contract are supposed to report by 7 pm tuesday to the training center in hempstead , li physicals will be conducted on wednesday , and the first practice will be held thursday afternoon the jets are starting camp a week early this year because they play their first preseason game , against the eagles in the hall of fame game at canton , ohio , on aug 1 it appears that the jets have made major strides toward respectability in the two seasons that steinberg and coslet have been in charge they took a team with a 214 record in 1989 and improved it to 610 in 1990 and 88 last season , when the jets made the playoffs for the first time since 1986 last year s performance has generated high expectations from fans for this season but steinberg , speaking with a mixture of caution and realism last week , would like to temper those expectations we 're a middleofthepack team right now , he said if we can get some improvement from some of these younger players and develop some depth in key areas , then i think we 've got a chance to get better to that end , the jets head into training camp with a lot of experiments on the front burners browning nagle , a secondyear quarterback , will be given ample opportunity to unseat the veteran starter , ken o'brien , who has n't signed a contract with the team yet erik mcmillan , who lost his starting freesafety job last year , will compete with mike brim for the starting left cornerback job linebacker mo lewis , the only rookie to start last year , will move from strongside linebacker to weakside linebacker and defensive tackle dennis byrd will move to defensive end , giving mark gunn a chance to earn a starting position at tackle mobile , with a strong arm the nagle experiment has the potential to change the complexion of the jets' offense nagle offers the jets a strongarmed quarterback with decent mobility who can create things by rolling out and throwing deep and although he has had intensive classroom sessions and has been working extensively with receivers during the off season , nagle still lacks game experience nagle should get a lot of playing time during the jets' five exhibition games and he could get the bulk of the snaps in practice because steinberg said he was not optimistic that o'brien would be signed before the start of camp and the jets wo n't be in a hurry to sign o'brien unless nagle shows that he ca n't run the offense we 'd like for ken to be here because it is an open competition , steinberg said but if he s not here , that just means there will be more reps for the other quarterbacks if nagle can nail down the starting job , steinberg said it would considerably change our style of offense waiting for mitchell steinberg was more optimistic that tight end johnny mitchell , the jets' firstround draft pick , would be signed in time for training camp mitchell has been working out at the jets' training center with nagle at 6 feet 3 inches , 263 pounds , mitchell has the size , speed and passcatching ability to give the jets an offensive threat at tight end that they did n't have last season steinberg acknowledged that none of the defensive experiments will have the kind of profound effect that the nagle test will have on offense but among the moves steinberg pointed out as significant is byrd s moving from tackle to defensive end and lewis moving from strong side to weak side linebacker byrd will be replacing marvin washington at the left defensive end spot , while gunn , a rookie last year , will switch to byrd s interior position washington had surgery on his shoulder during the off season and is still recovering , and the jets do n't want to risk going into the season with a defensive end who is n't completely healthy if lewis can master the right outside linebacker position , that will give one of the rookies a chance to do what lewis did last year start in his first season the competition at left outside linebacker will be among bobby houston and the rookies kurt barber , the secondround pick , and glenn cadrez , the sixthround pick apparently lost in the linebacker shuffle is joe kelly , who started at the right outside spot last year the jets want kelly to be a utility linebacker , playing backup at all three positions with the retirement of kicker pat leahy , competition for the kicking job will come down to raul allegre , an eightyear veteran and former giants kicker , and jason staurovsky , a plan b acquisition from new england
loosestrife , which had its new york premiere with the merce cunningham dance company on wednesday night , is a compelling work , so overflowing with an abundance of varied movement that its shapes recall mythical beasts of antiquity the voracious inventiveness of the choreography goes well with the strangeness of the title loosestrife is a wildflower , apparently attractive to insects and apt to take over the terrain on which it grows following the company s splendid revival of exchange , a powerful and invigorating piece from 1978 , and the sensuous native green from 1985 , loosestrife completed what was , in effect , an eveninglong showcase of cunningham openendedness choreography by juxtaposition rather than by linear logic mr cunningham has dedicated this piece which he performed with 15 other dancers at the city center \( 131 west 55th street \) to michel guy , the french arts patron and former minister of culture , who died in 1990 mr guy was one of mr cunningham s early supporters and founded the festival d'automne in paris loosestrife was created for the festival s 20th anniversary last year , and it comes across as a deeply personal work this is not only because mr guy was a good friend to the company but because it begins with mr cunningham , alone before a gray backdrop , plunging full force into a strangely intense solo he lunges forward , shoots his arms out , raises a shoulder and walks in profile this swift phrase of isolated movements continues as other dancers enter , one by one loosestrife has a visible if not totally comprehensible structure the dancers accumulate in the first half but their numbers are gradually reduced in the second mr cunningham has said beforehand that the work has 13 sections , conceived as territories upon which his invisible loosestrife grows and spreads certainly there is some sort of delineation between segments , sometimes defined by mr cunningham s own entrances and exits after contracting his torso with staccato fierceness , he ends his first solo by turning on his heel , looking over his shoulder and walking out yet in the end , loosestrife seems to grow into an ode to unison dancing none of this negates the way highly individualized perfection comes to the fore alan good , always ferocious in his vigor , was especially prominent along with victoria finlayson mixed signals , michael pugliese s score , executed by takehisa kosugi and the composer in the pit , went unheard during mr cunningham s first solo but after mr good fell stunningly and deliberately on his back and after robert swinston , in carl kielblock s salmoncolored leotard \( most of the others are in gray tones \) tripped across the stage , one heard a distant plunk the sound became more metallic miss finlayson threw her head back in an arabesque , carol teitelbaum cantered off while folded forward , michael cole and david kulick came slinking in into a quintet of gnarled figures that included randall sanderson came emma diamond , leaping in with amazing energy and a wondrously warped jete there were other highlights miss finlayson propelled out from a ritual circle larissa mcgoldrick s juicy scissor leaps an ensemble in a box step arthur murray never taught the dancers gamboling in front of mr cunningham as he entered and watched chris komar run around miss diamond while the percussion resembled a broken gamelan three men partnered three women before mr cunningham joined a cluster to watch helen barrow and kimberly bartosik twisting a knee or two when eight dancers took over the stage , they recalled wildflowers in the wind , swaying on half toe mr cunningham returned and offered one hand and then another to propel miss bartosik as she ran around him left alone , three pairs of dancers turned into modern griffins back curved over , knee up in front , they flew into the air with priestly calm , mr cunningham entered at the last movement to quell the turbulence , and the energy abated frederic gafner , jenifer weaver and patricia lent completed the fine cast the same 15 dancers , without mr cunningham , made exchange a much darker and more sinister dance than one remembered the exchange of the title occurs between two separate groups of dancers who mesh only toward the end there are playful highlights such as the duet between mr komar and miss bartosik , but david tudor s score , bearing down like a freight train , created an oppressive context jasper johns s seaweedgreen and gray leotards and bursts of light seemed all the more lifegiving mr gafner , an outstanding new recruit , mr good and mr swinston partnered miss barrow , miss finlayson and miss lent in native green john king s score , william anastasi s pointillist designs and dove bradshaw s lighting contributed to this uneven exercise in dissociation photo merce cunningham s loosestrife had its premiere wednesday night \( michael o'neill \)
united nations , march 14 throughout the 1980 s the short , plump , cigarsmoking tariq aziz became a familiar figure at the united nations as he tirelessly campaigned for support for iraq s long war against iran , presenting it as a struggle to stop the destabilizing forces of islamic fundamentalism from sweeping through the region it was a clever pitch that won iraq significant backing , including modern western weaponry and vital american intelligence , which allowed president saddam hussein to fight to a draw last week that same short , plump figure was back at the united nations for the first time since the persian gulf war ended , but playing a different role iraq s deputy prime minister was in the dock as he sought to explain to an increasingly impatient security council his leader s reluctance to comply with the conditions of the ceasefire the 56yearold iraqi diplomat is perceived as public spokesman for one of the world s most brutal rulers , whose very survival has become an embarrassment to president bush but this tough , loyal follower of mr hussein since the start of his ruthless climb to power is quite used to arguing a difficult brief in hostile surroundings he reminded the council that secretary of state james a baker 3d had threatened when they met in geneva a year ago to knock iraq back into a preindustrial stage if it did not surrender kuwait and true to form , mr aziz has left security council members unclear on president hussein s position at one moment mr aziz was promising to cooperate with the united nations plans to eliminate iraq s weapons of mass destruction but the next he was railing against illegitimate attacks on iraq s sovereignty and saying that this free people with its 6 , 000 years of civilization and history would never surrender all that is certain , one experienced iraqwatcher says , is that mr aziz is no more than the mouthpiece of his master whatever the outcome of his mission , it will be decided not by him but by mr hussein unswerving loyalty to president hussein and the ideals of his arab baath party has always been the hallmark of mr aziz s career and the secret of his success born mikhail yuhanna , the son of a minor government official from mosul in northern iraq , mr aziz is a chaldean christian who later arabized his name as his political career got under way his family moved to baghdad while he was a boy , enabling him to study english literature at the baghdad college of fine arts when its teaching staff was largely british this christian background , his schooling and his good english make him the odd man out in a regime dominated by sunni muslims of president hussein s tikriti clan from central iraq , none of them noted for their knowledge of the world or their education but these attributes also mean mr aziz is no possible threat to the leader not long after graduating , mr aziz joined the panarab baathist movement , working underground in baghdad but spending much of the 1960 s in syria , where he married an iraqi christian woman after the coup that brought the baathists to power in baghdad in 1968 , he started to climb the party ladder , editing its paper , al thawra , before becoming information minister all that time , his loyalty to mr hussein was unquestioned , and increasingly he came to serve as his leader s ears and eyes in the outside world iraqis say he was effectively running foreign policy from the moment mr hussein took power in 1979 , although he did not become foreign minister until 1983 on july 22 that year , mr aziz was filmed sitting stony faced in the front row of the meeting at which mr hussein consolidated his hold on the party by denouncing 22 top officials as traitors later , the story goes , the president ordered them personally shot by ministers and party leaders in the shuffle last march that followed the gulf war , mr aziz became deputy prime minister but iraqis say he still supervises foreign affairs and remains mr hussein s principal contact with the outside world
hempstead , li , april 26 some fans might have muttered johnny who \? after the jets selected nebraska tight end johnny mitchell in the first round of the national football league college draft this afternoon but the jets are banking that mitchell s potential will make his name a household word in the next few years the giants took the bestknown tight end in the draft , derek brown of notre dame , with the no 14 pick in the first round , just ahead of the jets' first selection but the jets considered mitchell , a sophomore who did n't start for nebraska last season , the better player very frankly , this was the player that we really wanted the whole time , said dick steinberg , the jets' general manager we did have him rated ahead of derek brown the selection of brown and mitchell , backtoback , by the two new york teams will give fans something to watch , compare and argue about for the next few years both teams have lost valuable veteran tight ends in the past two years the jets , mickey shuler , and the giants , mark bavaro and can use the services of a new player at that position why did the jets have mitchell rated ahead of brown \? he s got the size and speed ratio that you look for at this position , said jets coach bruce coslet my first question was why was n't he in the nba and why was n't he playing linebacker \? he was n't quite tall enough to play in the nba , but i do n't know why he is n't a linebacker that s the caliber athlete that you look for to play tight end mitchell , who is 6 feet 2 inches and 258 pounds , runs the 40yard dash in 468 seconds and has good hands , giving the jets a downfield passing threat at tight end even though he did n't start last year , mitchell had 31 receptions for an average of 172 yards per catch in a runoriented offense some people have questioned his blocking ability , but steinberg said that mitchell is an explosive blocker who fits into the jets' blocking scheme mitchell , a 21yearold native of chicago , dismissed the notion that he and brown will forever be the plot line in some kind of new york story derek is a great person and a great athlete , mitchell said i think he 'll do well for the giants' organization i have to take care of my part with the jets i guess we 'll be keeping in touch things started to fall into place for the jets to select mitchell after cleveland selected fullback tommy vardell of stanford with the no 9 pick the jets thought that the browns might take a tight end then , the jets had to wait and see what the giants would do the jets figured that they had no chance at getting one of the top seven or eight players in the draft , so they had ranked a second group of eight players none of the eight in the second tier were defensive players , steinberg said coslet said the jets had several contingencies working before the giants made their pick if the giants had not taken brown , coslet said the jets might have traded down a few spots , figuring that either mitchell or brown would still be there we had an offer on the board from another team that we were considering , coslet said mitchell said that he works out with jets strong safety brian washington , who played at nebraska , and that washington had already given him the lowdown on the jets great organization , a team on the rise , definitely should be in the playoffs next year and they were missing a good tight end , mitchell said of washington s team report i'm just a piece of the puzzle mitchell , who said he decided to forgo the remainder of his college eligibility because he wanted to help his ailing grandfather , was pleased with his selection by the jets the situation could n't have been any better , he said i think i will do well and i'm going to be a hard worker not a starter , yet coslet would not pencil mitchell in as a starter , but admitted that mitchell s athletic ability gives him an edge at a position where no current jet has established himself we might add a few things to get a tight end farther down the field , coslet said i like mitchell because we can hit him with a little dump pass in the flats and he s a good runner he s been a running back in his career , so he can run with the football the jets tried to address their defensive needs in the second round , taking kurt barber , a 64 , 241pound linebacker from the university of southern california who has the ability to rush the passer and also drop back into pass coverage barber missed two games last season with strained knee ligaments , which the jets said did n't pose a problem after an examination photo nebraska s johnny mitchell

mark messier is n't happy and according to his comments last night at madison square garden , neither are any of his teammates messier does n't think the rangers' system is working he thinks there are too many line changes too much rotation not enough chemistry he thinks , quite frankly , that it is high time the rangers' organization made a change this situation is n't working , messier said bluntly after the rangers embarrassed themselves , losing by 51 to the expansion tampa bay lightning we 've won games on talent alone and that s just not going to win a championship messier saw last night s debacle at madison square garden as an inevitable fallout of a system gone awry every ranger line faltered , every defenseman was caught short on some type of coverage , and the goaltender , mike richter , could charitably be considered to have had an off night on a night that the team president and general manager , neil smith , announced that he had extended roger neilson s contract through the 199495 season , messier s comments quite pointedly showed that he does not agree with the way his coach is handling the current overflow of talent in the rangers' organization to tell the truth , messier said , i think this has been coming for a long time we 've balanced 24 guys from the start of the season last year , we had the same lineup , game in and game out everybody knew what job they had to do and did it this year , we 're using 24 players and instead of having four players unhappy , we have 24 players unhappy and it s just starting to catch up with us now right now , we have a lot of unsettlement on this team we have 24 healthy bodies and on paper it looks like a fantastic situation but it s not working it certainly has n't worked so far that s just the way i see it i'm in the dressing room i'm here i have a finger on the pulse it s just a situation where i do n't think it s going to get any better messier was careful to avoid fixing the blame on anyone i do n't think it s roger s fault , i do n't think it s neil s fault , i do n't think it s the players' fault , he said but it was clear that if he were in charge , things would n't be run the same way messier s answer \? he would like to see the rangers make a trade , sending two or three players away for one strong addition nearly everyone on the club has stressed the necessity of such a move but if a good trade is n't an option , messier indicated , it s time to ditch the 24man rotation the rangers should pick four players to sit and 20 to play on a regular basis , he said four guys would be unhappy four guys would be insulted but it would be better that way , messier said neilson defends his system i think perhaps 20 happy is better than 24 unhappy , messier said i think if someone s given the job , he plays until he plays himself out of the lineup when told of messier s comments , neilson stood firm behind his decision to continue rotating all 24 players in and out of the lineup , arguing that he could n't bench someone who could reasonably be seen as deserving ice time it s tough with the extra players to keep chemistry , unless you 're going to sit the same four every night , said neilson , who has frequently conceded that the decision to play everyone makes it tough on both him and the club none of them deserve that you ca n't do it unless 20 players are clearly better , and that has n't happened yet for messier , though , that answer apparently is n't good enough the rangers , he thinks , have been waiting too long for the situation to change soon , he indicated last night , it might be too late we 're almost a quarter of the way through our season and we 're not improving , messier said slap shots chris kontos , a firstround draft choice of the rangers in 1982 , tagged goaltender mike richter for two goals last night , including a shorthander , to bring his season goal total to 16 second best in the league behind mario lemieux s kontos , a journeyman , signed with the lightning as a free agent last summer and has blossomed i think i 've finally found a place where i feel at home , he said the rangers' goal was scored by darren turcotte on a late thirdperiod power play , when new york was trailing by 50 the goal extended turcotte s scoring streak to five games photo rangers' tony amonte shooting against goalie pat jablonski of the tampa bay lightning last night \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b14 \)
a new financial study has to give pause to staten islanders anxious to secede from new york city emphasis on the word pause the study is fine as far as it goes but because of its narrowly defined scope , it raises more questions than it answers the study , by faculty members at nyu s robert f wagner graduate school of public service , found that staten islanders get up to 180 million more in city services than they pay for thus if staten island became independent it would have to close a huge budget gap just to stay even but the study does not examine the cost of operating an independent staten island that provided fewer services nor does it examine the cost of services and facilities that staten island would have to set up from scratch because the rest of new york now provides them , like jails nor does it examine the efficiency or inefficiency of scale would it cost the borough more or less to create its own board of education \? its own police department \? its own sanitation department \? what the study does prove is that staten island is costing new york city as much as 180 million more than the borough contributes indeed , if money were the key issue , the other boroughs might well be tempted to say so long to their neighbor across the bay the study s limited findings have not stopped both secessionists and their opponents from claiming victory secessionists emphasize the borough s 955 million revenue base , contending that s enough to support a city , while softpedaling the budget gap meanwhile , the dinkins administration contends that an independent staten island would have to raise property taxes 60 percent an exaggeration that assumes the new city would rely only on property taxes to close its budget gap the staten island charter commission will be getting several more studies before a vote on secession in november 1993 it s likely that none will conclusively determine the cost of secession voters will need candid guidance from elected officials to make a decision that will affect all new yorkers for generations to come

blankets and hampers dinner was served in a large tent after the concert this sort of gala , of course , has become quite commonplace in the musical world as institutions celebrate their anniversaries or graduations but what made this gala distinctive was what has made glyndebourne distinctive an attentiveness to the music rather than the stars ms caballe gave a portrait of desdemona s death from otello felicity lott gave a stunning performance of the final scene from capriccio and cynthia haymon gave gershwin s summertime a sinuous , refined interpretation other artists included frederica von stade in a series of infectious readings , the festival s music director , andrew davis , leading the london philharmonic , and elisabeth soderstrom , dame janet baker and sir geraint evans introducing the selections but the gala also marked a point of transition for the festival the next time opera is presented here it will be in a new 33millionpound \( 63 million \) hall rather than in an theater that is an extension of this eccentric manor s odd personality that hall will be more than a third larger as well , growing to 1 , 150 seats the atmosphere of slightly quaint awkwardness in the strangely laid out lobbies will give way to planned architectural charm , something that will surely have some impact on the collegial informality that exists here despite black tie and evening dress and the new theater will provide new temptations and opportunities for the festival stagings but the two productions i saw this week confirmed that a more substantial change is gradually taking place in the traditional , realist approach to opera that has made glyndebourne s reputation the change was not , fortunately , in the other area of glyndebourne s renown , musical accomplishment tchaikovsky s queen of spades on thursday night and britten s death in venice on wednesday were finely etched performances that would have done credit to any major opera house without major stars there was much major singing expression of character and articulation of line were more important than making a big impression in spades , for example , nancy gustafson was a strongwilled but vulnerable lisa she let her attractive soprano open on top without ever pushing it the sighs and swells of her vocal lines had a natural , spontaneous feel yuri marusin , who sings with the maly theater in st petersburg , may have begun his role as herman sliding up to notes and seeming blustery , but he gradually made his singing indistinguishable from acting the musical exclamations of the closing scenes were as potent as the character s hysterical laughs and sobs other highlights included mr davis s idiomatic conducting and sergei leiferkus s count tomsky at opera s end , the audience s stomps and cheers were entirely justified death in venice did n't have that same musical impact , but the singing of the two main parts almost made up for the weaknesses of the production in the demanding role of the novelist gustav von aschenbach , the welsh tenor robert tear created a character that lived up to the name thomas mann gave him suggesting the decay and dissolution of ashes as well as singing with the clarity and energy of a bach , a brook as the traveler , the elderly fop and other incarnations of the demonic , alan opie was an imposing presence , using his baritone to intimate the otherworldly , the ominous graeme jenkins s conducting also was impressionistic and precise the gamelaninspired accompaniments associated with tadzio the adolescent boy who becomes the focus of aschenbach s obsessions took on precisely the right quality of mysterious sensuality yet in both cases , the performances were impressive not because of the productions but despite them each was dominated by a design conceit meant to reinterpret the work
as he walked with purpose friday from court 18 back to the players' locker room at the national tennis center , malivai washington heard his name mispronounced by at least 20 people malivay maleevah wrong and wrong again none of this seemed to bother the 14thseeded washington , a man on the move at the united states open , with no time to correct the enunciations more people are pronouncing it right than last year , he said and if i win this tournament , i 'll tell them in my acceptance speech how to do it the name is pronounced malaveeyah , and it warrants considerable watching at this year s open after several years of progress too slow for the fasttrack analysts , the 23yearold washington from ponte vedra beach , fla , has won two tournaments on the tour this season with flair and has a favorable draw in this grand slam beatable bunch in a thirdround match today , washington faces henri leconte of france an upgraded model of marc goellner , the erratic power player whipped by washington in straight sets in the second round michael chang should be his fourthround opponent , and wayne ferreira of south africa is the potential quarterfinal foe all are beatable , if washington continues to improve his versatile game it is a style that features a sharplyangled whipping serve , a surprisingly rangy twofisted backhand return , and some sneaky , effective volleys on an intimate side court friday , washington struck a low backhand return at the feet of goellner for the decisive break in the third set then , he whacked two aces in the next game to clinch the victory he s been able to use different styles depending on what needs to be played , brian gottfried said gottfried , the tour director for the association of tennis professionals , has coached washington since he turned professional midway through his sophomore season at michigan this year before gottfried , washington was tutored by wolverine coach brian eisner this will come as news to those who still cling to the notion of washington as the robotic creation of his father , william , longtime mentor of malivai and his siblings softer approach william washington , who owns a master s degree in physiology , still is the primary coach for his 17yearold son , mashiska , and his 16yearold daughter , mashona he sits in , occasionally , on malivai s practices now , however , william washington offers only soft compliments to the son he began to coach at the age of 5 great serve , he told malivai on friday then , william washington disappeared and let gottfried take charge i do n't work with him as much as i used to , malivai washington said , of his dad and i have n't even seen my sister play since i was here last year mashona is expected to be one of the toprated junior girls at the open when the seedings are announced today mashiska is entering michigan state in the fall as a freshman , a sore point with malivai , the wolverine it was totally his choice , malivai washington said i'm happy for him , but it s just something else to argue about now malivai washington does not want to talk about charges of racism once leveled at the united states tennis association by his father several years ago , william washington said that more blacks would be involved in the sport with more support from american organizers reaching a peak that sort of talk is now too volatile , with the draw opening up for malivai washington and his tennis game at its peak the player said he would prefer to concentrate on his tennis , and will steer away from probing interviews tennis was something that grew on me , washington said when i first started , i did n't know if i was going to play the next week then , it became fun i like it for the man against man , out there battling it out and more than last year , a lot of people are following me around he signed some autographs for those fans on friday night , then hurried off this tournament is the biggest there is , he said you win a grand slam event , it means you 're at the top of your profession then , the little people learn your name
there is no hope in the lineup card kevin maas keeps checking , but every time he looks , the disappointment builds he has voiced his frustration to yankee management and the news media , he has met on occasion with the manager , and he has conferred with his agent none of it seems to soothe his unhappiness in the first 31 games of the season , maas has started just 11 times when the club begins a 12game stand at the stadium tonight against the seattle mariners and lefthander randy johnson , he 'll be on the bench again no sense even looking at the batting order maas grows more discontented by the day there are few options available to him 'i have no leverage' do i have a choice \? he said i have no leverage , none i 've talked to the people i can talk to everybody in the front office knows how i feel so does manager buck showalter , who said he has sought out maas in an effort to allay some of the young hitter s anger i 've let him know that i appreciate his professionalism , showalter said but i know he s not happy about it out of batting order on a sevengame trip that ended sunday and produced six losses , maas was a noncontributor he started one game and pinchhit in four others as the yankees slipped to 1516 and into fourth place in the american league east for the first time this season mostly , the 27yearold maas , a lefthanded hitter , has been a victim of circumstances last weekend , when he ordinarily would have played against three oakland righthanders , he sat instead showalter , in need of a leadoff hitter and a lefthanded bat , started dion james in right ahead of the slumping jesse barfield danny tartabull , coming back from a hamstring injury , was the designated hitter , with mel hall in left there was no room for maas with a healthy tartabull expected to play left field starting tonight , hall will become the fulltime dh the only opportunity maas has now is as don mattingly s backup at first base so far , there have been no requests for a trade but craig fenech , maas s agent , indicated he could moving in that direction we have n't had that conversation with them , fenech said we 've tried to take the view that , until now , kevin is keeping quiet and trying to be prepared when he s called upon whether our posture has changed , i'm not going to say but the situation does n't appear to be improving possible work in june it s not likely the yankees would seek a deal , or would even allow fenech to speak with teams , a procedure fenech says more teams should allow maas is still young , he provides insurance against an injury to mattingly , and he has hit 46 home runs in less than two seasons i think he can help us , showalter said there are times when donnie will need some time off , especially in june i know kevin does n't want to be a caddie for somebody else he wants to play , but it s a tough situation and there s nothing we can do about it now maas , who is batting 261 in 22 games , has become a capable pinchhitter , going 4 for 7 with one home run if he ca n't win an everyday job in new york , he said , perhaps he can show another team his ability a lot of times , he said , that s my motivation , to show somebody else that i can play in oakland , calif , near his home in castro valley , he left the usual number of tickets for family and friends , he said but if they hoped to see him play , they were as disappointed as he was it was a frustrating road trip for me , he said , but then again , this game is n't built on emotion the manager s got to do what he can to win a ball game whether i'm home or not does n't matter inside pitch don mattingly had a threehit game against the a s on friday but went 0 for 3 saturday and struck out three times sunday , only the second time in his bigleague career he has been fanned three times in one game the last time it happened was aug 25 , 1989 , when baltimore orioles pitcher jeff ballard did it it s arguable whether catcher matt nokes is enduring tougher times at the plate he s hitting 198 with five runs batted in or behind it the a s stole eight bases off him , six by rickey henderson base stealers now have swiped 14 consecutive bases off nokes without being caught and have been successful in 23 of their 27 attempts this season
health secretary louis sullivan rejected oregon s application to reform its medicaid program because , he claimed , the plan would discriminate against the disabled but he provided only flimsy evidence to back up the charge , inviting suspicion that the decision had more to do with election year politics than legal niceties indeed , gov barbara roberts charges that the administration rejected the plan before it granted oregon an ample opportunity to respond the administration gets a chance to explain itself next week when it meets in oregon with state officials if it ca n't produce a bill of particulars , the governor deserves to be granted her request that president bush overturn the rejection like every other state , oregon rations medical care to poor families by excluding many of them from medicaid coverage the proposed plan would ration care a different way every poor resident would be covered , but only for the most effective procedures to this end , the state ranked 709 medical procedures and decided it could afford to cover the first 587 on the list the rankings reflected judgments about which treatments helped patients , disabled or not but mr sullivan charged that the rankings also reflected community surveys about quality of life that reflected bias against the disabled yet he could point to only three examples , none convincing besides , oregon has demonstrated willingness to rid the plan of legal problems and to allay the fears of critics including child welfare advocates that it will cover fewer and fewer procedures over time but the administration did n't bother to notice an election year is an awkward moment for washington to approve a program that would openly ration care and provide money for abortions but oregon , faced with tight budgets and no national health reform in sight , made a hard , honorable choice its decision to cover every poor person adequately , but not completely , may not be to everyone s liking but without evidence of invidious discrimination , the choice ought to be oregon s

florida this week became the latest state to jump into the national search for improved access to health insurance , enacting a law that calls for affordable coverage for all workers the law , signed on tuesday by gov lawton chiles , was far more specific about its goals than about the exact steps it would take to get there it creates a new state agency for health care administration and sets a dec 31 , 1994 , deadline by which insurers and employers should voluntarily provide an affordable , basic health care benefit package for workers the measure also calls for broadening access to federalstate medicaid benefits to serve people not covered in the employer plans 24 million uninsured about 24 million people , or 18 percent of florida residents , are uninsured , according to estimates by the federal census bureau , and thomas j wallace , a member of governor chiles s staff , said that just under twothirds of uninsured florida residents have household incomes of about 25 , 000 or less nationally , about 35 million people , or 14 percent of the population , have no health insurance the problem is more acute in the south and west , with about one in five uninsured people in states like texas , new mexico , florida and california , the census bureau says these states are also home to large numbers of hispanics , who have less continuous health insurance coverage than any other ethnic group , according to the bureau other states , most notably hawaii and massachusetts , have tried to put into effect a stepbystep plan that would result in universal health coverage , but none have reached the goal in hawaii , 74 percent of the population remains uninsured , while in massachusetts , the census bureau estimates that 91 percent of the population is uninsured provisions backed by insurers the florida law incorporates provisions supported by major business groups and insurers to expand coverage for small businesses and to prevent job lock , a situation in which an employee with a health problem is afraid to change jobs for fear of losing health coverage those provisions guarantee employers access to coverage for their workers , permit a worker to change carriers without penalty and prohibit insurance companies from rejecting a highrisk employee who works in a business with three or more employees this bill is a commitment that employers and businesses and the insurance industry will step in and institute some basic reforms on their own , said jim mcclellan , a spokesman for governor chiles at the same time , the state is committed to doing everything it can to cover the 24 million without health insurance about 60 percent of people working for companies with fewer than five employees have no insurance , he said , and about onethird of the people in companies with from five to nine employees are uninsured an outline for broad changes the provisions were accompanied by an outline for general changes in the health insurance business the details are to be worked out over the next two years mr wallace said he and governor chiles will meet in washington today with congressional and white house officials in an effort to obtain federal agreement for florida s plan to offer access to medicaid to residents who would not meet the current stringent income guidelines for that federalstate program florida , which adminsters a 412 billion medicaid program , of which 185 billion is state money , is seeking federal waivers that would permit those with household incomes under 25 , 000 two to three times the poverty rate for a family of four to pay for coverage by medicaid , which would no longer be considered strictly a poverty program while the bill envisions both greater use of managedcare coverage like that provided by health maintenance organizations and firmer state control over of use of expensive medical equipment , it has no specific costcontainment requirements photo gov lawton chiles signed law that calls for affordable health insurance for all workers \( mike pease \)
the 14 essays in under an open sky rethinking america s western past , edited by william cronon , george miles and jay gitlin \( norton , 35 \) offer a useful sampling of the methods and interests shared by many of the new revisionist historians of the west there are studies of the complex interactions of ethnic minorities with the dominant western culture , of the subtle ways in which life in the west transformed relations between the sexes , and of the manner in which previously untapped materials , such as newspapers produced by american indian tribes , reveal a fuller portrait of conflict and adaptation in western communities while the selections in under an open sky are addressed to a general audience , the 12 essays in trails toward a new western history , edited by patricia

a plan proposed by some creditors of revco ds inc to maintain the drugstore chain as an independent entity won the widest support in a vote by creditors that concluded friday , according to preliminary results announced by revco the plan competed against two other proposals , both of which would have merged the company with other drugstore companies one merger plan called for revco s acquisition by the jack eckerd corporation the other proposed a merger with the rite aid corporation the most popular plan was accepted by four of the seven key creditor groups the banks , trade suppliers and holders of two types of bonds but it did not receive enough votes to win automatic confirmation the holdouts the plan for revco to remain independent was not supported by a third group of bondholders and two groups of investors that hold revco bonds issued before the 1986 buyout that took the company private the plan to stay independent had also received the support of revco s management we continue to believe it is the best plan for revco and its constituents , said boake a sells , the chairman and chief executive as we go into court this week , it appears this plan is closest to confirmation , and we hope judge white will be able to do so all our stakeholders have endure a process that has gone on long enough hearings to confirm a reorganization plan are scheduled to begin jan 8 in federal bankruptcy court in akron , ohio revco is based in twinsburg , ohio judge harold white in akron will ultimately determine which plan will bring revco out of bankruptcy after more than three years of operating under protection of chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code because none of the three plans for rebuilding the company apparently received enough votes for outright confirmation , judge white could force the acceptance of any one of them another possibility including the one backed by rite aid , based in harrisburg , pa , and the one supported by the jack eckerd chain of clearwater , fla , and a group of bondholders , could be sweetened and another vote taken among creditors , the rite aid plan was supported by the two groups holding bonds issued before the leverage buyout , and the eckerd plan was approved only by the bondholder group that proposed it to be confirmed , a plan required approval of creditors representing twothirds of the total dollar amount of debt held by those in each group and the majority of creditors voting in each groupcreditors could vote for more than one plan , making the tally more complicated the votes were still being sorted out , but a rough tally showed that about two and a half times as many creditors supported the plan to remain independent as favored the rite aid plan and about twice as many supported the independent plan as the eckerd proposal deal sweetener was sought martin l grass , president of rite aid , said that during and after the vote on the reorganization plan , his company had been contacted by at least two creditor groups that suggested they would change their votes in favor of rite aid s plan if the deal were sweetened by 7 million or 8 million in cash the plan that was voted on offered to buy revco for about 155 million of rite aid stock and 575 million in cash revco had about 15 billion in debt when it filed for bankruptcy protection analysts now value the company , which has sold several stores , at between 800 million and 900 million mr grass said his company had not made any decision about sweetening its offer we have to see where this thing is going first , he said kim walin , a retail analyst at lehman brothers , said the rite aid plan would offer revco more stability because rite aid was an ongoing viable public company , whereas revco on its own might have tough times the plan to remain independent , she said , is a good plan and the current revco management has done some things to shore up the company in the last couple of years but revco , she added , has still got a long way to go until it s healthy again
washington , june 15 president bush said today that he was considering joining the parade of presidential contenders to the television talkshow circuit , a move that his advisers were urging him to make as a means of countering the unexpected appeal of the independent ross perot but mr bush , who was said to be grappling with whether appearing on a talk show would seem too defensive or would diminish the presidential stature he has been struggling to maintain , said he would not join in another political fad of the 1992 campaign and obtain a tollfree number i think it s good to take some questions and to be out there on the frontline , mr bush said in an appearance on international hour , a cable news network interview program but i think to turn the white house into a clearinghouse for 800 numbers is a little beneath the dignity of the white house , and i am determined to conduct myself in this office , hopefully , with decency and honor and dignity 'first of several tv interviews he added , so i am not going to do that and say , 'hey , call in to your friendly white house operator , ' and use this magnificent building and this magnificent office i hold to further political ends in that way mr bush s appearance on cnn was the first of a series of television interviews he plans in coming weeks , including one on abc with barbara walters next week and a possible 30minute appearance on the mcneillehrer news hour the interview today focused on foreign affairs , and mr bush continued to refuse to say much about mr perot or gov bill clinton but he did say he disagreed with speculation that none of the three candidates would get a majority of electoral votes and that the election would thus be decided by the house of representatives as they have cast about for ways to get public attention , white house officials at first ridiculed mr perot and governor clinton for appearing on callin programs mr bush s consideration of such a move for himself now is a measure of how alarmed he and his advisers are at his persistently low approval ratings and at mr perot s unexpected strength it also underscored the extent to which efforts to bypass traditional television news coverage and appeal more directly to voters have come to dominate the public relations strategies of the 1992 presidential campaign robert m teeter , the bush campaign chairman , said today that after watching mr perot and mr clinton field questions on the networks' morning programs he had given mr bush a memorandum recommending that the president appear on a program of that nature , but that mr bush had yet to decide whether he would do it i would hope so , mr teeter said communications and the media since '84 , and clearly since '88 have changed , he said people watch these things they get a lot of information out of them mr bush dwelt at length today with his argument that voters should reelect him and get rid of the democratic majority in congress the bush campaign has been arguing for some time that the divided nature of federal government is to blame for the legislative gridlock in washington , and mr bush made that case today let s try it the way it has n't been tried but for only for a couple of years in recent history a republican congress and a republican president , he said photo president bush talking to frank sesno yesterday on international hour on the cable news network \( cnn \)
the journey by ida fink translated by joanna weschler and francine prose 250 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 20 ida fink s first novel , the journey , is a splendidly constructed and effective account of survival during the holocaust this is ms fink s first book to be translated from polish into english since the publication in 1987 of her shortstory collection a scrap of time those spare , often elegiac stories gave disturbing glimpses of the corrosive effect of german actions on the life of polish jews the literature of the holocaust is replete with detailed and horrific accounts of events for which the word unimaginable is inadequate perhaps it is only time that has permitted the esthetics of language to recreate how ordinary people thought and felt in a society on the edge of extinction ms fink did not mythologize the holocaust in her stories but presented an ominous world in ways more vivid and compelling than historical record with a depth and completeness only suggested in the stories , the journey extends the author s witness into the lives of ghetto jews trying to survive in 1941 in rural poland , where casual antisemitism is part of daily life , the german actions are becoming more thorough , as soldiers sweep the countryside looking for jews as if they were contraband two sisters , daughters of a jewish physician , prepare to leave their home and where better to go than into germany , with forged papers that identify them as polish volunteer workers \? the narrator \( whom for a time i took to be a child \) is the older sister both are young women part of the deprivation of their lives is the theft of identity to acquire an alias and become someone else , or to be called by a number in a concentration camp in a life bounded by fear and betrayal , each time the sisters flee to another place a different past must be invented , a new personality pasted on and real memories denied the lover left behind in the lacki street prison , the father who can be contacted only through coded letters , the vanished relatives identity in the journey fractures and fractures katarzyna majewska , the narrator , turns into joanna pilecka , then into maria walkowska elzbieta stefanska , the younger sister , becomes jadwiga kotula and , finally , barbara falenska each sister has three names and three different lives and none of them is the real one the sophisticated sisters dress like peasants and wrap themselves in colorful shawls how mindless is the society they must join \? well , one set of forged identification papers is useless because the photograph of elzbieta does not show her left ear , as the regulations require the sisters voluntarily join a transport of workers going from poland to germany and find themselves employed in a factory in the ruhr valley the stories they tell must convince , because it is easy to be caught by a halfremembered lie how much german should they be able to speak \? what is the best disguise cheerful stupidity or belligerent demands \? the nightmare becomes more real the more it is pinned by reality the german factory is a closed society within a closed society the volunteer workers , polish and german , are called girls by the narrator it is with difficulty that the reader realizes they are women , some of them married , for adult sovereignty is reduced to nonexistence indeed , so easily do we believe the concept of the sisters' disguise that we accept them as adolescents quarreling over food and clothes , envious of each other , while they are in the factory these workers betray one another for the smallest of favors a new sweater or a job in the office katarzyna divides the group into the city girls \( those who are secretly jews \) and the others betrayal of the city girls offers the juiciest rewards everyone in the factory accepts the primacy of personal survival , yet traces of old codes of behavior remain promise not to escape without me , they urge one another promise not to tell schmidt , the man in charge of the factory , behaves as if primed for the stock role of camp commandant danger is everywhere some will offer their bodies in exchange for possible safety the false solidarity of the group of city girls dissolves in the journey as in ms fink s stories the actions of the nazis split the world there are those normal moments in which we sat in the warm , homey room a fire roared in the stove the polished furniture gleamed on the sofa was an open book , a ball of wool , knitting needles this is contrasted with such chilling scenes as this we were standing with a group of naked women under the warm shower , and the older woman and the man with the trim mustache were waiting at the door elzbieta and i both knew at once they were waiting for us we saw the looks they gave each other , the looks they gave us the sisters have moved into an uncharted territory edged with fragments of hope it is a life without sureties where they can scarcely believe in those germans who will risk their own safety to help and those friends who will betray
who is bob olden \? an informal poll of reporters who cover nassau county scene found that none had ever heard of him i guess i'm very low key , said robert l olden sr , a deputy county executive for three years he holds the highest office of any of the scant number of blacks in the county government last month , as the two warring factions of the republicandominated board of supervisors clashed and eventually came forth with a 1992 budget , mr olden stood quietly at the rear of the meeting room absorbing it all , but saying nothing publicly what mass layoffs will do he did not flinch as the board slashed 23 percent of the spending across the board , even though the widespread layoffs and service cuts will affect the human services that mr olden oversees the cutbacks are also apt to affect mr olden s annual salary of 96 , 700 mr olden was deputy planning and economic development commissioner for six months before county executive thomas s gulotta asked him to move upstairs literally to the executive suite before that , mr olden s sole public role was as a member , and ultimately chairman , of the nassau county community college board of trustees he was a trustee when a controversy over staging sister mary ignatius explains it all to you arose my picture was in the paper , as i was opposed to the play s going on , mr olden recalled i was stung by the press they misquoted me as one of two deputy county executives the other is santa c rozzi , a lawyer mr olden , who is 60 years old , is a liaison aide to groups concerned with affirmative action , economic opportunity , social services , human rights and minority issues he calls himself the human services deputy although his fourthfloor office in the county executive building in mineola is not accessible without an appointment , mr olden said he had an opendoor policy i feel that even if i have just two minutes , and the person is coming only to vent his or her frustration , i will see that person , he said i 've had my own problems in the trenches i once made a commitment to myself that if i ever got into a high government position , i would be available to all before becoming a deputy executive , he told mr gulotta that he would continue to see everyone , regardless of what they look like or smell like two missions vs one mr olden said he first encountered discrimination in the air force in the 50 s if i wanted to get those wings , he said , i had to fly two missions , where the whites had to fly only one mr olden served three years as a navigator , bombardier and reconnaissance officer in the strategic air command it gave me a rude awakening of what i 'd have do to make it in these united states , he said on his return to new york city , mr olden became a shop teacher , a department chairman and an assistant principal at springfield gardens high school even there , i had to place all my credentials on the principal s desk to become assistant , even though i had better credentials than he did , mr olden said mr olden , who lives in roosevelt , moved to long island in 1968 and commuted to his job in queens until 1988 a republican committeeman who still goes door to door at petition time and who once unsuccessfully sought a seat on the hempstead town council , mr olden had toyed with running for a new york city council seat he joined the republican party in his native brooklyn as a worker for a rockefeller campaign i felt it was the party to assist the disadvantaged , he said there were very few minorities in the party i wanted them to understand that they had to deal with us , know our point of view and our sensitivities mr olden said being one of the few blacks in the nassau republican hierarchy had helped his career i was in the right place at the right time , and timing is the key , he said from the start , mr olden said , he made it clear to mr gulotta that he was in his post to help solve problems and not to be solely a black deputy for black problems several black leaders have shied away from speaking out about mr olden for fear , they said , of undermining his position privately some questioned how much power he had and wondered about his lack of experience still , the leaders said , they are pleased to see a black as deputy county executive and wish him well the head of the economic opportunity council , john kearse , said i believe mr olden is doing as good a job as the administration allows , but they 're not using his potential there s not enough money , support or authority mr kearse worries about the effects of the budget cuts and said he would like to see mr olden given as free a rein as possible in making decisions on behalf of the minority community legislator is reticent assemblywoman earlene hill , democrat of hempstead , a black , was reticent about mr olden i know him as a distinguished and respected citizen and a member of the local church , she said although ms hill and mr olden are on different sides of the political aisle , they are the highestranking blacks in government in nassau still , ms hill said , she is not familiar with mr olden s responsibilities and had not worked with him mr olden said his chief concern was how the budget cuts would affect the 7 percent of blacks in county jobs they were the last on board , and the law says , 'last hired , first fired , ' he said i'm concerned that those let go will be the ones with the least amount of assets they will likely end up on the welfare roles the ripple effect will hurt everybody mr olden said he enjoyed working for mr gulotta and would like to continue even if mr gulotta s career took him to albany mr olden is looking to washington to supplement his work in nassau he has submitted resumes for an appointment to federal education commissions or boards early in life , i was never sure of myself , he said i always doublechecked before i took a step as i got older , i saw what i could do i 've accomplished some tasks people would thought would be impossible , so i realize i should n't be afraid i never thought i 'd be sitting in this seat in government it was the furthest thing from my mind mr olden s optimism stretches to the nassau republicans i'm a firm believer , he said , that the differences of opinion will make for a stronger party we 'll look at some of our mistakes someone has to feel the hurt , but we will learn from that experience photo deputy county executive robert l olden sr is a liaison aide to groups concerned with affirmative action , economic opportunity , social services , human rights and minority issues \( steve berman for the new york times \)
rio de janeiro , june 12 environment ministers at the earth summit finally wrapped up a set of voluntary principles aimed at preserving the world s dwindling forests , a goal that was a united states priority at the conference , and were working feverishly tonight on a global cleanup plan the administration did not obtain a commitment to turn the forest preservation principles into a binding international convention , but the document , approved early today , leaves open the possibility of a new forest treaty in the future the document describes the forest principles as an authoritative statement insuring that all countries have a right to use their forests to advance their economic development , but that they should do so only on a sustainable basis the principles thus chart a tortuous middle course between the desire of countries with tropical forests , like malaysia , india and brazil , to assert theirsovereignty over a valuable natural resource and the wish of most northern countries to define forests as a global asset william k reilly , administrator of the environmental protection agency , expressed some disappointment with the outcome today , saying the principles were not as strong as we would have liked but some other western officials said the principles went further than they had expected at the start of the summit talks they do n't close off the possibility of a convention , and closing it off was the objective of malaysia , an official said it was also suggested that the proposed new sustainable development commission , which will monitor compliance with commitments made at the earth summit , could call for negotiations on a binding treaty when it reviews the way the world s forests are being managed the talk around the ministers' meeting last night , though it could n't be said in there , was that this should be a priority for the commission on sustainable development , another western official said in negotiations , many developing countries said the industrial world only values tropical forests for the carbon dioxide they absorb because this reduces the sacrifices the north must make to avert global warming the principles call for environmentally sound national guidelines for development and recognize that while forests meet many economic , social and cultural needs , they also act as carbon sinks and reservoirs that slow climate change these same representatives of the world s rich and poor countries worked tonight to resolve outstanding issues over aid and atmospheric pollution that are blocking completion of the new global cleanup plan , known as agenda 21 , which the summit hopes to endorse on sunday vows to do more to encourage developing countries to compromise on these issues , the united states , canada , germany and the 12 european community countries , speaking as a bloc , all pledged to do more to help poorer nations safeguard the environment but it was impossible to judge immediately how much new money they were really offering developing countries want the western industrialized nations to make good by the year 2000 on a promise they made more than 20 years ago to raise development aid to 07 percent of their economic output none of the western heads of state or government who addressed the summit today would make such a promise but chancellor helmut kohl of germany said he wanted to reach that target as soon as possible , and in the meantime committed his government to an unspecified increase in official development aid president bush and prime minister brian mulroney of canada both said they would increase the amount of aid to help poorer countries protect their ecological systems but it was unclear whether this involved new money or reapportioning existing aid budgets europeans pledge 4 billion prime minister john major of britain made no mention of development aid when he addressed the summit but the 12 european community countries , as expected , said they would give 4 billion , including some new and additional resources , to finance key aspects of agenda 21 , describing this as an initial contribution by making these offers , western leaders say they are seeking to convince developing countries that they mean to help them cope with the extra bills they face for making development environmentally sustainable and thus encourage them to accept the goals set in agenda 21 but negotiators are still trying to settle on wording that encourages aid donors to reach the 07 percent target by the end of this century without actually committing them to do so meanwhile , saudi arabia continues to oppose passages in agenda 21 encouraging countries to use economic measures to promote energy savings , fearing that this will lead to the introduction of new carbon fuel taxes that would reduce the world s appetite for oil

washington , oct 3 under the pressure of a presidential campaign , gov bill clinton has been trying to outline his own unique foreign policy , while at the same time fending off criticism from the bush white house that he is a closet dove masquerading as a hawk and that his experience in world affairs is limited to breakfast at the international house of pancakes although foreign policy has not been a big issue in this first campaign after the cold war , mr clinton has laid out his internationalist vision in four speeches over the last year , knowing that he cannot pass the commander in chief test without appearing credible in this area the clinton foreign policy is hard to summarize in a single phrase , but it is a blend of idealism and pragmatism , internationalism and protectionism , use of force and reliance on multinational institutions mr clinton s critics say it is all of these things , because he wants to be all things to all men and has not really made up his mind he and his aides contend that after the cold war alot of the old divisions in foreign policy , which particularly plagued the democratic party , can be bridged and that this is what clintonism is all about indeed , mr clinton s team of foreign policy advisers is an ideological peacock made up of every wing of the democratic party it is dominated by old hands from the faction of the carter administration most averse to using force abroad , but there is also a heavy representation of members of congress like senator sam nunn of georgia and representative les aspin of wisconsin who are associated with the more conservative wing of the party , as well as neoconservative reagan democrats and a new generation of foreignpolicy thinkers who might be called clintonites in fact , mr clinton has embraced so many advisers that he relies on no single elder statesman and no single adviser stands out as first among equals the question of whom he might appoint as secretary of state or national security adviser is a mystery , even to his closest aides mr clinton rebuffed repeated requests to be interviewed for this article at the core of mr clinton s thinking is the contention that with the cold war over , american foreign policy needs a whole new focus for him , that begins with revitalizing the american economy without doing that , he argues , the next president will have no chips with which to play abroad and will have no mandate from the american people for engagement abroad , because the public will be obsessed with domestic affairs in this new era our first foreign priority and our domestic priority are one and the same reviving our economy , he said in a recent speech in los angeles this has been the administration s most glaring foreign policy failure an anemic , debtladen economy undermines our diplomacy , makes it harder for us to secure favorable trade agreements and compromises our ability to finance essential military actions i will elevate economics in foreign policy , create an economic security council , similar to the national security council , and change the state department s culture so that economics is no longer a poor cousin to oldschool diplomacy though he emphasizes the importance of economics in his foreign policy , mr clinton up to now has avoided coming out either for or against the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico , for fear of alienating union voters aides say he has finally decided to support the trade accord , but wants to couple any endorsement with a proposal for legislation that will retrain american workers who lose jobs some call it waffling waffling is too kind to describe his position on the agreement , said peter rodman , a former member of the bush national security council mr clinton has argued that he will also diverge from the bush administration in two other fundamental areas one is the question of values , where he says he would assign a much greater weight than mr bush to promoting democracy abroad , rather than settling for stability based on authoritarian governments that repress human rights in that vein , for instance , he has said he would support the use of selective trade sanctions against china to get that country to ease its repression of human rights as mr clinton put it in a speech in milwaukee this week , i believe our nation has a higher purpose than to coddle dictators and stand aside from the global movement toward democracy mr bush s aides counter that the president helped to foster the rise of democratic governments from nicaragua to poland , and that extrapolating from his lessthansuccessful china case is wildly unfair mr clinton also declared , long before the bush administration was ready to consider military action , that the united states should be prepared to join with a multinational coalition to shoot its way into the sarajevo airport to make it safe for a relief airlift if necessary he said the united states should take the lead in seeking un security council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort bigger saving on arms
it was the hottest week of the year over 90 degrees in silicon valley , but for the daredevil skiing executive , now is the time to make reservations for this winter s excursion not for this group the crowded winter resorts of lake tahoe or aspen real skiing occurs in places that only helicopters can reach , where runs are measured in miles , avalanches lurk around every bend , and in a week of skiing one might not cross a single ski track operators of heliskiing adventures now offer trips to the sierra nevada in eastern california , the wasatch range in utah and even northern india but the most action is in the canadian rockies of british columbia , in mountain ranges with unlikely names like the bugaboos , cariboos , monashees , adamants , gothics and bobbie burns by far the biggest organizer of these expeditions is canadian mountain holidays inc of banff , alberta it now sends helicopter trips to nine areas of the canadian rockies and has six lodges , 300 employees and 24 million in annual revenues celebrated names on the cmh guest list include king juan carlos of spain richard marriott , vice chairman of the marriott corporation pierre trudeau willy bogner , the olympic gold medalist and chairman and chief executive of bogner fashion , and william t esrey , chairman and chief executive of sprint visiting royalty pose special challenges , said martin von neudegg , a cmh vice president , because canada requires they be accompanied by security personnel the result can be armed bodyguards made to ski down mountain slopes hundreds of miles from the nearest possible threat silicon valley has had its own contingent , including james morgan , chief executive of applied materials , the venture capitalist william davidow , and the semiconductor industry pioneer robert noyce , who died in 1990 like many others , mr davidow recalls his most memorable moment as flying off a cliff and looking down through my skis and seeing the ground get further and further away , then closer and closer , and then landing in an explosion of powder mr morgan talks of the cleansing of the spirit that comes during such vacations the high altitude and clean air revitalize your mind and soul , he said for canadian mountain holidays , 14passenger twinjet bell 212 choppers not only deliver customers to the slopes , but are the only contact the lodges have with the outside world that s not to suggest these lodges are primitive each comes with jacuzzi , sauna , full bar , massage therapists and gourmet chefs just because the snow is up to the roof and the nearest building is over the horizon does n't mean you ca n't enjoy medallions of veal in lemon tarragon mousse or other entrees good enough to have been written up in gourmet magazine there s even a baker at each lodge this luxury is matched by what awaits outside a typical day during the standard oneweek visit begins at 7 30 am with a stretching class , oldfashioned mountain breakfast and then the chopper ride up a nearby mountain groups of 11 and a trained guide do 8 to 15 runs a day , ranging from 2 , 500 to 7 , 000 vertical feet each \( the longer an approximately 47mile run \) even when the lodges are full , there are at most 44 skiers from cmh on terrain the size of rhode island , so there is little chance of feeling crowded if the weather is good , lunch is served on the slopes between 4 30 and 6 pm , it s back to the lodge for a soak or rubdown , then the gourmet dinner afterward , ski movies are sometimes shown or the guests organize skits or costume nights mostly , there s a lot of talk , some of it about business for example , the idea behind what was to become the association for california tort reform , a program to reduce litigiousness in the state , was born in one such latenight conversation none of this comes cheap rates begin at 2 , 282 per person and climb to 4 , 350 per person per week , depending on the time of year the highest rates are in february and march in a season that begins two weeks before christmas and runs until the beginning of may that covers everything , including skis and a guarantee of 100 , 000 vertical feet of skiing there is also that soupcon of danger required by every overachiever the canadian rockies is notorious for fatal avalanches on top of that , there are the usual accidents that happen when humans hurdling down mountainsides collide with trees and rocks more than one chief executive has had a leg or arm sewn up on the dining table luckily , because at least a third of the clientele is doctors , there is sometimes a trained physician around to do the stitching despite these impediments , helicopter skiing has proven immensely popular since its founding in 1965 , canadian mountain holidays has served 62 , 000 skiers \( its summer helihiking program , which offers a similar program for wilderness hikes , has had 19 , 000 clients since 1978 \) not surprisingly , some of these customers are true ski fanatics more than 550 have skied more than one million vertical feet with cmh , enough to earn a special ski suit as a reward \( my 30 , 000 ski outfit , jokes one honoree \) ned damon , a former rodeo and water ski champion , has skied 9 , 370 miles the equivalent of a trip from new york to switzerland and back over years of 17week stays mr damon s wife , carolyn , has skied 13 million vertical feet but even in this exclusive skier s paradise , the vagaries of the outside world intrude , most notably in a changing guest list that reflects the ups and downs of the economy for example

to the editor characterizing president bush as prodeath in on fetal tissue , bush shows he s prodeath \( letter , july 14 \) is a bit heavyhanded , do n't you think \? david andrews s letter misrepresents the president s position on providing reproductive services to women i can set the record straight , as the official responsible for administering 150 million worth of family planning through title x of the public health service act mr andrews refers to an appropriations bill to renew funds for federal family planning clinics the program , whose funds have increased for 20 years under title x , serves more than four million , primarily lowincome or adolescent women with preconception counseling and preventive familyplanning services title x was written with the restriction that none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning last year congress tried to use the appropriations process to overturn that regulation , handing president bush a bill that opened the door for familyplanning clinics to promote abortion the president vetoed the bill he is deeply committed to caring for the reproductive needs of american women , particularly the poor who make up 85 percent of those served in familyplanning clinics when the bill was stripped of its abortion provisions , he signed it immediately , and services to women through these clinics continued uninterrupted abortion is not a method of family planning the sooner we separate the two in congress , the sooner they will be judged and financed on their merits william r archer , md dep asst secy , population affairs dept of health and human services washington , july 21 , 1992
dublin , nov 19 prime minister albert reynolds is insisting that voters in a national referendum on nov 25 will approve a constitutional amendment that will expand the grounds for legal abortion in this predominantly roman catholic country but none of the combatants in the national debate on the issue seem confident of victory or defeat , and polls are inconclusive opposition to the government proposal comes from both sides the antiabortion groups say the proposals will permit more abortions than are now legal those favoring a liberalizaton of the law feel the proposals do not go far enough to protect the rights of women with unwanted pregnancies but opposition from both sides does not indicate sure defeat for the proposals a poll by irish market surveys showed last week that 55 percent favored the government amendment the three government proposals , to be voted up or down on the same day as the national election , guarantee women the right to information on abortion the right to travel abroad to have abortions , and stipulate the new grounds for legal abortion there is little opposition to the right to information and travel the dispute is over the amendment that says , it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life , as distinct from the health , of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantive risk to her life , not being a risk of selfdestruction for opponents of abortion , the amendment is an expansion of legal grounds for abortion beyond the 1983 amendment that was thought to forbid abortion in all cases the current dispute stemmed from the case in february of a 14yearold girl who said she was raped by a friend s father and wanted an abortion in britain the irish government forbade her the supreme court overruled the government , saying that the girl had the right to an abortion partly because she had threatened suicide she had the abortion the accused rapist is not expected to be tried until next year the government s proposal asks the people to formally sanction an abortion regime in the irish constitution , a license to kill , said the prolife campaign those supporting the campaign , who feel they are the advocates of a divine law that categorically forbids abortion , had been pleased when pope john paul ii told catholic bishops that he favored the idea of a vote but prolife had also looked to the catholic bishops to support their view but the bishops , while calling the proposals basically flawed , declined to tell people how to vote , urging them to follow their consciences the most influential womens' organization that is opposing the amendment defining grounds for abortion , is the council for the status of women , an umbrella of 93 groups the council s chairwoman until she decided to run for parliament last week was frances fitzgerald the mother of three sons , she favors legal abortions for rape and incest and threatened suicide , and said , i do not agree with the division in the amendment between the health and life of the woman the acting head of the council , anne taylor , said the amendment was insulting to the integrity of women as individuals and mothers she said a survey of council member groups showed only two against abortion in any circumstances , while 22 cited rape and incest as valid grounds , and 22 favored unlimited access to abortion if the two sides manage to kill the amendment , the law would then permit abortion in cases where a mother s life appeared to be threatened , including cases of potential suicide the issue would then go to parliament , which could decide to pass ordinary , legislation to define legal grounds , or to write another constitutional amendment and propose another referendum , or the lawmakers could ignore the issue until another court case marian finucane , the moderator of a radio callin program and who probably listens to more women talk about abortion than anyone in ireland , said no matter what way the vote goes it s not going to change things women will continue to go for abortions to england
mayor david n dinkins and city council leaders reached agreement yesterday on a proposal that would create an independent agency to investigate complaints of police misconduct the compromise involves one of new york city s most divisive and racially charged issues , one that has been fought over in the ballot box and in the streets who should judge the actions of police officers police department employees or outsiders instead of a 12member civilian complaint review board , with 6 civilian police employees , the new board would consist of 13 members , none employed by the department it would also allow the city council , for the first time , to effectively make some appointments , create an investigative staff entirely from outside the department and give the board direct power to subpoena witnesses the board , which has operated essentially under the supervision of the police department , would get its own budget for the first time impact of police rally the agreement comes six weeks after an angry rally by an estimated 10 , 000 police officers and supporters in front of city hall , an event that radically altered the political landscape and galvanized public opinion and the city council behind a proposal by the mayor to restrict the membership of the panel to civilians outside the police department twentysix years ago , in one of the most bitter battles in the city s history , one that pitted blacks against whites , mayor john v lindsay s move to create an allcivilian board was soundly defeated in a citywide referendum yesterday s agreement reflects the growing political power of the city s minority communities , which in 1966 were only beginning to flex their political muscles but even against the backdrop of that change , the compromise marks a remarkable turnaround before the police rally , even the mayor conceded that his proposal had little chance of being approved by the council but now , with the sponsorship of 19 council members and the support of the council s speaker , the bill seems destined for approval some council nominees politically , the major turning point came when the speaker , peter f vallone , originally an opponent of the mayor s proposal , measured the impact of the rally with its images of officers taking over the brooklyn bridge and knocking down police barricades and the mayor s public battle with the police union he agreed to seek a compromise he said was needed to help keep the city unified under the agreement announced at a city hall news conference by mr dinkins and mr vallone , the mayor will appoint all 13 members but five will be nominees of the council and three of the police commissioner people familiar with the negotiations said the mayor has agreed to work out with the council any problems he might have with the council s board nominees the mayor will select the chairman of the board from among the 13 members the bill would require the council s five nominees to come from each of the city s five boroughs the 10 nominees from the mayor and the council cannot have had experience as police officers or fbi agents but those appointees could have past experience in such lawenforcement positions as , say , assistant district attorney or as a prosecutor the three nominated by the police commissioner must be civilians who have either been police officers or former lawenforcement professionals like criminal investigators or former supervisors in a federal , state or local lawenforcement agency they cannot have worked as an attorney in a prosecutorial agency the review board currently consists of 12 members , with 6 civilians appointed by the mayor and 6 highranking civilians from the police department appointed by the police commissioner more than half of its 59 investigators are police officers , and all are department employees excessive force changes on the board would have little impact on how police officers are handled within the criminaljustice system the board reviews complaints relating to police misconduct , like excessive force that would not amount to criminal assault , rude behavior or racial insults but more severe complaints , like assaults or felonies , would go to the district attorney , as dictated by law in addition , under the mayor s proposal , the police commissioner would continue to have the final say on any punishment of an officer , although he would have to consider the board s findings at yesterday s news conference , the mayor , flanked by mr vallone and about 20 council members who are supporters of the bill , hailed the bill as being balanced , fair and the outgrowth of compromise from all parties we believe , mr dinkins said , it reflects the concerns of all the involved parties , and it has benefited from the open debate and consultation among public officials the agreement represented some compromise from both the mayor and mr vallone , the council speaker mr dinkins won what he has long sought an independent board whose membership was all civilian the mayor also prevailed in his wish to have independent , civilian investigators
the clash between commissioner fay vincent and three members of the yankees' hierarchy took another turn yesterday with their meeting scheduled for monday postponed , the possibility of discipline dissipated and the agreement of the commissioner s office with an arbitrator that it acted prematurely instead of meeting with vincent on monday , general manager gene michael , manager buck showalter and jack lawn , a club vice president , will be asked by the players association to talk to union lawyers about their meeting with the commissioner last wednesday the union has charged that the meeting compromised the hearing on steve howe s challenge to the lifetime ban that vincent imposed on him for a drugrelated incident the hearing on that challenge remained uncompleted after its third day yesterday and there was no indication when george nicolau , the arbitrator in the hearing , will be ready to rule on the attempt by the yankees' pitcher to be reinstated or to have his penalty reduced vincent had been scheduled to meet monday with michael , showalter and lawn , but he postponed the session at nicolau s request originally , the indications were that all three men would be disciplined by vincent because of their testimony at the howe hearing , but that only michael seemed likely to face suspension but steve greenberg , the deputy commissioner , said he had recommended to vincent thursday , after reading the transcript , that none of the three yankee officials be disciplined , and that the commissioner had agreed greenberg , in a telephone interview , also said if he had to do it over , he would have recommended that vincent s initial meeting with the three not be held until monday instead of calling them in last wednesday my understanding was all the testimony was completed and all that remained was closing arguments , greenberg said i understand now it would have been more prudent to wait until after closing arguments the players association , which had charged that bringing the three yankee officials in to meet with vincent amounted to witness intimidation , felt that nicolau came down hard on the commissioner at yesterday s session of the howe hearing , the arbitrator said he found it difficult to understand why the meeting between the yankee officials and vincent was held when it was and why the commissioner did n't wait until after the howe hearing ended we gave assurances it is in no way related to the howe hearing , greenberg said the purpose of the exercise was more educational than discplinary from the outset we will sit down with the three gentlemen sometime in the future to close the loop vincent had said he summoned michael , showalter and lawn to the wednesday meeting because he was concerned that they showed , in their testimony at the howe hearing the day before , an unwillingness to uphold and enforce baseball s drug policy there s a drug problem i wanted them to understand there s a drug problem , vincent said at the howe hearing , all three testified that howe should not have been banned permanently to varying degrees , the three indicated disagreement with baseball s drug policy vincent reacted swiftly to their testimony because any division over the drug policy would be an easy point for the union to focus on in challenging future cases the players association , facing a difficult task in the howe grievance , instantly charged that vincent s action compromised the hearing , saying his intrusion could affect the testimony of future witnesses in this hearing as well as others nicolau did not immediately issue an opinion as to whether he felt the hearing had been compromised but , according to eugene orza , the union s associate general counsel , he put in place a mechanism for proceeding in a more orderly fashion to determine what happened that mechanism includes a letter the commissioner s office sent to michael , showalter and lawn yesterday saying that all three could talk with union lawyers if they wanted to without fear of consequence from the commissioner orza said yesterday that the union wants to speak to the yankees say anything you want' greenberg said the commissioner never said the three men could not talk with anyone about their meeting as they were leaving vincent s office wednesday , greenberg said , one of the yankee officials asked what they could say about the session the only thing fay said was 'you can say anything you want as long as it s the truth , but i intend to say nothing' orza said union lawyers will interview the yankees' officials next week based on what we find out , he said , nothing will be done or we 'll ask to have their testimony put on record let the arbitrator determine if this has an effect on the howe case in arlington , tex , where the yankees played the rangers last night , michael expressed relief that the possibility of a penalty had been removed no explantion sought i was n't given an explanation and i did n't ask , he said i'm just glad that part of it is over i did n't feel there was anything we did that was wrong , but i'm relieved it is over and i feel like buck does about that i felt we did what we needed to do michael said he did not know how he would have reacted had he been penalized and had yankee players reacted by boycotting a game that s very honorable and very flattering , but i do n't know what i would have done , he said in response to a question michael declined to comment on whether he felt there had been any intimidation factor in his being summoned by vincent
washington , july 1 the senate armed services committee approved the promotions of 1 , 126 navy and marine corps officers tonight , breaking a logjam caused by a scandal over an aviators' convention last year the committee had imposed a freeze on more than 4 , 500 promotions , transfers and retirements until the pentagon certified that none of the officers were involved in the incident at last year s convention of the tailhook association , a private group of activeduty and retired naval aviators twentysix women , including 14 female officers , were assaulted by drunken fliers in the past few days , the defense department has hastened the process of clearing the names of several hundred junior officers to satisfy a condition set by the committee s two senior members , senator sam nunn , democrat of georgia , and senator john w warner , republican of virginia the two lawmakers last week objected to a short promotion list of 15 navy admirals and marine generals , and 45 people coming out of the service academies , contending the navy was giving preference to senior brass over junior officers the navy had contended that it was essential to approve the nominations of the admirals first because several of the officers were scheduled to assume commands in the united states or in europe that affected american security relations with its allies fourteen of the 15 admirals and generals on the pentagon s original list were approved today action on the 15th was delayed for reasons unrelated to the tailhook scandal

port st lucie , fla , feb 23 julian vasquez , for all the fractured english and cultural confusion that complicated his first couple of seasons in the minors , always communicated with a language that needed no interpretation pure , fluent fastball the mets listened and fought hard not to let it drown out what their hearts were telling them wait let vasquez s personal development match his fastball s maturity do n't let vasquez get ahead of himself never , though , has vasquez s fastball been louder or more insistent than it has been this weekend it has exploded over and over again , opening mouths , opening eyes and pleading , enough waiting i'm ready , the 23yearold vasquez said i do n't have a lot of patience i 've got too many too good pitches an 028 era vasquez , who could earn a spot on the mets' class aaa club this spring , certainly had more than enough fastball for the florida state league last season a righthanded reliever from the dominican republic who had fought control problems in his first seasons in the minors , vasquez amassed 25 saves and posted a staggering 028 earned run average in 56 games he struck out 56 and gave up only 35 hits in 64 innings he s got the best arm , hands down , of any pitcher in our system , said gerry hunsicker , the assistant vice president of baseball operations and being a powerpitching righthanded reliever , we do n't have anything that even comes close to him his experience has been like that of so many latin players in that his development was slowed by the enormous challenge of adapting to life in the states and in baseball but last year was a major step forward we believe he is now poised to move quickly word of the righthander s fastball entered the mets' major league clubhouse last friday and has raced around it since for vasquez , whose struggle to assimilate , although not easy , was no more dramatic than for any other latin ballplayer , this is his first visit to the major league camp i have n't caught him , but i have n't had to because i caught next to him , said mackey sasser you do n't need to catch that fastball you can hear it plenty good 'great , live arm' no one has mistaken the acoustics for anything other than a bona fide , major league arm great , live arm , said mel stottlemyre , the mets' pitching coach very interesting pow , pow , pow , and without any grunts , said manager jeff torborg i 've forced myself to remember that he pitched winter ball , and so his arm is naturally going to be ahead of others and you can be deceived by what you see on the mound but when you go to the files and there are stats there that back up what you 've seen and heard , then you pretty much realize you 're watching something pretty special last season , vasquez had no earned run average at the allstar game break , and he struck out the side in the ninth inning of the florida state league s allstar game despite a flash of youthful flamboyance in which vasquez all but announced that he 'd be throwing nothing but fastballs he allowed two earned runs all season , none in his final 24 appearances i told our coaches that he was a kid who was n't going to be awed by anything , said hunsicker he s a wonderful kid , alive , fearless , and if in the spring we run him out there against darryl strawberry , he s going after him as full of himself as he is full of energy , vasquez has become both a magnet for affection and a target for the traditional abuse in the clubhouse he moves almost nonstop , talks almost without end and laughs whenever he takes a break from either walking or talking is he a flake or a wild kid \? david cone asked both and legitimately both nice arm , said one more cynical observer no clue crazy \? vasquez asked , repeating a reporter s question no , not crazy you crazy , you get released i have fun , but in 1990 , i asked myself why fool around with baseball anymore i had thought like a boy i think like a man now a slider , too and he s even begun to pitch like a mature pitcher julian had always had trouble developing secondary pitches , said hunsicker , who has not ruled out a september appearance at shea for vasquez but he s figured out the slider , and it flatout freezes righthanded guys at the plate he can be a closer in the major leagues soon , hunsicker promised , but not yet , no matter the elegance or loudness of his fastball s argument inside pitch general manager al harazin said he had agreed to open talks this week on a contract extension for john francothe lefthanded closer is entering the final year of his contract , and harazin said he was eager to sign the man who has recorded 66 saves in his two seasons with the mets

new orleans , aug 27 sfiga no luck , daniella veroneze , a tourist from milan , said glumly on tuesday morning as her husband videotaped workers boarding up brennan s and hurricane andrew barreled toward this vulnerable soup bowl near the mouth of the mississippi but as things turned out , of course , luck was with new orleans after all as the storm moved to its west just hours after the remnants of the storm headed off toward mississippi wednesday night , the moist gulf air in the french quarter was a cacophony of moaning guitars and booming trombones , the hurricane andrew survivor tshirts were for sale for 599 , and the only hurricanes to be seen were being slurped from plastic cups if hurricanes are nature s biggest crap shoots , swirling atomic bombs guided by their own inscrutable compass , no place plays for higher stakes or with a richer feel for the tragic dimensions of the game than new orleans this week south florida and the cajun country of southcentral louisiana were devastated while new orleans emerged almost unscathed almost everyone in this weird gumbo of cultures , bordered on three sides by water and protected by a delicate network of levees and canals , knows that next time it could be the opposite and that a hurricane churning up the mississippi could virtually destroy new orleans but if new orleans fears hurricanes , it may take a place that turns funerals into celebrations and buries its dead above ground to fully appreciate them you do live with the belief that some day the big one s going to get you , said patricia mcdonald gomez , general manager of aunt sally s original creole pralines in the french market you 're almost fatalistic , which is part of the reason new orleans has that mixture of frivolity and fatalism living in a soup bowl will do it to you , like romans dancing while nero fiddled and the city burned longtime coastal residents from the atlantic to the gulf of mexico maintain a complicated relationship with hurricanes part fear , part fascination it is expressed in the way hurricanes are given names , the way they are sized up like approaching bullies as they head toward land , the way people will talk decades later about their encounters with betsy or hugo or the monster of all monsters , camille , whose 200 milesanhour winds ravaged the mississippi gulf coast and killed 256 people in 1969 but with its long memory , waterlogged geography and evocative mixture of sin and religion , new orleans has a particularly intimate relationship with hurricanes they provide the name for the lethal combination of liquors that is the national drink of bourbon street at the cafe du monde , famous for serving its cafe au lait and beignets 24 hours a day all year long , there are only two reasons for closing christmas and hurricanes mrs gomez remembers riding out hurricane betsy in 1965 in the world her grandfather created solely for hurricanes across the street from the family business he then owned and she now manages he was so hurricaneobsessed that he kept the second , third and fourth floors of the warehouse across the street for hurricane apartments , she said that was the only time they were used at the famous door club on bourbon street , 29yearold john wehner was pulling out framed photographs of jazz bands from the 1940 s and 50 s and thinking about the lifetime he had already lived since buying the 58yearold jazz club a week ago all i could think was , 'my first week in business , and a hurricane s going to hit , ' he said it was n't hard to find people like mildmannered edna francis , working her 49th year at aunt sally s , who express a perverse sense of letdown that the storm passed by all that frenzy of preparation with no climax at the end , she said but for ms gomez , bounding into work the day after the storm asking how everyone was , to mr wehner , watching work crews take apart the famous door s famous old stage to build a new one , the feeling was mostly something very different new orleans can seem a royal mess it is the nation s third poorest city , after laredo , tex , and detroit , with streets that look like haiti , persistent poverty and a sense sometimes of problems too big to solve but after andrew s bullet was dodged , none of that mattered the pastel shutters and doors in the french quarter looked that much more alluring the coffee at the cafe du monde tasted that much better andrew jackson was still tipping his hat to one and all in jackson square having survived storms , fires and epidemics , invading pirates and yankee occupation during the civil war , new orleans had survived andrew as well this week , that was enough photo a pantomime artist , known as the mardi gras beadman performed yesterday in the french quarter of new orleans hours after hurricane andrew had landed west of the city wednesday night , the bars had returned to their usual state of reverie , with hurricane souvenirs for sale \( matt anderson for the new york times \)
the united states has stumbled into its first preventable epidemic , a wave of tuberculosis with strains so virulent they threaten to return pockets of american society to a time when antibiotics were unknown the resurgence has been swift , forceful and for many of america s largest cities , it has come after two decades of searing budget cuts in publichealth programs without those cuts , experts say , the disease could have been all but eradicated , and new , deadly strains would never have been able to flourish the last time new york city had 4 , 000 cases of tb in 1967 more than 1 , 000 beds in municipal hospitals were specifically assigned for tuberculosis patients today there are fewer than 75 there were 22 fulltime chest clinics in the city in 1968 today there are 9 and each of those that remain is so overcrowded and dilapidated that scores of patients must huddle each day in the drab , dimly lighted corridors as they await treatment 'close the book' little more than 20 years have passed since a surgeon general traveled to capitol hill and stated with confidence that it was time to close the book on infectious disease for most of america , the claims seemed justified typhoid , cholera , even measles major killers not long ago had largely passed into memory and cases of tuberculosis , the withering scourge that infiltrates the lungs and slowly , painfully shuts them down , had declined for more than half a century but , kindled by the aids epidemic , and fueled powerfully by urban crowding , homelessness , immigration , drug abuse and the rapid disappearance of preventivemedicine health clinics in cities from new york to los angeles , tb has surged again in a society that had assumed it was gone for good i'm scared , said dr lee b reichman , who has just become president of the american lung association and who for 30 years has been one of the nation s leading tuberculosis experts here we are in 1992 with cure rates lower than countries like malawi and nicaragua we ca n't keep track of our patients , and all evidence suggests more and more of them have tb that is resistant to our best drugs we have turned a disease that was completely preventable and curable into one that is neither we should be ashamed stark as it is , his assessment reflects the prevailing view among publichealth officials and like many of his colleagues , he blames neglect for the stunning reversal for while most americans put tb out of their minds over the last 30 years , it never really went anywhere in the poorest parts of miami , atlanta , houston and new york city tuberculosis persisted , through the 1960 s , 70 s and 80 s in 1970 , for example , tb case rates in central harlem were nearly 20 times the national average , and at least five times higher than the average for new york city if anything , the disparities have grown worse since then last year , reportedcase rates in central harlem soared to 220 per 100 , 000 residents , among the highest of any american community and 35 times the figure for residents of the upper east side , just a short subway ride away beginning in 1953 , when the government began keeping tb statistics , the number of cases declined steadily from a high that year of 84 , 300 to a low of 22 , 000 in 1985 by last year , however , there were nearly 27 , 000 new cases reported in the united states the american lung association now estimates that without major efforts , the united states will see at least 50 , 000 new cases every year within a decade and that they will cost the country billions of dollars a year to treat nothing reflects the scope of the epidemic as dramatically as the rise of cases among children , experts say , because each represents a recent infection , not an old one that has returned cases among children have more than doubled in new york city over the last two years and have grown by 40 percent across the nation postponing by many decades the day when tb could possibly be eliminated in the united states for years decades , really the few experts left to deal with tb in the united states warned that neglect would guarantee a new epidemic nobody listened when numbers started to inch up again more than a decade ago , those experts began to shout more loudly yet , every year between 1981 and 1987 the reagan administration opposed the existence of a federal tb program , calling in each new budget for its repeal in 1988 , increased funds finally began to trickle in , but much of the money was simply diverted from essential aids programs federal health officials stress that it would have been impossible to anticipate the devastating effects of the aids epidemic , which has sucked resources the finest minds in science as well as money from virtually

celebration of song merkin concert hall musicians in the earlymusic world must constantly weigh just how far authenticity can be taken usually , the movement is concerned with instruments and performance practice , but in the case of schubert , recreating his music implies the recreation of the places it was originally played and the kind of listeners who first heard it current performances of older music are always , in a sense , metaphoric times have changed and so have we with schubert , who wrote some of his profoundest pieces with semiprivate contemplation in mind , the problem is particularly acute the fourhand works , for example , are not public music and sit awkwardly on a stage none of his contemporaries played the great piano sonatas in concert the song cycles originally communicated with a few friends , not an audience of hundreds david thomas , a bass from britain , and malcolm bilson , the distinguished fortepianist , tried to reduce die winterreise , or at least the singing of it , to more representative dimensions on thursday night mr thomas placed a chair on the stage of merkin concert hall , and , seated beside mr bilson , he reenacted , almost by tableau , the famous picture a schubert evening painted by moritz von schwind by all accounts , johann michael vogl , the seated figure in schwind s painting , possessed a musicality as large as his vocal abilities were small firsthand accounts of these events , however , remember a composerpianist and an aging opera singer so lost in the passions of their enterprise that technical shortcomings were overlooked here is where the boundaries of thursday s recital become so problematic mr bilson , playing a rebuilt 1825 instrument of great beauty , wandered only occasionally from strict accuracy in a format that divided schubert s cycle by an intermission , he also introduced schubert s fminor impromptu , perhaps the most majestic and leastplayed of schubert s impromptus his concentration and judgment were evident everywhere mr thomas , i am afraid , may have been truer to vogl s original than he wanted to be the earnestness was there and when the voice was not challenged , when it was allowed to insinuate quietly for example , in der leiermann at the end mr thomas made his musical points elsewhere , there were many problems a lurching delivery , erratic intonation and a disconcerting and often repeated habit of turning sustained notes into selfcontained whooping crescendos mr thomas s stinginess with vibrato may well have been an act of historical rectitude , but one could n't help thinking that its denial was more a sign of physical weakness than interpretive strength indeed , an unpleasant but recurring thought passed through this writer s mind on thursday night that performances of vocal music very old and very new might have more consistent power on audiences were both fields not such attractive refuges for voices that do n't quite work mr thomas s musical mind seems to have its admirable traits , but i wonder whether his vocal abilities , when stripped of their earlymusic trappings , could have gotten away with the kind of performance he gave on this occasion
florham park , nj , july 19 no matter what you hear about a possible trade , no matter how the words of ray handley , the giants' head coach , and george young , the team s general manager , are interpreted , phil simms is highly unlikely to go anywhere when the giants open training camp monday , simms will be their backup quarterback , and when they end their season , barring injury to him or his successor as starter , jeff hostetler , simms will still be the backup quarterback at age 36 , a pro football player since 1979 , he can still play , and he desperately wants to play but the giants do not want to lose him because starting quarterbacks seldom get through a season unscathed and thus the backup will usually be needed the giants know that first hand because their starting quarterback the last two years simms in 1990 and hostetler in 1991 suffered seasonending injuries try and understand on friday , handley said that if he were with another team and needed a quarterback , he might approach the giants because the giants had five some listeners felt he was shopping simms later , handley said privately that his words should not be misunderstood we 're not looking to trade phil simms , the coach said it s just that we have a lot of quarterbacks and a team that needs a quarterback might call us we got jeff carlson in the off season in case we got a fabulous offer for simms and felt we had to take it simms chafed over his unaccustomed role of backup last season , although he started the last four games after hostetler injured his back permission granted after the season , simms asked the giants to trade him to a team that would make him a starter young even gave him permission to shop himself but given simms s age and salary \( 15 million \) and the high draft choice or choices the giants would want from a team that signed him , no deal was made and none seems likely now unless a potential super bowl team loses its starting quarterback early in training camp and is willing to offer two or three firstround draft choices for simms so the best quarterback in giants' history remains a giant although he does not like to talk about his predicament , he wants to play but he should not be encouraged by handley s words a multitude of things can happen , the coach said if someone approaches us with a deal , we have to be prepared for that the giants' five quarterbacks are hostetler , simms , carlson , dave brown and kent graham because the giants took brown in the first round of the recent supplemental draft , he is sure to survive barring injuries to other quarterbacks , that makes graham , an eighthround draft choice , superfluous assuming simms stays with the giants , carlson may also become superfluous the giants , concerned that simms might retire unless traded , signed carlson as a plan b free agent but team sources say carlson s passes have lacked zip in offseason workouts , and the giants may ultimately decide to write off his 125 , 000 signing bonus and start the season with hostetler , simms and brown last year , when hostetler was rehabilitating from his back injury , handley said hostetler would be the starter this year handley said last week that all starters , including hostetler , could lose their jobs with a disastrous training camp i 've always felt i 've had to fight for a job , hostetler said , whether i 've been a backup or a starter you ca n't sit back and take anything for granted you have to go out and produce i 've never assumed anything , and that has n't changed since i 've become the starter extra points some of the giants arrived sunday afternoon and night , and the others , at least those who were signed , were expected in time for monday s 10 am meeting with coach ray handley matt bahr drove here sunday for his second camp of the weekend the giants' 36yearold kicker spent friday and saturday in the catskills at a reunion at camp acadia , where he spent summers as a baby \( his parents were staff members \) and later as a camper and counselor on sunday , he roamed the fairleigh dickinson campus here on inline skates i use them for offseason workouts , he said at least it s better than jogging
allowing parents to choose their children s schools may be the hottest idea in american education , but a new flood of research argues that such choice programs alone will not help schools and , in some cases , can actually hurt them a report to be made public today by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching , a leading educational research group , is the latest of several to argue that choice primarily benefits children of bettereducated parents , does not necessarily improve student performance , requires additional money and , without certain safeguards , may actually widen the gap between rich and poor school districts choice programs in various forms have swept the country in the last few years many communities allow students to choose any school within a district in 13 states alabama , arizona , arkansas , california , colorado , idaho , iowa , massachusetts , minnesota , nebraska , oregon , utah and washington students may cross district lines , taking their share of state and local money with them a dozen other states are actively considering such measures milwaukee voucher plan only milwaukee actually allows private schools to compete for students , paying public money for a small number of poor students to attend private schools thirteen states are debating a similar plan , and colorado has a voucher proposal on the november ballot the new studies come after three years of intensive lobbying by supporters of the voucher plan , including president bush , conservative research groups and the two scholars whose 1989 book helped ignite the current debate these supporters maintain that only competition from private or parochial schools will force complacent public school monopolies to improve the carnegie report , which is based on a yearlong study , was criticized by advocates of choice programs on the ground that it underestimates the potential of such programs and had played down public support for the idea selfsatisfied establishment' lamar alexander , the secretary of education , said , only a very selfsatisfied establishment could so easily dismiss so many parents' wishes the carnegie report recommends that rather than relying on choice alone , educators concentrate on improving all public schools and combating the poor health conditions and violence that impede many children s performance in school fair choice programs would pay for students' transportation , give parents enough information about schools and compensate for wide gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts school improvement teams could visit failing schools with the power to remove principals and invest more money so that failing schools could improve rather than shut down but critics of public schools like john e chubb and terry m moe , who ignited the choice debate in their book , politics , markets and america s schools \( brookings institution , 1989 \) , say public schools have resisted such changes precisely because they face no real consequences for failing to act when researchers contend that poor children with less welleducated parents would lose under choice programs , mr chubb replies that these children would have a better chance with choice than they do now , stuck in the nation s worst schools but the carnegie report and a number of other studies have found that in general , parents who take advantage of choice programs are better educated or more confident , raising the possibility that children of troubled families may lose in an educational free market and end up stuck in the worst schools surveys of families in choice programs in montclair , nj , and milwaukee , as well as research by amy stuart wells of the university of california at los angeles and a recent study of choice programs in scotland , all found that bettereducated parents usually participated in choice programs or used more sources of information to decide which school was best the carnegie researchers , who surveyed more than 1 , 000 parents , visited choice programs across the country and compiled other studies , present the most adverse criticism of statewide choice programs in massachusetts , with school spending already battered by the recession , a choice program has caused fiscal havoc , the carnegie report says it cites the case of brockton , a financially troubled city , and its suburban neighbor , avon , which spends twice the amount of money per pupil as brockton and could easily lure students away during the first year of choice , the report says , 135 brockton students transferred to avon , taking with them nearly 1 million in state aid under massachusetts law , brockton also had to pay avon the difference between the two districts' spending to match avon s higher perpupil spending while avon hired a new guidance counselor and paid for a new roof , brockton had to lay off teachers and pack 40 students to a class massachusetts has since amended its law to avoid such stark problems , but it still does not pay for transportation , which means that poor students may be unable to choose schools far away from their homes some bright spots

white plains , march 13 the westchester county executive , andrew p o'rourke , today detailed an ambitious program to scatter 5 , 000 units of affordable housing throughout one of the wealthiest counties in the nation over the next five years mr o'rourke , who announced the plan last month in his state of the county message , characterized it as a home ownership program that would address for the first time a need for affordable housing that has been long perceived as one of the county s most intractable problems communities earmarked for the first 500 units include somers , cortlandt , north castle , harrison , greenburgh , yorktown and mount pleasant those units will be built on sites ranging from 4 to 37 acres rye , white plains and mamaroneck will be home to smaller sites of three acres or less housing lottery the county s large homeless population is not expected to be a direct beneficiary of the housing , which instead will be offered through a lottery primarily to civil servants , the elderly and others who cannot afford a home in the county westchester leaders have toiled over a plan to make use of newfound housing powers since a ruling last month by the office of state attorney general robert abrams that gave counties the authority to build and finance homes for lowincome residents the program , which was generally praised today , appears crafted to head off the resistance commonly seen among neighborhood groups over proposals for lowincome housing and transitional housing for homeless people mr o'rourke , a republican awaiting confirmation for a federal judgeship , said today in none of these areas were we ever talking about governmental housing development i do n't think that is our idea at all the plan requires that the residents have household incomes between 28 , 000 and 64 , 000 'the power to do it' mr o'rourke said that he expected opposition from some communities , but that the county government has the power to overrule them we certainly have the power to do it , he said my first effort is going to be a cooperative one i do n't intend to throw this chance away from westchester county by the end of the year , the county hopes to have built 500 units on 20 sites that will include townhouses , garden apartments and singlefamily homes another 4 , 500 units will be created within five years by acquiring land from the state , municipalities and private property owners for its initial phase , mr o'rourke has asked the county board of legislators to approve 30 million to buy land and to start development as part of the program , some of the remaining 4 , 500 units will be created through ventures with municipal housing authorities and will involve sprucing up existing structures as well as new construction rental option while all the units are meant to be sold , the communities where they are situated will have the option to offer them as rental properties the county would require communities to take over the management and ownership of the rental units for home buyers , the average cost of the units is expected to be about 100 , 000 the state of new york mortgage agency is setting aside up to 50 million in mortgage funds at belowmarket rates for buyers the plan seems to have won the support of a number of legislators as well as housing advocates jon bowie , a manhattan lawyer who is a housing advocate in westchester , said the program would open up space in public housing projects that is now occupied by bluecollar workers who are having difficulty affording homes mr bowie said the housing program could have a trickledown effect on the 3 , 800 homeless people who are now in apartments , shelters and motels about 25 percent of the people now living in public housing projects are there on waivers because their incomes exceed the legal limit it does nothing direct for those in particularly bad shape , but i think it s a step in the right direction and a departure from what the county has done before , mr bowie said map of westchester county showing the location of proposed housing sites
naha , okinawa , may 18 the japanese government spared no effort last week in celebrating the 20th anniversary of america s return of okinawa , which many regard as the high point in washington s postwar relations with tokyo the emperor and the prime minister greeted vice president dan quayle warmly as both sides tried to rekindle the good will engendered between the onetime enemies by that act 20 years ago only one thing was missing the okinawans with the main ceremony held in tokyo , 900 miles to the northeast , and their own rocky , windswept islands reduced almost to an afterthought , the okinawans decided to hold a separate celebration , pungent with very different meanings an orchestra of traditional instruments played the prefecture s distinctive music , strains of china evident in the singsong melodies but it did not once play the kimigayo , japan s unofficial anthem the song is a paean to the emperor , making it a symbol here of japan s wartime oppression of okinawa , when the islanders could be shot for speaking their own dialect 'used to being insulted' and while the national flag , the hinomaru , fluttered in its red and white glory all over tokyo last friday , it was conspicuously absent here , except for a single rising sun image above the stage the three flagpoles in front of the convention center sat empty , bathed in the hard light of a breezy subtropical morning full of hope and frustration for the 12 million people of japan s poorest prefecture maybe it was insulting for them to have the ceremony in tokyo , but as an okinawan i'm used to being insulted , said tatsuhiro oshiro , one of the island s most respected novelists it will make us stronger we 've accumulated a kind of wisdom from our hardships masahide ota , the prefecture s americaneducated governor , put the issue in more political , but no less plainspoken terms there would have been one ceremony if the national interests were the same as the local interests , he remarked unfortunately , that was not the case the history of the more than 60 islands that make up okinawa is a story of a culture long caught between more powerful , competing powers it was a kingdom trading actively with asia for centuries , then stood in the awkward position from 1611 on of being vassal to both china and japan the ambiguity was clarified when the islands were forcibly annexed by japan in 1879 , beginning a period of economic exploitation and cultural intolerance the japanese , preaching homogeneity , looked down on the okinawans and their dialect , while pressing them to assimilate the religion of the island , a mix of animism and ancestor worship , was influenced by china , as was its music okinawa developed a highly esteemed textile industry , using plantain fiber rather than cotton or silk a different viewpoint but okinawa s economy lagged behind the mainland s , largely as a result of policies formulated in tokyo in short , the world looked much different from this easygoing , seaside city than it did from japan s main islands that was never more true than in 1972 in tokyo , the reversion symbolized japan s rehabilitation from the defeat of world war ii and the beginning of a forwardlooking era but it came at a price , which okinawa paid on japan s behalf japan allowed the united states to keep its military bases here , a keystone in america s cold war strategy in asia today , threefourths of the american forces in japan are on okinawa , or more than 30 , 000 soldiers the bases take up onefifth of all the land on the main island here okinawan officials acknowledge that the bases have brought economic benefits , since rent is paid on the land and the bases employ about 8 , 000 local people at one time they dominated the economy , but now tourism is the leading industry and much of the base land could be developed far more profitably for resorts or other projects more important , the military sites are a nettlesome reminder that , as many here put it , the islands are occupied by a foreign power , sanctioned by tokyo 150 , 000 civilians killed american troops took okinawa in the last campaign of the pacific war nearly a third of the residents , or almost 150 , 000 people , were killed as the japanese forces chose to retreat directly through populated areas hundreds more were forced to commit suicide by the defeated japanese more than 12 , 000 american troops and 107 , 000 japanese were killed many here remember the american occupation as a period of benign neglect the okinawans answered ultimately to unelected american occupiers , but faced none of the cultural suppression the japanese had inflicted on them i'm not going to forgive you for those 27 years of occupation , mr oshiro said but it did make it possible for us to develop independently we had the space to develop our culture and look at japan in a new way governor ota said the okinawans were waging a battle on two related fronts on the one hand , he said , the bases must be removed in addition , the okinawans insist they will fight to retain their special identity amid a culture that demands conformity it s not quite confidence you see here now , but something on the way to being confident , said hiroko sho , the prefecture s vice governor it s just beginning in a more solid way that s what has started with the 20th anniversary photo gov masahide ota of okinawa , speaking last week during celebration of the 20th anniversary of america s return of the japanese island \( kyodo news service \) map of japan showing

colville , wash , sept 14 president bush rushed today to side with far west loggers in a war with environmentalists over a threatened owl , vowing to block renewal of the endangered species act unless it takes into account jobs and the economy while protecting vanishing creatures the president s position , long implicit but not formally announced until now , would force a basic change in the 19yearold law , one of the strongest environmental measures ever enacted the endangered species act was intended as a shield for species against the effects of major construction projects like highways and dams , not a sword aimed at the jobs , families and communities of entire regions like the northwest , mr bush said it s time to put people ahead of owls the law now requires the government to take steps to protect threatened wildlife , regardless of the economic effects on towns or regions where the wildlife live effort to change law mr bush s statement marked a significant step in what has become an electionyear transition from advocate of strict environmental laws to a candidate who sees economic benefits in relaxing environmental restrictions in the first two years of his presidency , mr bush pushed through a clean air act that strengthened controls on virtually every source of air pollution in the country , barred construction of a new dam in colorado , halted oil exploration off both coasts and ordered a governmentowned electric utility to reduce pollution that clouded the grand canyon and his administration added plants and animals to the endangered species list at an annual rate faster than any president since richard m nixon but since last summer , when mr bush approved a proposal that would open half the nation s wetlands to development , the president has favored an approach to environmental policy aimed at protecting jobs in january , he halted new environmental regulations that he said would be too costly , and he speeded up those the white house considered friendly to business he removed restrictions on logging in the national forests , approved efforts by the justice department to relax enforcement of stripmining laws and negotiated out of an international treaty s restrictions on american production of carbon dioxide decades of bitter debate the endangered species act has been a point of contention between conservative and liberal political interests for decades , precisely because it is so unbending in the past , federal courts have halted billiondollar dams to save tiny snaildarters in the waters below them , and have limited subdivisions to save desert kangaroo rats here in washington , where timber companies are struggling in court with environmentalists over the fate of a threatened bird , the northern spotted owl , mr bush assailed the act as a broken law that he pledged will not stand he offered no details of his favored replacement , except to say that it should give greater consideration to jobs , families and communities but his sentiment was clear the challenge to put people ahead of owls drew cheers from nearly 5 , 000 people crammed into a chilly local lumberyard here , although residents said none of the forests in this part of the state are home to the owls colville , near spokane , is a republican stronghold in nominally democratic washington the dispute over the owls is centered mostly in far western washington and oregon , where the logging industry is badly depressed and mr bush is far less popular it also was not clear what mr bush s threat to block renewal of the endangered species law actually means in practical terms congress has not sought to reauthorize the act this year , in part , republicans charge , because it would force democratic lawmakers to take a stand on the spotted owl the white house is seeking instead to place language that would reinterpret the act in the 7 billion interior department appropriations bill , which is now in a housesenate conference a spokesman for the department , steve goldstein , said mr bush s challenge was technically aimed at a future reauthorization of the act , but he refused to rule out a presidential veto of the interior bill if his language was rejected the endangered species act , signed by president nixon and enacted in 1973 , prohibits the government , with very rare execeptions , from considering economic factors in identifying animals and plants that are threatened with extinction the law allows the president to name a cabinetlevel committee , popularly known as the god squad , which can approve plans to save a species even if the palns take into account economic considerations like the number of jobs affected but that has only been done twice this year and in 1979 the first time , the committee approved a dam in wyoming near a habitat of the endangered whooping crane last may , the panel voted to allow logging in oregon on 1 , 700 acres that are a home of the spotted owl environmentalists swiftly assailed mr bush s remarks today a costbenefit analysis would gut the endangered species act , said eric glitzenstein , a washington environmental lawyer who has been an adversary of the interior department it would substitute an economic judgment for a scientific and biological judgment on the status of species popular stand here but mr bush s comments were cheered by hundreds of members of the alliance for freedom , a national group that hopes to roll back environmental restrictions this is extremely encouraging to those of us who have been a besieged community the last four years , said larry mason , executive director of the washington commercial forest action committee , in forks , wash finally , there is a discussion on the presidential level of the appropriateness of a law like the endangered species act in his remarks today , mr bush sought to depict his position on the act as a moderate one , saying congress had always contemplated a balance between environment and economy not far from here is a timber town called forks , mr bush said like colville , forks supported a mill , and the mill supported a community because of a lack of timber , the mill had to close today unemployment at forks is at 20 percent the car dealership has closed the clothing store is gone mr bush maintained there was a single reason for the economic devastation the balance has been lost between economics and environmental needs today , he asserted , when harvesting on federal timberland is stopped outright by 13 different lawsuits under 7 different statutes , each inconsistent with the others , the balance has been lost it s time to fight for jobs , families and communities flying by helicopter into this town of 5 , 500 people deep in the foothills of the cascade mountains , mr bush also opened his federal grabbag again , as he has repeatedly in recent weeks , to strengthen local industry he said he would not sign a new species law unless he is given a specific plan to harvest enough timber to keep timber families working in 1993 and beyond he also promised to mandate that all logs cut from federal lands in washington be processed at local mills , rather than exported uncut to foreign ports on thursday , the president moved to keep idle timber mills open by waiving federal rules that slow the cutting of dead and dying timber in the west , where drought and disease are rampant in forests the exporting of uncut logs , productivity improvements in lumbering and a shift of the industry to the south have contributed to a large loss of jobs in the western timber business washington and oregon are at the center of the debate over saving the spotted owl , a subspecies now reduced by logging to about 3 , 000 nesting pairs in washington , oregon and california the owl lives mostly in the dwindling stands of oldgrowth forests that are among the last areas untouched by timber firms photo president bush campaigning yesterday at los penasquitos canyon preserve in san diego \( associated press \)
in his 23 years as a new york police officer , he never fired his gun in making an arrest but yesterday investigators were searching for four men who shot and killed james f o sullivan who retired from the police force 12 years ago when he pulled out a licensed gun and tried to stop a robbery in a lower manhattan electronics store thursday evening mr o sullivan , 57 years old , who was known as sully and had retired as a sergeant , was gunned down by one robber in an exchange of gunfire the three others fired shots at him as he lay dying , detectives said mr o sullivan , who was a security official for the bank of america , got off five shots himself , but apparently none of the thieves was hit in the gunfight at the radio shack at 9 broadway , off bowling green the commanding officer of manhattan detectives , assistant chief john j hill , said the gunmen fled with 1 , 700 in cash in a 1983 fourdoor blue buick with new york license plate g2u159 the car , he said , was stolen in brooklyn on nov 7 and used in a robbery on nov 9 chief hill said a transit police officer , mark colamesto , who was on the street , chased one of the robbers and tried unsuccessfully to pull him out of the car before it sped away the bank of america yesterday offered a 25 , 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killers , and the police department offered 1 , 000 officers who had worked with mr o sullivan described him as the prototype of a community police officer long before the department s recent emphasis on that approach he was an officer , they said , who on meal breaks visited elderly residents of nursing homes in his precinct and sheltered stray dogs until he could find a home for them they recounted incidents in which he arrested suspects by subduing them with his fists even after he had been slashed and a gun was aimed at him a man so gentle that after retiring from the force he became a registered nurse former officers said mr o sullivan grew up in the rockaways area of queens , enlisted in the navy in 1955 and had been a middleweight champion of the seventh fleet arthur hoyt , a retired detective , said that mr o sullivan as a rookie officer in 1958 was on night foot patrol in far rockaway and spotted a burglar in a western union office the burglar , mr hoyt said , pulled out a knife and slashed mr o sullivan s right hand mr o sullivan responded by knocking out the burglar with a left , mr hoyt said joseph j lazarich , a patrolcar partner with mr o sullivan from 1967 to 1978 in the 20th precinct on the west side , said he stopped by almost every day at nursing homes to visit patients if he thought someone was ill or neglected he would make sure the director of the home did something about it , mr lazarich added hugh brady , a retired detective , said that mr o sullivan was on foot patrol in the 20th precinct in the early 1970 s when he arrived at the scene of a drugstore robbery as the robber darted into the street with a gun in his hand they were almost face to face , and sully had no time to reach for his gun when the perp pulled the trigger , mr brady said fortunately the gun misfired , and sully landed one right to the guy s jaw and that took care of him mr brady said mr o sullivan was injured subduing another suspect and was on limited duty in his final two years in the department he decided to become a nurse because he wanted to help people , mr brady said but he was so sensitive that after five or six years of holding people in his arms and watching them die in hospitals he could n't take it anymore in 1986 , mr sullivan became a security official for the bank of america and was the head of security at a business office of the bank at 2 rector street he was on a work break when he walked three blocks to the radio shack to make a purchase and came upon one of the robbers struggling with a store employee , the police said he would n't turn his back on anyone in trouble , mr hoyt said photos james f o sullivan in a family photograph from the 1960 s mr o sullivan with his wife , lola , at his daughter s wedding in 1990
lee a iacocca , the outspoken chairman of the chrysler corporation , in an address before detroit s business elite , unleashed his most vitriolic attack yet on japan yesterday , predicting that president bush s trade mission would not budge the trade deficit or salve the auto industry s wounds other executives said yesterday that while the president s trip might eventually help narrow the trade deficit , mr bush focused too much attention on the conflict between japan and america s auto makers , who , they said , have only themselves to blame for their woes such views reflect the widespread belief outside detroit that the industry s troubles result not so much from japanese trade barriers as from the american auto makers' failure to match japan s efficiency and reputation for quality i know many companies do have problems with japan , but focusing on autos is taking on the japanese where they have a good story to tell , said george hatsopoulos , the chairman and chief executive of the thermo electron corporation , a hightechnology and industrialproducts company based in waltham , mass i think the trip was ill conceived mr iacocca , however , would have none of that i for one am fed up hearing from the japanese , and i might say some americans , too , that all our problems in this industry , all our problems , are our own damn fault , he told a gathering of about 5 , 000 business executives at the detroit economic club we do not have idiots running general motors , ford and chrysler , or our suppliers and our workers are not lazy and stupid he said that japanese auto makers benefited from having a closed sanctuary in their home market a huge , wideopen market like the united states to sell into a friendly japanese government , and company unions and sweetheart deals with banks and suppliers still , mr iacocca said that mr bush s trip , with 18 american business executives in tow , made an important diplomatic point what s changed is that economics finally made it to the front of the plane along with the generals and the admirals and all the foggy bottom types from the state department , he said their leaders have always taken business people on missions like this , because they 've always put economics and business first , he said of the japanese now we 're doing that he added seeing american government and business arm in arm for the first time ever sent the japanese a clear message and i think i think the japanese got it they did n't like it they fought it oh boy , did they fight it and they made a start in dealing with it , but only a start frankly , from a detroit perspective , it was weak , but it was a start the lunchtime speech was vintage iacocca , crammed with hyberbole , statistics , his trademark expletives and folk wisdom i used to believe the oriental long view was a great virtue and something we could learn from the japanese i was wrong it s not a virtue at all , it s a weapon , and we have to disarm them we need to use our own weapon good oldfashioned american impatience that means demanding a solution to the problem now some blunt words looking wan from having crossed the pacific twice since monday , mr iacocca reiterated his preference for free trade , but accused the japanese of exercising predatory trade and insidious japanese economic and political power within the united states he also rejected the notion that part of the reason for the large trade deficit is that american vehicles are unpopular in japan they say it s because our stuff is junk , he said i wonder if there s another reason like maybe because my jeep cherokee costs 12 , 000 more in japan than it does here because they do n't accept our certification , and everything has to be inspected , and there s a maze of red tape not designed to protect the japanese consumer , but to keep us out the business contingent with mr bush included executives from financialservice and industrial companies who spent most of their time outside of japan , visiting other trading partners but the presence of the top executives of the big three auto companies and several makers of auto parts emphasized the auto industry s needs to the point that they overshadowed other topics a different perspective the talks in japan actually put far less emphasis on the auto industry s concerns than the news reports suggested , said dexter f baker , chief executive of air products and chemicals inc of allentown , pa , and one of the executives on the bush trip he also said the visits to australia , singapore and south korea would have longrange benefits for business that have been underestimated i think it was a very positive trip , mr baker said president bush is the first president to focus for an extended period of time on the international trade issue , and he performed magnificently but other executives said yesterday that many americans were probably misled about japan s role in the challenges the economy faces and about

albany , nov 23 the republicans who have controlled the state senate for 27 years appeared to have suffered a small chink in their armor this month when election results indicated that one incumbent in southwest new york , jess j present , had lost to a democrat but today even that chink was eliminated when election officials announced that a count of absentee ballots had handed the victory to mr present after all returns released today showed that mr present , a 13term senator from bemus point , had held his seat by 190 votes , 50 , 540 to 50 , 350 his opponent , nancy g bargar , had been leading by about 900 votes after a recount of machine ballots mr present s victory means that the republicans will maintain their current 35to26 edge in the senate , and that none of the party s 31 incumbents running for reelection on nov 3 lost it also means that the election amounted to even more of an incumbency juggernaut of the 211member state legislature , only 8 incumbents lost races , and 3 of those did so only after redistricting forced them to run against other incumbents in a state where democrats enjoy a nearly 3to2 registration edge over republicans and where gov bill clinton carried the state s presidential vote by a 16point margin , the democrats had hoped this fall for a boost that would carry them to control of the senate , where they have been the minority party since 1965 but republicans , who seized on the advantages of incumbency and raised more than 10 times as much money for the senate races , managed to fight off the challenge across the legislature as a whole , incumbents running for reelection against challengers won 97 percent of the time this year , according to figures compiled by new york state common cause a drop of just one percentage point from the average rate of 98 percent in the last 20 years julian palmer , the executive director of the group , described mr present s close victory as a reflection of the fact that new york s election laws make it exceedingly difficult to unseat incumbents the margin of victory clearly came from what was , in effect , an intensive getouttheabsenteevote effort by workers for mr present , who was endangered in part because of a challenge from a conservative party candidate , john w hasper what the whole thing shows to me is the less things change , the more they stay the same , said mr palmer
martha s vineyard , mass by midjuly before the quest for atlantic salmon claimed my attention , i had caught more than 130 striped bass with a fly rod this season and had kept only two of them it is n't that i do n't enjoy eating stripers only two of those fish reached or exceeded massachusetts' minimum length limit 36 inches for the species , although two dozen of them were over 30 inches on the vineyard , angling for stripers traditionally slows in midsummer , picking up again in september in late september , i pursued bass with a fly rod from the vineyard s beaches for seven nights over a twoweek period and was rewarded with less than half a dozen small fish i hankered for one more encounter with striped bass and when my brother dan drove into the yard in midoctober and asked me if i would like to go out with him in his boat and cast for them along the rocky rough and tumble of the vineyard s north shore , i rose to his offer dan does not like to dawdle , so i spent only a few minutes gathering up a fly rod , a plugging rod and assorted lures and flies dan made the first cast when we fish together , he always makes the first cast i was admiring the fall colors on the forested hillside a half mile away pale yellows and mildlyhectic reds a big fish slammed into his danny plug , a surface swimmer \( danny plugs and my brother have no formal affiliation \) all i have to do is keep this fish out of the rocks , said my brother it s a good one dan s line went slack he tossed his rod to the deck , cursed with commendable fluency , then said , i'm jinxed ! i ca n't hook and hold a big fish here this fall either they cut me off on the rocks or the hooks pull out and now the line lets go ! she got my best danny plug , too he reeled in the line had let go at the knot to the snap swivel as he rummaged about for another danny plug , i made a cast with one of my own and was rewarded with a series of boils behind it this happened two more times the bass appeared to be toying with the lure try another danny , said my brother there is n't one in 10 that acts just right , but they are still the best surface swimmers you can buy do you have any that are n't weighted \? i always take the lead weights out of mine they have to stay on top and you want the tail end and the tail hook to sway back and forth , making a wide wake with a slow retrieve he caught and released a striper about 30 inches long before i finally hooked and released one of about the same size there ! my brother shouted as the water bulged behind his plug and the tail of a truly large bass sent spray flying he struck back hard the fish broke free in about 10 seconds two of the plug s treble hooks were crushed inward think of the jaw power it takes to do that , dan said as he began a frantic search for a pair of pliers with which to repair the damage we caught six or seven bass in about two hours of fishing that day , including one keeper taken by dan wherever we stopped and cast from the drifting boat , the stripers were there , including many large ones much of the time we could see the bass coming they were obviously interested in our plugs , but for every one that hit there were a dozen that turned away at the last instant about halfway through the endeavor , i switched to my fly rod and soon was in a fury of frustration there were times when as many as four stripers came right to the boat at one time , their noses only inches from the fly , but they refused to take in my rush to get going , i had brought only small flies intended to resemble sand eels i was sure that big surface sliders would do the trick , but had none with me upon my return home , i located the flies that i should have brought with me i also gathered up all my danny plugs , drilled the lead weights out of them and sharpened all their hooks two days later we returned to the north shore the temperature had dropped to a few degrees above freezing the previous evening , and at 10 am was still in the mid40 s they may be gone , said my brother as we hurtled along at 40 miles an hour in his 20foot sea craft pushed by a new 150horsepower evinrude outboard he likes to get where he is going in a hurry my first cast with a danny plug produced a solid hit from a big fish it remained hooked for only seconds , but before the lure was back to the boat , another fish made a pass at it that was the beginning and end of the action for us that day we fished all of our favorite north shore locations and even ran around gay head scattering huge rafts of whitewinged scoters before us and cast to several rock piles along the ocean side of the island they are gone others may stop by , but those fish we found two days ago have migrated , dan said perhaps it s time to think about duck hunting , i said , looking at the undulating lines of scoters low over the ocean photo dan bryant with a striped bass he caught off martha s vineyard , mass \( nelson bryant for the new york times \)
meribel , france , feb 18 the united states hockey team feeds off the jeers , off the clamor in the arena and the loud lectures in the locker room and the offsound of body smashed against wood the unbeaten americans grew bigger and their reliable goaltender grew even more steady with the roar again tonight , in a rowdy 41 quarterfinal victory over france the chanting crowd and the brassy coach woke them up after a period of sleepwalking had them flirting with sudden elimination from the olympic tournament we were tired to begin with , it was tough to get going , said ted donato , who scored two goals and had an assist the coach gave us a talk that i 'd have to rate a 10 and all the noise from the fans got our juices going lecture from the coach the victory sent the americans into friday s semifinals , where they will meet the winner of the match to be played wednesday between finland and the unified team on another friday 12 years ago , the american hockey team met the soviet union and accomplished what will always be known as the miracle on ice , clinching at least a silver medal before going on to claim the gold at lake placid , ny this time , the other semifinal will be canada against either czechoslovakia or sweden today , canada got past germany in only the second olympic hockey game decided on penalty shots in the team usafrance quarterfinal , the americans were down , 10 , after one period and mentally tired from a tough 33 tie monday night against sweden so coach dave peterson gave the players the sort of lecture that only he can deliver i'm pretty loud to begin with , peterson said , and i thought we were kind of lethargic no handshakes afterwards so peterson yelled , and the french fans screamed , and soon the american legs and the hips were grinding again in the second period , the united states jammed the puck down the slot of their opponents to score three times by the end , the americans were swinging sticks and , yes , refusing to shake hands there were four united states players in the penalty box at the final buzzer , fights all over the ice and an insulted opponent in the locker room as always the americans are winning , 41 , i do n't know why they need to do this , french forward phillippe bozon said i do n't think it is the french team that is starting fights maybe they need to play so hard and physical to be successful they need that , and they most definitely require goaltender ray leblanc the pattern is unmistakable every match , the americans are outfinessed and outshot they have yet to be outscored the difference , france coach kjell larsson said , is leblanc tonight , leblanc made 35 saves , while the united states managed just 17 shots at goaltender petri ylonen the french scored first , electrifying the crowd , on a rookie mistake by the americans' most veteran player defenseman moe mantha , who has 12 seasons of national hockey league experience behind him , flipped a sloppy , slow crossice pass to his teammate sean hill at his own blue line stephane barin intercepted , headed in on leblanc , and beat him high to the stick side at 11 minutes 1 second of the first period the arena exploded , and shortly afterward a fistfight broke out in the stands between a french fan and an american fan the american was escorted out of the arena us scores three but in the second period , the united states regained solid control of the match with three unanswered goals none was particularly beautiful , but each one staked out more territory in front of the french net we did not take the man , bozon said that was our mistake keith tkachuk tied the game on a powerplay goal at 5 43 of the second period , a rebound tucked over the flailing body of ylonen donato stuffed the puck in from a tangle of bodies outside the crease at 8 13 and donato slid a backhand under ylonen at 11 29 , again from in front of the crease donato created the americans' final goal , as well , stealing the puck from defenseman bruno saunier , then feeding marty mcinnis for an easy onetimer the french were done for the night compared to the finns and swedes , those teams do n't have the same pep as the americans , said patrick dunn , another envious french forward i think it could be a north american medal 'our line s turn tonight' donato , a harvard graduate who calls his degree , my miracle off ice , said he got no more personal satisfaction from scoring the two goals than from his team s victory it was just our line s turn tonight , he said people underestimate the power of this team banding together in difficult situations there were a couple of loose threads to tie up greg brown , the american player injured when he was slammed into the boards by mats naslund of sweden on monday night , is out of the hospital and will try to practice on wednesday peterson said he had n't shaken the hand of the swedish coaches that night , because they had n't shaken his hand at chamonix two weeks earlier in an exhibition now , it is on to the next step , and a semifinal match on friday against the winner of the unified teamfinland match will be the most difficult situation of all the surprising united states , 501 and still turning heads , will be playing for at least a silver medal in that one a victory just might justify every missed handshake , every one of peterson s social gaffes i'm not in

moscow , aug 20 not everyone in moscow this week is celebrating the anniversary of the victory over the coup attempt of last year , least of all yelena a lukyanov her father , anatoly lukyanov , is one of 11 men who are still being held in prison one year later on charges of conspiring to seize power , awaiting a verdict in a case that looks like it may never end ms lukyanov , a 34yearold law professor and committed communist , calls them political prisoners , victims of what she describes as a corrupted government that has no interest in seeing justice done it is not to their benefit to bring this case to court , she said it will do them no good , and they know it the case against mr lukyanov , former head of the soviet parliament , is particularly sensitive unlike the other defendants , he was not directly linked to the state emergency committee that seized power last year , on aug 19 he was not arrested until aug 29 , the eve of the last session of parliament this timing , in the eyes of his only child , is proof that the purpose was to remove him from the political arena furthermore , ms lukyanov said , the government has no case my father has read through the 125 volumes of evidence , and he says none of it holds together , she said in an interview on wednesday there is nothing there government is called 'brazen' she had just given an emotional speech , attacking the government of president boris n yeltsin for its brazen political persecution of those , like her father , who wanted to prevent the sudden death of the soviet union her audience , several hundred members of mr yeltsin s opposition , was ready with applause when she denounced the case against the coup plotters and another one , now in progress , against the communist party from the tangled web of events that surrounded the coup attempt , a number of conspiracy theories have emerged a favorite among mr yeltsin s opposition is that the coup was a spectacle contrived to secure the victory of the democrats , as members of the old anticommunist opposition are still called , and to engineer the demise of the soviet union since the coup attempt , a mountain of material has been published in the russian press , some from prosecutors , some from defendants , some from bystanders in the threeday drama but there are many pieces missing from the puzzle , and others that do not fit why did the coup leaders , having isolated president mikhail s gorbachev at his seaside villa in the crimea , not move to isolate mr yeltsin , then the president of russia , at his country house outside moscow \? was mr gorbachev as isolated as he said he was \? why , once it became clear that mr yeltsin would mount resistance from the russian parliament building , did the kgb not cut off communications \? why did the army sit by and watch its troops within moscow go over to the other side \? and finally , was there ever a plan to storm the building , as the thousands of defenders so firmly believed on the rainy night of aug 2021 \? at the opposition meeting wednesday , ivan v konstantinov , a member of the russian parliament who went to the building on aug 19 , described many contradictions they told me we were in the middle of a military putsch , he said i thought of chile , of mass arrests , of concentration camps when i watched mr yeltsin walk out of the building and approach the lead tank , i thought , 'this is it' but to my amazement , he climbed on the tank , and nobody stopped him in the building , members of mr yeltsin s team were on the phone , calling around the country , calling abroad , mr konstantinov said his description of the confusion in moscow a year ago is neither new nor startling but what is perplexing is that the government , with access to kgb tapes and scribbled notes found on the defense minister s desk , has not presented a clear picture of conspiracy it is typical of the haphazard nature of the emerging evidence that russia s chief prosecutor , valentin stepankov , recently gave his most definitive account of the coup to a german magazine , der stern , and not to the russian press according to an account of the interview carried by the russian news agency itartass , the plotters made their final plan for action only on aug 5 , 1991 , when mr gorbachev left moscow for a summer vacation the precipitating event was the signing of a new union treaty , scheduled for aug 20 , after which three of the coup s masterminds were to lose their jobs the storming of the parliament building was originally planned for 1 am on aug 21 , mr stepankov said it never took place , he said , in part because of the large crowds , but also because of the coup plotters' unwillingness to assume responsibility he said the army was waiting for the kgb , while the kgb was waiting for the other units to move first mr stepankov also said president yeltsin was ready to order the bombing of the kremlin , where the plotters had their headquarters , if the parliament building was attacked but such is the skepticism about the entire case , shared even by those supported mr yeltsin , that mr stepankov s accounts were quickly brushed aside , at least by one newspaper commentator more likely than not , the chief prosecutor is pursuing political goals , and not legal ones , wrote a journalist for the daily izvestia photo yelena a lukyanov , a committed communist , calls the 11 men whoare still being held in prison for their involvement in the coup attampt last year , including her father , anatoly lukyanov , political prisoners \( otto pohl for the new york times \)

washington , nov 6 when president bush s glum supporters wandered out of the houston ballroom where he gave his concession speech tuesday night , they were greeted by a vendor hawking kemp in '96 tshirts sales were brisk in indianapolis the next morning , vice president dan quayle s aides wasted no time repainting a bushquayle '92 banner on a campaign bus to read push quayle '96 it did not take long for republicans to look beyond the recriminations over the 1992 ticket to their prognostications for 1996 there is a passing on of the baton right now , said william j bennett , a top official in the bush and reagan administrations who may run for president himself , and there are a lot of hands out there to take it kemp seen at the top even this soon after mr bush s defeat , most republicans , with a little prodding , will talk about 1996 , and most say jack f kemp , the secretary of housing and urban development who has espoused a message of compassionate conservatism , is in the best position the early line is that such bush administration insiders as mr quayle and james a baker 3d would be too tainted by tuesday s defeat to emerge in 1996 but if republicans were reminded of anything from the outcome tuesday , it is that the next president may not be on anyone s current list gov bill clinton s election was also a reminder not to count out the bench of potential republicans stars , from gov william f weld of massachusetts to gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina to look at what s going to happen in 1996 is almost absurd because nobody knows they have n't got a clue , said frederick r meyer , chairman of the texas republican party a secondstringer just became president of the united states i would feel stupid talking about it because someone might save this article and bring it up to me in five years it is true that the republican nomination in 1996 may hinge as much on what presidentelect clinton does in office as what any republicans do there are also considerations beyond any candidate s control will the republican party look to a conservative or a moderate \? \( a hint of that should come after the party elects its new chairman in january \) now that they are in political exile , how visible will people like mr quayle and mr kemp be \? and will governors like mr weld and pete wilson of california pull their states out of financial chaos , win reelection and then be ready for the national stage \? such concerns aside , the scheming and angling among wouldbe nominees is under way months ago , in fact , sentimentality had given way to raw ambition , with even officials in the white house notsoquietly talking up their preferred candidates for the next run gramm is stepping out using his chairmanship of the national republican senatorial committee as a vehicle , senator phil gramm of texas has been most blatant about his ambitions in an obvious effort to gauge his support around the country , he had his name added to polls that the committee conducted of republican voters on behalf of republican statewide candidates it did not appear to be an accident that mr kemp spent the cold , rainy election day touring polling places in new hampshire , the state that holds the first primary they 'll all be up here beginning in january , said warren b rudman , the state s retiring senator who is sometimes mentioned as a 1996 republican contender they 'll be at all the lincoln day dinners but the fact is , it does n't make any difference until the last four weeks of the campaign , but nobody understands that shades of '76 bill brock said the climate now reminds him of 1976 , when he became the republican party chairman after president jimmy carter knocked the party out of office little did he know then that ronald reagan would emerge as the next president there will be some pretty early jockeying to establish the credentials of those who might want to run , mr brock said but after that initial phase , we probably will see a quiet period while people evaluate the new administration , get a sense of what its vulnerabilities might be and how that might fit the talents that one individual might bring versus another mr kemp is mentioned by republican politicians in and out of washington as a top contender he s clearly a very , very hot property at this point , said representative jerry lewis of california , chairman of the house republican conference the peril for mr kemp is that if he is the leading contender , that gives rivals four years to tear him down another obvious possibility is mr quayle but even mr quayle s backers say that at age 45 , the vice president may be better off waiting 8 or even 12 years to run for the top job one who clearly is not waiting to gear up for 1996 is mr gramm he suffered a setback at the republican national convention when he delivered a keynote speech that was widely criticized as tedious , but so was mr clinton s keynote speech at the 1988 democratic national convention frank j fahrenkopf , a former republican party chairman , suggested that mr bush s loss had damaged mr quayle , mr gramm and mr baker republicans are disappointed right now , he said , and anyone who was very closely aligned with the campaign as of today would not be leading the pack maybe they will six months from now , or a year from now , after the scars and wounds heal unlike mr gramm , dick cheney , another possible contender , did his best to keep some healthy political distance between himself and the bush administration while serving as secretary of defense robin west , an official in the reagan and ford administrations , said that by keeping some distance mr cheney was better positioned than mr baker dole will be noticed though older at the age of 69 than most of the others , senator bob dole of kansas is another whose name cannot be left off any list as the senate republican leader , he will be the leading spokesman for the party under a democratic administration also leaving the door open are conservatives who raise the notion that with mr clinton as president , the republicans may favor a candidate who can draw a sharp contrast high on that list would be patrick j buchanan , who challenged mr bush in the primaries and is returning for now to his role as a television commentator there is also pat robertson , the television evangelist who gained respectable support in 1988 but as steven a merksamer , a republican operative in sacramento warned we 're talking about something that s happening four years from now there could be someone who emerges that none of us have heard about let alone met photo the early line on republican candidates for 1996 is that bush insiders like vice president dan quayle and james a baker 3d , the white house chief of staff , would be too tainted by tuesday s defeat to emerge in 1996 mr quayle acknowledged supporters on tuesday after his concession speech \( mary ann carter for the new york times \)
washington , oct 26 at the beginning of the presidential debate last monday night , with 90 million americans looking on , gov bill clinton was asked a straightforward question how can voters believe that he can pay for all his campaign promises so painlessly \? it was an appropriate question the democratic presidential nominee promises to create jobs , reduce the budget deficit , cut taxes of the middle class , reform welfare , provide universal medical insurance , guarantee college educations for everyone qualified and spend 20 billion a year more on new public works projects to pay for all that , he proposes little beyond higher taxes on the very wealthy and foreign corporations and modest additional cuts in military spending shift into cruising gear but it also was a question mr clinton has fielded time and again this year before smaller audiences so in the debate , he shifted into his familiar cruising gear he responded that middleclass americans were overtaxed he decried trickledown and taxandspend economics he said the country could increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time once again , he did not answer the question throughout the campaign , mr clinton , president bush and ross perot have ducked a variety of questions or managed to avoid discussing certain difficult topics altogether the matter of how they would pay for their campaign promises is foremost but they have also dodged such issues as urban decay , homelessness and bank failures mr bush is no more precise about how the country could afford the pinata filled with the tax cuts he favors an acrosstheboard reduction by one percentage point in tax rates , increased personal exemptions for families with children , credits and deductions to help families pay for medical insurance , a cut in the capital gains tax rate , new tax breaks for investments in plants , machinery and real estate , tax credits for firsttime homebuyers , more generous tax treatment of individual retirement accounts , lower smallbusiness taxes and writeoffs for businesses that give workers time off in family emergencies all together , these tax measures could cost the government 250 billion or more in lost revenue over the next five years the president said last monday night , as he has throughout the campaign , that he intended to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending just what is this mandatory spending he wants to control , and how does he propose to control it \? mr bush never says mr perot has made deficit reduction the focal point of his campaign , and he talks often about fair , shared sacrifice but even his ledger is heavy on the side of promises and light on the side of pain tom stacy , a law professor at de paul university in chicago who has scrutinized mr perot s policy proposals , puts the matter this way perot is not very different from the stereotypical politician from whom he tries to distance himself he , too , promises that we can have our cake and eat it too we can balance the budget while having everything else we want economic growth , universal health care , better schools and safer streets the deficit doubtful figures for many plans the budget deficit the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it takes in is expected to be nearly 350 billion in this fiscal year , by far the highest in the nation s history all the candidates talk about reducing it mr perot says he would eliminate it entirely in six years mr bush says he would lower the deficit by twothirds at least , and mr clinton promises to cut it in half during the next four years almost without exception , independent experts who have studied these proposals say that the candidates' figures do not stand up to scrutiny clinton s plan just does n't add up , and bush has n't proposed anything specific , said stanley e collender , a specialist in the federal budget at price waterhouse , the accounting firm the perot proposals , mr collender added , have little meaning unless the independent candidate explains how he would reduce the government s spending on medicare and medicaid , which will continue to mushroom if the law is not changed in fact , the biggest problem with all of their plans is that the three candidates want to overhaul the nation s medical care system to make health insurance much more widely available , but none have suggested realistically how this could be financed mr clinton and mr bush suggest it could be done by controlling medical costs in one way or another mr bush talks about somehow restraining malpractice lawsuits mr clinton has said he wants a federal board to set prices but the authorities doubt any of this would be sufficient , and say universal medical insurance could cost the government as much as 20 billion a year mr perot is even more vague in the debate monday night , here is how he described what he would do about the problem we 've got plans lying all over the place in washington nobody ever implements them now i'm back to square one if you want to stop talking about it and do it , then i 'll go up there , and we 'll get it done
february 1992 serbian forces opened a cam paign of aggression against the former region of yugoslavia called bosnia and herzegovina in short order they launched a relentless bombardment of sarajevo , the historic city that gave living proof that many faiths can coexist this assault was only the most visible part of the serbs' barbaric campaign of ethnic cleansing against the muslim slavs 44 percent of bosnia s 44 million people what did the world do \?

washington did not press for immediate investigation of the camps instead , it tried to keep the reports from becoming public if other countries received similar reports , they gave no public sign may 4 with serbs in control of half the country , the bosnian government appealed to the world , with poignant logic , to lift the arms embargo on bosnia and give it the means to defend itself what did the world do \? the arms embargo remains , to this day may 7 serb and croat nationalists in bosnia agreed to carve up the republic , a process the european community blandly called cantonment five days later the un reported a concerted effort by the serbs to create ethnically pure regions in bosnia in the context of the ec negotiations on cantonment what did the world do \?

may 30 the un finally imposed an economic embargo on serbia but stopped short of enforcing it secretary of state baker said that before we consider force , we ought to exhaust all the political , diplomatic and economic remedies that might be at hand an unnamed us official said , we are really talking about the need maybe to do something next time everyone in the loop concedes that yugoslavia is a past case already early june outside sarajevo , the carnage of ethnic cleansing continued serbs had by now overrun twothirds of the country , displacing 700 , 000 people what did the world do \? june 6 president bush said , we 're concerned about the situation in yugoslavia , but there s no commitment on that ten days later the us agreed to help airlift food and medicine to sarajevo , but only after a un force of 1 , 100 took control of the airport the un said it could not send in such a force until a ceasefire took hold throughout june relentless serb shelling continued to reduce beautiful old sarajevo to rubble what did the world do \? june 26 the security council gave the serbs an ultimatum stop shelling sarajevo and put all heavy guns under un control or face military action a senior american official said , meanwhile , no action is imminent july 3 the serbs temporarily withdrew from the airport but without relinquishing their heavy guns the airlift began , but only fitfully under intermittent serb shelling three weeks later roy gutman of newsweek visited serbrun camps and heard eyewitness accounts of murders and atrocities other reporters uncovered rape camps where muslim women were violated by the thousands what did the world do \? the us expressed concern and insisted that the red cross be allowed into the camps it said nothing about freeing those imprisoned or punishing the perpetrators summer and fall serbs conducted hundreds of bombing and strafing raids on bosnian towns what did the world do \?

new delhi , jan 20 in sharp contrast to the rest of the world , south asia is on the brink of a nuclear arms race , say senior western diplomats and foreign political figures who have visited new delhi in recent weeks this arms race is viewed with particular alarm because of the continuing tension between india and pakistan over kashmir , a region over which two wars have already been fought and although both india and pakistan are regarded as nuclear powers by western intelligence agencies , these diplomats generally contend that it is india , rather than pakistan , that has blocked any meaningful progress toward defusing nuclear proliferation south asia seems to be bucking the trend on reducing international tensions , said a senior diplomat here we see south asia at the precipice of a nuclear weapons race within the next five years , both sides will have mediumrange missiles each side will have to assume the worst of each other and this is destabilizing because of the hairtrigger nature of these missiles in times of tension first nuclear , now chemical india detonated a nuclear device in 1974 for what it said were peaceful purposes , and pakistan is generally recognized as having developed its own nuclear abilities indeed , in testimony this month to the senate subcommittee on nonproliferation , robert m gates , the director of central intelligence , expressed washington s anxiety over the direction both nations were taking in south asia , the arms race between india and pakistan is a major concern , mr gates told the subcommittee not only do both countries have nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs they have recently pursued chemical weapons as well these programs are particularly worrisome because of constant tension and conflict in kashmir all american assistance to pakistan was cut off in 1990 because of its nuclearweapons program in the last year , and especially in recent months , concerted international pressure a medley of wooing , cajoling , encouragement , suggestions , hectoring and plain blunt talk has been applied to india , pressure intended to get the government to address the question of nuclear proliferation in south asia so far none of it has worked pakistan proposes talks since june , pakistan has been making proposals for talks with india over nuclear issues , has volunteered to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty if india does and has suggested a gathering of the united states , russia , china , india and pakistan to discuss the elimination of nuclear weapons in south asia in november , during a visit here by the under secretary of state for security assistance , science and technology , reginald bartholomew , the united states proposed more sweeping fivepower talks to explore a greater range of options among his ideas were a testban treaty and pledges not to attack urban centers , along with a proposal that both india and pakistan sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and submit to international inspection no response from india india has remained silent on all these proposals , instead offering arguments as to why it cannot contemplate a limit on its nuclear options these arguments are made publicly in the press , privately in conversations with foreign journalists and even , with hardly any differences , in discussions with foreign governments foremost , india insists that pakistan retains aggressive intentions toward india and that it has its own nuclear weapons with its smaller army , the indians argue , pakistan will inevitably rely more on its nuclear arsenal , however tiny , if there is a serious conflict along the border the indians also argue that as long as china , a nation with whom it fought a border war in 1962 , possesses nuclear weapons , new delhi cannot consider any proposal that would lead to a nuclearfree zone in south asia , since china shows no signs of giving up its nuclear weapons india also contends that there is an inherent unfairness in the pressure from the large powers on new delhi when they continue to possess large arsenals of their own but these arguments have not been met with sympathy , neither in washington nor in moscow , nor in london nor even in tokyo nonproliferation is not an american issue , said a diplomat here the french and the germans have found religion on this issue even the japanese have expressed their concerns to the india about this the united states and britain in particular , are pressing india to put forth some ideas of its own last week , foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain was here and the issue of nonproliferation headed his agenda and next month ronald f lehman 2d , the director of the united states arms control and disarmanent agency , is to visit new delhi to reemphasize washington s position i have left them in no doubt of the growing anxiety of nuclear proliferation , mr hurd told the bbc they left me in no doubt that so far as they are concerned they see the problems here in this part of the world as resulting from the differences between of india and pakistan after emerging from his meetings with government leaders , the foreign secretary was pessimistic about prospects for india joining any fivepower talks on nuclear proliferation i did n't have the impression that this was likely in the near future , he said diplomats here and in western capitals are becoming increasingly frustrated by india s refusal either to discuss proliferation with them or to put forth ideas of their own at the british embassy here , david s keeling , first secretary for information , said what we have suggested to the indians is that there is no point in turning their backs on these ideas , that they should frame proposals of their own why not come out with some positive proposals of their own and come and sit down and talk about it \? india is becoming more and more conspicuous in its stance , said a senior western diplomat here the indians know that the countries they are depending on to make their economic reforms a success are pushing them on nonproliferation they have a hard choice to make particularly worrisome , this diplomat said , is the rush toward the development of mediumrange missiles by both sides they say they have a legitimate need for missiles , the diplomat said china has them pakistan is getting them it s a matter of parity and all that this is extremely dangerous the political factor many diplomats here say the difficulty facing india s leaders in grappling with nuclear issues is as much political as substantive the main opposition party , the bharatiya janata party , a hindu chauvinist party bitterly hostile to pakistan , opposes signing the nonproliferation treaty indeed , in a visit to the united states this month , the party s president , lal kishen advani , said india should retain its nuclear ability prime minister p v narasimha rao , who heads a minority government in parliament and who is delicately pushing forward with the most radical restructuring of india s economy since independence , is not seen by most diplomats as willing to provoke a showdown with the opposition over the nuclear issue pakistan s continued aid to separatist rebels in kashmir has made it virtually impossible for him even to engage his counterpart in islamabad in discussing the matter but a diplomat here said the indians had been told repeatedly pakistan has said it will match any indian move on nukes maybe it s a bluff , but it should be called
chiphou , cambodia , april 4 this village about 10 miles from the vietnamese border , on the old french colonial road linking phnom penh and saigon , has changed beyond recognition , but it remains the place where the mass disappearances of journalists , victims of the war in cambodia , began on april 5 , 1970 , at a vietnamese army roadblock about three miles east of here , six photographers and members of television camera teams were seized and never seen again the next morning , two americans , sean flynn of time magazine , the son of the actor errol flynn , and dana stone of cbs news , parked their motorcycles at a grocery store on the marketplace of this village and joined three colleagues for a drink they laughed when they were cautioned about what the road ahead might hold , particularly since they wore parts of american army camouflage uniforms the three others left in one car , slowly , ready to turn back at any sign of danger moments later , the two motorcycles roared up behind them , one passing on the left , the other on the right their riders waved it was the last time their friends saw mr flynn and mr stone , and the number of the missing , never to return from that roadblock , rose to eight 30 journalists killed in the days and weeks after the communist vietnamese invasion of cambodia , which began almost immediately after the coup that overthrew prince norodom sihanouk on march 18 , 1970 , the government of prime minister lon nol published no news about the fighting to learn what was happening , reporters left phnom penh , the capital , every morning to see how far they could go on the roads leading east and south , to judge how much more of cambodia the north vietnamese , aided by the precursors of the khmer rouge movement , had bitten off before the war in indochina was over , more than 30 journalists of many nationalities had been killed last month the first grave of missing journalists may have been discovered , 34 miles south of phnom penh four skeletons were sent to a military forensic laboratory in hawaii for identification one is possibly the remains of welles hangen , an nbc news correspondent , formerly of the new york times mr hangen , his french cameraman and japanese soundman , as well as two japanese working for cbs , disappeared in may 1970 the deaths of the journalists has made little mark on cambodians , whose own losses in the war and its aftermath were incalculable a man in a primitive coffee shop in the rebuilt village said he had heard of three journalists being killed on those two days 22 years ago in chiphou laughingly , he told this correspondent , who shared that drink with mr flynn and mr stone on their last morning , in the grocery that stood approximately on the site of the present coffee shop , that the villagers had been scared to death to see westerners in chiphou then the vietcong were all around the village since the night before , he said , and the villagers feared they would shoot up chiphou to capture them he pointed across the street and said that had been the site of the old french fort , which the vietnamese had set afire pol pot finished the rest , he added he destroyed everything that was left of chiphou what you see now was all built after 1979 in that year , vietnamese troops , who had been the ally of the khmer rouge , invaded cambodia and overthrew the government of prime minister pol pot , the khmer rouge leader in 1970 chiphou was a modest market town , with a large population of vietnamese they fled to vietnam because they were afraid of the khmer rouge , the man said , as other villagers agreed they laughed in embarrassment when the visitor recalled that in fact the vietnamese minority had not fled from the cambodian communists but had been driven out , many of them killed and their property sacked , by the forces of the americansupported lon nol government and much of the civilian population yes , there was a massacre , another man acknowledged when they were asked whether they recalled that in prasot , a few miles to the west , more than 80 vietnamese children , men and women had been mowed down by the lon nol troops in april 1970 perhaps the people of this warscarred region can be forgiven for having confused memories of the many waves of mayhem that has poured over them in their lifetimes often a battleground this region , svay rieng province , has been a major battleground in all the wars of indochina the french colonial war , the american involvement and the war between vietnam and cambodia most of the villages between here and phnom penh , about a hundred miles west , have been altered beyond recognition by the cumulative efforts of the various land forces that did battle , widespread american bombing and the destructive frenzy of the pol pot regime now , at the cruelest peak of the sweltering dry season , when only those fields with irrigation show signs of green and promise of harvest , it is hard to tell which of the deep holes are bomb craters and which driedup fish ponds not everything has changed pagodas are flourishing once more in this land of deeply felt buddhism after the war on religion by the pol pot regime , followed by only a restricted revival under the vietnameseimposed successor government but fear of government , more or less present under all regimes in cambodia , remains alive none of the men in the coffee shop would give their names you go , i stay here , one said when asked what he feared the ship has gone , the harbor remains photo dana stone was among the american war correspondents who disappeared in cambodia 22 years ago last month the first grave of missing journalists may have been discovered near phnom penh \( upi bettmann \) map of cambodia showing

in recent months , warren e buffett has dropped various hints about the kind of person he would select to replace him as chairman of salomon inc an experienced businessman , a knowledgeable investor , a seasoned wall street person he chose none of the above yesterday salomon named robert e denham , its general counsel , who came to wall street to join salomon only nine months ago mr buffett had called on the 46yearold career lawyer to sort out the legal mess left behind after the disclosure of the company s role in a treasury auction scandal mr denham helped guide salomon through a long investigation , which ended last month with a 290 million settlement before last year , mr denham spent 20 years as a lawyer with munger , tolles olson in los angeles , where he specialized in securities law and corporate acquisitions among his principal clients were the pacific stock exchange and berkshire hathaway inc , mr buffett s investment company it s a surprise to virtually everyone , said deryck c maughan , who last week was named chairman and chief executive of the company s investment banking subsidiary , salomon brothers inc it was a classic warren buffett move everybody s predicting one thing , and he thinks in a new way wall street executives , who could not remember the last time a lawyer was named to head a leading brokerage , said mr buffett was less interested in surprising conventional wisdom than in finding someone he could trust to run salomon the way he intended mr buffett , who invested 700 million in salomon in 1987 , will remain chairman of the executive committee on the company s board speculation about whom mr buffett would choose was rife on wall street before yesterday s announcement , and some executives expected the winner to be john j byrne , the chief executive of the fund american companies buffett ties cited friends and associates of mr denham cited his unusual intelligence , competence and integrity , but some acknowledged that his personal relationship with mr buffett was most critical to his selection warren buffett has to have confidence in whoever takes this position , said robert e wycoff , the president and chief operating officer of arco , who has known mr denham as a friend and neighbor in los angeles for several years i think that s really the issue here mr denham declined to be interviewed yesterday , and a statement released by salomon did not include any comments from him instead , it listed the primary responsibilities mr buffett expects him to take up evaluating the performance at salomon s two subsidiaries , salomon brothers and phibro energy inc , and their executives setting their compensation insuring the legality and prudence of their operations , and allocating the capital they produce new general counsel due mr denham will also guide a new general counsel , to be appointed soon , the salomon statement said , adding that while his immediate duties would require his full time , it would gradually become a parttime position he will eventually return to his old law firm in los angeles , while remaining salomon inc s chairman mr denham is unlikely , mr maughan said , to alter the style or priorities that mr buffett established over the nine months that he served as interim chairman asked about mr denham s lack of business and wall street experience , mr maughan said the new structure at salomon was set up so that mr denham would not have daily responsibilities at salomon brothers , which fall to mr maughan this is not the structure we had under john gutfreund , mr maughan said , referring to salomon inc s previous chairman , who was also salomon brothers' chairman , and a physical presence on the firm s bondtrading floor bob is not going to sit there and trade treasury bonds mr gutfreund , who resigned when the full nature of the scandal emerged , seemed to personify the aggressive , sometimes bullying attitude that inspired fear and respect on wall street in contrast , acquaintances described mr denham s best attributes as those that are sooner used for an administrator than a leader he s one of the most intense and intelligent listeners i 've ever worked with , said ronald l olson , a senior partner at munger , tolles olson , who worked with mr denham for more than 10 years he has a quiet competence he s not a loud , massive personality type roderick m hills taught mr denham as a visiting professor at the harvard law school in 1970 before becoming chairman of the securities and exchange commission under president gerald r ford he remembered mr denham as the sharpest student in the law school mr hills said he had persuaded his student to join the los angeles law firm that later became munger , tolles olson , where he excelled , assuming a position equivalent to managing partner in 1985 i do n't think he was interested in wall street per se , mr hills said , referring to mr denham s move to salomon last year i think it was more that he enjoys the challenge of doing something new in salomon s statement , mr buffett said mr denham fitted perfectly the owneroriented and businesswise criterion that was set forth in salomon s annual report in march he comes to the post with extensive knowledge of our two major businesses but with no ties to either , mr buffett said in the statement i have known bob for 18 years and seen him perform with distinction in every job he has undertaken photo robert e denham , who is to replace warren e buffett as the chairman of salomon inc
manila , oct 16 when the children in some chinesefilipino families here head off for school in the morning , they are handed cellular phones along with their lunch boxes and are reminded to call home every hour my mom would have a heart attack if i did n't call , said one 10yearold manila boy , pulling a cellular phone from his pocket other chinesefilipino children in the philippine capital go nowhere these days without a chauffeured car and a brawny bodyguard a team of guards , if their parents have the money several manila schools with ethnic chinese students are guarded by armed patrols with shoottokill orders it may be a sign of the economic desperation of the philippines that one of the big growth industries here is kidnapping the targets are usually members of the small but comparatively affluent population of chinesefilipinos , who have a reputation for paying large ransoms and keeping their mouths shut this is a traumatized community , said teresita ang see , editor of a chinesefilipino magazine and one of the few prominent chinesefilipinos to speak out about the kidnappings you can call chinesefilipinos perfect victims because they do n't talk 'hoodlums in uniform' and if they did , she said , where would they turn for help \? the government acknowledges that some of the kidnapforransom gangs are led by police officers who have turned to crime to supplement their meager salaries , often less than 100 a month they are hoodlums in uniform , said vice president joseph estrada , who heads the government effort to stop the abductions a manila newspaper reported the case of a kidnapping victim who , after his release , went to the neighborhood police station only to discover one of his abductors in police uniform , talking to the chief the list of suspects in these kidnappings reads like a police rollcall , ms ang see said because so few families report the abductions , the manila police acknowledge that they have no accurate figures on the number of recent kidnappings information gathered by ms ang see and her magazine , tulay , suggests that there have been more than 140 kidnappings in the last 18 months , with most of the victims ethnic chinese the roughly 800 , 000 chinesefilipinos make up less than 2 percent of the philippine population , but their economic clout is much larger as is true throughout southeast asia , ethnic chinese families dominate elements of the local economy their success in this impoverished country has bred antichinese envy and hostility that may help explain why the chinese remain so insular generations after many of their families arrived here two 19yearolds killed bigotry has crept into some of the otherwise sympathetic press coverage of their plight a columnist for the manila chronicle described chinesefilipinos as mercantile creatures who have little ambitions beyond making their own piles of money panic among the ethnic chinese spread rapidly last month after two chinesefilipino men , both 19 , were kidnapped on their way home after a party they were tortured and killed one was beheaded even after their parents paid nearly 70 , 000 in ransom the gangs of kidnappers preying on the chinese are said to prefer to abduct children and women that leaves the men , who traditionally control family finances , free to raise a ransom the rash of abductions is the last thing that president fidel v ramos needs as he tries to revive the economy of the philippines , one of the poorest nations of southeast asia mr ramos took office only four months ago we 're very concerned , and we are addressing the problem , he said in a recent interview while he insisted that the kidnappings would prove to be a transitory problem , he conceded that foreign trade delegations were worried for some foreign investors , the kidnapping threat is among their major concerns about doing business in the philippines , he said many go to china not only have the kidnappings scared off foreign investors , they have also led to an exodus of terrified chinesefilipino families there are several flights a week from manila to xiamen , a booming city in southern china where many chinesefilipinos have made investments the flights are booked up weeks in advance , reportedly by families seeking a safe haven the chinese who remain in the philippines are turning their homes into fortresses some parents are getting hysterical , said the rev eugene moran , director of the xavier school in manila , whose students are largely ethnic chinese while none of the students at xavier has been abducted , the parents of at least two students were kidnapped this year several students have been withdrawn from the school by parents who feared that their children are not safe even on the school grounds photo kidnapping is increasing in the philippines , and many chinesefilipino children , who have become the targets of gangs of kidnappers , are now heavily guarded wherever they go a boy waited with an escort last week for his parents to pick him up at a school in manila \( associated press \)
my bloody valentine and dinosaur jr the ritz from the start of its set at the ritz on friday night , my bloody valentine was louder than most rock bands would dream of the irishenglish quartet s two guitarists , kevin shields and bilinda butcher , had their instruments cranked up to a level that sent buzzing , distorted waves of sound over the soldout audience the drummer colm o'ciosoig and the bassist deb googe laid down a rhythm as brutal and relentless as factory machinery some of the songs , like soon , from the band s recent album loveless \( sire \) , had recognizable pop structures apparent beneath the barrage others were sheer noise the vast wall behind the stage danced with psychedelic light patterns that spilled over onto the musicians' bodies , like a postmodern version of the velvet underground s exploding plastic inevitable two lighting devices on the stage sent knife shafts of neon blue and white into the spectators' eyes but my bloody valentine s highdecibel assault was far from the selfindulgence of most loud rock bands where peers like sonic youth explore the art of noise , this quartet explores the art of volume the band s fractured , angular recordings only hint at the potential my bloody valentine unleashed live the two guitars meshed like metal scraping together every once in a while , mr shields would wander back toward his amplifier , and the noise would change shape , swelling and subsiding like compressed torrents of emotion my bloody valentine has been as influential in britain as sonic youth on the american rock scene seemingly every year , a swarm of new bands recently ride , blur , swervedriver and others tries to rework distortion in a different way but none has come close to my bloody valentine s fierce magnificence during the last song , you made me realize , from a 1988 british 12inch ep , mr shields and ms butcher locked into a severalminute , single chord frenzy during which the sound bellowed to a near inhuman proportion it was scary and addictive , like a lowbudget horror movie that draws fear out of the rawest elements the college radio heroes dinosaur jr had the unfortunate task of having to follow them onstage but mr shields' and ms butcher s brilliant excess seemed to inspire dinosaur jr s lead singer and guitarist j mascis songs like the wagon , from the band s recent album green mind \( sire \) , were leagues faster and more propulsive than the recorded versions mr mascis is punkrock s answer to the guitar god playing hyperspeed solos , grungy riffs and thrashing rhythms , he seemed completely in tune with his instrument , dependent on it photo j mascis of dinosaur jr playing at the ritz \( adam scher the new york times \)
albany , ny in an effort to pin down rumors and calm growing campus anxiety , administrators at the state university of new york at albany last week asked students to divulge any information they have regarding a gang rape that purportedly took place on campus last month mitchel livingston , the vice president of student affairs , told about 150 student leaders on thursday that thus far no one has reported the gang rape to either the campus police or the albany police mr livingston urged anyone who has knowledge of the purported attack to tell the administration it s difficult to take action because there s a cloak of secrecy , he said i plead to you today , if you have information , come forward joel blumenthal , a university spokesman , said the appeal was necessary the rationale in this particular instance is unless someone comes forward , we ca n't do anything , mr blumenthal said a report that appeared thursday in the times union of albany said the university had been contacted by the parents of a female student who said their daughter was withdrawing from the university because she had been raped when questioned about this at last week s meeting , mr livingston refused to answer , saying he wanted to honor the family s privacy that s none of your business , he snapped at one reporter mr blumenthal said the family had contacted the university at least a couple days before thursday s meeting he added people from the university have talked to the family , but until someone makes a charge , we ca n't do a thing rumors that a female student was gangraped by fraternity members around st patrick s day last month have been rife on campus the rumors added to fears set off by a series of rapes and other attacks on female students in the last several weeks last week , posters appeared on the campus , saying another rape has occurred we know that a fraternity is involved we know who you are these actions will not be tolerated graffiti regarding gang rape also appeared on campus and in several women s and men s bathrooms in the last few weeks , the student newspaper has reported at least four attacks on students , three involving rape and on friday , a day after classes ended for the long holiday weekend , the university reported that a freshman had been raped after she attended a party off campus besides the recent attacks , i 've heard other stories where people have had someone enter their home uninvited , said meghan howard , a junior anthropology major from red hook , ny it will get worse when the summer comes and people leave their windows open it s not a good time to be a female in this city in his address to the students , mr livingston spoke of university efforts to stem campus crime , including plans for a new policy to deal with sexual assaults asked why the university s department of public safety does not assign officers to foot patrols on campus , mr livingston said , i will have to research the matter at one point during the meeting with the students , george boyce , a senior from mount vernon , ny , and the student association s affirmative action officer , urged classmates to help prevent crime we are 16 , 000plus students , mr boyce said we should take care of each other
philadelphia , july 29 four years ago , when senator al gore first ran for national office , he was as leaden on the hustings as a wintry sky , droning on interminably at every stop he was forced to quit the race long before the primaries ended but in campaign '92 , there is a new al gore crisper , animated , more to the point , leavened with a bit of impish humor mr gore and his hastily assembled staff have already smoothed out most of the early logistical problems inherent in flying from rally to rally to rally , day after day after day , jumbled together in careening limousines , vans and a chartered red , white and blue boeing 727 full of zingers more to the point , mr gore himself has pretty well worked out his standard stump speech , one that whacks the bush administration for domestic and foreign commissions and omissions , promises change the word is used at least a dozen times per appearance and is liberally sprinkled with crowdteasing , trailtested zingers a sampler bush and quayle have given out a 1'800' number , a hotline number , to the wealthy , privileged few in this country and they move heaven and earth to do whatever the callers want them to do but when the average working family calls saying they need something too , they get a busy signal a disconnect a voice that says , 'this is not a working number for you' the bushquayle administration is out of ideas , out of energy , out of proposals , out of vision , out of gas and , with your help , they 'll soon be out of office the crowds roar with laughter and , as quiet returns , mr gore , a beaming smile telegraphing another rhetorical punch , recycles his new york convention line in which he said it was long past time for president bush and vice president dan quayle to go , to depart the white house and washington what time is it \? he cries out to his audiences it s time for them to go ! the partisans roar back focus on foreign policy the most substantive and most emphasized part of the gore speech thus far has been an unremitting attack on mr bush s handling of foreign issues rather than economic issues , the critical concern for voters throughout most of this year s campaign it was mr gore , playing the role of campaign attack dog , who first went on the foreign affairs offensive , even before gov bill clinton struck in his initial solo appearance on the campaign trail , the tennessee senator tore into mr bush , asserting that he had coddled saddam hussein and mr gore has continued the attack , lately adding ridicule to his arsenal if george bush is so smart about foreign affairs , his line now goes , how come saddam hussein is toying with him \? make no mistake this tennessee democrat whom mr clinton chose for a running mate is still one earnest politician as he goes about the traditional no 2 job of shoring up the base and being the ticket rottweiler though now in his shirt sleeves , his cadences can still be stilted , his gestures wooden but out in the crowds , the eyes no longer glaze over the way they once did at a noontime rally here today in philadelphia s central business district , just about everybody stuck with mr gore to the end , all 7 , 000 or so secretaries , construction workers , lawyers and bankers , even most of those who disagreed with the message mirroring the polls the senator departed with loud , enthusiastic cheers bouncing and booming off the glassy facades of the surrounding cluster of skyscrapers a whirling clutch of people surged forward in the midday heat to shake the hand of the candidate who arrives and leaves most of his rallies to the driving beat of paul simon s you can call me al please ! oh , please ! a young woman holding a we love al sign implored as she jostled for position in today s crowd thus it has gone for mr gore for most of the past week , ever since he hit the trail on his own after leaving the bus that he and mr clinton rode across middle america the crowds have been friendly and seemingly open to being persuaded what is more , they have been growing ever larger , not unlike the clintongore edge in the july polls on monday , there were a couple of hundred people at the airport in atlanta on tuesday , there were 4 , 000 at the fairgrounds in raleigh , nc today s crowd of 7 , 000 in philadelphia s john f kennedy plaza was the largest yet of course , all that mr gore says substantively is either dictated from the clinton headquarters in little rock , ark , or at least cleared with little rock the same goes for his campaign schedule such is the lot of vicepresidential nominees but there s no subject i ca n't address and nowhere i ca n't go , the senator said the other day , as if to underscore that in the 1988 campaign the bush headquarters tightly reigned in mr quayle in an effort to minimize verbal gaffes and embarrassing headlines it is early in campaign '92 but mr gore , thus far , has avoided any unflattering news reports , certainly none of the magnitude that bedeviled mr quayle in 1988 in time , the gaffes and miscues and headlines will come they always do the campaign inevitably will have its fits and starts and problems already there is talk that for all the time mr gore spent the past week in the south , the number of black voters who showed up at his rallies could be counted in the low hundreds but for the moment , mr gore is riding high in the political saddle
wishing and hoping just how permanent is the guggenheim museum s permanent collection \? it s a question many artworld insiders are asking , now that all the extensive publicity and glittering parties surrounding the museum s recent reopening are over while the need to expand the space available to display the large permanent collection was the reason most often cited for the museum s 45 million renovation and expansion , the first exhibition in the new galleries , masterpieces from the guggenheim collection , includes many works that the museum does not , in fact , own , and a few that it probably never will a number of wall labels read on extended loan it s not uncommon for a museum to borrow works for a permanentcollection exhibition , said michael govan , the guggenheim s deputy director it s part of the museum s effort to attract new works we 've tried to be strict and make sure we were n't just borrowing for no reason many works are promised gifts others are under negotiation a leger up for sale one of the artworks in the show is a large painting by fernand leger , the printer , from 191718 while the wall label reads , extended loan , private collection , the work has been for sale for about a year and a half various dealers , museum curators and auctionhouse experts contend that the leger has been offered to them , but stephen mazoh , the new york dealer who is trying to sell it for an unidentified european collector , said that s not true it s been under my control , mr mazoh said and it has n't been offered around at one time , a prominent new york museum wanted to buy the painting , but it was n't ready to spend the money mr mazoh says the asking price is less than 20 million , a vast sum considering that leger s breakfast , a prized painting in the collection of burton and emily tremaine , was sold last november at christie s in new york for 77 million \( it was the highest price for any impressionist , modern or contemporary painting sold during the entire fall auction season \) this is a seminal leger , the dealer said he added it s at the guggenheim on approval it would be a great addition to the guggenheim s collection does that mean that the dealer would not sell the painting to another qualified buyer \? mr mazoh said that the guggenheim has first crack but that if another offer were to come along , the museum would have to make a decision for now , it s on view at least until the end of the exhibition , mr mazoh said we 'll see what happens after that wherever the leger ends up , it s clear that having it in the guggenheim s walls as part of the opening exhibition does n't hurt its value mr govan said the museum was aware of the painting s history it s not that we did n't know it s been for sale , he said but the museum also knows that it would fit well in the collection this is a sizable work , more suited to a public collection , and it s a great work mr govan also said he did not agree with criticism that the leger was in poor condition mr mazoh said the painting was in sublime condition the work has gentle creases on its surface , which is the way paintings like this age , he said it s never been relined 'a statement of what we want' other works currently on view at the guggenheim as part of what is billed as a display of its permanent collection are also on what mr govan calls the museum s wish list robert rauschenberg s canyon , for example , is owned by the sonnabend gallery in soho we have n't tried to hide the fact that we do n't own this , mr govan said it s a statement of what we want the collection to look like we 'd certainly like to have it , and there s a chance we have a close relationship with the gallery several other works are gifts by artists , like claes oldenburg s freighter and sailboat , from 1962 , and roy lichtenstein s grrrrrrrrrrr ! from 1965 \( mr lichtenstein s golf ball is on loan from the artist , and the museum is hoping that it will be donated \) of the three works by jim dine on view , one has always been in the museum s collection 'dream no 2 is a recent gift of the artist on the occasion of the opening , mr govan said and 'four rooms' is on extended loan and is being negotiated for acquisition four sculptures by david smith belong to the artist s children , and mr govan said the museum was currently having discussions with them some works are promised gifts from wellknown collectors jasper johns s highway , from 1959 , for example , is believed to be part of peter and sandy brant s private holdings the brants are the guggenheim s downtown landlords they own the broadway building that houses the museum s new soho branch other works , including some by joseph beuys and many by louise bourgeois , were acquired in the last year building the permanent collection is the name of the game , mr govan said it drives our strategy and thinking on every level mr govan added that the acquisition of count giuseppe panza di biumo s collection of art from the 1960 s and 70 s for more than 30 million two years ago helped declare the new guggenheim s aggressive stance in the marketplace at the time , however , the museum was criticized for the purchase because to finance it , about 47 million worth of paintings by artists like kandinsky , chagall and modigliani had to be sold still , the museum says that in the long term it made the right decision the panza collection was bought , mr govan said , not just to acquire it , but as a catalyst for future gifts princely treasures
for weeks , former united states representative geraldine a ferraro insisted that opponents' charges about her family s finances were sour grapes , desperate gambits of rivals far behind her in the polls but yesterday , she acknowledged something quite different the charges were working jettisoning the jaunty stance of frontrunner that she had so carefully nurtured since the early phases of this senate campaign , ms ferraro said that elizabeth holtzman s attacks were destroying the target herself and helping a third contender what is happening is that the votes are going to bob abrams , she said he s going up and i'm going down ms ferraro s statement , which she made in a news conference hours before a crucial debate among the four candidates for the democratic nomination , was plaintive but behind it was a fundamental tactical response to recent polls and a carefully thought out call to arms to those she is counting on as her core supporters women and italianamericans ms ferraro explicitly sought to rally both groups , even though in doing so she took the risk of conceding something that until now she had dismissed that mr abrams might actually win the primary on tuesday to women , she pleaded for support , arguing that those who wished to see a woman win the primary in this year of the woman would insure the opposite if they voted for ms holtzman , whom ms ferraro described as a kamikaze the kamikaze pilot in the minds of some , they are the hero , she said of ms holtzman but what she s also forgetting is that while she s destroying the target , me , she is also killing herself and the person who is benefiting from all of this is bob abrams you vote for liz holtzman and you are in effect voting for bob abrams ms ferraro also released a new television commercial aimed at female voters with footage of her accepting her historic nomination as the democratic vicepresidential nominee in 1984 , the ad concludes she s stood for the dreams of millions now it s time for us to stand with her to italianamericans , ms ferraro was , if such a thing was possible , even more direct noting that reporters have said they needed to see her tax returns to see if she had had any dealings with organizedcrime figures , she said i consider than an antiitalian slur , i certainly do i would hope that each and every italianamerican in this state gets as offended as i am and makes their anger known on tuesday the obvious danger in ms ferraro s new stance almost as an underdog a mantle that mr abrams , who initially had hoped to be the frontrunner , wound up trying to claim for himself is that she gives up the aura of invincibility that she had hoped would make her victory in the primary a foregone conclusion among voters indeed , mr abrams s ascension was confirmed by none other than the chairman of the state republican party , william d powers , who yesterday demanded that mr abrams answer questions about his seemingly unethical fundraising activities , including his acceptance of campaign contributions from people who do business with his office the attack by mr powers , a political foot soldier for senator alfonse m d'amato , could be interpreted variously as either an indication that republicans now expect to run against him or that they would like to damage him in a bid to help ms ferraro , generally believed to be mr d'amato s preferred opponent how to win a primary but in taking that risk , ms ferraro instead sought to do something that could be far more important , and to follow a dictum that has often made the difference in primaries energize your core constituency in political campaigns , it s almost always good to run at the end like you 're not ahead , and to say to your supporters , 'i need each and every one of you , ' said william t cunningham , an albany political consultant who worked for united states representative robert j mrazek of long island in the senate race until mr mrazek dropped out in the wake of the house bank controversy you do n't want anyone who might be your supporter to ever stay home because they think , 'oh , it does n't matter , she s got it wrapped up , ' mr cunningham said for the democratic party , of course , the larger danger is that all the attacks and counterattacks will mortally damage the nominee , whoever he or she is this is a warning sounded most vigorously by gov mario m cuomo , a democrat , who has not endorsed anyone in the race but has repeatedly chastised both mr abrams and ms holtzman for raising the allegations about ms ferraro there s no question in my mind that this does damage , not just to geraldine , but to whoever the nominee is , mr cuomo said in an interview yesterday the only person being benefited right now by this is al d'amato photo the rev al sharpton greeting geraldine a ferraro last night after the debate between the democratic candidates for the senate \( associated press \)

to the editor the two attacks made in your columns \( letters , jan 19 \) on my review of john p meier s book a marginal jew are strange jacob neusner is justly celebrated as a pioneer in the critical evaluation of the attribution of statements to named sages in rabbinic texts it is odd that he apparently advocates a fundamentalist attitude to the sayings of jesus in the gospels \( no judaism known to us maintains its founder superior to the torah s teaching , as jesus does in his own words and none declares , as does jesus in his own words , that israel should deny at least two of the ten commandments \) father meier himself favors a far more cautious approach joel marcus criticizes me for what i did not say i did not , as he claims , insinuate that father meier s book is antisemitic , which would be a disgraceful and totally unwarranted charge i did say that it uses oldfashioned categories in thinking about the subject of the historical jesus i wrote specifically that father meier s determined effort to be fair and objective is particularly impressive , and i meant what i wrote martin goodman oxford , england
united nations , feb 7 a top pakistani foreign ministry official visiting the united states has issued his government s first formal acknowledgement that it has the capacity for making an atomic bomb but the official , foreign secretary shahryar khan , insisted that pakistan had not built such a bomb and did not intend to , and that it would not transfer the nuclear technology it has developed to any other country there was a capability in 1989 when the present government came to power , and that means we could have moved forward in an unwise direction , mr khan said at the united nations today , at the end of a twoday visit that included talks with state department officials in washington but we did n't instead , we froze the program the reason for making the trip and for acknowledging that pakistan could build a bomb , mr khan went on , was not just to persuade the united states to resume the 570 million in aid that congress cut off last year because of pakistan s nuclear program at a state department briefing in washington , a spokesman , richard a boucher , was asked whether he expected united states assistance to pakistan to be resumed , and he answered at this point , it depends on the outcome of the discussions assistance remains suspended , pending certification mr khan said pakistan wanted to improve relations with the united states , convince the bush administration that the current islamabad government has frozen the country s nuclear program and make clear that pakistan sincerely wants to negotiate a regional nuclear disarmament agreement with india , as the united states , russia and china have proposed 'we want good relations' we are deeply concerned about the nuclear race in southeast asia , which none of us can afford , and we sincerely want the fivenation nonproliferation initiative to take off , mr khan said aid or no aid , we want good relations with the united states in the past pakistan has denied having any secret nuclear program , despite growing evidence that it was moving closer to developing a bomb mr khan acknowledged that this policy of denying what foreign governments knew to be true had produced a serious credibility gap for pakistan in the west , and said his country now wanted to correct the problem by telling the truth about its nuclear abilities but mr khan said it would be politically impossible for pakistan to dismantle its nuclear program without a similar move by india , which exploded a nuclear device in 1964 he also called on india to agree to mutual inspections of each other s nuclear plants like pakistan , india has refused to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty and open its nuclear installations to international monitoring another country suspected of developing a nuclear weapon , iran , has invited officials from the international atomic energy agency in vienna for talks in teheran and is offering to show them some of its nuclear installations a fourman team led by the agency s safeguards chief , jan jennekens , reached teheran this week and will return to vienna on thursday the iranian invitation came after american intelligence officials accused iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon , saying it had acquired some necessary equipment from china , including machinery for making enriched uranium under pressure from the united states , argentina today blocked a shipload of nuclear reactor material ordered by iran president carlos saul menem agreed to stop the shipment of 18 million worth of machine tools , tubing and other equipment a team of argentine technicians is already in teheran in connection with the deal as a signer of the nonproliferation treaty , iran has agreed never to acquire nuclear weapons and has placed its three declared nuclear research reactors under the atomic energy agency s safeguards to prevent their being used for military ends but signing the treaty did not prevent iraq from developing a huge covert nuclear weapons program unknown to the agency , which is now engaged in hunting down these secret installations and destroying them as part of the united nations security council s terms for ending the persian gulf war and last year a senior iranian official said it was the duty of islamic nations to acquire atomic weapons to counterbalance those held by the enemy apparently a reference to israel , which is widely believed to have such weapons the atomic energy agency s team will also use the visit to explain its plans for a new system of middle east safeguards against nuclear proliferation in preparation for a possible middle east peace settlement the agency s director , hans blix , was authorized two years ago by the member nations to investigate the possibility of a viable system of nuclear safeguards for the middle east under agency control he has talked with israel , egypt , and libya , and he is now talking with syrian leaders parallel inspections israel and most arab countries insist that any such regional safeguards system would require inspections of one another s installations as well as inspections by the agency israel also insists on parallel progress toward eliminating chemical and biological arms from the region embarrassed by its failure to discover or deter iraq s nuclear program , the agency has also moved to strengthen the safeguards on countries that have signed the nonproliferation treaty last year dr blix said he was ready to use his power for the first time to order challenge inspections of any plant in a signatory country if he is given credible evidence by intelligence agencies that it is being used for nuclear weapons development at the security council summit meeting here last week , leaders of the 15 members called for new steps to control the spread of nuclear weapons and said they were ready to take appropriate measures if the atomic energy agency notified them of violations of the nonproliferation treaty by any signatory countries over the last few months several countries that had refused to join the treaty because they did not want their nuclear activities monitored have changed their minds and done so these include south africa and nearby african states , and north korea has committed itself to putting its nuclear installations under agency safeguards
new yorkers and indeed the nation were shocked when two students were gunned down in the hallway of thomas jefferson high school in east new york , brooklyn , on feb 26 khalil sumpter , a 15yearold student , was arrested and charged with the slayings of tyrone sinkler , 16 , and ian moore , 17 for the 1 , 800 students who attend jeff , in one of the poorest and most violent sections of the city , murder and mayhem are as much a feature of teenage life as pep rallies and proms to learn more about the lives , hopes and fears of these children of war , as their principal calls them , the new york times invited two diverse groups of thomas jefferson students 19 altogether to discussions last saturday and wednesday even as city officials called for such measures as more metal detectors in the schools , many of the students said the problems went far beyond guns , ultimately to a kind of corrosion of the spirit the young people said they coped with life on the hard streets in ways that ranged from wearing bulletproof vests to pinning their hopes on careers that will take them far from east new york the following text was taken from the transcript of three hours of conversations with three reporters e r shipp , felicia r lee and mary b w tabor mariana bryant last night we was looking through my junior high school yearbook and my friend pointed out a number of people in that book that was dead q about how many would you estimate \?

washington , oct 22 the department of health and human services is planning a fiveyear effort to combat violence in america the way it would fight an epidemic of smallpox , using public health techniques to supplement the criminal justice system but the government s plans , known loosely as the violence initiative , have come under sharp attack by a crusading maryland psychiatrist and some prominent blacks who say the effort is racist and genocidal the dispute has put the secretary of health and human services , dr louis w sullivan , who is black , in an uncomfortable position and threatens financing for some research and communitybased demonstration projects that specialists say show promise in reducing violence 'i will not apologize' in a strongly worded speech to a group of child psychiatrists today , dr sullivan denounced the attacks on his plan as false and inflammatory accusations by extremists who have grossly and irresponsibly mischaracterized the work of his department i will not apologize for doing what i can to reduce the number of young lives that are being tragically destroyed by violence , dr sullivan said dr peter breggin , a bethesda , md , psychiatrist who has led much of the opposition to the plan , said in a telephone interview that looking for biological or genetic markers , as some critics have suggested was part of the plan , was very racist and without scientific foundation the violence initiative is denying racism , poverty and how tough it is for children living in the inner city , he said responding to such criticism in a talk to the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry today , dr sullivan said none of the research done by his department supported the idea that there is a crime gene or a genetic basis for crime but dr sullivan said that to build support among blacks for the government s work , he would appoint a special blueribbon panel to oversee the research , headed by franlyn g jenifer , the president of howard university the fight over the plan reflects a sensitive statistical fact a disproportionate percentage of homicides are committed by blacks , about seven times the rate , per capita , committed by whites , according to the public health service similarly , blacks are more often victims of murder homicide is the leading cause of death for black men between the ages of 15 and 34 , the public health service figures show a young minority male has a greater probability of being killed on the streets of a city than a soldier had on a tour of duty in vietnam dr sullivan said it was concern over such statistics , and a realization that the united states as a whole has become the most violent country in the industrialized world , that led him to push for greater involvement by the department of health and human services this problem is too great to be left to the criminal justice system , he said in an interview today instead , following the recommendation of a growing number of doctors , psychiatrists , criminologists and lawenforcement experts , dr sullivan has suggested using the publichealth approach it relies on analyzing the causes of an epidemic , then acting to prevent those likely to be at risk from becoming infected while the experts agree that no single cure is ever likely to be found to eradicate violence , they say a number of steps can be taken to reduce it gradually , just as intensive efforts have lowered the rate of automobile accident deaths and decreased the number of americans who smoke but one problem in treating violence like a disease , critics say , is that suggesting that some people are natural carriers may stigmatize blacks most of the research and programs would be sponsored by the federal centers for disease control and the national institute of mental health many of the projects would be expansions of work already under way in the 1991 fiscal year , the institute spent 427 million on violencerelated research less than 5 percent was devoted to biological causes of violence , the kind of work that has drawn the most criticism one of the strongest critics of the new research plan , representative john conyers jr , democrat of michigan and chairman of the congressional black caucus , said today my worst fear is that they will unscientifically correlate race or social class with violent behavior that would lead to discriminatory policies ronald walters , chairman of the political science department at howard university and a member of a group called the committee to stop the federal violence initiative , said , we perceive this as being a particular threat to the black community because of its focus on innercity youths professor walters said he objected to treating violence as a disease , as called for by using the publichealth approach if there is a reason for this kind of research , the aim is to find a drug , he said and if you begin using drugs to pacify young black males , as is often done with ritalin for hyperactivity , you 're creating a regime of social control the department of health and human services' plan , professor walters said , has come about because the bush administration has no interest in allocating resources to overcome the economic and social problems of the inner cities whole program threatened such accusations have put dr sullivan on the defensive and led some specialists in the agencies that comprise the department of health and human services to worry that the whole program may be canceled dr sullivan himself today insisted there was no violence initiative with a capital v and a capital i instead , he called the document a planning process for a possible future initiative the plan would have a proposed budget of about 400 million spread out over the next five years most of the research and programs would be sponsored by the federal centers for disease control and the national institute of mental health many of the projects would be expansions of work already under way since 1983 , for instance , the disease centers have financed research examining whether there is a statistical link between the presence of guns in society and the frequency of violent death one study compared seattle and vancouver , british columbia , two cities with similar histories , climate and social and economic characteristics but with different guncontrol policies the study found that they had nearly the same rates of burglary , robbery and assault , or similar levels of aggressiveness but homicide was 60 percent higher in seattle than in vancouver , and murder by firearms was 500 percent higher , apparently because handguns are much easier to obtain on the united states side of the border
mikhail tal , a latvian grandmaster who held the world chess championship in 196061 and was one of the game s most popular and exciting players , died in moscow yesterday after a long illness , the russian news agency itartass reported he was 55 years old since the breakup of the soviet union , mr tal had hoped to represent latvia in this month s world chess olympiad in manila , but was unable to make the trip because of illness no cause of death was given , but he had suffered from liver and kidney ailments for many years itartass said he died after being taken to a hospital to undergo surgery for a severe kidney illness known in chess circles as a swashbuckling attacker who reveled in daring sacrifices and allbutunfathomable complications over the board , mr tal won the world championship in 1960 at the age of 23 becoming the youngest person to hold the title in this century by defeating mikhail botvinnik , who had been the champion since 1948 although mr tal lost the championship in a return match with mr botvinnik a year later and never became a title challenger again , he continued to play at worldclass levels of competition and steadily won tournament and brilliancy prizes in an illustrious chess career while his slashing style earned him the sobriquet tal the terrible , friends called him misha , and he was known in the chess fraternity as one of the game s most popular and amiable figures a gentle , witty man who seemed totally immersed in chess and displayed none of the egotism that is common among toplevel contenders because of his nearly lifelong struggle with liver and kidney ailments , friends recalled last night , it was not unusual for mr tal to be hospitalized during tournaments but he was so keen to continue that he often returned to the action and occasionally played tournament or match games at his hospital bed , as he did once in the early 1960 s with bobby fischer , the american who would later become world champion mikhail tal was born on nov 9 , 1936 , and was taught to play chess at the age of 6 by his father , a doctor in the latvian village of yurla , near perm though he had an astonishing memory and was so eager for knowledge that he was placed in the fourth grade in his first year of school , the youngster showed little interest or talent for chess at first , preferring books and more active pastimes but playing with a cousin a few years later sparked a new and absorbing interest in the game , and the boy joined the chess club of the palace of young pioneers in riga , the latvian capital he began playing in tournaments and steadily improved under an able tutor , aleksandr koblents at the age of 16 , mr tal s play earned him the rank of national master and three years later , in 1957 , the year he graduated from riga university with degrees in history and philosophy , he became a grandmaster , joining the select ranks of the world s best players he soon was beating those players regularly and , in 1960 , crushed mr botvinnik for the world championship by a score of 12 1 2 to 8 1 2 , astounding the chess world mr botvinnik had held the championship for 12 years in one of the longest reigns in the game s history , and the intense young latvian challenger was virtually unknown outside chess circles mr tal swept the champion away with his characteristic flare for the dramatic a series of sudden , entirely risky moves that turned the games into inextricably complex positions months of analysis later proved many of these moves to be unsound , but his opponent was unable to solve them over the board in the return match in 1961 , experts said , mr botvinnik managed to avoid mr tal s diabolical complications by steering the play into end games that gave him an advantage in succeeding decades , mr tal continued to play at exceptionally high grandmaster levels , despite his frail health at the board , he often stared fixedly at opponents , a habit that disconcerted many and even led some to accuse him of trying to hypnotize them but , experts said , it was his capacity to envision combinations and deeply analyze complex variations not hypnosis that made him formidable over the board he had an insatiable appetite for the game , robert byrne , an american grandmaster who is the new york times chess columnist , said of mr tal last night it sounds trite , but few love the game as much as he did you could just see it some players consider it labor this man loved chess photo mikhail tal \( camera press , 1984 \)
a growing number of groups demanding jobs for black and hispanic workers have been disrupting construction sites in new york city , beating workers and extorting money for labor peace , the police , prosecutors and industry officials say the proliferation of these groups , called minority coalitions , has bred sometimesviolent competition , with members waging intramural gun battles in the fight over turf the groups , lawenforcement officials and people in the construction industry say , are the jagged edge of a movement that has been trying since the 1960 s to give black and hispanic workers a toehold in the largely white and largely exclusionary building trades while such confrontations are far from new at construction sites in the city , they have become more and more frequent as unemployment sweeps the city s building trades , the officials say 'it has nothing to do with race' it is simple extortion , said michael cherkasky , chief of the investigative division in the manhattan district attorney s office , which recently prosecuted a major minoritycoalition extortion case they 're gangs it has nothing to do with race we 've had cases with black contractors with an allblack work force shaken down last month , when two school buses pulled up to a construction site on queens boulevard and more than 80 men jumped out , demanding jobs , neville b knew exactly what to do he and his 10 fellow ironworkers laid down their tools and walked away from the site we stopped work , said neville b , according to an affidavit filed with his union , which insisted that his full name not be used but even as he called for peace , one of the men grabbed a 2by4 and bashed him in the head minutes later , the group drove off his head injury has kept him out of work since the week before , another coalition group visited the same construction site the foreman tried to break up a fight he was hit on the head and the face , and his nephew was gouged in the head with a claw hammer before the group jumped into a van and disappeared city s protection is assailed there were 378 reported incidents like these in the past year , the police said in midjune , compared with 542 for all of last year many others go unreported the increase in confrontations has led contractors and unions to press the city for protection and amid charges that it has been slow to realize the severity of the situation , the dinkins administration has appointed a task force to look into security problems at public and private construction sites the mayor s office of construction is concerned about security at construction sites , said daniel kryston , deputy director of the office there is also a financial concern industry officials say the coalitions' activities add to the cost of construction , costs that are being largely borne by the taxpayers because the recession has hit government projects less hard than private ones the coalitions , even the least confrontational , draw their power from a simple fact of the construction business even a short workday disruption can cost contractors thousands of dollars as a result , many are willing to hire a few people immediately , or pay to stop the picketing , lawenforcement officials say among the coalitions , though , the line between the legitimacy and illegitimacy is not always clear civil rights or a scam \? the more established groups , like harlem fight back and positive work force , say they are civilrights organizations that use picketing and diplomacy to provide jobs for members of their communities and they take pains to distinguish themselves from the others , which lawenforcement and industry officials say are essentially moneymaking scams that use violence and intimidation to take advantage of the legitimate groups' reputations and their unemployed clients' needs it is wrong to fight other groups and it is wrong to extort money from contractors for labor peace , said james haughton , the director of harlem fight back , the city s oldest community coalition , founded in 1964 but the genuine ones , there is no recognition of their roles there is a major , major crisis in the inner city among young workers that have been totally forgotten , cast aside largely because of the policies and practices of governmental agencies that exclude workers from participating in the employment structure of the city this is a tinderbox that will explode still , all the groups have been involved in violence at work sites at one time or another , even though many say they fight back only in selfdefense i 'd rather go to jail to feed my family than because i stole from you , said alfonso rivera , the president of positive work force , which has operated from harlem since the mid80 s 3 gunfights in brooklyn in the last month there have been at least three gunfights involving coalitions in brooklyn after a gun battle broke out between opposing groups in front of the united brooklyn coalition headquarters in park slope , the police arrested 29 people and seized eight guns in the building , including four tec9 semiautomatic pistols and two 45caliber semiautomatics last year , the leader of a queens coalition was shot and killed as he left his home though no arrests have been made , the police say he may have been the target of a rival group
hempstead , li , aug 19 the scene was the jets' hofstra headquarters and not a political convention , but the similarities could not be overlooked here were browning nagle and ken o'brien , the candidates for the quarterback nomination , and today , as o'brien participated in his first full practice after his contract dispute , there were tv cameras , speeches and even analysis from the spin doctors the main spin came from the head coach , bruce coslet , who would have no one believing the analysis joe namath had offered last weekend namath suggested that the jets had avoided settling their salary dispute with o'brien to allow the young understudy , nagle , a chance to learn the role without distraction unfortunately , joe is mistaken , coslet said quite frankly , it is ludicrous for anybody to think that delaying the contract negotiations to give browning the extra time , well , i ca n't say the expletive deleteds enough it just did n't happen for anybody to insinuate that this was orchestrated is not true please , no controversy read his lips no new controversies can i talk about anything other than the quarterback situation \? he asked , smiling meanwhile , almost everyone , was talking about the quarterback situation o'brien , back for his 10th season , was a full participant in the twohour session and coslet said o'brien will probably play saturday night in a backup role to nagle when the jets \( 30 \) play the giants \( 20 \) at giants stadium should n't o'brien s experience and incumbency count for something \? i do n't even worry about it , o'brien said things take care of themselves you 'd go crazy if you started worrying about that kind of stuff he said he felt a little rusty , but spoke with optimism of the last two exhibition games and the regular season i'm looking to get a little better , he said i'm looking forward to getting a little further in the playoffs our goal is to get into the super bowl i'm not getting any younger and i 'd like to get it done while i still can nagle , the secondyear man who will start his fourth consecutive game on saturday , said he thought o'brien looked pretty good and he looked sharp i'm surprised he s pretty good shape and throwing the ball well nagle also feels pretty good about himself i think there s a short way to go before i can really feel confident with what i 've accomplished , said nagle , who has completed 21 of 42 passes for 382 yards , with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions i do n't foresee any problems he said , when asked about his relations with o'brien i 'd be surprised if there was it s going to be exciting we 're going to make it fun he said he asked o'brien routine questions , like how s the wife \? how s the kids \? how much you making \? i'm not going to look over my shoulder , nagle said , and , if kenny s there , he s not going to look over his shoulder o'brien said nagle has been playing well , he s improved a lot and he will continue to improve you know how long the season is , o'brien said everyone s going to get a chance to play everyone s going to be able to play o'brien called the debate about the firststring job an exciting topic for a lot of people unfortunately , my answers are n't that exciting it makes for exciting print , i guess , because you can kind of try to create a controversy , o'brien said but there s really none in my mind or in anybody s mind on the team nagle agreed it s probably going to get beaten to death , he said , but it does n't bother me it s something you guys will have fun with for the next two weeks and maybe into the season , but it will wear off coslet said neither man has won the job and as far as the competition , it s as open as it can get at this point i'm going to try to treat it like any other position , as hard as that may be once he makes the decision , the debate wo n't linger , coslet said it might linger in your minds , but it wo n't linger in mine and that s what s important , coslet said extra points center jim sweeney , coming back from elbow surgery , is ahead of schedule , coslet said , but he wo n't play this weekend al toon , the wide receiver who passed an examination after suffering heart palpitations , has been cleared to practice wide receiver rob moore is still doubtful with a sore ankle photo jets' ken o'brien \( 7 \) and browning nagle \( 8 \) sharing a laugh as quarterback coach , walt harris , watched \( vic delucia the new york times \)
on a recent wednesday , a night when most restaurants are dying , sotto luna in roslyn heights was bursting with a steady stream of diners was the popularity the result of market research \? certainly this new pasta cafe is giving the public what it wants its atmosphere puts jeansclad diners at ease , yet is classy enough to qualify as special sotto luna scores with classic good looks , plus the excitement of an open kitchen complete with a brick pizza oven carpeting and tablecloths are upscale touches first impressions are positive on the tables are tiny pepper mills and carafes of balsamic vinegar and extravirgin olive oil warm crusty peasant bread and even better homemade breadsticks dripping garlic butter make a speedy and welcome appearance whole heads of roasted garlic , to spread on the bread , are a crapshoot , however on two occasions , we received undercooked hard garlic while diners at neighboring tables were enjoying perfectly roasted treats service is also hit or miss refills on bread are not automatic , but are quickly dispatched when requested dishes are delivered piecemeal and auctioned off at the table such casual service would be annoying at a more formal restaurant at sotto luna , the staff s congeniality and cando spirit cover the rough spots low prices are an additional crowd pleaser the highest entree on the written menu is 1395 evening specials like salmon and veal chops climb to the upper teens salads are an especially good buy these crisp beauties are presented on oversize dinner plates and could easily double as main courses the highly recommended mixed salad topped with slices of warm grilled chicken breast , 895 , is just that the caesar , napped in a creamy dressing and topped with homemade croutons and shavings of parmesan cheese , comes in two sizes , the entree at 595 and a smaller version for 395 either is big enough to share a savvy couple at a nearby table chose one of the small caesar salads and a pizza to split as appetizers they followed them with a shared pasta and left toting doggy bags in addition to salads , the hit parade of wellreceived openers includes a platter of glistening seafood salad , tiny tender baked clams , a shish kebab of tasty grilled veal sausage skewered with roasted red peppers and fresh mozzarella , velvety carpaccio with a garlicky aioli on the side and a special of exceptional grilled portobello mushrooms splashed with a balsamic vinaigrette over a bed of arugula main courses are limited to 13 pastas , 9 pizzas and 3 or 4 meat and fish specials we sampled a giant veal chop , served pink as ordered , and covered with artichokes and mushrooms even better was a flaky salmon steak set over a wineandbutter sauce tinged bright magenta by beets although the color was a tad offputting , the lush sauce was sensational sotto luna s pizzas would earn a b , if graded their thin crusts are nicely smoked tinged from the brick oven , and their toppings are tasty but every pie sampled had a soggy center the word on pastas is similarly mixed the lighter moreinnovative dishes failed linguine tossed with shrimp , arugula , garlic and olive oil was so underseasoned that its blandness made it a nonevent spaghetti in garlic and oil , also short in the seasoning department , was awash in oil instead , go the red route the marinara sauce is a spirited chunky success we sampled it over angel hair and atop plump cheesefilled ravioli a special of penne with portobello mushrooms and the red sauce made pink and creamy by mascarpone cheese is splendid desserts also go to the head of the class the winner at our table was an apple torte of puff pastry , caramel and apple slices it was baked in the pizza oven , served hot and crowned with a scoop of

the ford motor company s chairman , harold a poling , took a 66 percent pay cut in 1991 , earning 114 million in salary and other compensation , the company disclosed yesterday while the base salary for the top five officers of the no 2 auto maker did not change in 1991 from 1990 , cuts were made in nonsalary compensation like allowances for overseas assignments and club memberships no bonuses were given to ford s top managers last year , when the company reported a record loss of nearly 23 billion as the american auto industry experienced its worst year in history in 1990 , it earned a profit of 860 million proxy disclosures no other ford executive earned more than 1 million last year , according to the company s annual proxy statement philip e benton jr , president and chief operating officer , received 752 , 452 , down 46 percent from 1990 the disclosures in the proxy statement come just days after the chrysler corporation said lee a iacocca , its chairman , took home nearly 3 million in salary , stock and other compensation in 1991 , down about 35 percent from 1990 the general motors corporation is expected to release its annual proxy statement next week while the united automobile workers harshly criticized mr iacocca s pay package , the union offered faint praise of ford s move the lowered compensation paid to ford s top executives reflects overdue but still welcome restraint , union officials said in a statement it appears that ford is taking an encouraging step toward a more responsible approach to executive compensation ford also granted the same number of stock options to top officers in 1991 as in 1990 , at the exercise price of 30 a share mr poling was granted 135 , 000 shares , worth 405 million at the exercise price mr benton was granted 95 , 000 shares worth 285 million but none of the officers exercised the options last year , the proxy statement said predictions for ford although auto sales have been slow to improve in recent weeks , some analysts have predicted that ford will report a modest profit for the first quarter later this month they also predict that ford s efforts to cut costs will enable the company to outperform gm , which is in the midst of a big restructuring chrysler , an aggressive costcutter of late , will be weighed down by costs associated with introducing its new jeep grand cherokee , a model that chrysler hopes will win back customers who have defected to ford s popular explorer model ford declined to comment on analysts' projections for its firstquarter earnings ford also said yesterday that it would pay a secondquarter dividend of 40 cents a share for its common and class b stock , the same amount that it paid in firstquarter dividends
none dare call it pandering , but no presidential candidate has done as much to cultivate the young as edmund j brown jr tabitha soren , a 24yearold political reporter for mtv news , said she never had difficulty getting lengthy , exclusive interviews with the former california governor he s the only candidate you can have a conversation with about chuck d , she said , and not have to explain that he s with public enemy the 53yearold mr brown , who has showcased his insurgent , antiestablishment campaign at huge college rallies and rockandroll fundraising events , has positioned himself as the youth candidate janna siegel , 21 , a communications major at new york university , said she was taking a course on propaganda i'm trained to ignore all the media hype and the emotional appeals and concentrate on the issues it s like , oh my god , jerry brown is the only one who acknowledges that the environment is a problem through the primary season , mr brown s voters have consistently been more likely to be under 45 than over , according to voter surveys the reverse is true of bill clinton s voters \( although in most races mr clinton s total vote was a good bit larger than mr brown s , and even among the young mr clinton beat mr brown , just by smaller margins \) endorsed by rolling stone because of his iconoclastic style and insurrectionist message , mr brown is widely perceived , even by his own staff , to be doing best with voters under 30 yet the group he seems to inspire most are older and grayer and can remember woodstock it is often among those in their 30 s and early 40 s that mr brown finds his most fervent backers as peter hart , a washingtonbased poll taker and consultant put it , he does well with people who like to think they are young mr brown was endorsed yesterday by rolling stone , a magazine that boasts a readership with a median age of 25 but the man behind the endorsement was its 46yearold publisher , the 60 s wunderkind jann s wenner , who was friendly with mr brown in california in the early 70 s a survey of likely democratic voters in new york state taken march 29 and 30 by the marist institute for public opinion showed mr brown with greater support among those between the ages of 31 and 44 than among younger voters \( mr clinton , on the other hand , showed the reverse \) thirtyseven percent of those ages 31 to 44 said they would vote for mr brown , compared to only 26 percent of 18 to30yearolds brown is the candidate who speaks most directly to 18to24yearolds , said judy mcgrath , the 39yearold creative director of mtv , the cable music network that reaches 54 million homes in the united states but we have n't seen everyone under 30 going for brown not at all she said it was her impression that just as many mtv viewers back clinton , and a significant number favor george bush at a recent rally in washington square park , it was the aging baby boomers in the crowd who seemed to demonstrate the most unwavering enthusiasm for mr brown , people whom collegeage voters sometimes mockingly call bleeding ponytails \( generation x , a canadian novel marketed as the manifesto of the under30 generation , defined a bleeding ponytail as an elderly soldout baby boomer who pines for hippie or presellout days \) 'fiery rhetoric' many brown supporters in their 20 s voiced political diffidence and distrust even about their own candidate i like his fiery rhetoric , said ted duggen , a 22yearold senior at new york university , and he does n't owe anybody any favors to big money interests but mr duggen also described mr brown s call for a 13 percent flat tax as bull i do n't even think he believes in it mr duggen said he had tried to work as a brown volunteer , but gave up because the phone in the new york headquarters was always busy he also expressed irritation with the 60 s music blaring from the stage what year is this \?

moscow , april 4 when president boris n yeltsin locks horns with the jealous russian congress of people s deputies next week , the likelihood is that he will prevail the question is at what price the main issues before the 1 , 000odd deputies , whose congress is the highest legislative authority in russia , will be the progress of economic change , the powers of the government and a new constitution each debate promises some heated skirmishes at the meeting , which starts monday but the central issue in each will be one the unresolved and critical question of how the rising new russia will be ruled mr yeltsin and his cabinet argue that the difficult period of economic and political transition requires a concentration of power , that a bickering legislature would only dilute and delay painful but essential reforms reassertion by parliament the parliament , through which mr yeltsin himself rose to power , ceded its powers over the government in the heat of the battle against the communist regime now , it will try to reassert its authority the legislators will charge that under the sauce of reform , mr yeltsin is rebuilding the old structures of centralized command and stifling democracy both sides have a case the congress , elected in far different circumstances two years ago with a heavy concentration of old communist nomenklatura , has hardly been a bastion of democracy or wise legislation its unruly and inconclusive debates have soured much of the public on it on the other side , mr yeltsin s rule by decree has been demonstrably undemocratic , and his administration has been prey to corruption and some pillaging of former state and communist properties on balance , mr yeltsin clearly has the stronger hand despite soaring prices and an occasional political blooper , he has managed to maintain much of his personal popularity his primary challengers , the parliament speaker , ruslan khasbulatov , and vice president aleksandr v rutskoi , are not yet considered serious contenders and mr khasbulatov has signaled that he will not carry out his threat of trying to bring down the government boost from west mr yeltsin has also received a potent boost from the west , which announced a large proposed aid package for russia on the eve of the congress and linked it to a continuation of the course mr yeltsin has chosen mr yeltsin and his team have made some preemptive tactical maneuvers , shifting the government around a bit to give the impression that the most prominent figures have been reined in a notch gennadi burbulis , the operational head of the team , was dropped as first deputy prime minister but remained state secretary , while yegor t gaidar , the architect of the economic reforms , lost the ministry of finance but remained a deputy prime minister two other key associates , sergei shakhrai and aleksandr shokhin , were also affected by the shuffle but all their functions remained largely intact , and none gave any sign that the basic policies of the government were being altered the president s office has also leaked hints of an alternative draft constitution , with the tacit threat of going over parliament s head to a referendum if the deputies try to push through their powersharing formula surprises are possible still , the congress is capable of surprises its membership is divided roughly into three voting blocs staunch supporters of mr yeltsin , staunch opponents and an amorphous third bloc that swings widely but has usually ended up with the president without the discipline of political parties , the congress is likely to provide another televised potpourri of fervent diatribes , clashing ambitions , indecipherable motions and inconclusive procedural votes , of the sort that has become standard fare in the three years since legislatures began being elected here behind such displays and tactical maneuvering , however , is an ongoing struggle that could prove crucial to russia s fate what s happening in russia is a veritable battle for survival in the postcommunist era , mr burbulis said in an interview with moscow news last week , speaking not only of reforms but also of the political struggles around them however painful mr yeltsin s reforms have been to date , the worst is still to come the real crush may start when oil prices are freed in may , and when factories start to collapse and disgorge armies of unemployed people into the streets the hope of mr yeltsin s government is that the ruble will be sufficiently stable by then , privatization sufficiently under way and the west sufficiently involved to nourish new economic beginnings it is then that the government will require the broadest support , and that a war with parliament would be most debilitating resistance to parliament mr burbulis , a former instructor in marxism in sverdlovsk and now the prime architect of mr yeltsin s overall strategy , has made clear that he will not allow parliament to

the last link with the totalitarian system , and so are incapable of drawing up a creative constitution
greenbrae , calif , may 16 as the baby boom generation approaches menopause , the oncetaboo topic is provoking frank talk among women accustomed to raising their voices and getting their way and the sheer number of these women is creating huge new markets for menopause remedies and clinics , and is inspiring books and workshops about the change of life , 1990 s style after all , this is the generation that came of age ventilating problems in consciousnessraising groups and seeking answers to health questions in the 1970 feminist bible our bodies , ourselves 'vocal about everything' so it is unlikely that they will suffer menopause in lonely silence , as so many of their mothers did , fanning away hot flashes , tranquilizing jangled nerves and accepting that their best years are behind them we 've been vocal about everything , said terry norton , the 45yearold owner of an art gallery and a member of a menopause support group , known as the red hot mamas , that gathers here to compare notes on distracting symptoms , confusing medical advice and unsettling feelings about aging we do n't keep any secrets , much to our mothers' horror the first of the baby boom women are just now moving into the 45to54 age group , and with their addition , the menopausal population will increase in the next decade by almost half , from 13 million to 19 million takecharge attitude experts say this group s size and takecharge attitude will transform how society thinks about menopause , how much time and money gets spent understanding it and how doctors behave this is the group that has always reshaped the american landscape in its own image , and they 'll do it again , said ross goldstein , the president of generation insights , a consulting firm in san francisco that concentrates on baby boom trends instead of secrets , the baby boomers crave information about how they can relieve their discomfort and guard their health during the decade when women stop producing female hormones and unexpected things happen to their bodies and their minds not every woman experiences menopause in the same way or at the same age , of course the average age for cessation of menstruation is 51 , but most women experience a range of related symptoms from their mid40 s until their mid50 s a much smaller percentage suffer extreme symptoms or virtually none at all but regardless of the symptoms , this midlife decade is literally a change of life , and it raises important questions for many women the first is whether to follow their doctors' recommendations to start hormone replacement therapy , which shields older women from heart and bone disease and relieves menopausal symptoms but has been linked to cancer the next worry , for many of them , is how to remain competitive in highpowered jobs during a time of hormonal turbulence that can be as disorienting as adolescence , a time of muddled thoughts and weeping jags that undermine their usual sense of control and then there are more philosophical questions about how to use menopause as a life marker , a time to take inventory of where they have been and where they are going when you stop being reproductive , other things happen , said elsemarie johnson , a member of the support group there s an inner peace you did n't have before the strength of greater numbers the red hot mamas , and other groups like them in hollywood , new york city , boston and washington , spend much of their time together trading scraps of information they say that the facts they need are hard to extract from gynecologists who often dismiss them with a pat on the head and a prescription for hormones together , they tinker with the dosage of their hormone replacement therapy , often against the advice of their doctors they discuss the relative merits of vaginal lubricants to replace the natural moisture lost to age , which is a hard choice these days , since the racks at the pharmacy are suddenly full and they share what they know about bone scans to detect osteoporosis and endometrial biopsies to check for uterine cancer they also invent clever asides about the hot flashes that send sweat coursing down their faces during business meetings or soak their nightgowns in the middle of the night a favorite in this group comes from susan roane , a 46yearold writer and lecturer , who carries a pleated fan on her speaking tours you think this looks strange \? ms roane asks her audience well , imagine how i feel i just turned into my mother the compelling demographics of this group has already caught the attention of some in washington spearheaded by the congressional caucus for women s issues , the senate labor and human relations subcommittee on aging held its first hearings on women s midlife diseases last year and this year , under a new female director , the national institutes of health will begin a 10year , 100 million study on hormone replacement therapy and its effects on cancer , heart disease and osteoporosis but some experts say there is danger as well as promise in the demographics they worry that this huge cohort could be a snake oil salesman s dream and that these women will wind up wasting their money and perhaps harming their health with products that are already flooding the market to meet their real or perceived needs i'm concerned that a time of transition will be used as a marketing opportunity , said cindy pearson , program director of the women s health network in washington
alonzo king makes dances that are peculiar , uncomfortable to watch and oddly static , all things that ballets are not supposed to be mr king is an extremely popular , nationally known ballet teacher , but there are no lyrical effusions or star pyrotechnics of the sort beloved by dancers however , by the time the program of dance presented by his lines contemporary ballet group wound to an end on tuesday at the joyce theater , where the company performs through sunday , it was clear that mr king is an original his work has a look of rough , selfguided exploration similar to the earliest modern dance pieces of garth fagan the program got off to an abysmal start with the 1991 cante , set to a spanishflavored score compiled and composed by donald ivan fontowitz wearing black and bathed in red light , the dancers in this 10yearold san franciscobased troupe looked awkward as they spun and stretched in stopandstart posturing voyages back and forth across the stage the piece had a bejartian sultriness to it , but none of that choreographer s sophistication nora heiber added a welcome dash of wit , and marina hotchkiss brought some genuine warmth to the proceedings in a lead cast that also included katherine warner , summer lee rhatigan , eric thome , vincent cowart , gregory dawson and chiharu shibata things got better with gurdjieff piano music , a 1992 work set to a propulsive and enjoyably datedsounding score by the mystic g i gurdjieff and by thomas de hartmann dressed in what looked like shredded white dancers' practice clothes and bits of underwear , performers appeared and disappeared in solos , duets and trios in the suite form mr king apparently favors there were a good many strange lifts in one trio , two men manipulated a woman who seemed to be cheerfully drunk a male trio was filled with heroic poses that might have been choreographed by ted shawn nothing made much logical sense but the dance was often intriguing there were interesting stage patterns and , even more , a feeling that mr king and his dancers were traveling through an emotionally charged landscape mr king works a good deal with bodies that stretch and then bow or crumple they jiggle and bounce on the stage floor , not following the sort of line of travel that helps to define dance in without wax there is a look of magnetized scattershot choreography reminiscent of the dance of william forsythe , who has acquired this piece for his frankfurt ballet but everything comes together authoritatively in this 1990 work , which is set to music by bohuslav martinu and a fascinating string score by sofia gubaidulina what looks like instinctual experimentation is ordered here by an overarching emotional theme symbolized in opening and closing images in which the dancers seem to reach for something just over their heads like mr forsythe , mr king loosens a few of the binds of ballet conventions here , most compellingly in a tender but bizarre pas de deux almost hidden at the back of the stage without wax is a yeasty , provocative work that received a strong performance from the company , which also includes freddie miranda , debra rose and laurie skophammer costumes were designed by sandra woodall the evening s lighting was by craig miller
a 39yearold homeless man was set on fire and severely burned early yesterday as he slept on a subway train passing through the bronx , the transit police said it was the most serious incident in a series of similar attacks on homeless people on new york city trains this year , the police said although no one witnessed yesterday s incident , which took place about 4 30 am on a northbound no 2 train , transit investigators concluded that the fire was intentionally set , said lieut robert j valentino , a transit police spokesman after the train pulled into the freeman street station , witnesses saw four teenagers running from the car where the man was burning , he said the man , who gave his name as robert walther , was listed in critical condition last night at bronx municipal hospital center with thirddegree burns over 95 percent of his body , said clarence crump , the administrator on duty the incident fit the pattern of previous attacks , lieutenant valentino said we do not believe it s the same group that s doing it , but in all incidents it s similar , he said it s a homeless person , he s sleeping on a train , and the first time he s aware of what s happened is when he s awakened by the fire in yesterday s incident , mr walther was set on fire as he slept in the third car from the rear of the train as it passed from the simpson street station to the freeman street station , lieutenant valentino said fire marshals could n't tell if an accelerant was involved , he said he was wearing a plastic jacket , and that alone would act as an accelerant at freeman street , another passenger dashed from the train , snatched a fire extinguisher from the token booth area , and put out the flames , he said since jan 26 , groups of young men , ranging in age from their midteens to their mid20 s , have set fire to seven homeless men sleeping in subway cars , lieutenant valentino said they 've happened all over the subway system , not on a specific line or in a specific borough , he said transit police made two arrests in one of the attacks , he said advocates for the homeless , saying they knew of no previous pattern of such attacks , connected the incidents to growing public intolerance of homeless people reactions to the news of the attacks among homeless people seeking cover in the subways from last night s rain ranged from fearful to fatalistic craig whitley , 29 , standing on the platform in the 168th street irt station , said the news confirmed his fears of sleeping in the subways , which he tries to avoid at night i worry , he said we need protection but another man , resting on a bench in the 137th street irt station , seemed more accepting if it happens it happens , said the man , who refused to give his name i have nothing to lose the coalition for the homeless is offering a 5 , 000 reward to anyone supplying information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those who attacked mr walther , said mary brosnahan , executive director of the group lieutenant valentino said that none of the previous attacks on homeless people resulted in serious injuries on feb 24 , two brooklyn youths were charged with reckless endangerment and assault after they tried to set fire to a homeless man , also on a northbound no 2 train in the bronx , he said
crossed over a murder , a memoir by beverly lowry 245 pp new york alfred a knopf 22 if the impulse to write fiction comes partly from wanting to experience more than one life , one of the advantages of authorship is how comfortably we can do so , assuming whole new identities and points of view without ever leaving our desks but every so often a novelist feels moved to go out and encounter a very different life as it were , in person interestingly , this life is often that of a convicted prisoner who inhabits an even more confined space than the author s study , and there in that cramped cell the writer is inspired to his or her most expansive work norman mailer s executioner s song , truman capote s in cold blood now we have beverly lowry s memoir crossed over , which , like its literary predecessors , centers on a killer with loser charisma smart , pretty \( and apparently rehabilitated \) 32yearold karla faye tucker is now on death row in texas s mountain view prison when she was 23 , she and her boyfriend brutally murdered two people with a pickax in a suburban houston apartment originally scheduled to die on june 30 of this year , she has been granted a 90day stay of execution photos of karla faye tucker cover a wall of beverly lowry s study , and her presence occupies considerable room in the mind of this writer , who over the last three years has become intensely involved with the legacy of karla faye s violent past and with her uncertain future among the qualities that distinguish a serious truecrime book from its trash competitors is the tacit or implicit acknowledgment that the writer is also its subject so crossed over is beverly lowry s frank attempt to fathom what impelled her to visit karla faye tucker , a young woman she knew only from grisly newspaper articles ms lowry s motives were more personal than professional , less about gathering literary material than about reconstructing an inner life made unlivable by grief she is convinced \( as are we \) that she would never have sought out karla faye if her own 18yearold son , peter , had not been killed in what she calls a hitandrun incident like karla faye tucker , peter lowry had a troubled , stormy youth when peter was alive , ms lowry tells us , i used to think about the mountain view unit for wayward boys a lot i thought peter might end up a state boy but ms lowry insists \( and again we believe her \) that her connection with karla faye is too complicated to be reduced to that of a surrogate mother and her substitute child crossed over is a tough book to read , emotionally draining you may come to the end of a chapter and find you 've been holding your breath it s a tribute to ms lowry that we 're stunned by her account of the sort of events that hardly snag our attention when we see them on tabloid television a writer of fiction whose previous books include breaking gentle and daddy s girl , beverly lowry uses her skills as a novelist to render karla faye tucker s early life in all its perversely enthralling detail a doper at 8 , a needle freak behind heroin by the time she was 11 , karla faye tried sex for the first time at 11 , maybe 12 when she was 13 , she learned that she was the child of one of her mother s illicit liaisons as a teenager , she shot dope and turned tricks with her mother and traveled as a groupie with the allman brothers by her own admission , she was on drugs solid from the age of 10 to the day , four months before her 24th birthday , when she was sent to jail at once passionate and coolly observant , ms lowry invites us to join the other flies on the wall at the funky houston house where karla faye tucker and her boyfriend , a bartender named danny garrett , gave a nonstop party with a constantly shifting guest list of jumpy bikers , dopers , bad cops , whores we witness a succession of unnerving scenes there is the grim pas de deux of escalating nastiness between toughtalking karla faye and the man she and danny eventually murdered , jerry lynn dean , whom she had always disliked and who had made the mistake of punching out his estranged wife , shawn , karla faye s best friend there is the night of the brutal killings , which began as a robbery , just something to do , and ended with the death not only of jerry dean but also of a woman named deborah thornton , who 'd had the bad luck to meet him at a party that afternoon in the aftermath , karla faye and danny did a lot of boasting and bragging and throwing their weight around and one afternoon danny s brother \( the boyfriend , later the husband , of karla faye s sister , kari \) arrived wearing a police wire to elicit taped confessions from the druggedup karla faye and danny this is strong stuff but beverly lowry s memories of her lost child , which she interweaves with karla faye tucker s story , are nearly as harrowing she reveals them in stages , as if she is steeling herself \( and us \) for an account of the night when , after a rainy labor day picnic , peter was struck and killed

lang son , vietnam me thi ha believes she is a widow but apart from the faded , redbordered government certificate proclaiming her husband a vietnamese martyr in the struggle against america , she has no proof of his death mrs ha worries about calling herself a widow because she still does not know how or when or where her husband died , and she says she probably never will of course i understand how the americans feel , she said when i read in the newspapers how the americans come here to search for the missing soldiers , i know exactly the pain of the families we share the same grief missing and presumed dead in vietnamese homes , the redbordered certificates are typically displayed in the finest wooden frames the families can afford , and as household decorations they are as common here as wall calendars and family photographs like the families of many vietnamese soldiers , mrs ha received the certificate instead of a body that the vietnamese army could never find according to the hanoi government , her husband , capt to van thinh , and more than 300 , 000 other vietnamese soldiers are still missing and can only be presumed dead from what many vietnamese in the north still call the war against america about a million and a half vietnamese were killed in the war 185 , 000 south vietnamese soldiers , 924 , 000 north vietnamese and vietcong and 415 , 000 civilians about 58 , 000 americans died more than threequarters of the vietnamese missing are from central or northcentral provinces , although the figure of 300 , 000 includes vietcong as well as tens of thousands of soldiers who served in the south vietnamese army careful with americans there are death certificates on display everywhere in lang son , a city of merchants and small farmers on vietnam s mountainous northern border with china , about 80 miles northeast of hanoi lang son is the capital of lang son province , home to nearly 2 , 400 soldiers listed as missing from the war the vietnamese government , which is eager to resume diplomatic and economic ties with the united states , is careful not to offend american visitors by suggesting directly that the sacrifice of vietnamese families was greater than that of families in the united states but when american investigators come to hanoi to press the vietnamese to cooperate in the search for 2 , 265 americans still listed as unaccounted for in indochina , the vietnamese will turn the conversation slowly , carefully , inevitably to the fact that so many more vietnamese are also missing few dental records hanoi s recent announcement that it will step up cooperation in the search for missing americans by opening up its war archives is thought likely to result in a relaxation of a 17yearold american trade embargo on vietnam vietnam s ministry of labor , war invalids and social affairs is responsible for trying to help vietnamese families determine the fate of missing soldiers , but there is little it can do vietnam is a very poor country , and so the people must take responsibility for this themselves this must be a people s campaign , said nghiem xuan tue , a military spokesman even when we have a soldier s remains , we have none of the modern technology to identify them dental records , among the most valuable tools the pentagon has for identifying the remains of american troops , are usually not available for north vietnamese soldiers , most of whom had never had a dental xray families keep searching as a north vietnamese soldier in the early 1970 s , mr tue fought on some of the most grisly battlefields of the south , and he said it was common for northern soldiers to be buried hurriedly in shallow dirt graves marked only by a few stones in the war there was no time to bury a man properly , he said i buried so many myself you would leave stones on the grave and hope to go back someday to find it for thousands of soldiers who were hit by bombs dropped from b52 s , he said , there were no remains at all while the chances of finding a soldier s remains are virtually nonexistent , nearly 1 , 000 northern vietnamese families apply to the government each month for the chance to travel south to look for clues to the fate of missing relatives proper burial is essential many go armed only with a onepage typewritten letter that was commonly sent to families by the army informing them of little more than the fact that a soldier had died if a family was lucky , the letter mentioned a province where the body might have been buried during the war , communication from the southern battlefields was difficult and dangerous , and mail from soldiers did not routinely travel north many northern families were not notified for years that a soldier had died or was missing tran van ke , a 64yearold shipping clerk from lang son , waited five years before he learned that his son had died of wounds suffered in south vietnam his friends came home from the war in 1975 and told us our brave son died in 1970 and that he had been quickly buried , mr ke said , reaching up to remove a small blackandwhite photograph of his son , tran ban tiep , from the wall of the front room of the family home the 1968 photo showed a boyish mr tiep , then 18 , in full military uniform , carrying an ak47 rifle his friends cannot remember where he was buried , mr ke said it is my great hope that we will someday discover where he is buried ancestor worship dominates the spiritual life of the vietnamese , and it is considered essential that the remains of the dead be properly buried and venerated if i could afford the trip , i would go south to look for my husband , said mrs ha , a retired army cook whose only income , apart from gifts from her three children , is a 5amonth pension even if i could not find him , i would like to try i am not a religious woman , but i do know i would feel relief in my dreams if i know where my husband was buried photo tran ve ke , a shipping clerk from lang son ,

a young woman , kelly kelleher , and a senator meet at a july fourth party on an island off maine rushing to catch a ferry that will take them to the mainland for a date , their car skids off a bridge and into water a nd , yet , had it happened \? the car speeding skidding along the road that seemed to have no houses , no traffic only swampy land stretching for miles everywhere the spiky brown rushes , the swaying tall grasses , stunted pines , and the harsh percussive rhythm of the insects' cries in their mating as if sensing how time accelerated , how the moon would shortly topple from the sky turned upsidedown and kelly saw without registering she saw \( for she and the senator were talking \) in a shallow ditch beside the road a broken dinette table , the front wheel of an english racing bicycle , the headless naked body of a fleshpink doll you 're an american girl you love your life you love your life , you believe you have chosen it she was drowning , but she was not going to drown she was strong , she meant to put up a damned good fight and there was his anxious face floating on the other side of the windshield as again , after she 'd come to think he had abandoned her , he was diving for her , tugging at the door so violently the entire car rocked , and how tall he was , how warmly bronze his tanned skin , taller than nearly any man kelly had ever seen , his wide white smile filled with teeth , those frizzywiry hairs on his arms and his arms were solid , muscular , his right wrist as he 'd mentioned perceptibly thicker than his left from squash , decades of a fierce commitment to squash and his strong fingers crushing hers kelly is it \? kelly \? that day that morning she 'd been jogging on the beach , wind in her hair , and in the frothy surf were sandpipers with prominently spotted breasts and long thin beaks and those delicate legs teetering pecking in the wet sand and she 'd smiled at them , their curious scurrying movements , the oblivion of their concentration , feeling her heart swell i want to live , i want to live forever ! she was swallowing the black water in quick small mouthfuls reasoning that if she swallowed it quickly enough she would be simply drinking it , she would be all right it was risky it was the adventure of her young life very likely yes probably a mistake but she 'd leaned forward on her bare straining toes taking the kiss as if it were her due , for she was the one , she and none other , supplanting all the others , the young women who would have taken that kiss , from him , from that man whose name she had forgotten , in just that way she 'd never loved any man , she was a good girl but she would love that man if that would save her the black water was splashing into her mouth , into her nostrils , there was no avoiding it , filling her lungs , and her heart was beating in quick erratic lurches laboring to supply oxygen to her fainting brain where she saw so vividly jagged needles rising like stalagmites what did it mean \? laughing ruefully to think how many kisses she 'd had tasting of beer \? wine \? whisky \? cigarettes \? marijuana \? you love the life you 've lived , you 're an american girl you believe you have chosen it and yet he was diving into the black water , diving to the car , his fingers outspread on the cracked windshield and his hair lifting in tendrils , kelly \?

gowanda , ny , oct 1 a rattling wind slams against the redbrick facade of building 86 of the gowanda psychiatric center , then whistles down the hallways of what was once a ward in one of new york s staterun mental hospitals like many of the other structures at the sprawling complex here , building 86 is empty but gowanda , which in its heyday in the 1950 s had 3 , 710 patients on grounds surrounded by farmland , is not closed on the second floor of building 67 , amid wall stencils of horses , sunsets and a space shuttle , 14 mentally ill people live on a single ward they are the only patients here with local lawmakers fighting fiercely to preserve the hospital and the jobs it provides , the state continues to spend 29 million a year to keep gowanda open paying for a roundtheclock admissions center , a staff of 44 including fulltime psychiatrists and services ranging from physical therapy to ceramics classes it is an amount that many mentalhealth advocates call frighteningly high , because it could pay for more than a hundred beds in community residences at a time when thousands of the mentally ill are homeless in the streets of new york city but so far , the legislature has not provided the legal authorization for the center to be closed so gowanda has become a sort of love canal of state mentalhealth policy , a ghostly setting that lingers while the bureaucracy fights over what to do with it and like love canal , it is perhaps even more potent as a symbol than for the actual dollars spent here what is happening at gowanda , 40 miles south of buffalo , is likely to happen elsewhere in new york as the state tries to close or reduce services at several other large mental hospitals upstate that are vestiges of another era in each case , a powerful combination of community leaders , local lawmakers and unions are fighting off the planned closures of the mental hospitals , which often have been the dominant employer in their area their campaigns provide an oddly direct contrast to the not in my backyard phenomenon that has stymied attempts downstate to build many of the community residences for the mentally ill , which are far cheaper and considered by experts to be more humane and more effective in treating most sick people while almost everybody agrees that some of the hospitals need to be phased out , the local groups plead against closing the one in their backyard what has happened , in essence , is that the debate over how best to spend the state s mentalhealth dollars has been overwhelmed by a classic political struggle over how to fairly divide money between upstate and downstate there is tremendous pressure on lawmakers to keep these hospitals open until they can find other employment for the people who work there , and i can sympathize with that , said steven greenfield , the executive director of the association of community living agencies in mental health , a nonprofit advocacy group but to some extent , he said , mentally ill patients are being held hostage for the sake of economic development although the vast move to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill has emptied new york s mental hospitals of all but 11 , 000 patients , there are nonetheless 22 hospitals in the system four more than there were even in 1953 , when the mentalhospital population hit its peak of 93 , 000 nearly twothirds of the state s mentalhealth budget is spent on the hospitals , even though the goal of deinstitutionalization was to channel most spending to the community programs so while new york continues to lead every state in percapita spending on the mentally ill , there is nowhere near enough money for the estimated 170 , 000 mentally ill people outside the hospitals and up to half of the patients in the hospitals could themselves be treated in community residences if there were rooms available , state officials say as the patients at gowanda wander the silent grounds on a chilly fall afternoon , the physical isolation here only magnifies the sense that some are trapped in worlds of their own do you feel that \? asks a woman named carol , her eyes brimming with tears do you feel the winter feeling coming on \? others say that if there is nobody around , they like it that way you know that when all these buildings are empty it s good you do n't have to look around for anybody looking at you , said douglas , a bearded 34yearold man who was committed to gowanda after the police found him ripping paneling from a house he had formerly lived in \( he said he still considered the wood his \) 'it s eerie' outside of building 67 , which houses the ward and staff offices and an outpatient treatment center nearby , gowanda is a virtual ghost town it s eerie , it s strange , said peter l smith , who started working here as a mentaltherapy aide in 1966 now , as the sergeant in charge of safety and security , he makes the rounds of the empty buildings , guarding against water leaks or cracked pipes imagine coming through here at midnight , mr smith said as he took a visitor through the abandoned building 86 just you and a flashlight and your shadows
rzeszow , poland plunked by government fiat on defenders of stalingrad street , the wsk company endured the cold war as a reluctant polish cog in the soviet military machine , grinding out spare parts and helicopter engines the street name choosing it was roughly akin to calling an american street hanoi avenue was changed by city officials shortly after polish communism collapsed in 1989 just a year later , the soviet union failed to make good on on a 30 million debt to the factory , and soon after disappeared from the map altogether wsk remains the largest employer in this city 180 miles southeast of warsaw , it is a worstcase instance of how the industrial legacies of the communist system threaten to drag down economic reform plans in poland and other eastern european nations the factory , part of an interlocking group of aviation concerns that employ 70 , 000 people across poland , stands on the verge of bankruptcy management and the solidarity union demand a bailout to save their company and help this city of 153 , 000 , which depends on wsk for everything from heat one of its byproducts , steam , keeps a sizable part of the city warm to tax revenue they want the government to forgive overdue taxes and place big new airplane orders for the polish army we 're asking the government to find a place for us in the economy , said bronislaw jarecki , member of the solidarity leadership at wsk , whose initials stand for transportation equipment manufacturer in polish the government has to make a decision whether or not it needs an aircraft industry or whether it has to be restructured or whether onehalf should produce aviation and the rest something else you cannot close this down it s too big something has to remain here the company , and dozens others like it , represent a test of strength for the shaky coalition government of jan olszewski , the prime minister , who has called poland s budget catastrophic pleas are pouring in from every corner of the heavy industryempire built by the communists at the nowa huta steel mill in cracow , the country s biggest staterun concern , they are pressing for a governmentguaranteed loan to rebuild foundries the previous government had a radical plan to close a substantial portion of the company and throw 15 , 000 people out of work it was greeted by a workers' hunger strike private businesses double the opening moves in poland s reform , market prices and free trade began on jan 1 , 1990 , and brought cities like warsaw or cracow alive with commerce last year , the number of private businesses doubled yet the national economy is in a recession , with unemployment above 11 percent only a handful of poland s more than 8 , 000 staterun enterprises have been turned over to the private sector , and restructuring communism s industrial dinousaurs is proving even harder than expected more than 60 percent of polish workers are still employed by the government , either as bureaucrats or at the state companies polish officials acknowledge that bailing out the state companies , particularly those that depended on the arms business or nowcollapsed soviet market , would mean hyperinflation and a crippling blow to the fledlging private sector jerzy eysmontt , new leader of the government s economic team , insisted that poland would not go on a moneyprinting spree to underwrite the aid that would place in jeopardy the seal of approval from the international monetary fund that warsaw needs to continue reducing its 45 billion foreign debt and gain foreign assistance to finance its large deficit prime minister olszewski , who plans to unveil his economic blueprint by midfebruary , faces a brutal dilemma if he helps the rzeszow plant or similar claimants , all will clamor for a piece of the pie flat rejections risk a wave of social unrest from the workers at the large staterun industries who were the prime supporters of the solidarity movement aides to mr olszewski said the decision has already been made to protect the several dozen towns in which one factory is the only employer for tens of thousands of people the hundreds of cities like rzeszow , where bankruptcy of a leading company would be very painful but not fatal , pose a more difficult problem no government has yet dared tell the communistera factories the cold truth that many of them are virtually worthless and must be scrapped or drastically overhauled it s too late , said zdzislaw najder , newly named senior adviser to mr olszewski two years ago , i said we should be preparing policy that recognizes those who made this victory over communism possible , the workers in big state enterprises , will be worse hit instead , nothing was done mr najder said the new government must forge a social compact with polish society and the trade unions we have to agree on a set of minimal obligations in social security , health , education , he said then we will have to start with the admission that we cannot do even that out in rzeszow \( pronounced zhehshoof \) , where the solidarity union is holding an occupation strike in a management building , they are convinced mr olszewski will prove sympathetic at first glance , the plant looks like poland , circa 1980 the solidarity banner is draped across the wsk factory gates upstairs , a crowd of workers clusters in a room filled with long tables a crucifix gazes down at the scene from a perch next to the polish flag there are differences back then , the fear was that the soviets might come now , the worry is that the former soviet republics might not return with their business then , the workers wanted a voice in running the factory now , they have the power to fire managers , and design their protests to avoid slowing production job rolls cut sharply since 1989 , wsk has trimmed its job rolls from 14 , 000 to 8 , 500 , with layoffs of 1 , 500 more scheduled for this spring in 1990 , it paid 64 million in taxes to the central government last year , the government levied 33 million in taxes , but collected none the company has some exports to foreign countries , and hopes for more a study by polish consultants concluded that the aviation sector could survive , if it were cut from 70 , 000 to 30 , 000 jobs and switched from military production to crop dusters , jet trainers and smaller aircraft for developing nations joint ventures with major western aircraft makers were possible , the report concluded mieczyslaw janowski , the mayor of rzeszow and a former aviation engineer at wsk , sees no alternative to rescuing the concern unemployment in the city stands at 17 percent , and wsk represents 12 percent of the remaining jobs and 15 percent of local tax revenue in my opinion , the state cannot wash their hands of it , mr janowski said at one time , the state made the decision as to what kind of production ok , it was a communist state , but there were very restricted possibilities now you ca n't just say , 'boys , do it completely by yourselves' photo the wsk company in rzeszow is part of an interlocking group of aviation concerns that employs 70 , 000 people across poland and is on the brink of bankruptcy

responding to public anger , the hertz corporation announced yesterday that new york city residents who want to avoid surcharges can pay a 25 onetime fee for the company to check their driving and employment records to determine whether they are what hertz is calling responsible renters but hertz said that it would keep its surcharges 56 a day for residents of the bronx , 34 for brooklyn residents , 15 for those who live in queens and 3 for manhattan because they appear to be achieving their purpose , scaring off renters who cause a disproportionate number of accidents and later suits against hertz by people who are injured hertz said yesterday that in january and february , only about 20 of its cars were wrecked in the city , compared with about 90 in the same period last year the number of accidents with less severe damage was down , but not as sharply , it said meanwhile , the number of rentals is roughly unchanged hertz will not know until next year whether suits are down also , because those usually lag the accidents by months , it said hertz , based in park ridge , nj , has reported huge losses in payments to pedestrians , passengers and the drivers of other cars hit by cars rented from hertz , under a new york law that makes the car owner liable it attributes the problem mostly to people renting cars near their homes other car rental companies complain that local renters are more accidentprone than people traveling on vacation or business , but hertz is the only one to take such an action avis , in contrast , is lobbying in albany for a change in the liability law 'a burden on residents' public officials who were asked for a reaction to hertz s announcement yesterday were uniformly negative jeff maclin , a spokesman for mayor david n dinkins , said that applying for a safe driver certification still amounts to a burden on residents clint roswell , a spokesman for the bronx borough president , fernando ferrer , said it s a smokescreen maybe it s easing somebody s conscience , but it s not really a responsible program daniel andrews , a spokesman for claire shulman , the queens borough president , complained that hertz was hurting mothers at home with young children , retired people and youths by limiting responsible drivers to working people hertz was slightly conciliatory yesterday joseph russo , a spokesman , said the aim of the new program , which will start in 90 days , was to respond to the indignation of new yorkers who are saying , 'wait a minute , we 're not all bad drivers' potential renters would have to apply two weeks in advance , paying 25 and permitting hertz to search their motor vehicle records applicants with no tickets in the last three years would qualify hertz will recheck the records intermittently , he said , and if someone later gets a speeding ticket , the qualification would be canceled but the peace offering was immediately rejected by consumer advocates , including three members of the city council who have sponsored a bill , scheduled for a vote today , that would outlaw discrimination in rental charges based on geography within the city sponsors of the bill said the council would vote on it despite hertz s action and the city and state consumer agencies and the new york state attorney general are still suing hertz over the surcharges we think this is a token effort that fails to address the issue of a discriminatory surcharge , said ed barbini , a spokesman for attorney general robert abrams he compared the requirement to imposing literacy tests on voters susan d alter , a city councilwoman from brooklyn and the chairwoman of the council s consumer affairs committee , said of hertz s new program , it s not enough hertz s policy is dividing the city , said ms alter , who is one of three sponsors of the bill scheduled for a vote today bill would support hertz hertz officials said yesterday that the city law , if passed , would be unconstitutional , and that the company would sue to block its enforcement state senator nicholas a spano , a republican from yonkers , said yesterday that he would introduce a bill to prevent the city from barring the hertz surcharges he said in a statement that if hertz could not raise its prices in new york city it would do so all over new york state yesterday , state senator kemp hannon introduced a bill that would limit the liability of car rental companies , for accidents involving their cars , to 100 , 000 a victim and 300 , 000 an accident the bill is backed by avis , based in garden city , li , in senator hannon s district avis is lobbying hard for the bill , but hertz is not , reasoning that it is unlikely to pass because of opposition by trial lawyers new york is one of eight states that place no cap on liability hertz s announcement yesterday parallels a move by alamo in january to require driving record checks for local renters at airports in 10 cities before it required the checks , it simply charged local renters more than renters arriving by plane but alamo s policy applies only to large cars alamo has a rental office in newark , but none in new york city avoiding hertz' surcharge to enter hertz s responsible renter qualification program and avoid the surcharge , you must pay 25 and give the company your name , address , date of birth and other personal information the company will then check your driving record it must be clean , and you must have been employed for the last 12 months then , when you call for a reservation , the agent will quote you a rate that does not include the surcharge approval takes about two weeks if you are rejected , hertz keeps the 25 to reduce fraud , the company said , it will not issue an identification card its computerized information will be available to rental agents at counters the company will check driving records periodically it will not say how often and if it finds a ticket for a moving violation in the last three years , it will cancel the certification the program will begin in 90 days forms will be available at all hertz offices in the new york area
when a basement is flooded because of water rising from beneath the floor , one solution is to install a sump pump aside from requiring modest excavation , including breaking through the basement floor , the task is not difficult but before starting , call the building inspector to ask about the requirements for installing sumps find out whether the pump may discharge into a municipal storm sewer in many localities that is strictly forbidden , because sewers can be overloaded during heavy rains the inspector will probably say the pump has to discharge onto the ground on the property , where it can soak into the soil never connect a discharge line to an ordinary sewer or a septic tank two styles of pumps are available , pedestal or upright pumps and submersible pumps pedestal pumps have an electric motor attached to a hollow shaft about three feet long at the base of the shaft are the pump parts the unit stands upright in a sump pit , a hole dug in the basement floor , with the motor above the water level submersible pumps are sealed , so that water cannot enter the motor the entire unit is placed on the floor of the sump pit submersible pumps are more expensive than pedestal pumps because of their waterproof casing , but they operate more quietly unless there is a convenient 240volt circuit , choose a pump that operates on standard 115volt current when shopping , compare pumping capacity , horsepower and the amount of electricity needed most houses need pumps having about onethird horsepower , capable of pumping 50 gallons a minute to a height of five feet that information is usually on the pump or packaging to compare power use , determine the wattage from the label or by multiplying the motor voltage by its amperage then divide the wattage by the pumping capacity the answer indicates how much electricity is used by the pump the model whose specifications yield the lowest number when divided is the most economical to operate because conventional pumps operate on household electricity they will not operate during a power failure if that is a concern , buy a backup pump that runs on 12volt batteries both pumps are usually installed in the same pit , with the secondary pump higher than the primary that way , if the primary pump does not operate , the secondary will automatically start when the water rises higher than normal to install a pump , the first step is to dig the pit that should be at the lowest part of the basement floor a drain usually marks the spot if there is none , find the lowest area by noticing where flood water collects or stretch strings between the walls at floor level and measure under them use a pencil or chalk attached to a string to mark a circle on the floor around the spot 18 inches in diameter or as specified in the pump instructions break the floor to remove the concrete in the circle one way to do that is to rent an electric hammer drill bore holes around the perimeter and in the center break up the concrete with a sledgehammer and remove it a faster way is to use a rented jackhammer after breaking through the floor , dig the rest of the pit with a shovel to the depth recommended by the pump manufacturer , usually 24 inches cover the bottom of the pit with two or three inches of gravel , or as the pump instructions specify then insert a plastic , fiberglass or metal sleeve called a sump liner in the hole to prevent dirt from entering and fouling the pump liners are available where sump pumps are sold also buy a removable sump cover fill around the outside of the liner with dirt and cap the area with concrete troweled smooth and sloped toward the pit fastsetting concrete like sakrete fastset high strength concrete hardens fully the same day it is poured assemble a discharge line using plastic , pvc , plumbing pipe the standard diameter for sump pumps is one and a quarter inches the layout will vary according to the location of the pump and the dimensions of the basement , but a common design consists of a vertical pipe that is attached to the pump and rises out of the pit if a secondary pump is installed , it also can be attached to that pipe to the vertical pipe , attach a horizontal pipe running along the floor to the nearest window the vertical or horizontal pipe has to have a check valve to prevent water discharged by the pump from flowing backward toward it another vertical pipe is attached to the horizontal section that pipe can lead to the window or to a hole drilled through the basement wall above ground level attach an elbow fitting to the end of the pipe connect a long length of flexible drain hose to the fitting the hose should extend at least six feet away from the house , and the open end should rest on a splash block the glass can be removed from the window and replaced with plywood through which a hole is cut to accommodate the pipe apply caulking around to seal the hole plug the cord for the motor into a basement receptacle protected by a groundfaultcircuit interrupter close the pit with the cover drawings showing how to install a sump pump

san salvador , dec 13 just before the ceremony to bring a formal end to the civil war here , the toughest fighting sector of the salvadoran guerrilla movement is resisting demobilization and has turned to the united states to resolve concerns about its safety and economic security after a meeting on friday of leaders of one guerrilla movement with an official of the united states embassy , it was not clear whether the ceremony would take place as planned on tuesday , or would be further delayed officials and legislators were working throughout the weekend to push forward many of the uncompleted items of the broad , complicated peace package , and president alfredo cristiani was holding meetings with exguerrilla leaders to assess progress last major hurdle however , the question of the demobilization of the people s revolutionary army appeared to be the most difficult roadblock to overcome more than 35 field commanders from the , group , one of five represented in the guerrilla front , held an unannounced meeting in the capital on friday with peter romero , the charge d'affaires of the united states embassy , to discuss their fears and frustrations mr romero said today that the field commanders had returned to their rural zones to discuss possible next steps with their followers the group is led by joaquin villalobos , the master guerrilla tactician who fought the army to a draw mr romero said none of the participants in the meeting gave any indication that they intended to return to war , but he said they expressed a lot of apprehensions about some of the government promises worry over committments mr romero said the commanders were worried that , once the formal peace is declared , promises to reduce the size of the army and continue a land distribution program might be broken they also said they feared the army might be sent into former conflict zones after the peace is made formal i found that they were not very well informed about what has been happening during these months , mr romero said i ca n't say that there has been bad faith on either side , but they seemed to have little understanding of the details they were concerned about whether the united states would be here to guarantee implementation , he added , and seemed surprised when i told them that our aid is linked to compliance with the peace accords by both sides i told them that we realize we are the major aid giver and that we are here to provide guarantees , he said , adding that he had told the commanders the incoming clinton administration would continue to give el salvador high priority transition period the government and the rebels in the salvadoran civil war signed a united nationsmediated peace agreement on jan 16 , and on feb 1 began a ceasefire , or period of armed peace , during which they committed themselves to carry out a series of steps leading to formal peace , originally scheduled for oct 31 delays in fulfilling the agreement led to a renegotiation of the timetable and establishment of the new date of dec 15 for the ceremony vice president dan quayle , united nations secretarygeneral boutros boutrosghali and other foreign leaders are scheduled to attend under the agreement , the members of the farabundo marti national liberation front were to demobilize and disarm so the front could be reorganized as a political party also stipulated was a reduction of the army and a purge of officers accountable for the most serious crimes against civilians the agreement also called for the adoption of legislation dealing with electoral and judicial reform , and the provision of land and other benefits for former combatants on both sides and to guerrilla followers demobilization in phases the entire guerrilla front has been carrying out a phased demobilization of its 8 , 000 combatants since the end of june , with 20 per cent disarming in each step , handing in their weapons to united nations peacekeepers the fourth phase of the demobilization occurred at the beginning of this month , which was supposed to leave just the final 20 per cent to disarm immediately before tuesday s ceremony however , diplomats and peacekeepers made known in recent days that the people s revolutionary army did not take part in the fourth phase and wanted to delay full demobilization for a couple of months since most of those demobilized in the earlier stages were support personnel and parttime fighters , the heart of the group s fighting force remains intact at various points around the country the group s leaders said that since the ceasefire began , their rank and file members had not had contact with aid officials from the united states and the salvadoran government , and that this had contributed to the unrest , mr romero said by contrast , he said , other guerrilla factions had allowed aid workers easy access to discuss benefits available to fighters for demobilizing
officials will seek criminal charges against the driver of a bus that careered off a wet road and down an embankment in upstate new york , killing two long island schoolchildren and injuring 27 students and teachers last month , the essex county district attorney said yesterday the district attorney , john mcdonald , said he would present to a grand jury evidence for possible charges of criminally negligent homicide , a felony , against dennis d ellis , the driver of the gray line company bus mr ellis , 45 years old , of brooklyn , was driving home a group of children from woodland middle school in east meadow , li , after a field trip to montreal when his charter bus went through railings on interstate 87 , about 90 miles north of albany , and tumbled 70 feet down a ravine david jeffrey levinton , 12 , and michael vincent capozzi , 13 , died in the accident after the accident , the state police ticketed mr ellis for driving too fast for road conditions , and said the driver had admitted trouble sleeping the night before up to 4 years in prison criminally negligent homicide involves the failure to perceive a risk that causes the death of another person , and carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison while declining to discuss the details of the case , mr mcdonald described criminally negligent homicide as a gross deviation from the standard of conduct a reasonable person would observe in that situation mr ellis could not be reached for comment yesterday a check of mr ellis s driving record showed the april 11 accident was his fourth in three years he had accumulated six points on his license for passing a red light and going through a stop sign still less than the nine that would disqualify him from driving a bus under new york state law eleven points would disqualify him from driving a car an employment check showed mr ellis had lost two previous jobs for poor driving gray line has said that it knew nothing of mr ellis s employment history , and that none of the violations were serious enough to warrant his dismissal review of state laws mr mcdonald said that mr ellis s driving record would not be an element of the case , and that he did not expect charges would be brought for the injuries of the other children and teachers in the bus revelations of mr ellis s driving and employment history outraged east meadow parents and students , who were angered that mr ellis had been allowed to continue driving professionally the accident has prompted a review of new york state laws certifying bus drivers by the state department of motor vehicles and the senate s transportation committee though they are among the toughest in the nation , the state regulations do not deem mr ellis s record bad enough to keep him from driving a bus the ticket mr ellis received after the accident , however for driving too fast for road conditions carries a threepoint penalty , giving him the nine points that would lead to suspension of his bus driver s license

bardera , somalia , dec 24 in the early morning , the only sound in some feeding centers here is the uninterrupted crying of children some just sit on the ground , covered with flies and so thin that their skin falls in wrinkles around their bones as meal time approaches , they are joined by hundreds of women with their children , plastic bowl or sootblackened kettle in hand , who wait in line for their morning handout of steaming , highprotein gruel once served , they squat in the dirt , scooping up their gruel with their hands six hundred american marines arrived here today , tired and caked with dust after a 12hour ride through desert and scrub from baidoa , 120 miles to the northeast the marines set up roadblocks at the entrance to the town and took control of the airstrip , but on their first day here none of them saw the scenes in the refugee camps a mile out of town marines outside hunger zone some of the newly arrived marines wondered whether starvation , disease and malnutrition even existed here we 've seen all these pictures in magazines that show the horror of somalia , said staff sgt michael mcclung , 32 , of the 7th engineers support battalion we 've been to mogadishu , baidoa and now bardera people look definitely poor , but they 're not lying around lethargically dying we were wondering where these people were bardera , a dirt road lined by bulletpocked buildings and shanties of corrugated tin , is the second major famine relief center that the marines have secured on dec 16 they entered baidoa and began escorting food convoys to outlying villages military officials have considered the bardera operation much more difficult logistically it is more isolated than baidoa , reachable only by ramshackle roads or a dirt airstrip that becomes impassable whenever it rains and mines are a problem in bardera , a legacy of bitter fighting between rival somali factions the town has changed hands twice this year hungry cluster in camps bardera s fortunes have declined steeply from a decade ago , when it was at the heart of a fertile region today it is dusty and tattered but the butchers in the market sell slabs of camel and beef , and merchants have cloth and firewood for sale the only hints of famine in the town are the skeletal beggars who walk the streets and are regularly turned away from food stalls images of famine take over in the refugee centers , and in the outlying villages there are 186 villages we 'd like to reach , said bob allen , who heads the bardera operations of care , the american relief agency we 'd like to see the americans stay up to such time as the economy picks up and the harvest kicks in in september , war between clans emptied the countryside , and 16 , 000 refugees settled on the outskirts of town four months ago more than 300 people were dying each day , many of the weakest and most vulnerable among them since then the situation has improved considerably , said katherine macarthur , a care nurse in bardera the daily death toll is down to about 60 but warehouses have been looted regularly and relief agencies keep only a few days' supply of food in town for fear that it will be stolen relief agency officials say they hope the american presence will end the threat from looters weariness , but little cheer the tactics the americans used for bardera were similar to the approach they took in baidoa and kismayu leaflets announcing the marines' arrival were dropped on the town on tuesday , and on wednesday robert b oakley , president bush s special envoy to somalia , visited with town elders and clan leaders the bardera operation produced the first american death of the somali operation on wednesday when an american was killed and three others were injured when their car ran over a land mine the pentagon identified the dead man as lawrence n freedman , 51 , of fayetteville , nc the first american troops here were 64 marines in 12 vehicles from the first combat engineer battalion , whose job was to sweep the roads between baidoa and bardera for mines trucks decorated with handlettered merry christmas signs pushed huge steamroller wheels and chains to detonate mines they encountered none the rest of the troops arrived by 3 30 pm , caked in dust many asked reporters where the starving somalis were we 're not planning on going into town , ' said lieut col rod getz of the first battalion , 7th marines we 're trying first just to have a presence here , to create a good feeling the crowd that turned out to watch the americans was quiet and calm , appearing awed by the heavily armed marines as they went about their chores , sweating profusely in the 100degree heat aside from the holiday signs , there were few signs of christmas cheer among the weary marines in these depressing surroundings they settled into digging foxholes at the airport or just collapsed onto cots i'm trying not to think about christmas , said sgt john manoni , 28 , of elmwood , ill i try to think of it as just another day photo a somali woman and child passed by united states marines yesterday as the american forces covered the 120 miles from baidoa to bardera

washington , dec 22 under heavy pressure to add more women and members of minorities to his cabinet , presidentelect bill clinton appears to have replaced the leading candidate for interior secretary , former gov bruce babbitt of arizona , with representative bill richardson of new mexico , who is of hispanic descent the shift seems to have been dictated by mr clinton s desire to name a second hispanicamerican to his cabinet , say officials of the transition team if selected , mr richardson would join former mayor henry g cisneros of san antonio , whose selection as secretary of housing and urban development was announced last week mr babbitt is now considered likely to be named the united states trade representative but leaders of environmental organizations sought last night to forestall the decision , telling mr clinton that they wanted mr babbitt at the interior department , the cabinet office that most affects their interests uncertainty on decision a highranking transition official said tonight in little rock , ark , that because of the intense pressure from both sides , the decision could go either way an announcement is likely to come on thursday the reports about the interior post came a day after mr clinton bypassed senator tim wirth of colorado , who is believed to have been promised the job of energy secretary by vice presidentelect al gore on monday , mr clinton chose hazel r o'leary , a black woman who worked in the carter and ford administrations , to head the energy department he s casting aside people he knows very well and had planned to choose in favor of people he knows much less well who will help him reach his diversity goals , a top clinton campaign adviser said today doubly disappointed senator the disappointment felt by mr wirth , who is retiring from the senate , was deepened by the fact that the interior department had been his first choice he had been persuaded to take the energy post after campaigning hard for the clintongore ticket his friends have blamed a variety of outside pressures for his omission from the cabinet , from hostility by republican senators to pressure by leading democrats with different energy interests from his but some democrats or their spokesmen denied they had sought to block his appointment to a cabinet post that is bunk , senator robert c byrd of west virginia , whose state produces coal , said through his press secretary and senator j bennett johnston of louisiana , whose state is a leading oil producer , called mr wirth his friend and said that in talks with thomas f mclarty 3d , the presidentelect s choice for chief of staff , he had recommended that mr wirth be named interior secretary or energy secretary mr clinton and mr gore both said on monday that they had no fears that mr wirth could be confirmed by the democraticcontrolled senate , which acts on all cabinet nominations , but the two all but acknowledged that pressure for more women in the cabinet was a factor in the energy department decision even so , mr clinton has shown resentment over complaints about the number of women in his cabinet at one point in his news conference on monday he denounced feminist bean counters , saying , they are playing quota games 'incredible wars' in capital the likely selection of mr babbitt as trade representative would do more for mr clinton than help him just approach his campaign promise to provide a government that looks like america because mr babbitt is held in high respect , it would probably quell weeks of bitter struggling between washington s rival camps of free trade advocates and managed trade defenders there are these incredible wars going on around here , said a congressional aide who has been on capitol hill since the mid1970 s it s just completely unprecedented in my time here the selection of mr babbitt would also reflect a concern for overcoming congressional obstacles to agreement on the north american free trade agreement and a new world trade agreement some clinton advisers recommended this approach , even though a politician might take a long time to learn the minutiae of trade and might not be well suited to negotiating further trade agreements the 45yearold mr richardson was elected to a sixth term in november and named a chief deputy whip by speaker thomas s foley this month he has a record of concern about nuclear waste and a voting record that the league of conservation voters , for example , rates highly jim maddy , the league s executive director , said that by his group s ratings mr richardson has scored regularly 80 percent or higher , and that is a very good record but mr maddy s group and three or four others sent a letter to mr clinton today saying they wanted someone devoted to their cause and urging him to give the interior department position to mr babbitt or mr wirth we expressed our very strong concern , mr maddy said we are saying , 'where are our champions here \? ' tim wirth and bruce babbitt are champions of ours and have been for a long , long time the environmental community is wholly enthusiastic about these men and we cannot think of anybody who would be better at these two jobs than them almost criticism several environmental advocates spoke yesterday in terms just short of criticizing mr clinton , who assiduously courted the environmental vote during the presidential campaign i am deeply concerned that no senior cabinet position has gone to someone who represents the commitment to environmental issues that was expressed by clinton and gore in the campaign , said fred krup , executive director of the environmental defense fund we need people with a deep understanding of these complex issues and a proven track record in environmental matters , and we just have n't seen that from any of these cabinet positions mr babbitt , 54 , was governor of arizona from 1978 to 1987 , and ran unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination in 1988 he was strongly identified with environmental causes in his administration and has been honored more than once by the national wildlife federation dee dee myers , press secretary to the clinton transition operation , took note of the onrushing dispute and said the environmental groups were welcome to speak their minds and we welcome all input but i think the presidentelect will make a decision based on who he thinks is best qualified , as he did in the case of the energy secretary and the epa administrator , she said i am confident he will choose someone of some quality to head the department of interior ms myers acknowledged that there were racial and sexual factors to some of mr clinton s choices , but said that did not undercut his commitment to making appointments based on merit reflection of america he said early on that he wanted a cabinet that looked like america , she said but he never set aside any particular jobs for any particular ethnic groups he has not set any quota system what he has done is expand the search ms myers said mr clinton had become a little frustrated over criticisms by interest groups that he was not acting swiftly enough to accede to their demands but ms myers said , somewhat ruefully , that none of this was really much of a surprise we are the democratic party , she said this is the way we do business photo a day after senator tim wirth of colorado , left \( paul conklin \) , was bypassed as energy secretary , presidentelect bill clinton appears to have replaced the leading candidate for interior secretary , former gov bruce babbitt of arizona with representative bill richardson \( the new york times \) \( pg a15 \)

in the last 12 months , three world class canadian figure skaters have died of aids another canadian skater , dennis coi , a former junior world champion , died in 1987 of the same disease john curry of britain , a former olympic champion also suffering from aids , returned last month to his home in england to spend the remainder of his life the sport has been rocked hard by the illness , in stoic silence , in an olympic year usually reserved for gold medals and triumphant tours that showcase nothing more controversial than triple jumps so now figure skating is left with the task of educating its anxious athletes and avoiding the publicity that might damage this theatrical , marketingdriven sport it s been devastating , said tracy wilson of canada , who won a bronze medal in ice dancing in the 1988 winter olympics with rob mccall , who died of aids last november i 've lost three skating friends to aids , and you can safely assume there are others out there who have the disease and are n't talking about it in the case of aids , a skater who acknowledges he is gay or admits to being hivpositive risks more than loss of privacy the admission also brings the strong possibility of loss of endorsements from sponsors and increased difficulties when crossing international borders for competitions the united states has one of the most restrictive immigration and customs policies in the world toward aids rob mccall did n't announce he had aids for that reason , wilson said those final months were an incredibly helpless feeling for him we were in the midst of our pro career , and he did n't want to quit at all wilson and mccall were touring professionally with brian boitano and katarina witt in march 1990 , finally cashing in on their figureskating artistry , when mccall was rushed to a hospital in portland , me , with pneumonia the illness was a symptom of aids mccall died of aidsrelated brain cancer last november , 20 months later , at age 33 shaun mcgill and brian pockar both died in their early 30 s the deaths of mccall and pockar , the threetime canadian men s champion , were officially reported by the canadian figure skating association as aidsrelated wilson said that mcgill , the world professional silver medalist in 1988 and a friend of wilson , also suffered an aidsrelated death he died last march 23 at the age of 30 coi , who defeated both boitano of the united states and brian orser of canada in the 1978 world junior championships , died in september 1987 of aids at the age of 27 curry , the former world and olympic champion from britain , who worked with mcgill , announced last month that he was suffering from aids and that he was returning to his home in england in a newspaper interview last month , curry said he contracted the virus that causes aids during a homosexual relationship several years ago none of the three canadian skaters who died in the past 12 months said how they contracted the virus first public appeal figure skaters are deeply divided on the question of whether aids has become a special problem in their sport and on whether to publicize its experiences nonetheless , the sport s stars will turn out saturday for an exhibition , skate the dream , at varsity arena in toronto , to honor mccall and to raise money for aids research in canada the toronto exhibition represents the first real public appeal by the figure skaters mccall , a bronze medalist with wilson at the calgary olympics in 1988 , died while planning the skate the dream fundraiser like most of the other skaters afflicted with the aids virus , mccall told only his closest friends about his disease , fearing the customs and immigration laws in the united states when mccall could no longer lace his skates over a tumor in his foot , he continued to work in the united states as a choreographer one month before his death , mccall was still directing orser s program orser has labored with wilson to complete mccall s plans for skate the dream and will perform a latinbeat routine choreographed by mccall in his program on saturday rob s death was the first time an olympian passed away from aids , orser said it was important , and it s a cause worthy of exposure but orser , like his compatriot and former olympian toller cranston , believes that figure skating does not deserve any special attention regarding aids 'aids is everywhere' there s all this finger pointing at figure skating , orser said i do n't know of any other skaters with the disease aids is everywhere not just in figure skating not just in sport it s only that figure skaters are in the spotlight whether or not fears have become exaggerated , the sport s top officials are fighting insiders' perceptions that figure skating is under seige david dore , director general of the canadian figure skating association , has been trying to prevent a panic among parents of junior skaters in his program the association is a major sponsor of skate the dream and has sexeducation programs available for its highperformance athletes dore insisted , however , that aids is society s problem , not figure skating s curse people have been frightened about this in figure skating for several years , but i do n't think the rate is anything above the rest of society , dore said 'obligation to young athletes' but paul george , who represents the united states figure skating association on the united states olympic committee board of directors , said he was stunned by curry s recent announcement it made me think that we should redouble our education efforts , george said we have an obligation to our young athletes
fort worth , dec 5 with a matchending ace from the maestro , and with a matchending embrace between two players who embody this nation s davis cup past , present , and future , john mcenroe and pete sampras culminated their comeback from a twosetstonone deficit to defeat switzerland s marc rosset and jakob hlasekand give the united states a 21 advantage today in the davis cup finale the united states , now in its third consecutive davis cup final , can claim its second title in three years on sunday when topranked jim courier faces 34thranked hlasek , and andre agassi meets rosset today s 67 \( 75 \) , 67 \( 97 \) , 75 , 61 , 62 victory left mcenroe , who terms his participation in 1993 davis cup a question mark , and sampras with an untarnished 20 davis cup record together it was a mental grind , said sampras , who came alone to the postmatch news conference in deference to his partner s weeklong request to avoid public queries about his marital discord it took a very strong mental effort , sampras said of the comeback , but probably the two best sets of tennis i ever played in doubles were the last two mcenroe waited only until the fourth game of the match , when the united states just happened to break back and square the proceedings at 22 , to engage the server hlasek , who just happens to be a former doubles partner , in a verbal sparring match and that set a confrontational tone for the duration of the 4hour16minute encounter hlasek later accused the united states team of overdoing its role as the heavy in what he termed a david versus goliath struggle between a fourplayer united states team , which has 29 davis cups in its history , and the twoman swiss squad responsible for its nation s firstever trip to a final a matter of respect i would have much more respect if their players showed us some respect i'm so proud to be swiss , said the czechborn hlasek , whose comments were downplayed by the united states captain , tom gorman in the heat of battle there s certainly a lot of intensity , but i do n't think it had anything to do with our players' lack of respect for the swiss players , gorman said up in the stands , there was another kind of clash a culture clash as tyrolia squared off against texas tengallon hats met lederhosen the clang of swiss cowbells met the hoarse honk of bullhorns borrowed from the high school football field everybody waved flags , precisely the kind of antic atmosphere mcenroe finds inspiring , but for the first two grueling sets , it seemed to do the same for rosset and hlasek the swiss duo , the world s 10thranked team and defending french open doubles champions , had precision and symmetry on their side rosset served big and hlasek volleyed with opportunistic ease , routinely ambushing the service returns of mcenroe and sampras mcenroe in particular had ample reason to regret the blunders he made at critical stages late in the first two sets he doublefaulted at set point of the first set s tie breaker and then dropped his serve again as he served for the second set at 54 in both instances , the tie breakers ended under circumstances that almost seemed surreal , and left mcenroe furious with himself it was n't until the routine 10minute break following the third set , which the united states duo squeaked through by finally gaining and converting its first break points against rosset s serve , that mcenroe successfully rerouted his selfdenigration and began to manhandle his opponents mac in the locker room was just ranting and raving , sampras said vintage mcenroe by the final set , mcenroe was pure menace , flipping tennis balls around the court like so many flapjacks , and his mind and body language proved contagious sampras , mcenroe s able understudy , turned ferocious , too , and together they tamed the swiss they solved rosset s mighty serve in the fifth game , where a pair of whiplash forehand crosscourts from mcenroe sealed the 32 break , and they went up by 52 when hlasek served up double faults at break and game point that gave mcenroe the chance to serve for the match , one that possibly could be his davis cup swan song the serve that was such a miscreant in the opening two sets behaved itself at last it was wonderful , said sampras he did the same thing in minnesota , where the americans defeated sweden in the semifinals he s the best doubles player to ever play the game , sampras continued hyperventilation was a problem for the overexcited united states duo in the opening sets the first , which began with a service break against a jittery sampras , had to be decided by the tie breaker after first mcenroe , who failed in the 11th game , and then hlasek , who followed suit in the 12th , lost their serve at love photos john mcenroe talking to jakob hlasek of switzerland during their davis cup doubles match in fort worth \( agence francepresse \) \( pg 5 \) john mcenroe hitting a volley as doubles partner pete sampras watches \( agence france presse \) \( pg 1 \)
laski , poland , july 6 the rage had been building for weeks in this quiet hamlet just outside of warsaw plans to open two homes for children infected with the aids virus had already stirred nightly protests and vows of defiance then , a government helicopter dropped sheaves of leaflets challenging the local belief that aids can be caught from mosquito bites , sewage systems and water a riot erupted villagers smashed windows in the two houses , which were being renovated for eight small children they set fires , scattered rotting garbage on the doorsteps and burned the leaflets , which accurately stated that aids can be transmitted only through sexual contact or blood on friday , a fire of suspicious origin swept through one of the two houses local residents insist that the blaze was caused by lightning a plainclothes policeman standing guard out front today shrugged his shoulders and said that s the official version in the village , when asked if he believed this story we do not trust anyone , said a 34yearold woman who gave her name only as wieslawa in other situations , we would n't resort to such excesses , but we do n't see any other way out suspicions are deep and dark the deeprooted suspicion of all authorities , inculcated by 45 years of communist rule , lingers in democratic poland on matters of health , people here accept the word of their neighbors , not that of the doctors from the health ministry rumors have more credibility than official statements , and people in laski are certain that the government is lying about how aids is transmitted , just as the communists spoke falsely about everything from the power of the proletariat to the chernobyl accident poland s religious and social leaders have been loath to confront the folk wisdoms , even though the solidarity movement s trademark in the 1980 s was its advocacy of tolerance and brotherhood none of the leading postcommunist politicians has yet spoken out against the dark fears that have engulfed laski the bishops of the roman catholic church , poland s leading faith , have not weighed in , either , leaving the commentary to local priests one said that aids was a consequence of sin , but that the church must also serve these people president lech walesa , the former solidarity leader , has appeared to side with the protesters in a recent television interview , he blamed a governmentfunded drug treatment group for trying to place the children in laski , a residential setting it should n't be done this way , said mr walesa society is as it is , and as long as it is such , let us try to do this somewhere else aids has only recently emerged as an issue in poland the government reports that only a few thousand people are officially registered as hivpositive public schools dropped their program of sex education under pressure from the catholic church after communism fell no governmentsponsored programs exist to promote the distribution of condoms nonetheless , marek kotanski , head of the drug treatment group monar , estimates that more than 100 , 000 people in this country of 39 million are infected with the virus most are drug addicts who shared needles while injecting what is called kompot , a homemade narcotic distilled from poppy seeds mr kotanski is at the center of the controversy over laski monar operates a network of treatment centers in which drug addicts live in remote areas for up to two years and follow a regimen of chores and physical labor some of the hivinfected people in the program had children , and mr kotanski decided to find a house where they could all be cared for together he was chased from the town of jozefow earlier this year by local residents , and reporters covering the protests there were beaten a second attempt to rent property near the central polish city of lodz also ended in failure when local government officials raised questions finally , mr kotanski turned to a foundation that , under the provisions of an americanpolish agreement , takes the proceeds from the sales of food aid donated to poland by the american government and distributes the money to charity the houses for the children in laski cost more than 250 , 000 i'm not leaving there , mr kotanski said i'm in until the end this is going to be a holy war , even against the whole state he is a wellknown figure in poland who in the 1980 s organized such eccentric anticommunist protests as a national campaign to clean public toilets a note of hope the church has succeeded in opening a home in the town of piastow for adults infected with the hiv virus residents protested , but the local police arrested the leaders and courts imposed hefty fines after a few months , the demonstrations subsided , although the atmosphere remains tense one of the few optimists about the possibility of opening the homes is tomasz polkowski , the manager of the americanpolish joint commission on humanitarian assistance , which paid for the houses and transferred title to mr kotanski s organization i still think this center will be opened , said mr polkowski if the ministry of interior , together with the police , ca n't handle this situation , it means we are living in anarchy photo citizens gathering last week at one of two houses in laski , poland , where plans to convert the houses into treatment centers for hivinfected children are

seventeen firefighters were injured , none of them seriously , battling a relentless fire in a vacant building near the holland tunnel in manhattan that continued to burn out of control early this morning , more than seven hours after it began , the fire department said the cause of the fivealarm fire , which engulfed all six floors at 36 ericsson place , in tribeca , was not immediately known , fire officials said a department spokesman , firefighter james spollen , said that the abandoned building might have been a paper factory firefighter spollen said that 12 of the injured firefighters were taken to local hospitals , with most suffering from heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation at the height of the blaze , nearly 220 firefighters were working to extinguish it , fire officials said the fire broke out at about 6 13 pm and spread so rapidly that firefighters feared the building would collapse and were forced to fight the fire atop tower ladders , a slower but safer method , firefighter spollen said fire officials said they closed the tunnel s manhattanbound exit near varick street to allow the fire trucks to better navigate lower manhattan s narrow streets

washington , may 16 two weeks after the los angeles riots , the white house remains focused on the shortterm goal of moving its existing urban policies through congress and shows little sign of beginning work on a broader agenda of new programs to revive the nation s cities although administration officials acknowledge that president bush s program is not a complete response either to the riots themselves or to more sweeping urban needs , none of mr bush s advisers have been asked to draft major new longrange initiatives or significant new spending for cities , the officials said a working group led by clayton k yeutter , the white house domestic policy chief , will review proposals for action that mr bush might take later this year , the officials said the group could become the vehicle for any major new initiative the president might make but they said mr bush was convinced by his visits to los angeles and other troubled cities in recent days that no fundamental change of direction was needed instead , mr bush plans to stick to the proposals he now has on capitol hill he says they have been ignored by congress and should be given a chance before new legislation is considered landing in the middle thus an internal debate over the scale and content of mr bush s public reaction to the rioting after the verdict in the rodney g king beating case has been resolved in favor of middleoftheroad oratory , with a bent toward themes of law and order it is this line that mr bush has been delivering in his public appearances since the riots , and aides say there is no reason to expect the president to go further despite continued protests by housing secretary jack f kemp , who has started to talk of a need to spend more money than the administration has proposed , officials said , the white house debate was dominated by the budget director , richard g darman , and by mr bush s insistence on holding to the 1992 budget agreement , which permits no increase in the deficit everybody is together on the basic equation that we have the new programs and we just need to get implementation , said marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman he was referring to mr bush s proposals to create enterprise zones in urban areas , press for welfare and education change and use new spending to root out drug dealers and seed neighborhoods with social services there s not a search on for some magic new formula , or a wand that can be waved to right these problems , mr fitzwater said two or three years of work went into the development of our programs the way they are , and our emphasis is on getting congress to act on them our whole focus is on the legislative side no single voice the clarity mr fitzwater described within the white house is blurred by the administration s lingering difficulty in finding a single voice to speak to congress and the public mr bush , mr fitzwater and other officials have veered between conciliatory words toward democrats and sharp accusations that the democratic welfare programs of the 1960 s led to the riots moreover , administration officials and outside advisers said there was no strong hand in the white house to mediate the views represented by mr kemp and mr darman , leaving the two officials clashing in private and increasingly in public as well at a breakfast meeting with reporters on friday , mr kemp took an undisguised swipe at mr darman , saying that helping the cities would eventually cost billions more than the administration now envisioned i'm not a bean counter i'm not the director of omb , mr kemp said i'm not going to engage in singleentry bookkeeping behind the policy debate are complex political imperatives for mr bush , the violence in los angeles produced an unexpected and potentially damaging threat just when his campaign staff thought it was finally starting to reverse his political plunge debate on republican policy while the bush camp has tried to keep public attention on the shortcomings of democraticinspired welfare programs , the riots have also begun to produce a debate about 13 years of republican supplyside economics , policies that mr bush ridiculed in 1980 but on which he has long since staked his political fortunes we left people behind , mr kemp said friday any economy that moves forward has to go back and bring its weakest elements behind , or it loses its soul it loses its moral example campaign officials said their planning was focusing on how to meet the clear need to address urban issues without allowing that debate to drown out the president s message on other issues , including the lawandorder themes so important to conservative supporters and the foreign policy questions that mr bush s advisers say they must exploit to defeat his challengers white house and campaign officials said that under these pressures mr bush did not have time to craft a significantly new approach to urban affairs so they seized on his existing proposals as a way of responding to the riots that was , they said , both politically responsive and responsible from a policy viewpoint the bottom line is that you have to produce , one official said we put something on the table , and it s good momentum it remains to be seen whether mr bush is genuinely committed to new approaches to urban problems , as the president and his advisers insist , or whether the white house is simply going through the motions , hoping that attention will soon shift to other issues stuart m butler , director of domestic policy studies for the heritage foundation , said this would be tested in large measure by the amount of political capital mr bush chose to expend on his legislative program he does n't suddenly have to become a bornagain innercity grassroots urban leader , mr butler said nobody would believe that but he has to say , 'i'm behind this , ' and he has to be there saying , 'i'm not going to pull the rug out from under kemp at the last minute' every time kemp has gone to push major proposals , in the past , the white house has been missing in action
if you had asked a bridge historian a year ago to name the strongest pairs tournament of all time , in average quality , he would have been puzzled now , however , he would surely point to the cap gemini pandata , played in the netherlands in january 1991 included in the field of 16 pairs were four pairs who have won bunches of world titles bob hamman and bob wolff , chip martel and lew stansby , jeff meckstroth and eric rodwell , all from the united states , and gabriel chagas and marcelo branco from brazil and almost all the other pairs were of comparable quality none of these four pairs were able to win , however the top honors went to bill eisenberg of los angeles and benito garozzo , formerly a star member of the italian blue team and now living in palm beach , fla two of the players succeeded in threading their way through a minefield on the diagramed deal , playing in four spades a heart was led to the ace and a club was returned west took the king with the ace and returned the suit , so that south ruffed east s queen south led a trump , collecting the king with the ace , and cashed the queen playing another trump at this point would be an error , and south correctly cashed one club winner , throwing a diamond , and played the diamond ace a diamond ruff and a heart ruff left this ending diagram east was helpless when the club ten was led from the dummy if he ruffed low south would overruff and lead hearts if he ruffed high he had to lead from the diamond queen or permit south to take the remaining tricks in his hand and if he refused to ruff at all , diamond plays from the dummy would allow the spade ten to score en passant diagram

based on a biotechnology that molds quasiliving plasm into ingenious devices that function pretty much as metal and plastic machines once did old people who die , at least among the confessors , are gradually assimilated into a kind of vegetative consciousness in what are known as ancestor groves but although the inhabitants of this land have learned to manipulate dna at a molecular level , they have made no progress whatever in understanding one another police actions and pogroms , concentration camps and refugees , corrupt officials and coldhearted rebels are daily facts of life in a comfortless world that we view through the eyes of the indomitable mathembe , a young girl who never speaks mr mcdonald works hard to render this imaginary world in all its particulars we are spared none of the sights and sounds and smells of degradation even when the prose strains for effects beyond its means , we respect the impulse that drives the author to repetition , to overwriting , to a bombast that insists on the allegorical dimension of mathembe s suffering but it is precisely as allegory that the broken land fails in the end the very abundance of detail that brings ma thembe s world to life the futuristic technology , the exotic customs , the intricacies of the political and religious situation works against the clarity of response that allegory demands this becomes apparent in the final chapters , when humanity s problems are suddenly solved by a technological breakthrough , a viral love plague that fosters telepathic intimacy while leaving people incapable of violent aggression what makes this miraculous creed different from all others , we are told without a trace of irony , is that it requires no exercise of faith mr mcdonald apparently intended the broken land as a cautionary tale , a generic nineteen eightyfour for the last decade of the 20th century but having suffered with mathembe , i found myself resenting the suggestion that her wounds , and those of her world , could be healed by a wave of the author s sciencefictional wand since nothing in the book has prepared us for this upbeat ending , it comes across as a counsel of despair if this is what is takes to save us , we are in fact doomed time , like an everrolling stream \( st martin s , 2195 \) , by judith moffett , is candidly billed as a sequel to the ragged world a novel of the hefn on earth , ms moffett s earlier tale of eccentric humans and even more eccentric aliens thanks to some adroitly handled introductory matter , the new book stands on its own as a narrative more to the point , it breaks new ground in the successful integration of science fiction and the mainstream novel the theme , as before , is ecological the hefn , who bear a deceptive resemblance to such furry little mythical creatures as hobbits , have taken firm control of the earth in order to keep humans from irreparably damaging the environment only sustainable technology , such as the production of electricity from wind , water and solar power , is permitted , and a corps of bright young humans has been recruited to preach the gospel of interdependence with nature not without some resistance from diehards who resent being told what to do by ecofreaks , either homegrown or extraterrestrial the story also involves time travel and an attempt to prove that the planet is girdled by magnetic currents that intersect at nodes where early mystics located their holy places what makes ms moffett s work so unusual is that instead of centering her narrative on these plot elements , she presents them as footnotes to a very different kind of story the coming of age of a gifted but emotionally arrested young woman named pam pruitt the bulk of the book is an autobiographical manuscript that pam sends to her closest friend , liam , who like her is a protege of the hefn the manuscript deals with events that are crucial to the earth s future but pam s motives for writing it , and for sending it to liam , are essentially personal although she feels sure that it contains everything important about what was happening in my family during the time i was growing a woman s body , selfknowledge eludes her and she asks liam to help her gain the insights that will ease her anxiety and dread the result is a complex narrative that has as much to say about pam s menstrual cramps and her tense relationship with her father as it does about what humans must learn to avoid following the dinosaur into oblivion if you think that there is no connection between personal and planetary salvation , it is ms moffett s business to persuade you otherwise kipling s science fiction \( tor tom doherty , 1795 \) is an edifying collection of short stories by rudyard kipling , selected , introduced and annotated by the british science fiction writer john brunner kipling , who was awarded the nobel prize in literature in 1907 , was first and foremost a storyteller born in india in 1865 , he achieved fame in his early 20 s as a chronicler of the british empire at the peak of its power the most intriguing stories in this collection show him trying to make sense of the technological marvels of the industrial revolution in the ship that found herself \( 1898 \) he describes the shakedown cruise of a new cargo steamer in heavy seas by imagining a spirited dialogue among the various parts of the ship 'ease off ! ease off , there ! ' roared the garboardstrake 'ease off ! ' shouted the forward collisionbulkhead 'pull any way you please , ' roared the funnel a little of this goes a long way , but when kipling resolves the dialogue by having the querulous voices coalesce into the strong single voice of the ship itself , the sense of exhilaration is palpable in wireless published in 1904 , five years before guglielmo marconi received the nobel prize for his invention of wireless telegraphy kipling imagines the longdistance transmission of thought waves , not just through space but through time as well with the night mail \( 1909 \) is a vigorously detailed celebration of the skill and courage of the captains who pilot the lighterthanair ships that knit together the global economy of the year 2000 the undercurrent of manly selfsatisfaction that drives this story surfaces in as easy as abc \( 1917 \) , which contrasts the noblesse oblige of the benevolent dictators of a technocratic future with the whiny complaints of a band of democratic troublemakers however distasteful the political sentiments may be , these stories show that kipling , like his contemporary h g wells , had mastered the fundamental technique of modern science fiction writing about an imagined future as if it were an already familiar present

richard m nixon has told officials in la habra , calif , that if they want to tear down his former law office there , he will not stand in the way of the wrecking ball but like much else about the former president , the dispute seems likely to linger in a letter to mayor james flora , mr nixon broke his long silence in the dispute , which for the last four years has divided politicians from preservationists and admirers of the 37th president at issue is the fate of a decrepit , seismically suspect brick building in the center of la habra , a city of 52 , 000 people in orange county , midway between yorba linda and whittier while i am deeply gratified by the efforts a number of my friends have made over the years to preserve the office i used in la habra as a young attorney , i do not believe that the historical value is sufficient that it should be permitted to stand in the way of whatever alternative plans the city has for the property , mr nixon wrote in the letter , dated july 22 unsafe and unimportant lee risner , la habra s city manager , said the letter should put to rest any lingering question about the historic importance of the building , where mr nixon practiced law until 1942 mr risner and other city officials hope to raze the office and several adjacent structures and replace them with a community center they say the building is only unsafe and historically unimportant efforts to preserve the office began in the early 1970 s , but were derailed by the watergate scandal in the years since mr nixon s resignation in 1974 , the building has enjoyed none of the refurbishment that mr nixon himself has it is now cordoned off behind a chainlink fence , intended to keep homeless people out i think he saw the situation exactly as it was that this was not a historically significant portion of his life , mr risner said once some minor obstacles are removed , he added , demolition can begin , probably around oct 1 opposition to continue but preservationists , who seek to turn the old law office into a museum , say they will carry on their efforts to save the building they contend that mr risner has mischaracterized local sentiments of the dispute , erroneously suggesting that a majority of townspeople support demolition , and that the former president was among those who has been misled the president sees himself as an elder statesman now , which we all agree with , and i do n't think he wants to see himself become embroiled in a local issue , said kent a roberts , a local businessman whose father played football with the young mr nixon mr risner , who has called the old office and adjacent buildings a cancer in the center of town , said he did not fear legal action from the preservationists they can try and sue us , he said if they do , they 'll lose
on two straight days , for two very different reasons , michael jordan had the same extraordinary look on his very famous face it was not the look of radiant confidence you see on the wheaties box , or the brimming confidence portrayed in one of his softdrink commercials , or even the cool superiority witnessed at the ends of most games this was none of those this was a look of utter disbelief on saturday afternoon in the second period , jordan , the flying man , broke away and was all alone from halfcourt on and went up to slam in the mother of all slam dunks , and missed ! unheard of ! the ball rebounded past half court it was like nureyev doing a twirl and landing in the orchestra like houdini not being able to pick the locks on the box that contained him underwater like the genie finding he was all out of magic carpets it was a look of shock the poor man was stunned last night , there was that look again , and it came with 194 seconds to go in the game anthony mason had just pulled down an offensive rebound one of thousands of offensive rebounds , it surely seemed to the bulls , that the knicks had grabbed and he stepped to the line to make a free throw that gave the knicks an 8point lead , 9284 jordan knew the case was closed before the second half began on saturday , spike lee , the film director who was seated at courtside , said to jordan , i was shocked at that jam you saw my face , said jordan , sheepishly same face last night it meant the playoff series was tied at 22 , and that the bulls , as jordan would say after the game , are in a battle i know some people expected us to sweep the knicks , he said , but we knew it probably would n't go that way we knew the knicks were tough they beat detroit we did n't underestimate them somehow that met with some disbelief , too the knicks had been in a virtual shambles at season s end , although they seemed to regroup in the first round of the playoffs to beat a fading and looseends pistons team the bulls , meanwhile , had won 67 games , one of the best records in nba history they were the defending champions they had just knocked off miami in three straight in the first round of the playoffs and why should n't they do likewise to new york , a team obviously less talented , less cohesive and less experienced than the bulls and then go sailing right through to the finals , and beyond what they did n't quite figure on was the muscle of the knicks the bulls are taking a battering under the boards the numbers that most influenced the numbers on the scoreboard were these 52 rebounds for the knicks , and 33 for the bulls 20 offensive rebounds for the knicks , and 12 for the bulls it was n't a basketball game , said jim cleamons , the assistant who took over the bulls when phil jackson was ejected from the game in the third period it was a mugging but then the whole series has been that way it was the roughest basketball i 've ever experienced , said scott williams , a bulls forward it was forearms , hips , hands in the back anything for position in the lane it was like they say in wrestling no holds barred but if these are the rules according to the referees now , then we 've got to learn to play by them once upon a time in the basketball playoffs , height was a determining factor now it is biceps the backcourt is comprised of running backs the center is the middle linebacker the forwards block for everybody intimidation is a factor before saturday s game , scottie pippen of the bulls stood outside his locker room when a man wearing a knick jersey with no 34 happened by i'm goin' to the hole today , said pippen , to his old friend and onetime teammate you ai n't goin' to no hole , said charles oakley that s why 34 s in the game thirtyfour s got but six fouls to give like anybody else , explained pippen on saturday , pippen did go to the hole , or penetrated to the basket , to translate basketball trashing , and the bulls went up 21 in the series but he did not do much yesterday it was n't just oakley who closed the hole to him , and to jordan and horace grant , among others , but xavier mcdaniel and patrick ewing and mason , among others now , as it is said , it is down to a bestofthree series , with the bulls getting the first and , if necessary , third games in their earsplitting home arena teams are supposed to win at home this is wisdom of the ages but the knicks seem not to have paid attention to some of their lessons maybe they were on lunch break they did n't let the pistons beat them up , but instead gave them welt for welt , and they did not collapse with awe at the sight of the rings on the fingers of the bulls not only have the knicks outrebounded and outpummeled the bulls , but they 've also outhustled them , with players like jackson and starks and anthony diving around the court like pete rose going into second base the ball , jordan said last evening , just bounced away from us we were n't getting the loose balls the knicks , however , had something to do with this , which , like that ball that was n't slamdunked saturday , was the true cause for the look of complete astonishment on michael jordan s famous face
virginia beach , va finding inner peace , strengthening his left knee and recapturing his stature as one of pro football s most dominating defensive players are not easy for bruce smith after the season he endured last year but smith has found a perfect way to start each morning and on most afternoons he hops onto his waverunner , a motorcycle on water , and from the dock behind his sprawling home here he zooms down the bay and out of sight , leaving the pressures and doubts about his career and those of the buffalo bills behind for a few moments there is the basketball player j r reid s home around the first curve , and the singerproducer teddy riley s home is a little farther up the coast sailboats and other waverunners like smith s pass him by once , i flipped over , smith said , laughing this big boat flew past me and i lost it but i can handle it out there this has become one of my favorite pastimes it s a different world out there yes , smith believes he can handle the roughest waters , especially in the national football league no doubt , he has before , and he will again , he said , as he approaches his eighth pro season after a year complete with surgery on his left knee before and after the 1991 season , after a year in which he played in only five regularseason games \( missing 11 \) and a year capped by the washington redskins' throttling of the bills in super bowl xxvi , smith firmly believes that not only he but the bills , too will bounce back in 1992 even stronger nobody wants it as bad as i want it , smith said there is not a team in this league that man for man has the players we have we are far from done the only way we can fall flat is if we just do n't care , and we are as far from that as i am becoming the pope we can get a third straight chance at the super bowl all we have to do is remain focused for the buffalo bills , that is no easy task people have asked me , said bills coach marv levy , what it is that we need most in personnel , from the draft and from other things the no 1 thing that this football team needs is a healthy bruce smith a healthy bruce smith is priority no 1 other than that , we 've got to think of ourselves as a piece of fruit that is yet to ripen because once fruit gets ripe , it starts to get rotten just where is the bills' psyche after joining minnesota and denver as the only teams to have lost consecutive super bowls \? they are through , many in the nfl believe some of the players are immature and childish , critics offer , and think of themselves as hollywood actors forced to play on stage in buffalo where the lights are not quite as bright and the attention and praise too little for them they fall over themselves clamoring for more attention , and smith , after the second knee surgery , may never be the same powerful defensive end , many believe they simply do n't have enough muscle on defense , others say , and teams in 1992 will catch on to ways to crunch their nohuddle , offensive attack smith listens and laughs injury started problems his first surgery on the knee , however , was no laughing matter smith said that late in the 1990 season when buffalo played at the giants and when smith was en route to numerous honors and the bills were en route to losing super bowl xxv by a narrowly missed field goal to the giants his left knee had begun to give him trouble that day at giants stadium , the knee was swelling and it gave me problems through the rest of the season , smith said that next april i was told by doctors that if i had surgery on the knee that i would not be ready for the '91 season so , since i had played on it before and had been effective , i decided against the surgery then when i got to training camp last year and ran on it , i could n't believe it the knee swelled as big as my thigh i had the surgery in late july and the doctors said it would take at least eight weeks to heal smith was back for the bills' fifth game , on sept 29 against chicago ralph wilson , the bills' owner , had said that he did not want smith on the field until he was ready we all heard what mr wilson said , but none of us really comprehended it , including me , smith said there was no way i should have been out there lord knows if i only knew then what i know now production tails off smith s sacks dropped from 19 , the best in the american football conference in 1990 , to one and a half in 1991 , and his tackles were down from 101 to 18 he never regained his timing last season and his mobility was hampered last march 9 , smith underwent the second surgery , this time to remove four bone chips in the knee smith said the problem with the first surgery was that the muscle just above the knee was not strengthened properly it was only at 40 percent strength all of last season , he said and that allowed the knee to move too freely and for the chips to surface now smith said there is no pain he rides a bike , walks fast on his treadmill and runs in the swimming pool as part of the exercises to strengthen the muscle and the knee when the bills open training camp on july 23 in fredonia , ny , smith hopes he can run at nearly full speed
the white house professes shock and sorrow at evidence that ross perot likes to snoop around in people s lives likes to have people believe it or not investigated it makes you wonder what world the white house has been living in lately surely president bush knows his own vast investigating empire makes inspector perot look like a bushleague sam spade or maybe it was philip marlowe , maybe humphrey bogart , with the battered old heap , bottle of booze in the desk drawer and bills for 25 a day and expenses remember those awful beatings spade , marlowe , bogart took for a lousy 25 a day and expenses \? that s the investigating weight class perot belongs in when compared with george bush it s bush who has all the guns , yet he professes alarm about snooper perot investigating people , ross \? shame shame is n't this the same george bush who , in one of his previous government jobs , ran the cia , america s multibilliondollar snoop to the whole darn world \? dear mr president , sir , know thyself the fbi is yours too the fbi keeper of the dossiers , eavesdropper extraordinaire , the agency that entertained presidents with steamy recordings its agents had made with equipment hidden in martin luther king s bedrooms ho , ho , ho what a good time was had by vital government men listening to those tapes that was before your time , of course everything clean as a hound s tooth over at fbi these days would n't snoop on anybody now still , it could it still has what pentagon mushmouth speech would call powerful snoop capability then there s the irs , whose mission is to plumb the private life of all america no 25aday limit on those babies none of those awful beatings like bogart and company had to take either nowadays it s the irs that dishes out the punishment , puts the boot into your ribs takes your car , takes your house , takes your pants you can keep the wife and kids the irs has treasury zillions , and computers galore instead of battered old heaps , not to mention officially licensed , collegecertified snoopers who come right into your house and sit there for a week going through a fiveyear supply of your bankbooks because some infallible machine or some joker or maybe some government twit who wanted to teach you a good lesson told them your measly salaried job is actually a cover under which you 're running an international smuggling ring i could run on about governments' thousand investigating arms , but it would be misleading to suggest that invading privacy is a purely governmental sport in a newspaper it would be outrageous hypocrisy , because what are newspapers up to when dishing out tales about kennedys , congressmen s banking habits , elizabeth taylor s weights and marriages , and and , well , all those tons of invadedprivacy material we provide you you , of course , would n't have joined the vital men having such a hohoho good time listening to fbi tapes hot from the m l king boudoir you are too civilized so why do you read the fruits of our daily invasions of the privacy of kennedys , clintons , bushes , perots , liz taylors , madonnas , warren beattys \? you do n't , of course it s other people who read that shameful rot another way to put it is to say that those other people have resigned themselves to the modern reality no sensible american nowadays believes his life is anything but an open book for browsing by any snooper with the energy to work the fantastic engines of exposure now operating shamelessly throughout the land example telephone a catalogsales company chances are you 'll be asked for your telephone number , then be told what your full name and address are , and asked if that is correct they could tell you your age and credit rating , too , and what your house cost , the latest medical report on your kidneys , what your sexual preferences are , how many children and inlaws you have , whether you prefer coffee , tea or milk , and lots more these things they wo n't tell you , of course such information is privately held and given only to people who want to use it against you it s shameful of the white house to try to make us think perot threatens our privacy it s impossible to threaten our privacy everything is already known

woman of valor margaret sanger and the birth control movement in america by ellen chesler illustrated 639 pages simon schuster 2750 if he makes time to read 600plus page books , vice president j danforth quayle could find plenty of ammunition in ellen chesler s woman of valor for his marching orders to new yorkers and other american miscreants who are n't paying attention to his lectures about family values ms chesler s biography of margaret sanger , whose personal life was not exactly circumspect and who pioneered the rights of birth control for women from the united states to japan , shows that the same censorious forces that exist today against feminism , contraception and abortion were at work , even more aggressively , in the first third of this century among the harshest critics of sanger s writings about sexuality and reproduction was none other than anthony comstock , the leader of the new york society for the suppression of vice , whose bluenosed indignation against moral pollution and pornography led to vaguely defined federal and state obscenity statutes in outspoken newspaper columns intended to educate women , sanger challenged comstock and the comstock laws ms chesler , a historian with experience in municipal government , writes that by insisting on exercising her first amendment rights about the open discussion of sexuality and contraception , sanger changed the social discourse of her times and of our own margaret higgins s first marriage , in 1902 to william sanger , an architect , introduced her to a world of cultural and radical ferment the generation that had come of age in the new century felt an obligation to redefine themselves and the country she had studied to become a nurse later , she combined her knowledge of health care with the socialist movement the sangers joined socialist party local 5 in new york city in 1911 , and william ran for alderman they were active during the movement s heyday under the leadership of eugene v debs the attractive young couple , ms chesler writes , became favored comrades , and to their uptown parlor flocked the leading young rebels and scoffers of the day , distinctions among them counting far less for the moment than their common vision of a better world for all among the powerful visitors to the sanger home were journalists , anarchists , wobblies , trade unionists , including john reed , walter lippmann , big bill haywood and emma goldman , whose brash manners margaret never forgave , even as she absorbed her forceful doctrines of radicalism and feminism the socialist party embraced the cause of women s suffrage as an organizing tool margaret sanger was hired to promote the vote for women , but she viewed this effort as a low priority in the larger struggle of women for economic and social justice working part time with lillian wald s visiting nurses association on the lower east side , she was exposed to the ignorance about birth control and the social pathos of poverty in 1916 , sanger opened the first birthcontrol clinic in the united states , behind the curtained windows of a storefront tenement on amboy street in brownsville , brooklyn handbills were distributed to promote the benefits of contraception over abortion she had seen women die after selfinduced abortions without open and legal medical assistance after several weeks , the police raided the clinic , sanger was jailed and the clinic was closed in this carefully documented book , ms chesler reports that the clinic had served 464 recorded clients sanger continued her efforts in lectures , writings and conferences held in the united states , great britain , india and japan in 1921 , she organized the first american birthcontrol conference at the plaza hotel in manhattan , with a list of sponsors that included winston churchill and theodore dreiser that conference established her as the country s leading spokeswoman for birth control prominent women and women s organizations joined her campaigns before her husband was nominated to be president , eleanor roosevelt served on the board of the american birthcontrol league members of the rockefeller family became major supporters of margaret sanger s birthcontrol clinical research bureau at the same time sanger devoted her professional life to birth control , her personal life took a different course before and after her first marriage unraveled , she followed her own advice about a fulfilled sex life for women she had many lovers , including h g wells and havelock ellis the affairs are described from a feminist viewpoint that would not shock the newsstand readers of cover lines in cosmopolitan magazine she did n't stop her relationships after a second marriage , to noah slee , a millionaire sanger , who died in 1966 at the age of 87 , had the comfort of knowing that the united states supreme court had made its historic 1965 decision in griswold v connecticut , which gave constitutional protection to the private use of contraceptives since her death the rebirth of a vigorous feminist movement has given new resonance to her original claim that women have a fundamental right to control their own bodies , ms chesler writes woman of valor is especially timely during this bizarre presidential election season when abortion rights and murphy brown s motherhood are flagwaving issues ms chesler delivers a scholarly , though heavy , contribution to the debate in her biography of a strongwilled woman who challenged the moral police and the mores of her time photo

prague jan kavan depicts himself as the ultimate kafkaesque victim he went to sleep one february evening last year a revered anticommunist dissident and woke up reviled as a secret police informant members of the czechoslovak parliament who investigated mr kavan , and who are demanding that he withdraw from public life tell a radically different story they insist that he knowingly cooperated with the hated secret police while a student in britain in 1969 and 1970 and that he is now waging an unjustified international campaign to clear his name , seriously harming czechoslovakia s reputation in the process the conflict encapsulates the wrenching problems that confront formerly communist nations as they try to separate the heroes from the villains , with records left by the most deceptive branches of the old regime the campaign is being waged with particular intensity in czechoslovakia 'highly politicized' this thing is used as political means to get rid of your real or potential opposition , mr kavan said , contesting each damaging sentence in his file that s my main objection to this whole screening procedure it became highly politicized no one is even pretending they 're looking for major individuals who committed crimes , who sent people to jail , who ran this country the main attacks in this country are now against me yet even our opponents agree that if it s true what the file says about me , then i'm a very small fish indeed who , 23 years ago , gave some information concerning a few czechoslovak students i say it s a lie however , even if i accept the premises , what the hell are they talking about \? key parts of mr kavan s 500page secret police file have been leaked to local newspapers , although other parts were mysteriously shredded in may 1989 , shortly before the collapse of the communist order mr kavan has adamantly refused to concede guilt or leave parliament , although he said he would not run for reelection this june some leading dissidents have signed public letters of support for mr kavan others are pointedly raising the question of hypocrisy , noting that today s fierce anticommunists were not nearly so brave when the country was in the iron grip of the old regime many jailed by the communists argue that czechoslovakia s velvet revolution has , like the french revolution , traveled from reformist enthusiasm to radical dogma and is now consuming its own children supporters of the screening process insist that they are simply removing from public trust people vulnerable to blackmail they say they are responding to a wave of public anger over former communists who kept their posts in government and industry there are two separate processes for screening in czechoslovakia a parliamentary commission has studied the records of legislators and last year gave those accused of collaboration a chance to resign quietly or have their names publicly read out several resigned , but others , including mr kavan , decided to fight separately , czechoslovakia approved a law that for five years bars senior communists and the more than 140 , 000 people on the registers of informants from holding high posts in government and staterun industry the statute draws no distinctions between those who cooperated fleetingly and those who collaborated for years the czechoslovak interior ministry declined to disclose how many people have lost their jobs among the opponents of the law is president vaclav havel , who reluctantly signed the measure and then immediately proposed amendments mr havel said he supports the removal of agents or former communists who harmed people s civil rights , but argues that it must be done case by case , not collectively other countries are considering similar measures , but none have gone as far hungary s law rolling back the statute of limitations was recently thrown out by a constitutional court poland has been less enthusiastic about debolshevisation the kavan case began in 1969 , a year after the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia mr kavan , a 20yearold student , was on his way to oxford and was arrested at the airport his scholarship grant was confiscated the secret police frequently used this tactic to pressure people into becoming informants shortly after his arrest , a secret police officer posing as an official from another department approached mr kavan and offered to resolve his problems when mr kavan arrived in london he was the subject of the friendly attentions of a mr zajicek , a czechoslovak diplomat whose cover was a post as education attache the name was an alias in fact , mr zajicek was a secret agent 10 meetings acknowledged mr kavan acknowledges conversations with mr zajicek , but insists that he was never aware they were being reported to the interior ministry or that he had been given the code name kato he said mr zajicek presented himself as a hidden supporter of the communist party reformers whose socialism with a human face led to the 1968 soviet invasion mr kavan says he met the diplomat about 10 times in 1969 and early 1970 the 40 meetings described in the files , mr kavan insists , reflect the diplomat s practice of writing three reports for every session kato fulfills his task conscientiously and willingly , reads one march 9 , 1970 , report quoted in the czech magazine respekt its authenticity was confirmed by mr kavan by his own cooperation , kato is compromised , the document said this compromise stems not only from the documents he handed over and the reports in his own hand but also a letter to deputy minister of interior dr kubik in which he demanded legalization of his stay and hinted at his willingness to cooperate mr kavan dismissed this as puffery by secret service officials he said this particular document was written by analysts in prague who had misread mr zajicek s reports no way to stop mr kavan said he never thought again about his meetings with mr zajicek until feb 21 of last year , when the parliamentary commission told him to resign or be exposed mr kavan acknowledged that screening has acquired a momentum of its own now that it s started , i do n't think we can just stop , draw a thick line , and say , 'forget it all' it s too late the only way out , and i say with a heavy heart and no great conviction , the only way out is to improve the legislation , to introduce a presumption of innocence , introduce individual evaluation , even it means taking a long time and clogging the courts photo the main attacks in this country are now against me , said jan kavan , who is under investigation by the czechoslovak parliament for cooperating with the secret police while he was a student in britain in 1969 and 1970 mr kavan defended himself in parliament in march \( asociated press \)
for at least a decade , the roiling debate over garbage disposal in new york city has been portrayed mostly as a bitter fight about building an incinerator but the truly radical part of the plan approved by the city council this week has nothing to do with burning trash and everything to do with recycling it for if new york city actually reaches its ambitious new goals , it will have by far the most aggressive recycling program in the united states , changing the daily habits of almost everyone who lives or works here but at least one crucial question remains will it ever really happen \? an abysmal failure it is an understandable worry in a city that has pledged its commitment to recycling before and failed dismally it has been three years since the council passed the city s first recycling law , a program many rejoiced in but most environmentalists and city officials now agree it floundered about as badly as such a plan ever has in part because of anemic financing , but also because the city never put a uniform policy in place brooklyn s program , for example , was nothing like staten island s , or manhattan s in fact , brooklyn did not have a single program at all some residents sorted all their trash for recycling others sorted none often the differences were apparent on the same city block at least on paper , all that has now changed proponents argue that what could not possibly succeed in a haphazard way on a small scale could easily work when it is applied to every household in the city scale is everything in this kind of program , said john schall , a visiting professor at yale university and the lead consultant on the city s new solidwaste management plan and this will have the biggest scale you ever saw in one stroke you will be able to educate everyone the same way , and you will send a strong message to mills and recycling plants that new york has resources that no other city can possible compete with that can turn this city into the world center of recycling within a year , city officials promise , the recycling effort now an uneven collection of programs in 29 of new york s 59 sanitation districts will be essentially one program reaching into every neighborhood by september 1993 , city residents will be required to sort six types of materials into two different batches newspapers , magazines and corrugated cardboard in one bundle , metal , glass and plastics in another the blue garbage cans that are now used for recycling will no longer be distributed , although anyone who has one can continue using it other people will be able to buy blue plastic bags at the store or ask the city for a blue sticker to place on a regular trash can taking apart the garbage food waste will be collected separately in small programs in each borough if that works well , the city will try to make it uniform and by 1995 , each new yorker will be required to include 25 different materials textiles , mixed papers and batteries for example in recycling bins a new generation of garbage trucks will collect recyclable material , placing paper in one part of the truck , metals , plastic and glass in another and food waste in yet a third pickup schedules will vary but for skeptics who say they have heard all this before , the city will have to move fast to prove that this time it means what it says to the degree that they perceive money as a sign of the program s success , recycling advocates are already cooing the last time a plan was approved by the council public law 19 , in 1989 less than 35 million in capital funds was appropriated for the entire city and as soon as the fiscal crisis arrived , even that almost disappeared the new plan calls for the city to spend up to 300 million on recycling by 1996 , the year it plans to begin construction on an incinerator at the brooklyn navy yard the financial commitment along with the political muscle of a newly powerful city council that has supported this plan overwhelmingly should be enough to draw the mills and plants that are needed to process the recyclable materials and then put them to use companies that refine the materials and those that buy them are crucial to the plan s success problems pile up but driven by necessity with its landfill capacity shrinking , other states threatening to limit garbage exports and little willingness to build new incinerators new york has few other options and as soon as the 28 , 000 tons of trash new york generates each day can be regarded as a commodity instead of a nuisance , recycling s success is assured it will not be easy to transform garbage dumps into mines of urban ore in most people s minds , of course but it did not seem easy to convince tens of millions of americans to give up smoking or cut their beef consumption in half , either yet , over the last 20 years , they have been persuaded when it comes to social change i believe in three big things timing , timing and timing , said the city s sanitation commissioner , emily lloyd , who has spent most of her time since her appointment in february negotiating the new waste plan and the time has finally come for recycling to work in new york but even she knows the going will be rough apartment dwellers will have to separate their trash , then rely on their superintendents not to mess up the neat bundles the city is about to begin a series of programs to train supers , and it will focus special attention on the biggest , most crowded apartment complexes , but it will take a major change in behavior to make the program work in such residences if all else fails , the city will fine violators up to 200 a punishment that is rarely used now and the success of the program will depend on dozens of technical decisions that the sanitation department will have to make soon what kind of trucks should they buy , and how soon can they get them \? will they give up using cans and switch completely to bags as many have advocated or will they stick with a system that requires truck drivers to empty cans and return them to the street \? will the department devote its top officials' time to planning the broadening program , or will they instead spend be preparing the groundwork for the construction of the new 450 million incinerator in brooklyn \? the forces all seem to be moving in the right direction , said eric a goldstein , a senior attorney at the natural resources defense council , who has lobbied vigorously for increased recycling over the last decade in new york city but we have been down this road before so i would hold onto the champagne for a while chart at a glance recycling when it is scheduled recycling is in effect in 29 of the city s 59 community districts , including all of staten island boroughwide efforts will begin in manhattan on sept 14 bronx on dec 1 brooklyn in june 1993 and queens on sept 1993 the recyclable material will be picked up once a week pickup days will be announced how to separate trash newspapers , magazines and corrugated cardboard boxes must be tied into bundles no more than 18 inches high glass , metal and plastic containers , aluminum foil and foil products must be rinsed and placed together in a recycling container depositrefund bottles and cans should be returned to the store violations rules will be enforced by the sanitation police violators will be issued warnings for the first six months of the program owners and residents who do not recycle are subject to a fine the first 25 the second 50 , the third , 100 owners of buildings with nine or more units receiving four violations within a sixmonth period will be fined 500 per bag \( pg 24 \)

a group of former worldclass shooters is challenging the national rifle association as the governing body for sport shooting in the united states , contending that the nra has too much power , so much that all competitive shooters , including those who reach the olympics , must be nra members today in chicago , a twoyear fight for control of the sport will reach a critical point , when the nra plans to ask the united states olympic committee to approve a charter that defines the nra s role as the national governing body included in the proposal is an expanded role for athletes , coaches and others and the elimination of mandatory nra membership for athletes but the request is being challenged by four former shooters who are concerned that the nra , as an influential lobbying organization with a fixed political agenda , still has too much control , thus inhibiting the growth of the sport the four are supported by a petition signed by 342 other current and former shooters the four contend that even revised guidelines from the nra , which historically has served as the governing body , still leave the nra in violation of federal law the amateur sports act of 1978 requires that all national governing bodies be free of outside control and that athletes have no less than 20 percent representation in voting power we want them to be like every other national governing body , said p kent correll , a lawyer representing the four shooters we do n't want them distracted by political interests we want them solely focused on the development of the sport the possibility that the nra has not been complying with the amateur sports act of 1978 was first raised before the usoc membership committee in 1990 and brought to the attention of the nra over the next 18 months , an nra task force developed and refined a charter for its international competitions committee , the branch of the nra that serves as the governing body for shooting sports the nra is asking the usoc membership committee to approve that charter today we really feel we have satisfied their concerns , gary anderson , the icc executive director and a former olympic shooter , said yesterday possibility of greater success \? the united states has performed well in olympic shooting , which now includes seven events for men , four for women and two in which both compete since the modern olympics began in 1896 , only five other sports in the summer olympics track and field , swimming , diving , boxing and wrestling have produced more medals by american athletes but in recent years , a growing number of shooters have begun wondering if the level of success would improve if the nra s role were muted the nra is a politically conservative organization that opposes any form of gun control in the united states and actively lobbies for its position among the other 40 national governing bodies within the usoc , none has any direct affiliation with a political action committee , although such affiliations are not specifically prohibited the athletes are particularly concerned about the structure of the icc , which , in their view , keeps the nra in the position of power the proposed composition of the icc , approximately 31 people , includes 10 from athlete elections , 7 directly appointed by the nra leadership and the rest from other organizations , some of which are affiliated with the nra , like the amateur trap shooting association and the national skeet shooting association anderson pointed out that with the proposed composition , the nra has relaxed its hold on the icc until now , nearly all members , including the chairman , were nra appointments the new charter also amends the requirement that anyone who competes in a sanctioned event must first join the nra jay waldron , a 26yearold international level shooter as a shotgun specialist , said he joined the nra 13 years ago only because he wanted to compete as a junior if i did n't join , waldron said , i could n't shoot the new guidelines would give athletes the alternative to pay a registration fee , equal to the sum of membership dues but those who question the new charter still see the nra in control of the larger agendas , through the direct appointments to the icc and the appointments from the affiliated organizations also , skeptics do not feel the new means of selecting a chairman by vote from a list of three people recommended by the icc represents much change and they object to the fact that the nra board of directors would still control the icc budget the icc charter still does things we do n't want , said ernest vande zande of vancouver , wash , shooting s athlete representative to the usoc and one of the four shooters challenging the nra if they think we should be different from any other olympic sport , they 're wrong the athletes challenging the charter are also concerned about blurring of the lines between the nra s political activities and its olympic development programs , which funnel athletes from the grassroots level to the 26member olympic team for the summer games in barcelona , spain even senior nra officials acknowledge a diverse public perception of the nra speaking at an nra board of directors meeting in january , david boehm , a state judge in rochester who served as chairman of the task force to revise the icc charter , cited the importance of the nra serving as a governing body , saying , our involvement with the us olympic committee is probably the most positive public relations association that our organization has
the scoreboard stare , a nightly august ritual carried out in major league dugouts , has a special , sorrowful edge to it for howard johnson if the mets , who ca n't be mathematically eliminated from the race in the national league east for weeks , remain effectively beyond reasonable hope , he could have shoulder surgery before the end of the month it s al harazin s call , said johnson , who says he has been bothered by damage in his left shoulder for much of 1992 i'm sure everyone involved will use their common sense we ca n't come right out and concede at the moment but the concern is to be 100 percent healthy for 1993 johnson , who is currently on the disabled list because of a fractured bone in his right hand , said he had been informed by the organization s medical personnel that his shoulder injury was fairly extensive he said he had been told that a tightening of the joint as well as the reattachment of a ligament was required , although it could all be done through arthroscopic surgery rehabilitation would take about five months johnson , who has n't been effective at the plate for the mets at all in 1992 , said there is no question in his mind that the injury impaired his talents and was a central reason behind his dreadful numbers johnson , after leading the national league with 38 homers and 117 runs batted in in 1991 , has only seven homers in 100 games this season yesterday , johnson referred to this season in the past tense had i been healthy , i would not have had that kind of year , he said no significant or sustained offensive action was generated by johnson all season should his season be complete , johnson will have hit 223 , with only 26 extrabase hits and 43 rbi those numbers are so weak for a player with johnson s track record that the explanation for them must go beyond an injury that was only recently considered substantial according to people close to him , as well as certain coaches , johnson had his season undermined by a wide assortment of factors , including unhappiness over seeing his best friends on the team traded in recent years , difficulty accepting the intense scrutiny of his play in center field and a return to impatient , overaggressive behavior at the plate and so the mets , who are faced with deep and perplexing organizational questions , are left to wonder about johnson how much did the shoulder in fact alter his season \? is johnson , a notably sensitive athlete , up to playing any longer in new york \? is there a position he can play effectively and happily \? has his trade value , explored by the mets at different points this season , been diminished by the prospect of his surgery \? none of these questions will be answered easily johnson said yesterday that progress in his fractured hand has been minimal , if there has been any at all he said the mets have scheduled another mri examination to see if there is ligament damage in addition to the fracture
on wednesday , sept 16 , after months of growing tension between mayor david n dinkins and new york city s police , more than 10 , 000 offduty officers and their supporters gathered outside city hall to protest the dinkins administration s handling of a list of police issues the demonstration began calmly enough , with a series of predictable chants , songs and demands then something went badly awry a handful of people , then hundreds , then thousands , broke through police barricades and surged onto city hall s steps from there , the protest degenerated into a beerswilling , trafficsnarling , epithethurling melee that stretched from the brooklyn bridge to murray street , where several politicians helped stoke the emotional fires the protest would have been noteworthy even if it had been any rally gone a bit too wild but the protesters were the police that only underscored the immediacy of one of the very questions they had gathered to address who should police the police \? that question is one of many that remain 11 days later the aftermath of the protest is having an impact both broader and quite different from the one the officers themselves had hoped for the proposal to establish an independent police review board , stalled before the rally , is now gaining strength the police department itself was brought under further scrutiny at a time when mr dinkins is searching for a new commissioner and beyond that , the city was given a preview of what may well be the core issues in next year s mayoral election race relations , police conduct and , perhaps most basic of all , crime and the fight against it mr dinkins called the department s lack of preparation naive he has asked his search committee to reinterview four leading candidates for police commissioner specifically on the question of how the demonstration should have been handled politics , racism and little control a reconstruction of the morning s events , based on witnesses' accounts and the few records that are now available , raises a number of issues about the people and the decisions involved in the protest , including these the protest had a strong political cast rudolph w giuliani , a likely candidate for mayor in 1993 , was present throughout the demonstration and led the crowd in a rousing condemnation of mayor dinkins s treatment of police issues it was his second appearance at a police gathering in several weeks earlier , mr giuliani attended a patrolmen s benevolent association convention in the catskills at the city hall demonstration , at least one giuliani supporter circulated through the crowd handing out voter registration cards , and many protesters wore paraphernalia with a decidedly political slant new white tshirts bearing the words dinkins must go and buttons printed fight crime dump dinkins mayor dinkins , in the days after the protest , framed the protest almost exclusively in racial terms some racial slurs were used by protesters at the demonstration and a small number held racially provocative signs but race did not appear to form a central theme of their complaints , which focused on mayoral policies they felt undercut the police many witnesses , however , said they were conscious of an underlying strain of tension in the overwhelmingly white crowd while the department is 22 percent minority , there were only a handful of black or hispanic protesters in the crowd police department officials appeared unprepared for the size and unruliness of the crowd , which included supervisors as well as rankandfile members there were relatively few police barricades up and they were sparsely attended by uniformed officers who joined in the chants , raised their own fists in support or passively stood to one side almost no effort was made by the 300 officers on duty to keep protesters from breaking police barricades to rush the steps of city hall alarmed officials inside city hall , fearing that the building would be overrun , bolted the doors and summoned a halfdozen uniformed guards from the basement to act as a last line of defense officials with the patrolmen s benevolent association , which organized and promoted the rally , appeared unable to control their members though they had assured police officials that the demonstration would be peaceful and that there would be at least 150 members acting as marshals , neither the marshals nor the union s leaders inhibited the protesters' movements nor did they appear to discourage protesters from displaying obscene and inflamatory signs , like those depicting the mayor with a large afrostyle haircut and swollen lips or another making reference to mr dinkins as a washroom attendant in the words of suzanne trazoff , the deputy commissioner , nobody was in control washington heights seemed final straw the roots beneath the disturbance were deep protesters condemned the mayor for his refusal to approve the issuance of semiautomatic pistols , saying officers had less firepower than criminals they took issue with the appointment of a mayoral commission to investigate charges of police corruption they complained , too , about the mayor s support of the formation of an allcivilian review board to investigate police misconduct
in the eight years since the deregulation of the telephone industry , thousands of privately owned pay phones have sprouted along the streets of new york city , providing , as intended , a vital service to neighborhoods that lacked it , but also , as never intended , duping and sometimes gouging unwitting users now , the city , frustrated by a lack of enforcement despite years of consumer complaints , is moving ahead with a plan that would in effect regulate many of the companies that operate the pay phones , the worst of which violate federal , state and city laws the plan , now before a committee of the city council , would require that companies obtain a franchise from the city s department of telecommunications and energy to install a pay phone on sidewalks or in other public places only those that comply with the law would receive franchises many phones violate laws the initial results of a survey by the department , expected to be announced tomorrow , show that as many as twothirds of the privately owned pay phones violate the law in a variety of ways by overcharging consumers , by blocking access to longdistance carriers , or by offering misleading or no information about rates , the company that owns the phone , the alternative operator service it uses and where people can complain if they have a problem in addition , none of the private pay phones now on sidewalks have the required approval from the city , which new york telephone obtains routinely , city officials said the survey shows there are a number of companies out there that are behaving responsibly , the department s commissioner , william f squadron , said it also shows there s a strong need for enforcement for a sizable chunk of companies that will not behave responsibly dennis novick , the president of teleplex coin com , which operates 450 phones in manhattan , strongly disagreed with the department s findings that twothirds of the companies violate the law 'we serve the public' i'm not saying we 're perfect , said mr novick , who is also president of the independent pay phone association of new york , which represents dozens of private companies in the state but in many cases we serve the public better than new york telephone can we 're filling that void the people most affected by the abuses of pay phones , mr squadron and other officials say , are those who need them most residents of the city s poorest neighborhoods , where many homes do not have telephones and pay phones offer the only link to work , family and friends miriam rosa , a doctor s assistant who does not have a phone in her apartment in williamsburg , brooklyn , because i ca n't afford to put one in , often has no choice but to use the private pay phones even though a brief collect call to a friend s apartment a few blocks away once cost her friend 475 i try my best not to use these phones , ms rosa , who is 36 , said as she shopped on broadway , the bustling commercial strip that slices through bushwick in the city and i go there a lot that s not a problem , but here people rely on them 15 , 000 private phones the privately owned pay phones or independents have proliferated across the nation ever since the federal government , in breaking up the ma bell monopoly , permitted private companies to install pay phones that for 100 years had been provided only by local telephone companies , in this case new york telephone in new york , which has more pay phones than any other city , there are now an estimated 15 , 000 private pay phones competing with the 54 , 000 pay phones operated by new york telephone the phones look and work like new york telephone s , but lack the distinctive logos the owners from barkeepers with a phone by the bathroom to fledging telecommunications corporations install the phones at a cost of about 1 , 500 , lease a business line from new york telephone and contract with alternative operator services , instead of american telephone and telegraph company , for longdistance calls the phones are regulated by a tangle of complicated and often misunderstood laws because the federal communications commission sets broad guidelines in the hope of letting the market dictate prices and increase competition , the state s public service commission has only limited jurisdiction basic local rate is set the state commission requires the phones to identify the company and the rates clearly and sets the maximum cost of a basic local call \( a quarter for the first five minutes \) , but after that the companies can legally charge what they wish in the shadows of the clattering elevated subway on broadway in bushwick , people who stopped the other day to use two private phones , covered with graffiti , on the sidewalk said the phones usually worked well when they used a quarter for a brief local call for anything else , though , they complained of frustrating confusion , persistent problems and exorbitant rates several months ago , victor kaos said he stopped at one of the phones to call his wife at their home less than a mile away quarterless , he called collect just long enough to tell her he would pick up some groceries before he caught the bus home he never thought much about it , until the bill came the call to his apartment , which would have cost 130 from new york telephone , cost 475 it s a ripoff , mr kaos said they do n't tell you nothing until the bill , and the people here do n't know any better in neighborhoods like bushwick , east new york and the south bronx , as many as 25 percent of homes do not have phones , forcing many residents to use pay phones for calls that most people take for granted seeking full disclosure the city s proposal , drafted by the department of telecommunications and energy last year , is intended to force private phone companies to comply with the laws requiring full disclosure for consumers the franchising proposal , which the city council is expected to approve in the fall and which would go into effect next year , would protect users and insure pay phones are evenly distributed throughout the city , especially in neighborhoods that need them most , he said it would also insure that the city receives a commission , as it does from new york telephone , for all phones on public property such as sidewalks and city buildings the department estimates that onethird of the private pay phones are located on public property the proposal would not affect phones on private property such as bars and other businesses
if you actually see the brutality that has gone on , ted forstmann said children s throats slit i went to the village green in mostar , in bosnia , which used to be a beautiful city the green is now a cemetery , with a mound over every grave , the markers showing muslims and catholics half of the headstones had birth dates in the 1980 s ted forstmann is senior partner in the great new york investment firm of forstmann little , a conservative , a leader of the bush reelection campaign sometime ago he became aware of the human disaster caused by serbian aggression in what used to be yugoslavia , and it has become his passionate commitment to try to relieve the suffering in telephone calls to american business executives he has raised large amounts of food and clothes and equipment for the hundreds of thousands of bosnians living under serbian shelling and in refugee camps in croatia the kellogg company donated food , sears children s winter clothing , bristolmyers squibb medicines among other donors none sought publicity nor does mr forstmann i just want americans to know what s happening , he said when i spoke with him if we would do something , these people could be saved the people in this country respond it s the government that does nothing mr forstmann has twice himself gone into besieged bosnia with shipments of aid he has paid the cost of airfreighting emergency supplies , working with the international rescue committee and its relief experts altogether there are at least 15 million displaced persons in bosnia and croatia they are victims of the serbian policy of ethnic cleansing , which means killing croatian catholics and bosnian muslims , or driving them from their homes , to secure areas for a future greater serbia about 80 percent of the refugees are women and children , most of the latter under 12 and they have little warm clothing as winter closes in you understand what happens , mr forstmann said in the middle of the night some serbians show up at the door of your house , and you have one minute to leave or be killed so the kids have no shoes official estimates are that up to 400 , 000 bosnians will die of cold and starvation in the next few months unless there are drastic changes in present conditions the changes would include effective western action to keep relief supply routes open , much more generous relief shipments and greater willingness by other countries to take in bosnian refugees a united nations resolution forbids the serbs to make military flights over bosnia but helicopters and fighter jets are both continuing to fly is anyone going to act to enforce the un resolution \? anyone necessarily means the united states the bush administration has been extraordinarily reluctant to do anything against the serbian aggression presidentelect clinton has taken a stronger position , but if there is going to be any action in time to be meaningful it will have to come from president bush the same burden of leadership rests on mr bush when it comes to relief to mention just one possibility , us military facilities in europe have stocks of surplus clothing and food that could be flown into bosnia and croatia if mr bush gave the word just as american military planes brought relief to the kurds in northern iraq after the persian gulf war then there is the question of where to put refugees here again the need is for american leadership , which so far has utterly failed croatia , a country of only 4 million people , now has 500 , 000 refugees from serbian onslaught if every western country took just 10 , 000 bosnian families , it would make a great difference but so far the united states has been willing to accept only 300 families britain is taking 60 mr bush should be pushing our european allies to take in more of the desperate bosnians , and showing the way by accepting more in this country he should specifically urge the european community s leaders to hold a special meeting on the human problem of bosnian refugees to me , ted forstmann said , the parallel is between this and what went on in the 1930 s this is not a war like ones i know , soldiers against soldiers it is serbians trying to obliterate a people
qyanjhari , india paulus ekka hitched the handhewn wooden plow on his shoulder , letting his eyes wander down the muddy path that plunged past the poundedearth huts of his village and into the earlygreening rice paddies he shifted his weight from one foot to another , saying nothing for a moment i think until now nothing has happened , he said finally , nothing has ever changed in this village there is no school there is no electricity qyanjhari huddles next to the broken macadam strip that dribbles south from ranchi , as if drawing comfort from the meager flow of commerce and life that struggles along the road but no paved surface runs into the village , no electricity lines intrude the single water pump broke some years ago this , alas , is bihar there is , though , nothing special about qyanjhari it is typical of much of bihar , india s most impoverished state more than 60 percent of bihar s 86 million people are illiterate 8 out of every 10 women cannot read of every 1 , 000 children born , 75 die in infancy the sixthhighest infant mortality rate in the country this is a state riddled with corruption , crime cartels , caste wars and caste politics shekar gupta , a senior editor for india today , the country s most important news magazine , shakes his head at the mention of bihar it is like not even part of india in february , in a village in central bihar , 34 uppercaste men and women called bhumihars , largely small landowners , were slain in their sleep by a group calling itself the maoist communist center , which claims to act on behalf of the harijans , the untouchables who are of no caste a kind of casteism in the months that followed , gangs of bhumihar youths rampaged through harijan villages , raping dozens of girls and women here in the south of the state , the savarna liberation front , made up of uppercaste thugs , and the indian people s front , made up of their lowcaste counterparts , kill one another , pausing only to kill one another s supporters more than in any other state in india , elections are accompanied by the systematic killing of candidates , the intimidation of voters and the theft or stuffing of ballot boxes the chief minister , laloo prasad yadav , has had himself declared an avatar of lord krishna , one of the most prominent deities in the hindu pantheon and politicians consort openly with leaders of powerful crime groups to many indians , bihar is a dantean vision of the abyss into which the country could descend to biharis mired in poverty and resignation , it is hard to imagine a better future for mr yadav , a member of a low caste , the source of bihar s discord lie in decadeslong oppression by brahmins i am not against the upper castes at all , he said but i want the poor and suppressed to come up so that social tensions and backwardness end otherwise there can never be social peace mr yadav , in two years in office , has worked tirelessly to drive brahmins and other uppercaste groups from political positions , from their grip on the economy , even from the state capital s sole golf course he who controls coal five hours east of here , in dhanbad , deep in coal country , politicians , local notables , the chief of police and even former prime minister chandra shekar gathered last month to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of suryadeo singh , known as the mafia king those who listened to the panegyrics to mr singh and enjoyed the grand picnic put on by his family sang his praises he was a mass leader , said sat yadeo pathak , a local congress party official there was no labor leader in dhanbad like suryadeo singh he loved the poor people he was never a caste leader but hari narainn singh , the editor of the morning news in ranchi and a cousin of mr singh , said of the labor organizer he formed a gang , went into the coal fields and started extorting coal truck drivers he ran his own union of coal workers in some parts of bihar , he controlled all the coal the state of bihar receives none of the benefits of bihar s coal , or of its vast reserves of iron , manganese and mica virtually all the coal , which is controlled by new delhi s central planners , is exported to steel mills in west bengal local industries , desperate for electricity , have shuddered to a stop as power companies find it impossible to muster enough cash to pay for coal and the electric companies have no cash because the government has stopped paying for its electricity of 165 industries in this city , only 10 are working , mr singh said all of them are small shoes , rubber , ice cream all the big industries , jute , plastics , bakeries , all are closed because there is no electricity for many villagers , though , the travails of towns and cities are little more than distant thunder yes , said mr ekka , the farmer , electricity would make life better here but nothing has happened jyaru uraon ambled by and interrupted there s been no development here in my

la paz , bolivia they are known here simply as max and goni and , apart from drug kingpins , they are possibly the two richest men in bolivia , owning two of the most successful and technologically advanced companies in this isolated andean country they also happen to be the two leading presidential candidates for bolivia s 1993 elections , and barring some startling development , either max fernandez or gonzalo sanchez de lozada is almost certain to be bolivia s next head of state whomever the voters choose , the country will get a leader who has taken bankrupt companies or failing industries and shown that even in this tiny latin american economy , bolivia can be innovative and competitive in world markets but that is about where the comparisons between the two end in their personalities and ways of doing business , they could not be more different mr fernandez , 50 years old , is a bolivian mestizo , a mixture of andean indian races , who was born into poverty and orphaned lacking a high school degree , he began work as a truck driver and is now president of the country s largest private employer , the bolivian national brewery he may seem an unlikely manager and candidate awkward in public appearances , selfconscious and shy , speaking in a spanish heavily accented by his native quechua tongue but his humble origins ring well with much of bolivia s population , which is 90 percent indian or mestizo the 61yearold mr sanchez de lozada , on the other hand , emits the confidence and refinement of his birthright as one of bolivia s landed gentry leaving bolivia when he was a year old , he grew up in washington , boston and chicago before he could enjoy the family riches , however , a coup put his diplomat father out of a job the family lost everything in the great land reforms of the early 1950 s but goni , as he is called , returned at age 21 and eventually built up the largest private mining company in bolivia , the mining company of the south , also known as comsur he has also had a strong dose of politics , as a cabinet minister a few years ago still , he is definitely an outsider , speaking spanish with a thick american accent the political season ahead is sure to be described as a battle between the cholo , a derogatory but often endearingly used term for bolivians of indian descent , and the gringo who was reared and educated in the united states , with a bachelor s degree in philosophy from the university of chicago wealth through mining when he returned to bolivia in the mid1950 s , mr sanchez de losada was almost thoroughly americanized his first business venture was in film making then he tried his hand in aerial photography for oil exploration companies , until he settled on buying up small to mediumsized mines mostly abandoned by bolivia s huge state mining company bolivia had nationalized the country s largest tin and silver mines , where workers' hours were long , and conditions were cramped , dangerous and bleak these conditions have not changed much in the last 30 years but comsur s mines which extract zinc , tin , gold , silver and lead tend to have large and reinforced shafts , lighting throughout , good ventilation and extensive networks of tracks mining safety is preached by the managers serving under mr sanchez de lozada perhaps just as important , comsur is putting in a 16 million zinc mill near its porco mine to increase production by contrast , the bolivian government has invested hardly any money in its mining sector in years mr sanchez de lozada , comsur s majority stockholder , has brought in the british mining giant rtz ltd as a partner rtz now owns onethird of comsur , and the companies have formed a joint partnership looking for new mines in bolivia if we find a small mine , we run it , he said if we find a big mine , they run it our speciality is running laborintensive , narrowvein mines experience in government mr sanchez de lozada s interests turned to politics by the late 1970 s and while he may run a mining company on the side , his most significant contribution to the bolivian economy was from 1985 through 1988 as minister of planning and coordination under president victor paz estenssoro when the paz estenssoro government came to power , inflation was running at 24 , 000 percent a year the country was mired in recession and bolivians essentially paid no taxes with the help of the harvard economist jeffrey sachs , mr sanchez de lozada brought inflation down to 26 percent , balanced the budget and increased tax revenues fourteenfold he cut tariffs that often exceeded 100 percent down to a uniform 10 percent , freed exchange controls and changed a tax system of 450 brackets to one with only seven since those years , bolivia has enjoyed one of the most stable economic periods in its history but during his term as planning minister , tin prices collapsed and the government fired half of bolivia s mine workers , the part of the population that may help elect his chief opponent he acknowledges that he cannot seem to escape the image of being part of the establishment while few doubt where mr sanchez de lozada got his money , many wonder how mr fernandez turned a prospering beer distribution company in the central bolivian city of santa cruz , 300 miles southeast of la paz , the capital , into 50 percent ownership of the country s largest brewery some speculate that he has ties to drug traffickers others say he has dealt in the black market for those reasons , the united states embassy will not give him a visa to travel to the united states but none of the accusations have stuck mr fernandez attributes much of his success to simple currency speculation in times of hyperinflation he describes getting bank credits in bolivian currency and converting them immediately into dollars three or six months later , after the bolivian currency had fallen 50 to 80 percent , he was able to buy entire companies for a fraction of their original cost i have a smell for these things , mr fernandez said , recalling how he used currency speculation in 1985 to purchase a plastic company for 15 million at a cost to himself of only 20 , 000 but his business acumen is not limited to currency speculation after being asked to buy control of the failing bolivian national brewery in 1986 for a reported 8 million , he revived its fortunes within a year now it has 85 percent of the domestic market and exports its beer , notably the pacena label , throughout latin america and to japan he is probably the most successful businessman in bolivia , probably much more successful than goni , said jorge lazarte , a member of bolivia s national electoral court , which regulates elections mr fernandez is now building a new , highly automated brewery in santa cruz and in an area of the world where thick , brown , reusable bottles remain the sole bottling method , he is building the only aluminum can factory in the southern part of latin america the plant will sell cans to other breweries in bolivia and in peru , chile and argentina using the economic base of his brewery , mr fernandez has built a political following not only is he the country s largest employer , effectively providing jobs for 43 , 000 bolivians , but he has personally financed hundreds , possibly thousands , of small construction projects around the country , ranging from schools , parks and social halls to water tanks and soccer fields photos max fernandez , a bolivian presidential candidate , took a recent visitor on a tour of the bolivian national brewery , of which he is president gonzalo sanchez de lozada , a businessman and candidate for bolivia s presidency , during a recent political rally in the

in the longawaited first debate of the 1992 presidential campaign , with his presidency in jeopardy , george bush asked the american people last night for more time to right the economy , but his economic stewardship drew withering fire from bill clinton and ross perot white house officials said later that if he was reelected mr bush planned to dismiss his three top economic advisers , as demanded for months by republican conservatives outraged over tax increases they are nicholas f brady , the treasury secretary richard g darman , the budget director , and michael j boskin , the top white house economist trailing badly in the national polls and in most big states , the president promised to make james a baker 3d , the former secretary of state who now heads his campaign , the overseer of all domestic programs once election day had passed it was an effort to suggest that he understood the urgency of american economic problems , something many voters doubt , but it also suggested that mr baker , not mr bush , was the man who gets things done renews attack on clinton jim baker is going to put together the economic program for the president , said marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman that means we 'll be getting a new economic team focusing on foreign policy , the president depicted himself as the only candidate with enough experience to handle the pressures of the oval office , and he questioned the judgment and character of mr clinton , his democratic rival transcript , pages a14a17 he renewed his attacks on mr clinton s role in antiwar demonstrations abroad during the vietnam era , contending that the democrat s actions raised grave questions about his fitness to serve as commander in chief mr clinton , mildmannered in most exchanges , answered sharply , accusing mr bush of unfairly maligning his patriotism he recalled the unsubstantiated charges of the late joseph r mccarthy and pointedly reminded the president that his father , the late senator prescott bush of connecticut , had been one of mccarthy s early foes a vivid perot during the debate , held at washington university in the st louis suburb of clayton , mo , and televised nationally , mr bush sought to identify governor clinton of arkansas , his democratic opponent , with the liberals whose economic programs have proved unpopular with american voters in the past , like walter f mondale , michael s dukakis and jimmy carter both the majorparty nominees did their best to ignore mr perot , their independent rival , but he was nevertheless a bright , sparky presence in the 90minute debate , full of pithy oneliners and selfdeprecation he seemed to have a good time , making fun of his big ears , telling the audience he was not playing lawrence welk music tonight and responding , when mr bush touted his presidential experience , that i do n't have any experience in running up a 4 trillion debt mr perot may have gone some way toward regaining at least a bit of the credibility he lost when he abruptly walked away from the race in july his vivid performance suggested what a power he might have been had he stayed in , but he had little specific to say except on his plan to help reduce the deficit by raising taxes on gasoline by 50 cents over five years president on defensive mr bush was forced onto the defensive much of the time on economic questions , but he fought back he produced no new proposals other than still another job for mr baker , who was brought to the campaign when it faltered but has not yet turned it around still , his answers were better focused than on many recent questions , and he spoke with verve and authority at times for his part , mr clinton managed to tame his tendency to sound like a politicalscience professor with abstruse , overdetailed answers he deftly turned a question about family values , a phrase the republicans have used to try to split the democratic coalition , into an indictment of the president s vetoes of democratic bills intended to help younger workers mr bush defended the status quo on several subjects , from american troop commitments in europe to spending on aids research , while mr clinton and mr perot consistently called for basic revisions in american policies on the economy especially , the president s insistent optimism left him open to the others' charges that he was complacent and out of touch with the nation his intentions with regard to mr brady , mr darman and mr boskin were revealed after the debate , as republican and democratic officials emerged to provide reporters with interpretation favorable to their candidates some saw the move as a sign of desperation , others as an indication that the president realized he had sounded too complacent about the economy no big gaffes there appeared to be no major gaffes and no knockout punches none of the three participants lost his composure or appeared stumped by the questions posed by jim lehrer , the moderator , and a panel of three other journalists the questioners were ann compton of abc news , john mashek of the boston globe , and sander vanocur , a freelance television reporter
when the centel corporation , one of the biggest nonbell telephone companies , said last month that it might consider putting itself up for sale , the market s reaction was unambiguous centel went through the roof the day before the announcement on jan 23 , centel s market value was a bit more than 3 billion the day of the announcement , frenzied investors bid up centel s shares by 9 each , to 46 , raising the company s value to 39 billion analysts said then that the rise was reasonable because centel might be worth more than 5 billion centel shares fell back since the announcement until yesterday , a day after it said it would indeed solicit bids for all or part of the company the shares rose 125 each , to 4575 , on the new york stock exchange , about where they were after the first announcement but is centel worth all the fuss \? analysts say that depends on whether investors look at centel s present and immediate past or toward its future bearish analysts say centel , based in chicago but with operations nationwide , is not worth the current heady price at current cashflow levels , they say , an acquiring company may have to wait nearly a decade to make back its investment bullish analysts and centel management say centel is worth its current value and much more future cash flow from what may become a surging cellular business and a resurgent localtelephone business , they say , will reward any acquiring company analysts differ on centel s core business of providing local telephone service in nevada , texas , virginia and other states centel has had an upanddown earnings and revenue history , in large part because state regulators have forced relatively low rates of return to keep consumer bills low last year , centel earned 111 million , or 131 a share , on revenue of 118 billion in 1990 , it earned 47 million , or 54 cents a share , on revenue of 115 billion john c culver , a telecommunications analyst at duff phelps inc in chicago , does not recommend buying centel at these prices , i'm worried that the upside is limited and the downside is great , he said mr culver notes that if a conservative value of 2 , 000 is assigned to each of centel s 153 million local telephone lines , an acquiring company may spend at least 31 billion to acquire centel s core business , the source of all its profits and most of its revenue but mr culver estimates that centel s cash flow this year from local phone service will be about 350 million , or about 230 a line thus , it would take an acquiring company at least nine years to make back its investment but a large part of centel s attraction is due to its being the last independent company among the nation s top 10 cellular telephone operators , which represent a majority of the potential subscribers even in cellular telephones , mr culver sees only limited promise las vegas , nev , one of centel s largest cellular markets , is near capacity , he said and of centel s other major cellular properties , like tallahassee , fla newport news , va , and harrisburg , pa , none are major markets john p frazee , jr , chairman of centel , acknowledged that the company s cash flow and earnings had been below those of other companies in the industry we 've bumped up against the rate ceilings in several states , he said he added , however , that localtelephone profits and revenue would improve , as several states reconsider rateofreturn formulas that have not been changed in decades nevada , for example , had not considered changing rates in 26 years , until last year although nevada regulators recently granted only 95 million of a 32 million centel request , centel will continue to push for higher rates , as well as regulations that reward operating efficiency by allowing it to keep more of its profits we 're entering a period of increased cash flow after a long drought , mr frazee said despite a moderate drop in monthly cellular revenue per customer , from 83 in the 1990 fourth quarter to 78 in the 1991 fourth quarter , in line with the rest of the cellular industry , centel has seen strong growth in the number of subscribers , to 251 , 000 , up 40 percent from the yearago period charles w schelke , an analyst at smith barney , harris upham company , said centel has a great deal of highcapacity fiberoptic cable , a modern digital network and some of the latest technological wonders , like signaling system no7 , in more than half of its network all these will make possible a wide variety of customer services , like video conferencing , that will increase earnings and because they have already been paid for , centel s future capital spending will be relatively low , compared with that of other telecommunications companies that have not begun to spend on these improvements but even mr schelke is a little cautious on the stock market s reaction he continues to recommend centel enthusiastically , but only to the sophisticated , wellheeled customers , who presumably would not miss a college tuition payment for their children if centel stock nosedived suddenly
gullane , scotland , july 17 coming frighteningly close to satisfying his own quest for perfection , nick faldo made a break from the field today with a recordbreaking performance in the second round of the british open employing nearflawless ballstriking , zonedin putting and an uncharacteristically joyful attitude , faldo shot a sevenunderpar 64 his twoday total of 12underpar 130 broke by two strokes the championship s 36hole record , which was established by henry cotton in 1934 and matched by greg norman and faldo in 1990 the jarringly low number gave faldo , whose 35th birthday is saturday , a threestroke advantage over john cook of the united states and gordon brand jr of scotland next was one of the firstround leaders , steve pate , at 134 raymond floyd , donnie hammond and ernie els of south africa were five shots back that was my best round ever in the open championship , said faldo , the champion in 1987 and 1990 , who has played every year since 1976 i felt so comfortable , i just kept firing away i had all the right thoughts it did n't matter what club i had in my hand i kept hitting good shots although faldo was clearly on a different level , the scoring remained generally low on a muirfield course that had only slightly heavier wind than thursday s benign opening round the 36hole cut of 143 tied the championship record for the lowest ever , matching the mark at st andrews in 1990 the casualties included fred couples , whom faldo would overtake as the world s no 1 player on the sony ranking with a victory davis love 3d fivetime champion tom watson threetime champion seve ballesteros , and jack nicklaus , who failed to make the cut for only his second time in 31 british opens faldo s round was reminiscent of his two previous victories in the world s oldest championship he exhibited the same mastery of muirfield in this 121st open that he achieved here in horrible weather in 1987 , as well as the palpable command of himself and his swing that is the enduring image of his fiveshot victory at st andrews seven threes in eight holes i'm swinging as well as i 've ever swung , said faldo , who has become less immersed in technical aspects in the last year i have far fewer swing thoughts when i play the old mechanical man is gone i'm going au naturel after playing the first eight holes in oneunder par today , faldo exploded with seven threes in the next eight holes the streak was ignited by an eagle at the 504yard , par5 ninth , where he hit a 3wood shot from 245 yards to four feet and made the putt that ball just came off like a rocket , said faldo it elevated the englishman to an extended moment of pure golf that even champions only achieve a few times in their careers converting birdies with perfectly paced putting on muirfield s consistently smooth greens , faldo holed a fourfooter on the 475yard 10th , a 15footer on the 381yard 12th , a 20footer on the 449yard 14th and a 15footer for his final birdie of the day on the 417yard 15th faldo missed an opportunity to tie the championship s oneround record of 63 when he failed to birdie the relatively easy 550yard 17th after a good drive , he pulled a 5iron into deep rough to the left of the green on the final hole , faldo left a 20foot birdie attempt an inch from the cup as the round progressed , faldo became unusually animated for a player who usually projects dour intensity all of a sudden there , i just felt so good inside , said faldo , who has tried to be more forgiving of himself and spontaneous on the golf course considering the cirumstances and where we are and what we are doing , this is a unique feeling faldo was loose enough after the round to joke about a putting tip that coach david leadbetter lord leadbetter he called him had given him before the championship asked to talk specifically about the change , faldo protested that it was top secret the code name is 'basil' at the moment , he said dryly at this point , faldo s competitors surely would n't mind if he were debriefed except for faldo and floyd , none of the lowest 10 scorers has ever won a major championship , and only faldo has ever won the british open

followed his opening 64 with a 71 , as faldo s most dangerous challenger floyd is trying to complete a career grand slam by winning this championship his experience and the recent level of his play are in his favor , but the rain and heavy winds that have been forecast for saturday would seem to work against an older player this is the one championship that i would dearly love to win , said
