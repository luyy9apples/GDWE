this is the time for americans and israelis to start talking in their own countries about whether american troops should be stationed on the golan heights that was the opening of this column on nov 30 , 1993 now the clinton administration says it expects to send us troops to the heights as part of an international force if syria and israel come to a peace agreement but still there has been no debate in congress and none scheduled there are two issues the second is whether it is wise to commit us troops as peacekeepers to the heights , one of the world s more dicey pieces of strategic real estate but first to be decided is whether congress has not only the right but the obligation to study the risks and benefits beforehand israel s labor government wants peace with syria quickly over a few years , israel would turn back the mountain ridge and high plateau from which syria fired down on israeli villages for 20 years until israel captured the golan in 1967 the present israeli government feels that prize of peace is worth the risk prime minister yitzhak rabin believes that peace with hardline syria could open the way to peace with many more muslim countries the syrians stall unwilling to give the full diplomatic recognition israel demands , even for those coveted heights on the road to damascus but one day president hafez alassad is likely to grab the deal , a bargain israel tells him that its political clock is running out israel will hold an election in 1996 and campaigning will start in 1995 many israelis oppose giving back the heights the labor party wants to put the heights controversy behind it by campaign time none of the three governments involved want a congressional debate about us troops whatever president assad knows about public discussion he detests and , like most american governments , the clinton administration prefers to present diplomatic done deals before getting involved in congressional headaches for the israeli government , a us commitment about troops is critical to rounding up israeli voters so israeli officials and the american israel public affairs committee argue hard against senate legislation , expected to be introduced this week , to order a defense department study before a commitment is made the report would include assessments of how large the us force might grow , the risks that iranianpaid holy war military groups in lebanon would target american soldiers , possibly with secret syrian approval , and how long the american commitment might last israeli laborites see this movement for debate as coming from israeli and american opponents of the current peace negotiations to some extent that is true but it also comes from us friends of israel simply concerned about the impact on usisraeli relations if american troops take serious casualties under a commitment made without advance congressional backing i think israel should be getting much more than handshakes and promissory notes from arab nations in exchange for land but i also think that any risks israelis take for peace are essentially up to them essentially but sending us troops to the edgy golan is american business recent history shows that it is far better now for the us and its allies if the american public has a good idea of what it is getting into that happened before the persian gulf but not before vietnam if i were an israeli , i think i would oppose asking for us troops israel s strength as a small ally is that it has not asked that foreign lives be put at risk for israel inevitably , the payoff for an american detachment on the heights would be loss of israeli freedom of action for the kind of military preemption that has helped protect the country so far as an american friend of israel , i am queasy about israel becoming more dependent on the us on an issue of this importance , congressional discussion could clear up legitimate doubts , or confirm them israel and americans who oppose congressional consideration will probably win a bad victory today , the movement for debate comes from american friends of israel if that is blocked , some soon tomorrow the demand will come from her enemies
in a highly unusual move , a congressional agency has apparently canceled a secret multibilliondollar contract awarded to trw inc and has ruled that the losing bidders , the lockheed corporation and the martin marietta corporation , be allowed to bid again trw was awarded the contract last year by the national reconnaissance office , a large and secretive intelligence agency that , among other things , is responsible for buying satellites for the pentagon and the central intelligence agency in september , several months after the project was awarded , the house appropriations committee strongly criticized the national reconnaissance office for commissioning satellites without first clearing the decision with congress the committee s report accused the office of ignoring its request not to proceed until it received permission because members of the house and senate appropriations committees believed that it was too costly and did not adequately meet certain requirements new round of bidding now , after protests from lockheed and martin marietta , the general accounting office , the auditing , review and investigative agency of congress , has ruled that the contract be canceled and that the bidding take place again , the los angeles times reported on saturday a lockheed spokesman said yesterday he could neither confirm nor deny the report , and telephone calls to the gao , trw and martin marietta were not returned or not answered over the holiday weekend bloomberg business news reported that several people involved in the bidding process had confirmed the gao action the contract , for an advanced spy satellite that would scan the skies and oceans for aircraft and naval vessels , is reportedly worth 5 billion to 10 billion and represents one of the largest remaining government contracts in an industry that has been badly weakened by budget cutbacks in recent years ballast for weaker operations this is the last best hope for trw and lockheed to stay in the satellite business , said john pike , director of the space policy project at the federation of american scientists , a policy research group based in washington martin marietta and hughes aircraft already have several satellite contracts and so their futures as suppliers are assured , mr pike said however , a spokesman for lockheed said that the company had several commercial and governmentrelated satellite projects , including contracts to build the satellites for an ambitious global wirelessphone system being developed by motorola and for a militarycommunications system being developed by the pentagon we are certainly not out of the satellite business , the spokesman said although the gao is best known for undertaking projects on behalf of congress , its duties include reviewing contract awards to make sure that they comply with federal law should trw lose the contract , 1 , 000 jobs might be lost at its design and production center in redondo beach , calif lockheed s missile and space subsidiary is based in sunnyvale , calif martin marietta designs and builds its satellites in denver mr pike said that he could not recall when such a large contract was withdrawn if you are talking about computers that you buy off the shelf , those sort of contracts are routinely recompeted , he said but for a heavymetal contract like this , i ca n't remember a time when that has been done the unusual move shows the fierce competition among contractors fighting for a declining amount of government work mr pike said the national reconnaissance office had also been working to reduce the number of its contractors over the last decade ten years ago , trw and lockheed were synonymous with the nro , he said now there is this suddendeath overtime to see which one gets the crumbs and which one gets none the project has been debated from the beginning intended to replace two competing systems put forth by the air force and the navy , the socalled spacebased widearea surveillance satellites would use advanced radar to track planes and ships but since the breakup of the soviet union at the end of 1991 , it has not been clear to arms experts and critics in congress that the system is needed both the air force and navy had very specific requirements , which were very much driven by the soviet threat , mr pike said after the contract was awarded , a congressional aide said that the national reconnaissance office s decision not to consult with congress had not been a deliberate violation of the legislators' request , but rather an embarrassing error
west hampton dunes , li it was a sunday in the hamptons as bright as new chrome , and the chairs and blankets were unfolding in lazy profusion no activity seemed the best but for some people too many for narrow dune road it was the perfect day to drive out and see the wracked land and ruined houses that became a village the other day where are the wrecks \? said gregory kirk , a weekend renter in a house nearby he craned his neck outside the window of his jeep like a true rubbernecker and got a look at a house on piles , just beyond the metal gates blocking the way to the village of west hampton dunes beach none of the curious saw much more a weary security guard in a civic hatchback stationed in front of the gates pointed out the keep out signs and brushed the endless stream of sightseers away not that there was much more to see west hampton dunes , known as the end of dune road in the town of southampton until last week , is barely there what s left \? the house on crutches , a stranded ranch here and there , a few battered shells and mounds of broken wood no families , just a few rare birds , have lived here since the beach was left for dead by a storm two winters ago only 87 people voted the village into existence , out of hope and frustration and a little desperation some people think incorporating is a joke they should cut their losses and move , said mr kirk , who is a manhattan lawyer but that wo n't happen , not after this long a fight just because the homes do n't exist anymore does n't mean we do n't love it and hope that one day we can live there again , said gary vegliante , who led the movement to create the village and ran unopposed for mayor it has been a lonely fight the 70 million budgeted to restore the beach has made others in the area grumpy comments and letters in the local papers tend to be of the stop whining variety some critics complain that the residents deserve no help , since they took their chances when they bought houses close to the shore others say that the homeowners should be compensated , but that they should give up their quest to rebuild and let nature take its course but politics bear a share of the blame back in the 60 s , the army corps of engineers began erecting jetties , or groins , along the beach into the ocean they were supposed to extend the length of the barrier island , but the army halted work after the county refused to pay its share of the project what is now west hampton dunes was left unprotected experts say the groins caused the unprotected sections to erode and created the breach that destroyed the houses a breach opened by the '92 nor'easter spread to almost a mile in four months , while local and federal officials debated how to respond by the time the army corps of engineers started a 9 million emergency project to close the breach , about 150 houses had been swallowed residents say becoming a village opens the door to state and federal grants for road construction and other public works and last month , the yettobeincorporated village settled for 32 million in a suit that charged suffolk county , new york state and the federal government with creating its problems not all the houses bullied by the ocean were glittering prizes some were doll house cape cods lined up in a row like monopoly pieces families bought the cottages before the hamptons went hollywood , when a teacher who played her paycheck right could stash away a down payment mostly , what is now west hampton dunes housed families some houses were rented to tanwielding partygoers , but they would spend their rowdy hours down the road at the summer beach dance club in quogue it s more familyoriented here , and not with big , ornate houses , said ted ferguson , whose family has kept a home here for decades some of the people who lost their homes have lost everything he s one of the lucky ones the grayshingled house his family has summered in for decades fights like a tank two years ago , he could see other buildings wash out to sea from his back porch it s on the bay side , which he finds more interesting than the ocean front you could see the horseshoe crabs and sails , he said but at present , the village is bird watching it is waiting on eight pairs of rare piping plovers that are using the beach for nesting as endangered species , the birds are left alone their eggs are due to hatch in august when they leave , the village will begin to rebuild photo just because the homes do n't exist anymore does n't mean we do n't love it and hope that one day we can live there again , said gary vegliante , who led a movement to create the village of west hampton dunes on long island and ran unopposed for mayor \( vic delucia the new york times \)
there is a basic reason that one , and possibly two , of the broadcast television networks may be close to being sold to companies that operate hollywood studios for both buyers and sellers , the time is right , and may never be more so the broadcast business , once considered shaky , has made a strong financial comeback in the last year and the owners of the two networks in question , nbc and cbs , have indicated a desire to relinquish control perhaps most significant , the two studios in the middle of the rumors have powerful incentives to protect their lucrative positions as suppliers of network programming time warner is in the middle of negotiations to buy the nbc network and the walt disney company may be moving toward talks to acquire cbs both time warner and disney are producers of many popular primetime shows that rely on network television to distribute their programs but that relationship could start to change next year , when federal regulations that have kept networks from producing much programming for themselves are set to expire networks will almost certainly reduce the number of programs they buy from outside suppliers , giving the studios strong reasons to want to control the distribution system themselves broadcast television is not going to go away , said larry gerbrandt , senior vice president of paul kagan associates , a media research firm and if it s not going to go away and you 're a studio , then you ought to own one officials of time warner and the general electric company , which owns nbc , declined to comment on their discussions yesterday , leaving wall street uncertain about how to react and cbs executives continued yesterday to deny that they were talking with disney page d16 both nbc and cbs have longtime owners that have previously tried to walk away from the network business just two months ago , laurence a tisch , the chairman of cbs , agreed to turn over control of that network to barry diller before the proposed merger between cbs and mr diller s company , qvc inc , collapsed at the time , mr tisch , who is 71 , said he had simply had enough but it is also true that analysts for years have criticized his stewardship of cbs as far too cautious alone among the networks , for example , it has failed to diversify into the cable business ge , which has owned nbc since 1986 , has seen the network decline in almost every area the chairman of ge , john f welch jr , came close to selling the network to paramount studios in 1992 now , an executive close to mr welch said he had concluded that everyone in the media business needed to consider new forms of alliances in order to survive certainly ge s bottomline results have been discouraging the network , earning about 500 million a year at the time of the acquisition , has seen years since then when it lost money under the plan now being discussed , ge would retain the one part of nbc that has consistently earned money the seven nbc owned and operated television stations in large cities , including wnbc in new york the financial interest and syndication rules , which have prevented a network from collecting the enormous profits possible in the sale or syndication of reruns of programs like cheers , will expire in november 1995 the networks have already begun to use their own inhouse production companies to generate more of the programs they put on the air 'huge impact' warner knows what s going to happen when the finsyn rules end , said john reidy , a media analyst for smith barney , referring to the commonly used term for the rules it s going to have a huge impact on the programming business warner has been the biggest producer of primetime television programs in hollywood for the last several years , including murphy brown , on cbs and full house on abc \( disney produces fewer shows for prime time , but some very important ones , including the toprated series , abc s home improvement \) warner executives , who were among the most adamant defenders of the financial interest rules , have openly worried that opportunities to place their shows on the networks will begin to dry up as the networks produce more of their own programs until now , warner s response was to try to begin its own fifth network , which is scheduled to start with just one night of programming on a group of independent stations in january paramount , another studio that supplies shows to networks , is also trying to establish a network of its own but there has been widespread doubt in the industry that either studio and certainly not both could ever get a network up and running successfully cable investments at the same time , executives at time warner , which has enormous investments in the cable industry including cable systems across the nation , along with hbo and part of cnn and a prospectus that includes heavy participation in the promised 500channel universe of the future , have often denigrated broadcasting as the territory of dinosaurs going for nbc represents a strategic shift for time warner , mr reidy said but the broadcast business has come roaring back in the past year meanwhile , he added , the cable business has faced reregulation , including the imposition of price controls that have the industry in something of a slump
testing the boundaries of his powers , schools chancellor ramon c cortines said yesterday that he would take over six of the city s worst elementary and junior high schools because their leadership has permitted failure for so long that it amounts to educational corruption mr cortines s plan is the most sweeping intervention in the operation of local schools by any chancellor since the system was decentralized in 1970 , school officials said in addition to the six school takeovers , mr cortines also said he would order a variety of emergency programs for 34 other schools several of mr cortines s predecessors have removed individual principals and even suspended whole community school boards for involvement in corruption , but none has sought to impose remedial programs in so many schools to correct educational decline mr cortines s action marks his most forceful move to confront the crisis of failing schools since he assumed his post last fall in some of the six schools , as few as one student in five reads at or above grade level there is an educational corruption , and we need to take over some of these schools that are corrupt , educationally , he said the law that decentralized the schools in 1970 allows the schools chancellor to intervene in local districts to stop illegality , but does not specially empower him to take control of local schools for failing to teach so far , mr cortines has persuaded local superintendents to cooperate with his interventions but he said that whether he received help or not he was prepared to take drastic action to improve education i do n't want this to be done in a dictatorial fashion , mr cortines said i want there to be a collaborative takeover of the school i want the people from my office to work together with the district superintendent to fix the school s problems but he also said he would ask the state legislature to bolster his powers as head of a decentralized system of 32 districts the central administration runs the city s high schools , but the local districts control the elementary and junior high schools mr cortines is to testify about failing schools today before the education committee of the state assembly i want to bring this issue before our state legislators for a simple reason , he said when there is corruption illegal acts in a district , the chancellor s authority to act to solve problems is clear so i want to ask them why does n't that authority to act or exert leverage extend to educational corruption \? mr cortines announced his decision to intervene in the schools in a board of education meeting yesterday he declined to name the six schools , but four of them have been identified in recent board of education documents they are public school 188 at 442 east houston in community school district 1 on the lower east side of manhattan , ps 57 at 2111 crotona avenue and intermediate school 193 at 1919 prospect avenue in district 12 in the bronx and junior high school 111 at 35 starr street in district 32 in brooklyn mr cortines said that local superintendents had agreed to remove the principals from four of the six schools before the beginning of the fall term we 're going to do some drastic things , he said dr robert berne , the dean of new york university s graduate school of public service and a codirector of a state panel that recommended in march that educators take tough measures to deal with foundering schools , applauded mr cortines s action but because the decentralization law authorizes intervention in local districts by chancellors only in response to illegal acts , dr berne said he believed mr cortines s actions could easily prompt a court challenge in 1987 , chancellor nathan quinones ordered jhs 123 in the bronx closed because it failed to meet minimum educational standards parents and teachers sued to keep the school open , and though board of education lawyers , after a protracted legal battle , were able to sustain the closing , the case established no clear precedent that became clear earlier this year when mr cortines ordered bronx school board 9 to renew the contract of a superintendent who had sparked an educational renaissance the board sued , and in march judge lorraine backal reversed mr cortines s action , arguing that since board 9 had not broken any laws , mr cortines had no power to intervene in the district s affairs he s absolutely correct to ask for more legal power , dr berne said board members approve several of the board of education s seven members applauded mr cortines s actions in interviews yesterday i believe he s moving in the right direction by saying that these schools cannot go on with business as usual , said dr luis o reyes , the manhattan representative but i believe he needs more legislative power if he s going to really scramble the eggs and create a revolution for improvement in these schools esmeralda simmons , an appointee of former mayor david n dinkins who has also been pressing for vigorous action on failing schools , said , he s given each of these schools a report card , and those that got an f minus , he s saying , 'i'm taking you over' i believe he has the power to do it , ms simmons said if a chancellor ca n't step in to seek improvement , then we 've got a system that s out of control mayor rudolph w giuliani s press secretary , christyne lategano , said , we support the chancellor s efforts in improving the school system , and we look forward to studying the details of his plan

los angeles , jan 17 ventura boulevard , the main thoroughfare through the devastated san fernando valley , was ghostly this morning , its shops a shambles , its sidewalks littered with broken glass , its traffic signals out and its automatic teller machines useless but the stillness was misleading behind a shuttered thrifty drugstore in the studio city section , where the aisles were clogged with fallen ceiling tiles , a tangle of toys and broken cosmetic bottles , employees peddled batteries and flashlights to a stunned throng of men and women still shaking from the jolt of a lifetime , which occurred before dawn i need a good flashlight ! and eight d batteries ! and a couple of triple a s ! and one of those heavyduty things ! sputtered one man in line , as harried clerks dispensed these limited goods from a shopping cart and apologized that nothing else was for sale because the store was kneedeep in ruined merchandise across the region from the eastern edge of the san fernando valley , where buildings shuddered and fell , to the graffitiscarred streets of downtown , to the manicured confines of beverly hills and pasadena residents were stunned and shaken , but largely composed some homes were ruined most were without power some lacked telephone service and all of their inhabitants were shaken to the core but residents of the city of angels , where disasters have lately been heaped one upon the other , kept their heads the closest thing to bedlam , as of nightfall , was the scene at hughes market , the only open grocery store for miles around ten people at a time were permitted inside to fill their baskets with bottled water , ice , cigarettes and food that required no cooking , because gas and electrical service was unlikely to be restored anytime soon in the neighborhood , 10 miles from the epicenter of the quake hughes s large plateglass windows were shattered the market reeked of spilled vinegar and wine , and the floor was a soggy mess of ketchup , crumbled plaster and whoknowswhatelse but shoppers had grateful words for the managers for opening and they made favorable comparison between today s frenzied shopping and the last round of panic buying here , in the aftermath of the 1992 riots the lines are long , things are crazy and people are petrified , said tobi oringer , a shopper from the nearby sherman oaks section , where two people were killed today when a hillside home collapsed but it s better than the last time this time we 're unified , as opposed to separated it s not a fearbased thing we 're doing to each other harmony amid troubles in fact , the mood of the day was civility throughout a region that in recent years has experienced more troubles than job shoppers with no cash because the teller machines were inoperative asked politely if merchants would take checks , and mostly they did virtually no one pushed and shoved in the long lines to buy food , gasoline or newspapers and people using pay telephones to reassure friends and relatives cut conversations short in deference to others nowhere was that civility more essential than at major intersections , most of them without traffic signals because of power failures with parts of three major freeways closed because of damage , and others virtually empty because motorists were afraid to use them , the surface streets became the main arteries some of those streets were deserted as far as the eye could see , long asphalt alleys eerily silent in the warm haze but others were thick with traffic and it was there that angelenos showed uncommonly good manners , making their way gingerly through intersections , some six lanes wide , using eye contact and hand signals rather than horns or expletives even when a stalled vehicle blocked fairfax avenue in the middle of the city , clogging traffic for blocks , drivers calmly made their way through the mess , commiserating with each other sharing information civility prevailed , as well , at airports and carrental agencies , as travelers returned to their broken city and others hurried away at burbank airport , for instance , a group of businessmen who had never met before shared information about which highways were standing and which had fallen and then joined forces for the drive home to the san fernando valley and a beleaguered avis agent , the only one who had made it to work by midmorning , offered a visitor a map from the trunk of her car when she discovered that none were left at the counter at los angeles international airport , where people from los angeles and others from san francisco crossed paths , there was consensus that today s earthquake , a shallow tremor centered just miles from the heart of the city , felt stronger and seemed more destructive than the 1989 loma prieta quake in the san francisco area , which severed the bay bridge , toppled freeways and killed 63 people this was worse , no question , said steve bentz , a computer executive from the san francisco area , who was rocked from bed at dawn today in a hotel room in the san fernando valley los angeles was a patchwork of stillness and carnivallike activity , with the few open restaurants bustling one hive of activity was walter s pastry shop in beverly hills , where a signboard on the sidewalk advertised earthquake news on tv every table was filled , and luxury cars were doubleparked while people waited for takeout orders worst fears three women , window shopping while they waited their turn to dine , described fear like nothing they had ever before experienced and damage inside gold coast mansions that looked untouched from the treelined streets do n't ask , said sophia braverman , who lost a boulle clock , a collection of antique perfume bottles , a marble mantel and more television sets , each with a 35inch screen , than she could count i'm embarrassed to tell you how many loss is measured differently in the shabby apartment buildings at the edges of downtown there , too , the damage was minimal on the outside but lives were ruptured inside in one building , near the riotscarred stretches of normandie avenue , plaster rained from the ceiling of a tiny apartment where 7yearold marshauna rose lives with her mother and four younger siblings the roof fell , said joseph , marshauna s 3yearold brother , who was whimpering on the front step no ! argued marsha , who is 5 well , yeah , in the hallway a little , said marshauna i 've never been that scared before
a study of babies born at very low weights has found that many will have neurological problems and nearly half will have learning problems requiring special education when they reach school age the study , by dr maureen hack of rainbow babies and children s hospital at university hospitals of cleveland and her colleagues , is the first to follow babies born at very low weight , less than 1 pound 10 ounces , in order to see how they perform when they go to school it was only in the early 1980 s that babies with birth weights that low began surviving in any great number the study is being published today in the new england journal of medicine dr hack and her colleagues compared three groups of children 68 with very low weights at birth , less than 750 grams , or 1 pound 10 ounces 65 children with low weighs , 750 to 1 , 499 grams , or 3 pounds 5 ounces , and 61 children born at term the researchers found that the tiniest babies were much more likely to have disabilities and learning problems when they reached school age as many as 21 percent of those born with very low weights had iq s of less than 70 , but just 8 percent of those with low weights and none of the term babies had such low iq s nine percent of the tiniest babies had cerebral palsy , compared with 6 percent of those with low weights and none of the term babies very poor vision occurred in 25 percent of the tiniest babies , 5 percent of those with low weight and 2 percent of the term babies fortyfive percent of the smallest babies required special education classes in school as against 25 percent of those born with low weights and 14 percent of the term babies dr hack said that at her medical center , about a quarter of babies weighing 500 to 750 grams survived in the early to mid1980 s , but half are surviving now dr marie c mccormick , a professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school and director of an infant followup program at children s hospital in boston , said the number of lowbirthweight babies being born was also increasing she said the increase was partly attributable to the wider use of infertility treatments that can result in the births of twins or triplets , who are more likely to be born early and very small but she said it was also the result of an epidemic of premature births among the poor we do n't know what to do about preventing these births , said dr mccormick , who wrote an editorial accompanying dr hack s article prenatal care and stopping smoking increase the birth weights of babies born later in pregnancies but do not seem to prevent the births of very premature infants , she said but dr mccormick noted that most of the children were not severely handicapped and that though learning disabilities and hyperactivity were more likely among the very premature , many children had behavior or attention deficit problems dr richard behrman , managing director of the center for the future of children in los altos , calif , said the problem facing society was an imbalance in spending the tragedy is that we spend enormous amounts in saving these kids , he said , but then we do n't put any money or very little money into the kinds of family support systems that they really do need dr behrman said it can easily cost 100 , 000 to 150 , 000 to save an infant weighing 1 pound 10 ounces

mr osborne acknowledges , though , that his prescriptions for delivering basic city services more efficiently will be harder to do in new york it s harder to do in new york than in a smaller place and in a place where politics is more rational and where corruption is less of a problem and you tend to need more red tape or think you do , he said the other day from one of those smaller places , his home in essex , mass , population 3 , 000 and in new york , the unions tend to be more powerful mr osborne conferred twice with mr giuliani , at his request , before the election since november , responding to a request from recruiters for the new mayor , he submitted the names of about two dozen heroes of the reinventing government crusade as possible appointees none , he said , has been given major jobs so far \( although the mayor , his parks commissioner , henry stern , and public advocate mark green , weigh in publicly with proposed reforms \) the relative inexperience in city government of mr giuliani s appointees remains the administration s greatest vulnerability but while the mayor has a lot to learn , he and his deputies also may be emboldened by their naivete as felix g rohatyn said when he resigned as chairman of the municipal assistance corporation after nearly two decades of nudging the bureaucracy , the job demanded a naif who still harbors illusions about what can be accomplished the challenges are daunting rikers island has a higher number of admissions than the city university system \( 86 , 000 detentions at the city jail last year compared with 28 , 000 freshmen entering all of the university s colleges \) the disparity between the higher infant mortality rates among blacks and the lower rates among whites is widening in 1991 , the most recent year for which comparable figures are available , new york city spent 193 for every 1 , 000 in personal income earned by city residents 45 percent more than the 133 average for all local governments \( more than half the 193 is spent on operating budgets for education , social services , housing and health \) because the city collected only about 100 per 1 , 000 in personal income from federal and state aid , bond issues and various fees a marginally higher figure than the national average the difference was derived from taxes a city planning department analysis found that city taxes took 96 for every 1 , 000 of personal income , more than twice the national average in new york , there are pockets of experimentation here and there , but not across the board , said mr osborne , who heads the nonprofit , washingtonbased alliance for redesigning government new york does quite a lot of performance measurement , but it s not used to drive decisions most of the principles in our book have been used in one place or another in new york city government and have worked , but no one has tried to revamp the city s management among the success stories he cites are operation scorecard , which measures street cleanliness , and the sanitation department s vehicle repair program mr osborne disagrees with the notion of radically disinventing government divesting itself of responsibility for certain services government s most fundamental role is to steer society , to make sure that problems get solved , he said , adding , though , that the business community and neighborhood organizations often can deliver services and solve problems more efficiently what he proposes is entrepreneurial government , which he defines as a systematic strategy to imaginatively improve efficiency and effectiveness competition with private companies more aggressive management accountability incentives decentralization community empowerment regionalism new york may be unique , but not ungovernable , mr osborne said , and its size is not the biggest obstacle the single most important variable in determining whether a community can reinvent its government is is it a necessity , is there a crisis \? when i listen to new yorkers talk about life in their city , there s a crisis the second big condition you need to make major change is leadership , and just the fact that new yorkers elected a republican mayor says they want big changes would he single out one goal \? i would tell mayor giuliani not to think that way , that s what all the politicians say , mr osborne said i would say , stop and develop a strategy that has things building on each other and puts the right people in charge of the right pieces otherwise , politicians produce a lot of motion by the time they 're running for reelection , but it has n't added up to a lot
los angeles , sept 26 the laborious process of finding 12 citizens who can try o j simpson fairly and impartially on murder charges , despite the torrent of fact , rumor and falsehood that has inundated them over the last three months , began today before judge lance a ito this afternoon , 15 weeks after nicole brown simpson and a friend , a waiter named ronald l goldman , were slashed and stabbed to death in the brentwood section of los angeles and mr simpson was charged with the killings , judge ito and the lawyers in the case began reviewing the first jury candidates , culled from lists of drivers and registered voters in los angeles county of utmost concern at this stage were not attitudes toward guilt or innocence , but whether jurors could serve including some amount of sequestering , the judge said for what could be a sixmonth trial a preliminary questionnaire warns prospective jurors that the evidence may take until january to present and that deliberations could last another month the form lists state holidays through presidents day on feb 20 by the end of the day , 119 of 218 prospects were excused and at least 97 remained the judge wants a group of 250 to question on the more substantive level to groans from those he called the survivors in the jury pool those not excluded for hardship judge ito handed out 75page questionnaires , prepared by him and lawyers for both sides judge ito will do most of the questioning for bias , though he said today that he would allow the lawyers to question jury candidates for a limited period of time , something that promises to make the selection process more arduous still just how far jury selection will proceed for now became unclear today when the district attorney s office filed a motion asking judge ito to delay questioning of prospective jurors until the court ruled on the admissibility of dna evidence hearings on such evidence , which could tie mr simpson to the crime scene through samples of his blood , are expected to last a month , during which the jurors would be home the prosecution contends that jurors would surely be buffeted , and tainted , by everything they read and hear about the case and that even questioning them again , as the court has proposed , would not guard against prejudice the simpson case has become a regular topic of conversation in every venue , as well as a daily presence in the tabloid newspapers displayed in every book stand and supermarket , the prosecution argued in its motion to expect all members of the jury to assiduously avoid all these sources of contamination is to expect the impossible that some of the jurors will be deemed unfit is almost a foregone conclusion the likelihood of a mistrial is overwhelming judge ito did not rule immediately on the prosecution request , which the defense is expected to oppose when the first prospective jurors met the judge in a woodpaneled assembly room two flights above his courtroom in los angeles county superior court , he told them i 've never seen a case as unusual as this this is probably the most important decision you will make in your personal life i need a fair jury moments earlier , the judge introduced mr simpson and the lawyers to the group mr simpson stood up and said , good afternoon , to them after 82 of the candidates were excused for hardship leaving the pool more white and older than it was originally judge ito began questioning others whose hardship pleas were more debatable the first was juror 32 the number mr simpson wore for the buffalo bills during much of his spectacular career on the gridiron i do n't know if this is an omen , the judge said to that , mr simpson smiled and nodded his head the juror , a white woman , will stay in the pool as the potential jurors filed in , mr simpson sang a song with the lyrics a new day has begun under his breath then , with mr simpson sitting eight feet or so away , judge ito began questioning the possible jurors about their ability to hear the case most did not look directly at the defendant , but he looked directly at them mr simpson , who faces life in prison if convicted , appeared cheery , almost carefree as he entered court this morning wearing a blue suit , he smiled frequently , joked with security guards , rolling his head and stretching his neck , and turned often to assay the gallery under normal circumstances , the prospect of living in virtual isolation , away from family and friends , for months at a shot , would send potential jurors running for cover but only 91 said they could not serve under any circumstances some cited illness , some family obligations , some both like a diabetic woman with a husband with heart problems and an 85yearold mother to tend to both sides said they wanted to question the woman further yet , the judge ito said enthusiasm for serving on the simpson jury ran considerably higher than in previous longrunning , highprofile trials one man told the judge that serving on the jury would cut into his savings , but even after the judge tried to dissuade him , the man said he still wanted to serve and he remained in contention among those who were not enthusiastic about sitting in the case , one man told judge ito that he suffered from high blood pressure what kind of things aggravated his condition \? judge ito asked him things like this , the man replied the judge also warned the prospects that reporters might be review their answers and that anyone who wanted to keep information confidential should give him a note i do n't think you should have to sacrifice the sanctity of your personal life for this case , he said none of the prospective jurors have been identified and none have been picked the selection process is being covered by three pool reporters in an unusual arrangement state law bars televising the jury selection process , or voir dire judge ito offered no word today on when he would hold a hearing on the conduct of reporters in the case on friday , after a second day of broadcasts of what he called erroneous reports on the case by a local television station , he threatened to terminate media coverage today , judge ito seemed conciliatory toward reporters , suggesting that the huge audience counting on continued televised proceedings of the most widely publicized case in history need not worry in yet another indication of the simpson case s wide reach , gov pete wilson of california signed into law three bills generated , at least in part , by publicity one makes it illegal for witnesses and jurors to sell their stories until the completion of a case the others seek to limit the statements of lawyers out of court and increase penalties for domestic violence the onslaught of journalists from at least 75 news organizations from around the world prompted the radio and television news association , coordinator of the trial coverage , to rent a parking lot across the street for 40plus satellite trucks and airconditioned doublewide trailers straddling the vehicles are massive wood and iron scaffolds built to allow tv networks and their affiliates to tape their reports away from courthouse crowds with downtown as a backdrop photo television news crews set up gear on the web of scaffolding put up for the coverage of the oj simpson murder trial across the street from

washington , dec 4 a rare form of epilepsy that fails to respond to most treatments appears to be caused by abnormal immune system activity , a report from the duke university medical center says , and the researchers say the finding could lead to new therapy the report was delivered today at the annual meeting of the american epilepsy society in new orleans the researchers said the rare form of epilepsy , rasmussen s encephalitis , appeared to result when a patient s immune system attacks his own brain cells the scientists said their finding was the first indication that a form of epilepsy was an autoimmune disease , one in which the immune system that normally attacks foreign tissue or germs turns on the host to assault normal tissue multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and some forms of diabetes are autoimmune diseases rasmussen s encephalitis often strikes children under 10 , causing severe , frequent epileptic seizures and eventually leading to dementia and paralysis on one side of the body rasmussen s is one of the rarest forms of epilepsy , a family of neurological disorders resulting from damaged cells in the brain an estimated 25 million americans are afflicted with a form of epilepsy , but rasmussen s accounts for fewer than 1 percent of the cases about 2 , 000 cases of rasmussen s have been diagnosed in the united states in the 40 years since it has been recognized as a distinct disease experts say rasmussen s is particularly intractable to treatment the disease does not respond well to antiseizure medicine and the only treatment as it progresses is removal of large sections of the brain , with the resulting disabilities , experts say dr james o mcnamara and dr p ian andrews of duke , and dr scott w rogers of the university of utah , found that patients with rasmussen s had antibodies in their bodies targeted against a specific set of brain proteins called glutamate receptor glur3 researchers tested rasmussen s patients for the antibodies after dr rogers noticed that rabbits stimulated to generate antibodies to these brain proteins became ill and developed epileptic seizures an examination of brain tissue from these rabbits showed that it was strikingly similar to tissue from human patients with rasmussen s , the scientists said the duke researchers found the antibodies to glur3 in all patients with active rasmussen s , but none in a control group of children who were healthy or had other forms of epilepsy or other brain diseases suspecting that removal of the antibodies might ameliorate symptoms of the disease , the researchers did so , using a blood separation technique called plasmaphersis they found that one girl with severe rasmussen s experienced significant , rapid improvement after the treatment , resulting in improved brain function and a temporary respite from her frequent seizures another child , more mildly affected , also showed transient improvement after the treatment dr andrews said in an interview that the bloodcleansing technique provided only a temporary solution because the body soon begins to generate antibodies again but he said it might find limited use in arresting severe , degenerating cases so that patients would have some temporary relief and doctors would get a chance to try alternative medications and treatments the body should not make antibodies that eat up its own brain but , knowing this happens , it should point to other strategies for treatment , dr andrews said , perhaps we can find a way to selectively remove the bad antibody or develop a substance to block its activity

mexico city , aug 19 she knows the majority of mexican voters are women , and she knows they have a crucial role to play in sunday s presidential election , but consuela ramirez ca n't help but feel that none of the candidates has done more than pay them lip service there has been very little focus on ideas of importance to women , very little , said mrs ramirez , a 46yearold psychologist from merida she wore a long white embroidered dress called a hipil that is traditional in her home state of yucatan , and she carried a cellular telephone for making business calls there is a change taking place in mexico as regards women , she said but it s taking place very slowly , while the demands are growing at a much greater pace the platforms have nothing to do with meeting those demands this year , more than ever before , every major presidential candidate courted the women s vote , declaring in slogans and speeches that women s needs have not been met but when it came to addressing concerns like the lack of educational opportunities and representation in politics , concrete proposals were almost nonexistent there was a time not too long ago , political analysts say , when the only women s issue important to candidates was insuring that welfare programs handed out enough milk before election day to remind women that the governing party would provide for their families since women received the right to vote in 1953 , the ruling institutional revolutionary party , or pri , indeed seems to have had a lock on their support strength in numbers but as mexico becomes less authoritarian and more open , with growing numbers of professional women like mrs ramirez , the pri and the main opposition parties have had to work harder to win the support of women , who represent 51 percent of the population and 52 percent of the 457 million registered voters women have suffered discrimination , prejudice and even violence , is this just \? the pri presidential candidate , ernesto zedillo ponce de leon , bellowed on tuesday to thousands of women gathered for one of his last campaign rallies in the central city of irapuato in reality , women do n't have the same rights as men even though the constitution guarantees it is this just \? to both questions , the women in the crowd shouted noooo ! a lack of specifics among the other leading candidates , diego fernandez de cevallos has focused on the family as a bulwark of society , and cuauhtemoc cardenas has stressed women s importance but for many women , the proposals share a thread of insincerity we 're all worried about this situation , said claudia barron , 27 , a lawyer in mexico city the candidates always say yes , they will do what we ask but it s only a promise they always end up saying that there are problems more important than ours one reason for that , many mexican women say , is that so few women have won or are running for political office of the 500 members of the lower house of the legislature , only 40 are women in the 64member senate , women hold just 4 seats only three women have ever served as state governors in all mexican history and only two women have served in the cabinet of the current president , carlos salinas de gortari there are more women than ever running for legislative seats in the election on sunday , but they still account for only a small percentage of candidates a study by anna fernandez poncela , an anthropologist with the interdisciplinary program of women s studies at the colegio de mexico , showed that women make up only 17 percent of the majorparty candidates for the lower house and 15 of those for the senate compared to other elections , women are advancing this year , dr fernandez said but they are advancing very , very little for many women , the fundamental issue is equality , meaning equal access to education and jobs even though the mexican congress passed a version of an equal rights amendment in 1975 , cultural restraints make it harder for women to attend college or break into the professional ranks many families feel that education in general , and higher education in particular , is wasted on girls and women , who are expected to simply marry and stay at home in the decades when women in the united states and other countries made great strides in entering the work force , the figures for mexican women hardly changed though they have made inroads in the professional fields , only 196 percent of women worked outside the home in 1990 when they said equality , they meant it in a traditional sense , that the husbands should help out in the house , that sort of thing , said amalia ojeda sosa , a 27yearold lawyer from merida for the majority of women who play the role of tending house and children in a sternly macho mexican world , the critical issues are health , access to basic education , and birth control the illiteracy rate for women in mexico is 15 percent , compared to 96 percent for men , abortion is illegal in mexico , though a report released this week by the alan guttmacher institute of new york estimated that 533 , 100 abortions were performed there in 1990 all the major candidates oppose legalization of abortion but have tried to skirt the issue mr zedillo has rarely talked about it mr cardenas of the leftist democratic revolutionary party says he would submit the issue to a public referendum mr fernandez of the rightofcenter national action party adopts the position of the vatican and opposes any attempt to legalize abortion the woman running as the workers party candidate seems to have had trouble with the issue cecilia soto said she is against legalizing it even though her party , the workers party , endorses legalized abortion still , miss soto seems to have won the support of many mexican women the only candidate that i can say has really reached my concerns is cecilia soto , said patricia lopez mancera , a hotel executive in cancun she s intelligent , she s a lady and she s going to have my vote the campaign has been marked by missteps and miscues , some of them offensive to many women in june , mr fernandez , a cigarsmoking lawyer with a reputation for being conservative on social issues , referred to women as the viajerio , which is interpreted in some circles as a casual term of endearment , like the ladies , and in other circles as an insult , like saying the old biddies 'gigantic' machismo mr fernandez said he was only trying to be informal but many women saw the remark as a reflection of his true feelings about women his level of machismo is gigantic , said laura maria cruz lara , 32 , a sociologist in merida she said she was disturbed by reports that mr fernandez would not allow his wife to cut her hair short if he controls his wife in such a way , just imagine what that would mean for the rest of the population , she said many women say they find mr cardenas most sympathetic to their ideas , though he has not put forward very specific proposals i do n't want to appear like a publicist for cardenas , but he is the one who inspires the most confidence , said benita galeana , 90 , a pioneer in women s rights who has been fighting for the cause since the 1930 s women say that they are encouraged by the critical role played in his campaign by rosario ibarra de piedra , who in 1982 was the first women to run for president in mexico she gave a keynote speech at mr cardenas s huge rally in mexico city last weekend photos consuelo ramirez , psychologist , 46 , there is a change taking place in mexico as regards women but it s taking place very slowly , while the demands are growing at a much greater pace \( keith dannemiller for the new york times \) cecilia soto , workers party candidate for president , 44 on abortion as a woman , i do n't like the idea of decriminalizing it but neither does it seem fair to punish a woman who in an extremely difficult situation has chosen it

oyer , norway , feb 26 when vreni schneider of switzerland looked down the steep , sunny mountain from her starting position this afternoon , the finish line and her medal chances in the women s slalom seemed quite a distance away she was in fifth place after the first run this morning , a relatively large 68hundredths of a second behind the leader , katja koren of slovenia and now schneider faced the final run , and the last race of her olympic career if she could win a fifth olympic medal , it would make her the most decorated female skier in olympic alpine history i did n't feel i could make the gold when i went to the starting line for the second run , she said but i also knew it was not impossible she faced stiff competition from her archrival , pernilla wiberg of sweden , who was second after the first run and who earlier this week had beaten her for the gold in the combined from the 18yearold koren , and from elfriede eder of austria and garbriela zinger of switzerland , who were also ahead of her going into the second run schneider , 29 , had won gold medals in the slalom and giant slalom in the 1988 calgary olympics , and in these games she had won a silver in the combined and a bronze in the giant slalom but as she prepared to make her second run , the race most clearly in her mind took place last feb 5 at sierra nevada , spain there , she was behind by a large margin and skied to victory i thought of that , she said , and realized i could do the same thing here i was nervous when i broke out from the start , but i said to myself , 'attack the gates , attack , attack , attack ! ' and she did sometimes , when i'm going down the slope , i have a feeling inside of how fast i'm going when the gates come up to meet me , i know i'm going too slow when i attack the gates , i am going fast and on the second run \? i went so hard i was unprepared when the finish line came up , she said before i knew it the race was over she was delighted when she saw her time on the scoreboard it was 5633 seconds , the fastest time of the day her total was 1 5601 , and put her in first place while seven women have won two gold medals in alpine skiing , none had won three until schneider today this was also switzerland s first alpine olympic victory since 1988 eder took the silver medal , 34hundredths of a second behind schneider flaking out koren won the bronze , beating out wiberg by 7hundredths of a second it was slovenia s second medal in these olympics , and the second in its history , or since it declared independence from the former yugoslav republic in 1991 when koren saw what she had accomplished , she jumped into the arms of her teammate , alenka dovzan , who had won a bronze on monday in the alpine combined the two women rolled in the snow together with joy it is our tradition , explained koren the medals at these games made up for schneider s disappointments in the 1992 albertville olympics , in which she fell in the giant slalom and managed a poor seventh in the slalom although she admitted that had been a painful experience , she said that one must learn to accept defeat it is part of our job , she said there was also a poignant significance to eder s medal , the first women s alpine skiing medal for austria in these olympics i felt it was very important for our team , and for me , to win , she said , because of our memory of ulli ulrike maier , at 26 and considered the skiing mom of the austrian team , was killed on jan 29 in a downhill race i was home when i heard this , said eder , and everything just went black in my head it was unbelievable she was so devastated , she said , that she thought of quitting skiing ulli meant very much to me she was very nice , and i looked up to her but i remembered that ulli was a fighter and i thought i must fight in life , you have to keep on fighting , no matter what carrie sheinberg of port washington , li julie parisien of sugarloaf , me , and monique pelletier of hood river , ore , were 18th , 19th and 20th , more than four seconds off the lead eva twardokens of santa cruz , calif , fell in the second run photos vreni schneider of switzerland on her way to winning the gold yesterday in the women s slalom \( barton silverman the new york times \) vreni schneider , left , of switzerland , and elfi eder of austria celebrat ing their medals yesterday in the women s slalom \( reuters \)
to the editor i visited cuba in june 1977 , when president carter briefly lifted the ban on travel there i went quite by chance , on the greek cruise ship daphne , having heard of a lowcost luxury voyage what i saw astounded me i will mention only a few examples every block had a severalfoothigh thermometer on the sidewalk , indicating the percentage of residents of all ages who had become literate blocks competed with one another in time the percentage rose to 95 percent havana s main boulevards , once the place of palaces for the privileged or brothels , were children s homes , schools or hospitals when i took a cab for a drive around town , i said to the driver your city looks so poor was it not better under batista \? he replied under batista , one man had a thousand shirts , and most people had none now every man has one shirt i think that instead of trying to starve the people into accepting our ways , it might be better to learn some of their ways sara dolgin brooklyn , nov 10 , 1994
our waiter tonight in this cool , beautiful room has the slightly frowning , preoccupied air of a young intern he has a haughty doctor s demeanor , too he acts as if we are extremely lucky to have his attention the fact is , we do n't have it all that often the service is agonizingly slow this is a surprise lunch here has always been a delight but now we order aquavit all around and sit watching as the bright liquid is delivered to the adjoining tables in tiny triangular glasses it takes a long time for our drinks to arrive , and when they do they are hardly worth the wait the cranberry version glows through the glass like some wonderfully rosy christmas libation , but it does not taste nearly so good as it looks the lemonlime version is filled with the bitter flavor of citrus peel the vanilla aquavit is clear , but the liquid lacks even the aroma of the bean if aquavit is what you 're after , best to have it straight of course , it would taste better with a little something to eat but we gobbled up all the delicious salmon mousse while we were waiting for the drinks , and bread does not seem to be in our immediate future it does , in fact , show up 40 minutes later , but by then we finally have some real food to consider meanwhile , we sit contemplating the room with a ceiling that soars toward the sky , visible through the wall of windows , it should be calm the soft whoosh of the water from the interior waterfall should make it even more peaceful but we are seated in the back of the room , where we feel crushed by the sheer number of diners crowded into the space mostly men in somber suits , they are a sobering sight they are not noisy exactly , but somehow we find it difficult to hear one another what \? we keep shouting into the dead air above our table it is a relief when the food finally arrives this is scandinavian fare , and i have been looking forward to the buckwheat blini , which come with three caviars the roe form a rainbow on the plate , glistening piles of black , pink and bright orange but the blini themselves are fat , dense and so yeasty that their flavor , even tempered by creme fraiche , overwhelms the flavor of the fish eggs the herring sampler offers a better pairing of flavors the fish , in guises from pickled to fried , comes with tangy vasterbotten cheese they are both so strong that the tastes ricochet off each other in a very pleasing manner the gravlax has strong flavors too the cured fish , soft as satin , is paired with mustard so sweet it sets your teeth on edge somehow , it seems right after all these forceful tastes , the less intense appetizers all seem slightly wimpy the creamy seafood bisque , the pretty shrimp salad with its threads of beets and daikon and its little snow pea garnish , the thin slices of smoked goose the entrees can also be divided between the strong and the meek the chimneysmoked lobster , served in a bowl of consomme spiced with tarragon and tomatoes , is a perfect example of how to bury a delicate piece of seafood in strong flavors the poached strips of sole , on the other hand , are just some timid pieces of fish in a creamy sauce laced with oysters ovenbaked turbot is on the dull side , too and the oncewonderful panfried arctic char , topped with fried greens and served in a tomatosaffron broth , has been replaced with cod , making the dish slightly dreary both salmon dishes , however , are terrific one is sauteed with bacon and lentils , and is served in a redwine sauce it is a wonderfully balanced plate of food the other is seared and spiced and served with artichokes , which add an interesting note but desserts are a letdown the baba savarin is just a pile of sweet stuff on a plate cloudberry mousse , despite its poetically seductive name , turns out to be an airy , apricotcolored foam sandwiched in millefeuilles as brittle as crackers the berries are aptly named , for the flavor is as fugitive as clouds creme brulee comes with an orange salad it is nice enough , but there does not seem to be any compelling reason for these two dishes to be brought together at the next table a man spills a glass of sambuca , and the licorice scent floats across the table , pungent , insistent , a reminder of how little we have to capture our attention over here just then our waiter shows up , frowning again can i get you something else \? he asks , as if we have imposed upon him long enough we decide we have and leave at lunch time aquavit seems like a different restaurant light pours in through the windows , making the room seem spacious and imperturbably calm people seem to talk serious business in hushed voices , and the service , over the course of many visits , has always been swift and solicitous much of the food is better , too those blini , which have been dense and awkward every time i have had them at dinner , are light at lunch they are still thick and puffy , but the yeast is now so retiring that the flavor is a perfect foil for the roe of bleak , a whitefish maatjes herring in aquavit is nice too , although the flavor of the liquor outpunches the fish , and the spice is so forward that when i taste it i think , gingerbread ! it comes with a dish of boiled potatoes

tulsa , okla , aug 12 nick price , eloquently and forcefully stating his case for designation as the best golfer on the planet , wrapped one hand around the pga championship today after 36 holes he has a fivestroke lead , larger than any halfway lead in the 76year history of the event and he shows no signs of wilting price , 37 , is so hot that he makes tulsa seem cool he went around the steamy southern hills country club in 65 shots , leaving him at eightunderpar 132 he is five strokes ahead of corey pavin , jay haas and ben crenshaw and well on his way to winning his second straight major championship driving the ball straight and long he averaged 303 yards off the tee and making every putt he needed , price flawlessly pierced the heart of the treelined southern hills layout it was a bravura performance , a bogeyfree round no sweat in 94degree heat but price is as cautious in assessing his position as he has been bold on the course the past two days a lot of people i 've spoken to already have assumed that i'm going to win , price said i'm not saying that for one minute i 've been in this game long enough to know there s still an awful lot of golf to be played and an awful lot of ground for the rest of the field to make up price , who won the british open last month at turnberry , is one of golf s better frontrunners the last time he had a fivestroke lead after 36 holes was at the million dollar challenge in south africa in december he won by 12 strokes i do n't know what it s going to take to slow nick down , said pavin , whose round of 67 also included no bogeys he s playing great right now he s the best player in the world , no question about it but we 're only at the halfway point and it s not going to be easy pavin is probably correct none of the four players in pga championship history who had fourstroke leads after 36 holes tommy aaron in 1967 , gil morgan in 1976 , tom watson in 1978 and greg norman in 1986 were able to win the tournament but none of those players were playing then the way price is now , or the way he has since his breakthrough victory in the 1992 pga championship the numbers are almost mindboggling since that victory at bellerive country club in st louis , price has been golf s equivalent of a 500 hitter in baseball in 60 starts he has won 15 times and finished in the top five 28 times over the last 18 months , he has won more than 4 million eight topfive finishes this year , he has five victories in 16 starts and eight topfive finishes he has come within one stroke of winning two other events , the nestle invitational at bay hill in orlando , fla where the south africanborn price keeps a residence with his wife and two daughters and the federal express st jude classic in memphis a golfer finishing in the top five in half his starts is a startling level of consistency for comparison , norman , the player who is still ranked no 1 in the sony world rankings , has been in the top five six times in 15 events the field took advantage of softer , slower greens to post some startling numbers today haas , who has never won a major championship , roared into contention by shooting 30 on the back nine for a 66 blaine mccallister , who started the day four over par , tore into southern hills for a 64 and is in contention at 138 , two under greens hold iron shots water was applied to the greens because they were drying out and speeding up to unacceptable levels they measured 11 on the stimpmeter , a device that measures green speed , at the close of thursday s play , and there were some dry spots appearing what the players in the morning portion of the field found when they teed off today were greens that were holding iron shots like a catcher s mitt when i walked on the first green yesterday afternoon my spikes skated , mccallister said this afternoon , they actually went in the ground we were really surprised at how much softer it was turning price loose on soft , receptive greens is like hanging a curveball in front of the white sox slugger frank thomas somebody is in for a big hurt when that happens , and today that was exactly what price applied to southern hills and the rest of the field praise from competitors he stuck an 8iron to the velcro surface at the third hole from the rough , made the 20footer for birdie and was off and running he birdied the 10th hole from 15 feet , the 12th from three feet , the 13th from 12 feet and the 16th from 10 feet he was stopping 4iron shots as if they were sand wedges this is the kind of performance that competitors have a tendency to notice crenshaw , whose 67 was hardly shabby , was taken aback by price s play he s striking the ball as good as anyone since byron nelson and ben hogan , crenshaw said he s magnificent to watch he s a man in full flight chip shots it was n't easy for everyone on friday colin montgomerie of scotland , who was tied with price for the lead when the day began , reversed the numbers in his score from 67 on thursday to 76 on friday and essentially shot himself out of the championship he was in surprisingly good humor , however do n't laugh at my golf , he said it is n't funny besides , it would be boring to shoot 67 every day arnold palmer said goodbye to the pga after 37 straight appearances , holing a putt at the last hole for a par and a round of 74 and a total of 153 palmer has taken a total of 8 , 893 strokes in the pga dating to 1958 this is one that i wanted to win very badly , but i just never did , palmer said they gave me their distinguished service award , that i am very proud of , and the only thing i would be more proud of is winning this championship jack nicklaus , who shot 71 for a total of 150 , also missed the cut , as did the defending champion , paul azinger , who shot 74

juliana hatfield has a littlegirl voice , high and airy when she was the singer for the blake babies , she sounded fragile and kittenish but two albums into a solo career , she has grown tougher and more complicated when she led the juliana hatfield three at the academy on friday night , she moved from the delicacy of folkrock to the muscle of heavy metal , her vulnerability now balanced by selfassertion and flashes of anger ms hatfield s songs encompass the contradictory choices and impulses facing the kinds of collegiate and postcollegiate women who seemed to be a majority of the audience the lyrics veer from aggressive sexuality to wounded pride , from enjoying artifice to longing for honesty , from chasing connections to retreating into isolation her firstperson narrators take chances , make mistakes , grow bewildered or get even shyness wrangles with passion in the choppy , driving this is the sound in supermodel , a rock waltz , ms hatfield asks , what s the big idea \? none of that stuff is even real amid the hardrock riffs of a dame with a rod , she avenges an abused woman the strippeddown trio format with ms hatfield on guitar , dean fisher on bass and todd phillips on drums keeps the songs taut and uncluttered some , like everybody loves me but you , verge on 1960 s pop others , like this is the sound and the suitelike , enigmatic president garfield , echo the asymmetrical structures of throwing muses true to alternativerock customs , ms hatfield did n't radiate much stage presence but by trading coyness for clarity in her songs , she has reached out to her listeners helium , which opened the concert , is a promising trio from massachusetts , led by mary timony on guitar most of its songs were stubbornly slow , with blunt guitar riffs and lyrics about not getting along there were touches of the pixies and the pretenders , but helium had its own kind of cantankerousness dig , which followed helium , couched existential pronouncements we do n't care all the time in routine alternative rock , using three guitars to build up a semblance of grunge

new delhi , nov 1 indian police officers freed three british tourists today when they stormed the hideout of kashmiri militants in a remote village in northern india an american was freed in a separate police raid on monday the four tourists , held for two weeks , suffered no injuries in the police raids , but two policemen and a militant were killed in the predawn shootout that freed the britons the three britons and bela joseph nuss , the 43yearold american freed in the earlier raid , had been threatened with beheading by the militants if the indian government refused the kidnappers' demands for the release of 10 kashmiri militants held in indian jails for india , the kidnappings marked what could be an ominous turning point in the struggle over jammu and kashmir , the only muslim majority state in predominantly hindu india muslim guerrillas have tied down more than 500 , 000 indian troops and police in a fiveyearold struggle against indian rule in the state more than 17 , 000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict although there have been previous kidnappings of indians and foreigners during the kashmir struggle , none had previously taken place outside the disputed territory , which is situated in india s far north , sandwiched between china and pakistan after the freed tourists told the police that they were lured out of new delhi by strangers offering to show them indian village life , police squads began touring inexpensive hotels in the city today warning foreign backpackers against accepting such offers the incident also suggested a growing role for militants with links to hardline muslim groups that developed during the guerrilla war in afghanistan indian officials said that al hadid , the militant group that delivered kidnap notes to the offices of the bbc and the voice of america in new delhi on monday , appeared to draw its members from muslim fundamentalists in afghanistan and pakistan the group was not previously known to have been active in kashmir , the officials said the police acknowledged that the breakthrough on monday came by chance , when policemen conducting a routine robbery investigation in a village outside ghaziabad , 25 miles east of new delhi , stumbled across the house where mr nuss , who is from walnut creek , calif , had been held questioning of two muslim men arrested in the monday incident led the police to the second hideout , at a village outside saharanpur , 90 miles north of new delhi after being flown to new delhi in an indian air force plane , the three britons , paul ridout , christopher cranston and rhys partridge , all in their late 20 s , said that they , like mr nuss , had been shackled throughout their captivity we were chained to the floor like animals , mr partridge said diplomats from britain and the united states said they would be asking the indian authorities why they were not told of the kidnappings before the kidnappers delivered notes to the two news organizations on monday a senior official of india s home ministry , kantipudi padmanabhaiah , said at a news conference after the tourists were freed that the indian police had known of the kidnappings since friday , eight days after the four men disappeared the diplomats speculated that the kidnappers seized the foreigners as part of a wider effort to draw britain and the united states into the kashmir conflict on the militants' side although both governments have been critical of what they have described as human rights abuses by both sides in the kashmir struggle , they have sought not to become embroiled in a conflict that has origins in the partition of india in 1947 , when pakistan and india dispatched troops to kashmir in the first of two wars they have fought over the territory
tokyo , april 8 prime minister morihiro hosokawa s announcement today that he would resign sent his governing coalition scrambling to form a new government and to salvage at least some of the economic and political reforms mr hosokawa promised when he took office last year mr hosokawa s sudden resignation nonetheless appeared to usher in a new period of political instability that japanese and american officials feared could slow , and possibly derail , his program to empower consumers and urban voters and deregulate a country choking on bureaucracy emerging as a frontrunner as a successor to mr hosokawa was tsutomu hata , the foreign minister and deputy prime minister , who is also known as a champion of reform but is regarded as less articulate and politically appealing throughout the country , there was a palpable sense of disappointment that mr hosokawa , a 56yearold former governor of a southern prefecture who took office promising to rid the political system of corruption , had fallen prey to precisely the kind of financial scandals he had denounced with his informal style and attacks on vested interests , mr hosokawa swept into office on a wave of demands for change among voters tired of nearly four decades of rule by the liberal democratic party , which was seen as protective of the bureaucracy and big business in japan he achieved a sweeping change of japan s electoral system , including new curbs on campaign contributions and a vast redistricting that promised to make elections more open and competitive he also opened japanese rice markets to imports for the first time and apologized to the country s asian neighbors for japan s aggression in world war ii but in recent months , under increasing attack , mr hosokawa lost his focus and was quickly overrun by many of the forces he was trying to combat his approval ratings suffered , although at a current level of around 50 percent , his popularity remained high by japanese standards supporters of mr hosokawa insisted today that he had begun an unstoppable tide toward economic and political reform , and that it would continue no matter who is chosen but they acknowledged that their first mission now is political survival the governing coalition consists of some rebels who broke from the liberal democratic party , along with the socialists and members of smaller longtime opposition parties there were many predictions today that the coalition could splinter apart in the battle to find a successor to mr hosokawa such a step that could even bring the liberal democrats back to power , although most analysts regarded the chances of that as remote also considered remote were the chances of a new election mr hosokawa , appearing at a news conference today , had lost his usual selfconfident air i sincerely apologize to the people of japan , he said many reforms are still under way and have not been completed , and my role will now be different but i will continuously work toward the fruition of the goals we set the man who came to office with a reputation as japan s cleanest politician left many questions unanswered about his financial connections to a trucking company , tokyo sagawa kyubin , that spent much of the 1980 s buying influence from the country s leading politicians the company has also been linked indirectly to japanese gangsters mr hosokawa took what he described as a loan of nearly 1 million from the company in 1982 though he insisted that he had paid back the principal , he conceded today for the first time that he did not pay the interest on the loan instead , the interest was diverted and used for my political activities , he said he said he had decided to resign after receiving other specifics about how his office had let an old personal friend of mine , whom he did not identify , profit from the management of other political funds when he served as governor of kumamoto prefecture , in southwestern japan many of the details remained vague , and it was unclear whether any laws were broken nor was it clear that mr hosokawa had been trying to cover up or simply had been misled by his staff the clinton administration had invested heavily in mr hosokawa s success , and counted on him to bring about reforms that would make japan s markets far more open the disappointment today was evident in the face of walter f mondale , the american ambassador here i'm very sad , the former vice president said i liked hosokawa , i consider him a friend , and i feel very sorry for him here is a guy who offered a new japan , mr mondale continued he appealed to the young he had a kennedyesque appeal he talked about political reform , administrative reform , opening japan to the world , finally responding to the consumers there was such hope here was the fresh political persona , coming from prefectural politics , and ending up in charge of a system that needed so many changes possible scenarios cited amid the chaotic juggling

the burning of books leads ineluctably to the burning of heretics freedom of conscience is a protection for all believers , to the disadvantage of none when preachers enter politics , scruple sometimes flies out the door it has taken centuries for western societies to absorb these lessons , whose value is periodically underscored here at home by an outburst of religious zealotry such as the killing in florida of a physician by a foe of abortion rights , to demonstrate the sanctity of life similar acts , in other parts of the world , have been inspired by what is too sweepingly called islamic fundamentalism every great religion derives its strength from fundamentals , and in that sense every believer is a fundamentalist rather call it crafty fanaticism when clergymen with a political agenda agitate to execute alleged blasphemers , now including christians and in countries where this is happening bangladesh , pakistan and iran religious bigotry is in fact a deadly weapon in a worldly power struggle in bangladesh , which once prided itself on traditions of tolerance , the most conspicuous target is a feminist novelist , taslima nasrin , who is threatened with death by islamic radicals and with a blasphemy trial by a rattled government the lesspublicized targets are nonconforming newspaper editors and aid groups like the renowned grameen bank , whose offense is to give small loans to rural women scores of journalists have been jailed for unislamic practices , while mobs take direct action , bombing houses and wrecking offices , as related in a report by human rights watch asia in pakistan , prosecutors use blasphemy laws , carrying capital sentences , against christians and adherents of the ahmadiyya , a minority faith some christians have died in custody others face execution , according to a detailed amnesty international report as in bangladesh , a moderate government , also led by a politically vulnerable woman , is challenged by militant religious radicals claiming a divine right to rule and threatened by women s newfound access to power , whether political or literary rather than fight , both governments have gone along with blasphemy prosecutions granted , compared with iran , these sanctions are mild since seizing power in 1979 , iran s clerical rulers have executed tens of thousands , and made life miserable for 350 , 000 followers of the bahai faith ayatollah khomeini has been succeeded as spiritual dictator by ayatollah khameini , whose hardline zealotry prevails over the cautious pragmatism of president rafsanjani ominously , islamic radicals elsewhere especially in the sudan , egypt and algeria take their cue from teheran s ayatollahs hence the sinister implications of a new wave of repression directed against 80 , 000 iranian christians , three of whose leaders have been killed this year the search for new victims and fresh heresies has been a proven means in iran of deflecting discontent with joblessness , inflation and clerical corruption the savage mistreatment of christians conflicts with guarantees in iran s constitution , just as obligatory bribes for mullahs shame the religious pretensions of the islamic republic president rafsanjani needs to know that these persecutions are noticed , that there is deep concern about the perilous example iran is setting , and that iran cannot hope for more normal relations with the west by showing such flagrant contempt for universal norms of tolerance
suburbia , eric bogosian s new play , takes place in front of the 7eleven in a town called burnfield do not think that name was picked out of a hat it is a clear declaration of mr bogosian s artistic intent in this scathing study of rootless youth , he practices a scorchedearth policy the third offering in the festival of new american plays that lincoln center theater has been holding this season in the mitzi e newhouse theater , suburbia recounts a night and the morning after in what one character calls the pizza and puke capital of the world and that qualifies as a delicate utterance in a work as ferocious as mr bogosian s own oneman shows in fact , any of the seven 20something characters , for whom the 7eleven parking lot is home away from home , could be turned into a bogosian monologue their abiding concerns , after all , are sex , drugs and rockandroll they rant and rage against a society that strikes them as so much spiritual oatmeal granted , none of them end up pounding nails in the floor with their foreheads , as the author did in his most recent solo outing but they hurl themselves furiously against one another , bounce off the concrete walls and career into the dumpster that serves no apparent use , since they throw their empty beer cans and uneaten junk food directly on the pavement they are not a pretty bunch however , they are acted with such terrifying truth by a perfect cast that you watch in horror and fascination and , yes , even sorrow at the aimlessness of their wasted lives if mr bogosian is following a chekhovian blueprint , it is chekhov high on speed and twinkies the director , robert falls , allows the characters their fuzzy dreams and their sour prejudices , but he never lets them off the hook they 're damned he knows it and in the end , they probably do , too the nihilism of suburbia is right in keeping with the festival of new american plays as a whole early in the season , howard korder plunged us deep into the moral corruption of the city in the lights then , in the musical hello again , michael john la chiusa reduced the joy of sex to the frenzy of copulation mr bogosian may concentrate on the gang at the 7eleven , awaiting the return of pony , their high school comrade who has since become a minor rock sensation but the emptiness of an american way of life is his underlying concern derek mclane s set is such an authentic piece of photorealism that you can imagine , just offstage , all the aluminumsided tract houses with their wishfully named family rooms although the festival has come up with some of this season s most compelling dramatic fare , nobody would pretend it s cheering stuff the only thing honorable about tim \( tim guinee \) , an alcoholic with a short fuse , is the discharge he got from the air force after he accidentally cut off the tip of a finger while doing kp jeff \( josh hamilton \) , the wouldbe intellectual , has n't quite dropped out of community college , but he s down to a single course the history of nicaragua buff \( steve zahn \) pretends to be a video artist , having stolen a camcorder at the mall , which he aims at the television set , clouds , his mother praying , whatever mr zahn , who gave a similarly arresting performance in october at playwrights horizons in sophistry , combines two qualities , a blissful flakiness and a volcanic recklessness , that should cancel each other out but do n't he s a tornado of imbecility , art carney for the 90 s , or , as one character describes him , a postmodern idiot savant the women in suburbia are hardly more together an aspiring feminist performance artist with the torn hose to prove it , sooze \( martha plimpton \) sees herself as the next karen finley , if she can only escape to new york beebee \( wendy hoopes \) , freshly sprung from a drug rehabilitation center , does n't nurture any ambitions at all surviving another day takes all her energy already a ghost , she just has n't found the time to die eventually , pony \( zak orth \) shows up in a limousine \( i never saw a black one before , marvels sooze \) but despite the backclapping and the protestations of friendship , he s no longer the guy they knew he even travels with a press agent , erica \( babette renee props \) , california cool and bel air spoiled the play s major plot development involves erica , who likes to flirt with danger and does so this particular evening mostly , though , suburbia is one of those plays in which a lot goes on but nothing happens from the start , tempers are strained and frustrations acute a reprimand from the pakistani immigrants \( firdous e bamji and samia shoaib \) , who run the 7eleven and are trying as best they can to uphold the american dream , infuriates the youths but then so does a scalding slice of pizza or dopey television fare everyone blows up for some reason sooner or later curiously , the blanket volatility accounts for the play s major shortcoming a dramatic sameness \( mr bogosian s three favorite colors , you could say , are black , blacker and blackest \) any one segment of suburbia really tells you no more than the next shuffle them , and the script would not be grievously harmed it s the performances that rivet you to your seat scrappy and rebellious , ms plimpton recalls at one point the baby brother who wandered off and drowned in an icy river before the speech is over , she has become a lost child herself mr guinee is as disturbing as those vietnam vets who , one fine morning , machinegun a shopping center , except that he does n't have vietnam as an excuse mr hamilton s frayed decency may make him the good guy here , although he , too , comes dangerously close to snapping to single out specific performances is misleading , however this is an ensemble effort the cast members have that intuitive understanding of one another that is born of a shared past , common deceptions and the same taste in music you encounter it often in life , hardly ever on the stage raw as the material is , mr falls s superb direction is subtle and disciplined all the brawling , slovenly carryingson do n't overpower the unspoken yearnings mr bogosian s characters have for something better they are unlikely to find it , of course even the rock star admits that away is n't so great , either in suburbia , some basic american ethic has gone kerflooey by the conclusion , the parking lot is one big garbage dump , and kenneth posner s inquisitorial lighting seems to be singling out every piece of trash the best hope lies in abandoning burnfield and starting over someplace else someplace clean , unmarked and underpopulated but is n't that how the endless suburban sprawl came about to begin with \? suburbia by eric bogosian directed

albany , jan 4 a videotaped beating at a maximumsecurity prison in which two guards were filmed striking a handcuffed inmate as he grunted in pain has led to the dismissal of the two guards and the suspension of two others who filed a false report about the episode the two were fired because it was an unprovoked , unjustified attack , said william a babiskin , an independent labor arbitrator who upheld a state decision to dismiss the guards the inmate did n't do anything to deserve it the force was unnecessary and excessive horrible is the only way to describe what s on the tape , mr babiskin said it s really disgusting an important role correction officials said the incident was the latest in a growing number of cases in state prisons in which video cameras , installed as early as two decades ago , played an important role in 1990 the cameras led to the indictment of 10 guards accused of assaulting inmates at a prison near buffalo but the cameras are used more often to document prisoner attacks against correction officers , said james flateau , a spokesman for the state department of correctional services this most recent case occurred on sept 20 after a brawl on the recreational yard of the great meadow state prison in comstock , 60 miles north of albany as documented on the tape , two guards , korey gordon , 25 , and edward sharrow , 30 , can be seen striking an inmate , jason mcdade , 21 , with their batons mr gordon hit the inmate in the head once , in a blow that mr babiskin described as sounding like the crack of the bat mr sharrow was said to have hit mr mcdade , who was handcuffed behind his back , three times in the legs in the dark and grainy videotape , which the correction agency released today , mr mcdade can clearly be heard groaning after each blow on dec 31 , mr babiskin , acting as a legal umpire between the state and the correction officers' union , upheld the decision of the state correction commissioner , thomas a coughlin 3d , to dismiss the two officers mr coughlin had also dismissed two other officers who witnessed the beating but lied about what happened but mr babiskin reduced their punishment to suspension for several months each disciplinary hearings mr flateau took pains to say that such abuse was not rampant in the state prison system in a total work force of 28 , 000 people , 20 , 000 of whom are prison guards , only 30 to 40 correction employees face disciplinary hearings each year for abusing prisoners , he said but he said it was important to take action in such cases and make them public commissioner coughlin has had a longstanding policy that inmates will not be allowed to abuse officers , and officers will not be allowed to abuse inmates , he said both are ironclad policies he added that the department has not decided whether to pursue criminal charges against the two dismissed guards 'no justification' mr babiskin , who has broad experience in prison cases , said the beating of mr mcdade was out of the ordinary because it was apparently so blatant and unprovoked in almost every case i 've been involved in , it was selfdefense or coming to the aid of someone else , he said that s what makes this case so unusual there was no justification for this whatsoever he also compared the beating to those of rodney g king and reginald denny in the los angeles riots two years ago in that the case involved violence documented on videotape but there is no racial angle in this case all the guards and the inmate are white during the disciplinary hearings , the guards were represented by their union , council 82 of the security and law enforcement employees union there was no answer to telephone calls to their albany office seeking comment this afternoon , but a spokesman told the associated press earlier that they would have no comment the attack was filmed by one of four cameras , mounted near a prison storehouse , after a brawl in which mr mcdade was reportedly swinging a shirt weighted with an unidentified heavy object in statements and interviews after the fight , all four officers said mr dade , who was serving a 2 1 2to 7year sentence for burglary and forgery , was resisting efforts to subdue him the tape , however , does not appear to show any sign of a struggle mr babiskin said he relied heavily on the tapes in making his decision and specifically contrasted his approach to that of the first jury in the trial of the police officers accused of beating mr king i am not free to ignore the evidence or find 'ambiguity' where none exists , he wrote in a 25page decision upholding the dismissal of mr gordon and mr sharrow to protect their friends mr babiskin said he decided not to dismiss the other two guards seen escorting mr mcdade on the videotape because they did not strike the inmate and lied about the episode only to protect their friends he said the officer , ronald brochu , 37 , and arthur stevens , 31 , both with more than a decade with the department , were otherwise exemplary employees last march mr stevens saved the life of a critically ill inmate , he said in a decision based on seniority and work records , mr brochu was suspended without pay for nine months and mr stevens was suspended for six months led by mr stevens , all four employees , in hearings last week , admitted lying about the beating initially , mr babiskin said mr mcdade , who has a long criminal record , has since been paroled and has filed a notice of intent to sue the state because of the incident photo two guards are shown , at bottom , on a videotape , beating an inmate with batons at the great meadow state prison in comstock , ny the tape was used as evidence against the guards , who were dismissed two other guards were suspended \( associated

the daydreamer by ian mcewan illustrated by anthony browne 192 pp new york harpercollins publishers 14 \( ages 10 and up \) the epigraph to the daydreamer , the british novelist ian mcewan s first book for children , is from ovid s metamorphoses my purpose is to tell of bodies which have been transformed into shapes of a different kind it s an appropriate opening , since in the course of the daydreamer , mr mcewan s young hero , peter fortune , finds himself transformed , at least in his dreams , into a doll , a cat , a difficult baby and perhaps most harrowing of all a grownup peter is the sort of child who likes to spend his time lying on his back on a summer s afternoon , chewing a piece of grass and staring at the sky his parents consider this behavior worrisome little do they know that peter is fantasizing about a vanishing cream with which he can rub them out of existence as readers of his fiction for adults , especially the novels the innocent and black dogs , will testify , mr mcewan possesses a vivid imagination for the grotesque thus he is nowhere more successful in the daydreamer than when like his young hero he lets that imagination get the better of him it s hard to forget the bad doll \( sharply illustrated by anthony browne \) that belongs to peter s sister , kate , and that in the course of a chapter comes alive it was a pink that no human had ever been long ago its left leg and its right arm had been wrenched from their sockets , and from the top of its pitted skull grew one thick hank of black hair also memorable is peter s experience of the world from a baby s perspective , after he and his infant cousin , kenneth , switch bodies tears were pouring down his face , and he was just drawing breath to fill his lungs and bawl out his sorrow when something powerful clamped under his armpits and he shot 50 feet into the air he was staring into his aunt laura s face , which was as sheer and colossal as a cliff she looked like one of those american presidents carved out of a mountain unfortunately , such fantastic passages come few and far between in the daydreamer , a much larger portion of which is devoted to charting the everyday calamities of peter s suburban life this is familiar territory , and all the tired staples of the genre sibling rivalry , a school bully , a father given to pratfalls get dutifully dragged out for a rehash the prose loses its luster , sometimes even gets slipshod , coming back to life only when peter clicks out of reality and into a daydream like most authors of adult fiction making their first foray into children s literature , mr mcewan has an unhappy tendency to talk down to his readers in a way that he could never get away with in an adult novel i bristled , for instance , at this sentence about peter when he grew up , he became an inventor and a writer of stories and led a happy life perhaps i'm merely another cynical adult \( who happens to write stories for a living \) , yet my sense is that most modern children are as unlikely as i am to accept this sort of pat simplification , just as they are unlikely to find the old warner brothers' vanishing cream joke funny anymore , or read the chapter where peter wakes up a grownup without remembering the much more vivid version of the same scene in the film big children are both more scrupulous and more skeptical than mr mcewan gives them credit for and none more so , ironically , than peter fortune , who in a wonderful holiday passage near the end of the daydreamer puts his finger on the pulse of adult experience much more accurately than his creator has you could not exactly say that the parents never had fun they went for swims , but never for longer than 20 minutes their only exercise \( if you could call it that \) was long boring walks , and these were nothing more than excuses for talking these restless grownups made constant visits to the telephone booth at the end of the lane to call their relatives or their work or their grownup children this is funny , supple prose , mr mcewan at his best as he always is when , instead of writing for children , he simply writes

a fish in the water a memoir by mario vargas llosa translated by helen lane 532 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 25 as mario vargas llosa was preparing to become the conservative standardbearer in peru s 1990 presidential elections , octavio paz was not the only literary colleague to warn him that novelists should write novels , that intellectuals should not run for office but whether out of vanity , patriotism or innocence , he ran for president anyway , persuaded by his aversion for the left and his faith in the market economy that he could save peru from the poverty , terrorism , corruption , runaway inflation and racism that had made it virtually ungovernable by the time he emerged , bruised and defeated , from three years of political combat , he seemed positively relieved that he had lost he had discovered that the reverse side of political idealism was maneuvers , intrigues , plots , paranoias , betrayals , a great deal of calculation , no little cynicism and every variety of con game , he writes in his memoir , a fish in the water he had come to know a country of hatreds , resentments and prejudices that fell far short of his dreams for it and the proof was that it had rejected him three days after conceding to alberto k fujimori , now president of peru , mr vargas llosa flew to paris and returned to a world of letters where he felt more at home but the pain did not go away first he had to watch mr fujimori appropriate my ideas and put my program for governing into practice then , in april 1992 , mr fujimori closed congress and seized dictatorial powers , to the applause of many businessmen who had backed mr vargas llosa s own campaign today , 58 years old and in selfimposed exile , he is still rubbing the wounds of his political misadventure of course , even at the darkest moments of the campaign there were those , both friends and foes , who predicted mr vargas llosa would get a good book out of this and he has but it is not , as many expected , a novel about a writer who tries to become president of a country resembling peru rather , with a fish in the water , he has published a fascinating and often bitter memoir in which he alternates chapters about his early years with a blowbyblow account of his presidential campaign and it serves as his mea culpa he explains why the aspiring writer of the 1950 s became a politician in the late 1980 s and why , in the end , this was a terrible mistake as an autobiography , the book is incomplete , since it omits the 30 or so years in which he earned a place among latin america s bestknown writers through such books as the green house , conversation in the cathedral , aunt julia and the scriptwriter and the storyteller instead , it focuses on his relationship with peru up to the age of 22 , when he moved to europe , and , later , when he ran for office in his early 50 s and through the device of alternating chapters , what happened in the interim becomes apparent a relatively prosperous peru turned destitute , and a young communist sympathizer metamorphosed into a convinced free marketeer happily , a fish in the water also tells much about the novelist in the making and for his admirers , it is enlightening born in arequipa , mr vargas llosa spent his childhood in bolivia with his mother and grandparents , believing his father was dead in truth , the father , who worked for panagra , the airline , had simply abandoned his pregnant wife five months after their marriage , first announcing he was taking up an assignment abroad for the airline and then , upon his return to peru , demanding a divorce , which was granted but when mr vargas llosa was 10 and also back in peru , ernesto vargas reappeared and set up house again with his former wife young mario was devastated and , for the next decade , fear and hatred of his father consumed him but it had its uses to write poems was another of the secret ways of resisting my father , he recalls , since i knew how much it irritated him that i wrote verses , something he associated with eccentricity , bohemia and what could horrify him most being queer indeed , his entire youth returned as fiction when he was 14 , his father sent him to the leoncio prado military academy in lima , and this gave him the material for his first novel , the time of the hero \( 1962 \) two years later , when he was a cub reporter on a lima daily , the world of grisly crimes , smoky brothels and drunken old hacks provided still more material for the future by the time he entered a university , he was contributing regularly to local newspapers and magazines then , at the age of 19 , to the horror of his parents , he fell in love with and married aunt julia , his uncle s sisterinlaw , who was 13 years his senior and , of course , that experience eventually produced a novel at the university of san marcos , he discovered politics with peru under a military dictatorship , he and two friends were contacted by communist recruiters and , after a diet of marx , engels and lenin , they were invited to join the party in 1953 felix and i said we wanted to be sympathizers , but lea asked for full membership immediately , he writes then we had to choose our pseudonyms mine was comrade alberto yet , while he cheerfully joined protests against the odria dictatorship , his political commitment always bowed to his dream of becoming a writer and for that , he was convinced , he had to leave peru
to the editor gingrich s life the complications and ideals \( front page , nov 24 \) leaves the impression that early in his political career newt gingrich abruptly shifted his ideological posture from liberal to conservative because it became fashionable to do so in fact , mr gingrich is a classic neoconservative whose entry point into conservatism was via the kemp wing it should be recalled that ronald reagan himself was a tradeunion liberal democrat who switched parties as the democratic party moved leftward in his first two tries for a house seat , in 1974 and 1976 , he was still in the liberal rockefeller wing of the party between '76 and '78 jack kemp emerged in the house as a champion of supplyside economics , devoted to entrepreneurial capitalism , with government relegated to maintenance of the social safety net created by democrats and approved by the neoconservatives as an editor at the wall street journal between 1976 and 1978 , i became aware of mr gingrich s enthusiasm for this new movement , as he sent me campaign material he used in his successful 1978 race that reflected his own conversion in all the gingrich profiles i 've seen since the nov 8 earthquake , none have mentioned the most important event of his career , his 1990 decision as house minority whip to oppose the budget deal between president bush and the democratic congressional leaders it was that deal , which raised the income tax rates that president reagan had lowered , that broke president bush s read my lips 1988 campaign promise mr gingrich was vilified by the bush team for killing the budget the first time around it was that act of political daring and principle , in a losing cause , that cemented mr gingrich s hold on the hearts of the party faithful and the backbenchers of the house at a time of political realignment , mr gingrich s beginnings as a liberal have been a source of great strength to him he still has in his intellectual experience a liberal s appreciation of human weakness and our collective responsibility to leave no one behind in the kind of general economic advance supplysiders envision jude wanniski morristown , nj , nov 24 , 1994 the writer is a political and economic consultant

singapore , april 19 the father of the 18yearold american sentenced to be flogged here for vandalism said today that his son had given up all hope of avoiding the punishment , even though the teenager continues to insist that he is innocent he has no hope at all , the father , george fay , an ohio businessman , said in a telephone interview from ohio he s prepared he told his mother in the prison today that he s prepared for the caning his son , michael fay of dayton , was permitted a visit today in a singapore prison from his mother , his stepfather and his girlfriend the visit came the day before the deadline for mr fay and his family to file a final clemency appeal with the singapore government george fay said that he had spoken today with his former wife , randy chan , after her visit with michael , and that she reported that their son looked good he s doing fine , mr fay added randy could n't hug him or touch him , which was hard on her , but mike kept telling her to be strong mr fay and mrs chan divorced in the 1980 s , and she has since married a businessman living in singapore mr fay said that he , too , had lost hope that his son would avoid the punishment , six lashes with a rattan cane , which leave permanent scars and often cause prisoners to go into shock from the pain there s no optimism none , he said in fact i think there s been a hardening of the position now by the singapore government michael fay pleaded guilty to vandalism after he confessed to spraypainting several cars and tossing eggs at other vehicles last fall in this prosperous , authoritarian citystate the flogging sentence has drawn protests from president clinton , among others , although public opinion polls have shown that many americans believe mr fay is only getting what he deserves the teenager has insisted that he is innocent of any crime he has said he confessed to vandalism as a result of a police beating a claim that some singapore criminal defense lawyers say they do not find hard to believe and pleaded guilty only because his family believed that he would be spared a caning george fay said that lawyers for his son would file a thick packet of material on wednesday with the office of president ong teng cheong , who has final authority over clemency appeals the argument we 're making in the appeal is that michael is a firsttime offender , that he has never had any problems at all in the past with anyone , anywhere , and that he suffers from a neurological ailment known as attention deficit disorder , which is known to lead to impulsive behavior , mr fay said mr fay said that his son s lawyers would also present president cheong with nearly 7 , 000 pages of petitions signed by americans and others who urge the government to grant mercy to mr fay criminal defense lawyers here say that given the unforgiving statements of singapore government leaders about the case they have said repeatedly that tough criminal laws and corporal punishment have saved singapore from the fate of crimeplagued american cities the clemency appeal will almost certainly be turned down within a matter of days
if jimmy carter s controversial mediation effort brings bosnia closer to peace , more power to him but the odds on an early end to the twoandahalfyear war remain long , despite yesterday s agreement on a ceasefire that could start as soon as friday the bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , began reinterpreting his agreement with mr carter almost from the moment he signed it monday night it remains unclear what he has committed his side to beyond a very temporary truce and a willingness to talk about revising the latest international peace plan under that plan , britain , france , germany , the united states and russia offered the serbs title to 49 percent of bosnia s original territory but mr karadzic s forces currently hold 70 percent of that territory , and given the unwillingness of the five powers to use force , no one has figured out how to get the serbs to pare down their holdings mr carter coaxed mr karadzic back toward the peace table with soothing words and a promise that territorial details could be renegotiated between the parties that promise represents a retreat from the takeitorleaveit position the plan s sponsors presented last summer mr carter is not responsible for the retreat it was publicly announced before he arrived on the scene what the serbs really seem to want is a permanent ceasefire in place , with the rival armies separated by un peacekeepers that would let them hold on indefinitely to the 70 percent of bosnia they now possess while negotiating for territorial exchanges that would give them an economically viable independent state such exchanges would mean evicting hundreds of thousands more muslims from their homes for its part , the bosnian government recognizes that it has lost the war , can expect no outside help and must swallow a compromise it wants that compromise to come as close as possible to the original fivepower peace map , which would minimize further evictions the clinton administration did a good job of briefing mr carter for his mission and persuading him to work within the framework of the existing peace plan for a change , washington and europe maintained a united position against abandoning the basic outlines of that plan if they can maintain that unity from now on , it would greatly improve the chances of an acceptable agreement the history of this war is full of onesided international concessions to the serbs that brought nothing in return none of the governments involved in that sterile diplomacy have grounds for complaint if mr carter has now managed to trade one of their past concessions for renewed peace talks for reasons best understood by himself , jimmy carter , known during his presidency for outspokenness on human rights , seemed to minimize the ethnic cleansing , mass rapes and other atrocities committed by mr karadzic s followers the most widespread violation of human rights in europe since the time of hitler americans , mr carter contended , had heard only one side of the story nevertheless , if mr carter succeeds in reopening peace talks on the basis of the fivepower formula , he will have made a valuable contribution
east rutherford , nj , sept 20 ah , life in the penthouse the dallas cowboys lose and all of a sudden the giants not only have the best record in the division , at 30 they are also the only undefeated team in the conference break out the champagne \? ready the speeches \? well , not quite remember , the giants jumped out to a lead over the cowboys last season but lost both games to dallas and ended up losing homefield advantage throughout the playoffs by one game so the giants are n't ready to celebrate they say dallas is still the team to beat do n't misunderstand them most of the players and coach dan reeves did n't shed any tears when detroit beat dallas on monday night , but they know that right now their lead means very little in the grand scheme it s not how you start , reeves said it s how you end the giants went through a light workout this morning and when it was over , the players looked as if they were kids on the last day of school as per their agreement with reeves that each victory before the bye week would mean a day off , the giants wo n't work out again until monday counting this afternoon , that s six days off no meetings no practices just a minivacation instead of talking about thirddown efficiency or the merits of a fourman defensive line , players were talking about which clubs to bring to the golf course quarterback dave brown was going to the beach in florida fullback kenyon rasheed was going to kansas city to visit his mother and how much golf were you going to play , corey miller \? let s see , the linebacker said , eighteen holes times six days off how many holes is that \? not lost , however , in all of the plans was this the giants do n't want to lose the momentum they have built last season , reeves had the exact same deal and the giants went 30 , went away for the bye week , then came back and lost at buffalo was it because the team had got so much time off \? reeves does n't think so , which is why he gave them the same deal this time around what he stressed to his players immediately after practice , though , was that while away do n't forget about football he told them not to lose their conditioning and stay in shape he meant , do n't stop running or start eating 20 cupcakes a day reeves thinks that his players know this and he is n't worried we 're not the kind of team that can take anyone for granted , reeves said we have to play hard every week and take it one game at a time we do n't fear anybody , but we ca n't take anyone for granted , either said miller i watched the game it feels good to be sitting here in first place i 'd be crazy if i 'd said i was rooting for the cowboys the giants found themselves in a similar position last season when dallas , without running back emmitt smith , began the season 02 the giants started 30 but dallas eventually caught them because the cowboys beat them head to head twice in the final meeting , dallas won the game on a lastsecond field goal , and it meant that the cowboys got homefield advantage throughout the playoffs the giants got one home game against minnesota , then went to san francisco , where they had to fight jerry rice , a long trip , and a threehour time difference new york was blown away by the 49ers all of that is in the back of the minds of each and every person in the giants' organization they want to take advantage of their lead and some players are afraid of losing momentum thus , there are mixed feelings about having a bye week one thing is clear players like rodney hampton , who has a bruised kidney , david meggett , who is aching and tired , and others could use the time off to heal i feel beat down , said meggett , who touched the football more this past sunday than he ever has i felt the pounding extra points not a sight you see everyday woody allen walking through the press room at giants stadium with an entourage of about 10 people when asked why he was there , one giants official said none of your business actually allen was surveying giants stadium as a potential site to shoot scenes for a coming film the giants do need help on the defensive line maybe allen can generate a little pass rush dan reeves needs just one more victory to move past his friend , the former washington redskins coach joe gibbs , on the career victory list the two are now tied for 12th with 124 career victories the former indianapolis \( nee baltimore \) and jets coach weeb ewbank is 11th with 130
toronto in an extraordinary group rant yesterday morning , the national hockey league s assembled general managers expressed the usual arguments in unusually strident tones they used sarcasm and anger to convey their frustration with the players union and portions of the news media who are skeptical when the 26 teams say they lost a total of 376 million last season only a radically altered collective bargaining agreement , with restrictions on wages , can save the remainder of the alreadydamaged season and the future of the business , they said soon , they may hold their collective breath until they turn blue , or they may huff and puff and blow the league down they pleaded their case to the news media and told reporters to believe them on faith they said they were insulted when asked to provide public documentation for their claims their numbers are none of your business , they said , although they use them to justify a 47day lockout that has already wiped out at least a quarter of the season glen sather of the edmonton oilers said that bob goodenow , the executive director of the union , is calling us all liars i do n't think mr goodenow has really been negotiating in good faith , sather said i think he wants to force us into a situation where we ca n't have hockey this year would it bolster management s case , sather was asked , if the league makes its finances public \? as far as i'm concerned , yes , i 'd like to make everything public so that we can get this thing over with , sather said you imply these numbers are n't real that s the same story i get from the players he said lying about finances can cause legal trouble you think i want to go to jail \? sather said we 've already got one guy who s in this league going to jail he was referring to bruce mcnall of the los angeles kings , who this week was charged with financial felonies sather then amended his intentions on disclosure i would n't want to make the numbers of our team public to all you guys , he told the assembled reporters and lou lamoriello of the devils said he would keep his ledgers private , too quite frankly , i do n't think it s any of your business , lamoriello said i do n't want my books out there lamoriello also said , if you think we do n't want to be playing hockey , something s wrong with you many executives , especially harry sinden of boston , said repeatedly that the league has leveled with the union on finances but john mccambridge , a lawyer for the union , said this is n't exactly true they have given us compiled revenues , but no profit and losses statements , no expenses and no idea of which teams are losing or making money except for the rangers , he said they told us the rangers did n't make money last year when they won the stanley cup no one believes that ken baumgartner , a vice president of the union , said that he was weary of attempts to discredit bob goodenow and that if bob is loathed that much , he must be doing a good job baumgartner noted that alan eagleson , who was ousted in favor of goodenow and is under indictment on labor racketeering charges , appeared at the hall of fame ceremonies tuesday in the company of bill wirtz , the powerful chicago owner what s wrong with this picture \? baumgartner asked back at the hotel , sinden scoffed at the latest union proposal to restrict the contract rights of rookies , saying it s like giving a canoe to someone in a desert sinden also questioned the credentials of marty mcsorley , a union vice president who called the most recent player proposal a significant compromise marty mcsorley , as far as i know , has been a player all his career , sinden said glen said mcsorley started out these negotiations as an economist he did n't realize mcsorley was an economist and i did n't realize he worked as a gm somewhere along the line gary bettman , the commissioner , said the specific figure on losses was n't important whether it s 376 million or 50 or 30 , it s not as important as the over all health of this business , he said bettman has proposed that an accounting firm audit the books and present its report to the players association the union will soon counterpropose that an investment bank assess the same numbers when the conversation turned to playersponsored exhibition tournaments , such as the threenight event in hamilton , ontario , last week , bettman expressed skepticism over the announced attendance of more than 43 , 000 despite the announced attendance , the building was halffull , bettman said when someone said gary , does that mean you do n't trust union numbers \? bettman smiled and replied that s what people tell me who were there i would have announced what they announced also photo the boston bruins' president , harry sinden , scoffs at the latest union proposal that would restrict the contract rights of rookies \( reuters \)
philadelphia what were the prospects during the 1930 s for a middleaged black man from west chester , pa , who earned his living as a handyman and had never studied art , to make it as a bigtime painter \? dim to none but horace pippin , the subject of a big retrospective here at the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts , had one of the most improbable careers in the history of 20thcentury american art born into a family one generation removed from slavery , he worked as a hotel porter , iron molder and usedclothes peddler before joining the army in 1917 at the age of 29 while fighting with the heralded allblack 369th infantry regiment in france , he was shot by a sniper and lost the ability to raise his right arm he returned , with a croix de guerre , to the united states and took odd jobs to supplement his disability pension as therapy for his injured arm , he also started to decorate discarded cigar boxes , and by the mid20 s had begun burning images on wood panels with a hot poker it was n't until 1930 that he tried oil painting , propping up his right arm with his left hand he completed his first painting the next year he was already 43 but pippin was fortunate in 1937 , his plainspoken and highly engaging paintings came to the attention of joseph fuggett , a school principal , who introduced him to a critic named christian brinton , who encouraged him to contribute works to a chester county show that was seen by , among others , n c wyeth unlikely though it seems , it was n't long before news of pippin spread as far as the museum of modern art in new york , which was organizing a major exhibition of socalled naive , or primitive , art four of pippin s works were chosen for the show , which toured the country thereafter he was promoted skillfully by the philadelphia dealer robert carlen and championed by no less a collector than albert c barnes , and he became for a time more famous than grandma moses , with exhibitions from coast to coast and works reproduced in time , life , vogue and newsweek it did n't last long pippin died in 1946 , having completed 140odd paintings , drawings and wood panels their subjects were diverse biblical and historical themes , still lifes and landscapes , portraits and it was on this , as much as anything else , that his reputation rested quiet and affectionate paintings of domestic life among blacks around the turn of the century , when he was young the largest tribute ever paid to him has now been organized , appropriately , here in the city where his career was made about 100 works have been brought together in i tell my heart the art of horace pippin \( the show remains through april 17 , then travels to chicago , cincinnati , baltimore and , next february , to the metropolitan museum of art in new york \) pippin is n't an easy artist to categorize there were others painting images of black domestic life during the 30 s , like palmer hayden and archibald motley , and by the end of the decade there was jacob lawrence , who has credited pippin as an influence one thinks of shahn and the precisionists at different points in the exhibition but these affiliations go only so far to call pippin primitive may not have been considered demeaning in the 30 s or 40 s , and it may have been a source of his success but it sounds demeaning today on the other hand , pippin was clearly not an heir to the harlem renaissance artists schooled in europe , nor did his work , although occasionally of political subjects that reflected his progressive beliefs , hew strictly to another familiar category of black art of the time , the art of protest pippin s paintings are neither monumentalist in the modernist sense nor political in a postmodernist way , observes professor cornel west of princeton in an essay in the show s catalogue \( edited by its curator , judith stein \) his works sidestep what mr west calls today s sterile 'quality vs diversity' debate , posing a challenge to critics and categorizers of art who see everything in terms of that debate mr west calls pippin s art emersonian in its exaltation of the commonplace and the lives of ordinary black folk a quartet of men singing on a street corner , children running in a backyard , women playing dominoes beside the fire , a man relaxing on a park bench \( the artist romare beardon called this image , the last one pippin completed , a spiritual selfportrait \) pippin s art is about healing , reconciliation and an optimism grounded , it seems , in his religious faith and a faith in people his art occasionally succumbed to sugary sincerity and a downhome currier and ives charm that derived partly from the fact that he culled images from popular magazines , films , theatrical productions and illustrated calendars but most of the time his work has a cleareyed narrative logic that seems neither secondhand nor saccharine it s no wonder that his series of paintings of lincoln and of the abolitionist john brown are among his strongest , because the highminded morality and integrity of these two figures struck a chord in pippin he was said to be modest and straightforward , of selfeffacing intelligence , patriotic and warmhearted , and these qualities describe his art , which has about it a generous spirit and ease pippin evidently loved nature , because many of the works are hymns to landscape paintings like the squirrel hunter , with its autumnal palette of yellows and rusts and greens \( and a flash of orange in the bands of the hunter s boots \) , or country doctor , with its scrim of slanting snow through which the doctor can be seen leading his horsedrawn carriage along a narrow wooded path , or cabin in the cotton iii \( whose central figure may have been inspired by a blind black singer in a 1932 film of the same name \) , with its auburn sky and brilliant white cotton above all , the show suggests , pippin must have enjoyed painting enjoyed the effect that patches of brilliant color made against a darkened background , enjoyed organizing complicated compositions of figures and buildings seen through trees , enjoyed rendering every lacy strand of a doily , every leaf on a tree , every brick in a wall , every band of color on the small rugs that brighten his sparce turnofthecentury interiors because it is the sense of pleasure that comes across in his work , as much as anything else pippin had a short but extraordinary career that is not widely remembered , which is a pity this show helps make amends photo man on a bench \( 1946 \) , on view in philadelphia a cleareyed narrative logic , neither secondhand nor saccharine \( pennsylvania academy of the fine arts \)
joaquim de almeida has appeared in some 30 films , including clear and present danger , in which he had a major role but he is not often recognized in new york , where he has an apartment in tribeca for the romantic comedy only you , which opens on friday , he was the last major actor cast as early as 1992 , eight weeks before marisa tomei received the oscar for best supporting actress for my cousin vinny , the director , norman jewison , offered her the starring role in the film when she won the award , he says , that s what tipped the scales at the studio , tristar , which had been unsure she could carry a movie shortly thereafter came the puppydoggish robert downey jr as ms tomei s love interest on a trip to italy then bonnie hunt , as ms tomei s sisterinlaw , along for the ride through venice , rome and positano ms hunt , who had worked at chicago s second city and had a star turn in the building , a shortlived television series , is best known on film for playing the mother in the two beethoven movies but in a romantic comedy , people always come in pairs , so the film makers needed to match ms hunt s kate , who is american , with giovanni , a fortyish italian ladies' man i interviewed many actors for the role , mr jewison says there was one italian actor , fairly prominent , that i met in la and again in new york and in rome and i wanted to meet several other italian actors in italy when the production moved from pittsburgh to italy last fall , however , none of the country s actors seemed right for what mr jewison called the cliched italian gigolo , the guy that women from the midwest always meet enter 37yearold joaquim de almeida \( zhowahkeem dee ahlmayda \) , who is portuguese mr jewison recalls howard feuer , the casting director , said , 'joaquim s not that tall he s not that handsome he s no rossano brazzi here' i said , 'but listen to his voice' there s a machoness especially when he lowers it , whispers , leans across the table and pours you another glass of wine he can be extremely intimate with his voice' so mr de almeida became giovanni the actor \( whose wife , cecilia , and 20monthold son , lorenzo , live in lisbon \) has made films in five languages portuguese , spanish , italian , french and english and also speaks german the only time i ever used my german was in a soap opera , 'as the world turns , ' when i played a spanish policeman who speaks german and french , he says the actor describes his character in only you as just the normal italian male or portuguese or spaniard he has the ferrari , he says he s romantic he has taste he knows history , art , and he knows how to romance women according to mr jewison , joaquim seemed to know exactly what he was playing he loves women on and off screen what may be puzzling , then , is why some women also found mr de almeida so attractive in clear and present danger , in which he played the coldhearted murderer felix cortez he is sophisticated , charming , mr de almeida says of the character , who doublecrosses his colombian druglord boss , kills an american lover and conspires with bad guys in the american government there is danger in him that attracts women portuguese actors often pass for other europeans on film and on stage mr de almeida , for instance , played an italian in paolo and vittorio taviani s first englishlanguage film , good morning , babylon , in 1987 and two years ago he played a spaniard in federico garcia lorca s blood wedding , at the joseph papp public theater he has appeared in two films with the portuguese actress maria de medeiros , who has a part in pulp fiction as a scantily clad frenchwoman in love with a boxer played by bruce willis ms medeiros , who portrayed anais nin \( a frenchwoman \) in the 1990 film henry and june , recently won the bestactress award at venice for her role as a selfeffacing sister in the portuguesefrench film tres irmaos we portuguese discovered the world by ship , mr de almeida says and now the world is discovering us , slowly but surely photo joaquim de almeida , who plays a gigolo type in only you the guy that women from the midwest always meet , says the director \( emilio lari tristar pictures \)
purchase , n y , june 16 the knicks' backcourt has moved to the forefront of the national basketball association finals as the knicks prepared for friday night s pivotal game 5 against the houston rockets at madison square garden , derek harper and john starks have emerged as leaders for the knicks and as a problem for the rockets both guards were brilliant in new york s 9182 victory wednesday night that evened the fourofsevengame series at two games apiece harper had 21 points including five 3point shots , badly outplaying the rockets' point guard tandem of kenny smith and sam cassell and starks , who finished with 20 points , took over the game during the final four minutes , scoring 10 of new york s last 13 points , including two crucial 3point jumpers in the final four minutes without the sensational effort of charles oakley , who grabbed 20 rebounds in game 4 , the knicks still would not have prevailed but harper and starks have taken control offensively in two games of the series , something that neither patrick ewing nor hakeem olajuwon has been able to do while the muchanticipated battle between the great centers has gone back and forth , the battle between the backcourts has been onesided and if that continues , the knicks feel good about their chances of winning game 5 , and ultimately winning the championship guards are going to determine the ball game , because we have the ball a majority of the time , said starks you know what patrick and hakeem are going to give you , that s a given it s up to the supporting cast to step up and play very big in this series at this level , great players raise their game i think me and harp have raised our games to the next level , and right now we 're playing great together riley used a threeguard rotation in game 4 , benching hubert davis , and playing starks 45 minutes and harper 41 minutes , with limited backup time for greg anthony it would not be a surprise if harper and starks log heavy minutes again in game 5 the rockets , meanwhile , hope to get a full game out of robert horry , the forward who was injured on a hard fall to the court after he was flagrantly fouled by anthony mason in the third quarter the rockets said xrays on horry s back and right wrist were negative , and horry said felt 98 percent and would be ready to go a first for everyone game 4 was another test under pressure for the knicks , but game 5 will be more of the same , in front a home crowd that will be enthusiastic but tense the rockets have never won an nba title , and none of the knicks' players ever has the series has become a twoofthreegame battle which team will seize the moment \? as you 're approaching the thought of winning it all , what team is going to win , and what team is going to crack \? said knicks coach pat riley that s what it comes down to since neither team has ever had the experience of winning a championship , they do n't know what that is we have to have more poise , more power and force at critical times when things are going bad than we 've ever had in our lives added harper , when you talk about momentum and pressure , i do n't think anyone has it right now but after game 5 , i think somebody will definitely have an advantage both starks and harper have been able to create shots for each other with their ballhandling and passing , much the same way that isiah thomas and joe dumars did for years with the detroit pistons it took awhile for harper and starks to learn each other s games after harper was acquired by new york in january but in the playoffs , they have played together instinctively we talk more than we did in the past , harper said we were feeling each other out before , but we 're playing together now john is very capable of pushing the ball up and creating opportunities for me when i see him with the basketball , i run to a spot a lot of times , he has gotten me comfortable shots huge edge in stats harper has enjoyed a huge advantage over smith , and harper plans to keep it coming into the series , the harpersmith matchup was expected to be one of the most even instead , it has been a mismatch while harper has averaged 17 points on 509 percent shooting , smith has averaged 38 points on 263 percent shooting smith was extremely tentative in game 4 , rarely looking for shots , as harper pressed smith full court , and even talked trash to smith on several occasions we 've done a good job against him , harper said of smith , but i still have to guard against him trying to come back he keeps telling me that he s coming at me as far as the talking , it s just talking i'm trying to use every edge i can in game 5 , the knicks will also try to get better shots for ewing , who was 8 for 28 from the field in game 4 once again , ewing was dependent on his jump shot , and he has only taken two foul shots during the last two games that will not change unless ewing takes the ball to the basket more strongly , yet the knicks' center seemed pleased with the shots he took in game 4 i thought i had good shots , but i just missed them , said ewing who had 15 rebounds the press is the one making a big deal out of it we won the game that s the bottom line if i can miss 20 shots and we win , i 'll take it i'm overdue a lot of people have been making a big issue out of the fact that i'm not getting to the foul line but i'm not even worrying about that i'm worrying about playing basketball if i have the shot , then i'm going to take it if i have the drive , then i'm going to drive if i start worrying about what the media and everyone else says , then that s going to mess my game up if i get the same shots tomorrow , i'm going to shoot them said riley of ewingd i do n't mind 28 shots , but some of those were contested i just want him to use a little better judgment , whether it means passing , or where he catches the basketball i'm not concerned about it , as long as we win rebounds charles oakley , who feels he gets less respect sometimes than rodney dangerfield , became annoyed before practice today when several reporters continually asked about his rebounding i 've been doing the same things for nine years , oakley said it ai n't nothing new people are just trying to give me respect now i'm like the sixth or seventh option on offense , but i do what i have to do everybody gets paid , everybody should hit the boards they 'll be some nights when i do n't get as many rebounds , but other players need to step up oakley did admit that his sprained left ankle felt better in game 4 i try not to think about it , oakley said i do n't jump that high anyway
moscow , jan 13 president clinton came to this wintry capital today and embraced president boris n yeltsin almost without qualification , despite the surprisingly strong nationalist , antiyeltsin revolt evident in the parliamentary elections on dec 12 on his first visit to russia as president , mr clinton and his top aides conceded that many people here had suffered acute economic privation in the transition from communism to a free market they spoke of the need for a redesigned net of social services to ease the pain but they nonetheless pressed for a sustained or , in some areas , increased pace of reform in backing the ultranationalist vladimir v zhirinovsky and other foes of the government , one of the main american participants in today s talks said , russian voters had not

including gennadi zuganov , a communist member of the lower house , and maxim travkin , a 25yearold banker who is a more suave , less vociferous colleague of mr zhirinovsky according to secretary of state warren christopher , mr zhirinovsky himself was not asked because his actions and his language and his statements do not make him fit to be in a meeting or invited by the president of the united states mr clinton told the legislators and a wide variety of officials , scholars , artists and business people , each of you who have participated in this new democratic process have my respect , my admiration and my pledge of equal partnership shifting the aim on friday , administration officials said , russia and the united states will officially announce that they have agreed to stop aiming their missiles at cities and military targets in each other s countries and in allied countries instead , the officials said , some will be aimed at uninhabited ocean areas while the agreement is

russian and american leaders are to be joined by president leonid m kravchuk of ukraine for the signing of an agreement leading to the destruction of ukraine s entire nuclear arsenal today , mr clinton met three times with mr yeltsin at two sessions in the kremlin this morning , with the emphasis firmly on economic policies , and tonight over dinner at a snowdusted government dacha outside town , where security issues were discussed he left not the slightest doubt that the silverhaired reformer remained the administration s main man in russia i believe that we have a clear opportunity to work together to build a new framework of security for europe , mr clinton told reporters , based on free political systems , free economic systems and nations that respect one another and president yeltsin has been doing that here and deserves the support of the united states from the kremlin , the president embarked on a tour of moscow shops , dropping in on a baker , then a combined butcher and fishmonger near red square he fumbled in his pocket for rubles to buy a loaf of dark bread , told inquiring muscovites that hillary rodham clinton would arrive friday and offered assurances that things would soon get better for ordinary russians all these folks working hard need to know that in the end they will be rewarded , he said prayers at cathedral then , wearing a gray fur hat to ward off the 17degree cold , he went on to kazan cathedral , destroyed in the stalin era and recently rebuilt its bells chimed as he arrived , and he prayed for his mother , virginia kelley , whose funeral mr clinton attended in arkansas just before leaving for europe finally , he visited the leader of the russian orthodox church , aleksy ii , the partiarch of moscow and all russia , who is ill with bronchitis , at the central clinical hospital in a parklike district of downtown moscow the dacha where the dinner was held , called novoye ogaryovo , a halfhour southeast of moscow , was

susan starr used to take 20 minutes to commute to work from syosset to lake success , until construction started on the long island expressway and the northern state parkway and jericho turnpike and now , said mrs starr , who teaches nursery school at the lake success jewish center , the 15mile trip takes up to an hour , often with five construction delays en route i leave home a halfhour earlier than i normally would , she said , and i'm still often late to work i try to take different routes , but you never know where the construction will be half the time the roads are coned off , and there s no one even working there for mrs starr and thousands of others on long island roads , highways , turnpikes , parkways and expressways , this is nightmare time , a period of stops and starts , delay upon delay , detour after detour and frustration compounded by frustration the state is financing 90 projects on the island , according to a spokesman for the transportation department , mel cooperman they include resurfacing , repaving and widening roadways , as well as adding shoulders and reconstructing ramps that is in addition to maintenance work on local roads , including filling potholes and repaving streets damaged in the winter the work virtually blankets the island the thoroughfares include not only the parkways and the long island expressway , but also hempstead turnpike , jericho turnpike , rockaway turnpike , northern boulevard , sunrise highway and routes 101 , 106 , 107 , 109 , 114 and 347 , as well as many bridges and expressway ramps on fridays the state publishes a list of lane closings for the next week but traffic reports , mrs starr said , were often not accurate or up to date one week this month , there were 66 lane closings , including 10 on the southern state parkway for sandy jones , a guidance counselor at syosset high school , a morning trip from her house in bay shore to work usually takes about 35 minutes , she said but now it often takes more than an hour i bought a map to find alternate routes , ms jones said but none has saved me any time i 've tried the sagtikos parkway no good the southern state is a disaster you have to read the paper every day to see where they 're working , because each day is a different story after i took a course in stress management , i tried to practice making myself relax in the car i even bought books on tape , which work for a while , but then they give me a headache the loop parkway is no better , councilman james moriarty of long beach , a daily commuter to freeport , said , adding they were supposed to stop working for the heavy summer traffic , but they have n't i do n't know which is worse , the construction s continuing or leaving the project in the middle when the roads are still blocked and congested it s a real drag bob sperling of manhattan , who drives to his office in garden city every morning , said construction this year seemed worse than before you ca n't get more than a few miles without seeing everybody s brake lights go on and signs warning that construction is ahead , he said on some days , the construction almost doubles my time to get to work why ca n't they do the work at night , when the roads are less crowded \? 'have a lot of catching up to do' mr cooperman said most of the work was covered under a bond issue from 1988 , but was deferred because of budget problems now we 're trying to make up for lost time , he said and we have a lot of catching up to do the paving could n't be done in the winter , because it s a warmweather activity it will take 10 years to catch up with the infrastructure to bring the roads up to snuff nighttime construction is impossible , mr cooperman said , because most of the work is near residential neighborhoods would you want trucks going through your backyard at night \? he asked mr cooperman said the state was expecting many complaints one major project site on hempstead turnpike in elmont and franklin square , five miles from the city line , was the highest accident location in the state , he said we knew we had to improve the road , yet it took a lot of persuading of local people to convince them that this had to be done people will have to be inconvenienced , but it s for an important reason yet there s no stopping the complaints in syosset , a series of projects stretches along jericho turnpike between routes 106107 east and round swamp road at the intersection of the turnpike and underhill boulevard , traffic backs up in all directions on the turnpike , where a turning lane is under construction , one lane is open in each direction new lanes are also being built on underhill lesley kalish of syosset said construction moved to different sites every day , with different lanes blocked and cars detoured in new directions one day , you 're driving in one lane westbound , and the next day , with no clear markings , the same lane is for eastbound traffic , mrs kalish said i 've seen several near accidents , with cars going the wrong way or stopping in the middle of jericho turnpike , not sure of where to go it s really very frightening i 've tried to stay off the parkways when i drive to east rockaway every day for work but now jericho turnpike has become the worst of all routes 25 drop in business not only are motorists complaining , but merchants along jericho turnpike also say the construction has hurt their businesses marcello marcoccia , owner of marcello s cleaners and tailor at the turnpike and underhill boulevard , said his business was off 25 percent other store owners tell me the same thing , mr marcoccia said we 're angry and frustrated , but what can we do about it \? i have my steady customers who still come but other business owners have n't been as lucky the neighboring merit service station has seen its gasoline sales fall , from 45 , 000 gallons a week to 32 , 000 , according to the manager , jeffrey marino customers complain that they ca n't get in or out , mr marino said i 've seen cars stuck at the light at this intersection for up to a halfhour the bottleneck is unbelievable aside from the traffic problems , he said , dirt and dust from the construction are also a nuisance some stores in that shopping center are trying to overcome losses in business ann borghese , owner of on broadway , a clothing and jewelry boutique , said that to offset a 40 percent decline in sales she had increased advertising our faithful customers get here , ms borghese said but the impulse shoppers on which we depend turn around and go home after being stuck in traffic for a halfhour the way things are going our clothing will go out of style before the customers get here in that shopping center , labelle camera stereo has seen its business fall by 60 percent since christmas , according to the owner , albert williams he has placed a large sign on the shoulder of jericho turnpike in front of the store saying , labelle camera stereo enter here 'trying everything we can' we 're trying everything we can , mr williams said this construction is killing the business this place is usually like a bowling alley , and now it s more like a morgue customers want to come but once they get a taste of this mess they 're not coming back the president of the long island association , matthew crosson , said the effects of construction on business were not lasting in the short term , he said , it s aggravating and probably has some marginal effect on business but in the long term the construction is important to long island , because we have numerous transportation and road problems that need to be solved and the only way to solve them is through construction , even though it makes life miserable for a while photos road work on the long island expressway in middle village , queens , top left jericho turnpike in syosset , top and bottom right , and the southern state parkway near wantagh ave \( pg 1 \) the owner of cleaning store on jericho turnpike , marcello marcoccia , said his business was off 25 percent \( photographs by clarence sheppard for the new york times \)
britons are caught up in another fit of argument over why they should keep the monarchy the american answer is simple of course , they should keep it for our amusement listen , this is a fine show , not least from a journalistic point of view in the united states , the pathological marriage of prince charles and princess diana is a tabloid television entertainment in britain , it is still largely a print story , and nothing brings out the deeprooted obedience of establishment journalists more quickly than bad behavior toward or by the royal family the source of bad behavior toward the royals is the tabloid press whose sneaky photos and transcripts have raised the palace shades in a cruel twist of fate , the tabloids' firebombing of the windsors' facade of respectability has been abetted by the sunday and daily times of london monarchists believe that the papers' publisher , rupert murdoch , and a former sunday times editor , andrew neil , have done more damage to the crown than anyone save the children of elizabeth ii it was mr murdoch s sunday times that published the prince s caddish declaration that he never loved his wife and anyway his daddy frightened him into marrying her also , his mother was distant and the boys at his perfectly awful school picked on him today , the sunday times is expected to offer the prince s authorized version of his affair with camilla parker bowles charles s grandiose selfpity masks his truly sad human situation he is a reasonably intelligent , educated man captured in a nottoobright family that has never been much for school his profession is waiting for his mother to die all that , alas , is not enough to excuse the terrible hash he has made of things in the days since his confessions , a band of godsavethequeen writers has been doing its best to invent arguments for preserving an institution that the tabs , the prince and mr murdoch seem bent on obliterating the daily times obligingly gave william reesmogg , a former times editor and thatcher government censor , a platform for his salvage operation mr reesmogg rated all princes of wales on a scale of 1 to 100 talk about grade inflation the current prince got a staggeringly generous seven for personal responsibility on the way to a total of 71 \( george iii got a 63 despite managing to lose the colonies \) the reesmogg verdict \? prince charles is still fit to be king , but he really must stop bleating about his mum in public in the conservative daily telegraph , the former editor and thatcher crony bill deedes had a clear solution for the botch charles had made of his life it was to wrest control of the times from an absentee landlord like rupert murdoch these are the yelps of old boys who prefer a dysfunctional nanny to none at all even the economist , which endorsed sacking the queen in theory , could not contemplate life without her the royals really ought to go , the economist concluded , but it was more important to reform other parts of the british constitution first even then , if the people wish , the monarchy could continue such contortions may seem strange to a traditionimpoverished country like ours but england did not survive the loss of empire without learning the virtue of smiling while institutions collapse so it was left to the independent , the newest of the quality dailies , to find the virtue in charles s nuclearstrength whining according to an independent columnist , the ineverlovedheranyway defense showed that charles was a modern heir who had figured out how to match diana s publicrelations wiles by publicizing his anguish , he has shown he can play diana at her own game and win yes , indeed , and with a few more such victories , charles might slip to 70 on the reesmogg scale
when peter spagnuolo first saw the building on east 13th street that he now calls home it was little more than a roofless hulk burned by arsonists and stripped by vandals of its wiring , windows and bathroom and kitchen fixtures the city , which owned the building , paid little attention as mr spagnuolo and others who needed places to live dug out the garbage and debris , rebuilt the roof , reconnected plumbing lines and wiring and put back kitchens and bathrooms but now , six years later , new york officials want it back having already rehabilitated most of the abandoned apartment buildings it took over in the 1970 s and 80 s , the city is now planning to take over buildings occupied by mr spagnuolo , his neighbors and other squatters as a way of providing housing for lowincome families and the homeless the squatters , though , are fighting back , pledging not to be moved when we got here , these buildings , this street was dangerous and dirty , said mr spagnuolo , a poet , who added that he had lived in the building at 541 east 13th street since 1988 we cleaned up the buildings , chased away drug dealers and helped to make this street a decent place to live again that deserves recognition although hundreds of squatters are encamped in about 50 abandoned cityowned buildings , over the years officials have largely let them alone and in a few cases actually helped them make homes out of the decrepit buildings but housing officials say that with thousands of people on waiting lists for lowrent apartments , they have no choice but to go after the buildings that the squatters call home these are very thorny issues , how to balance the equities , said deborah c wright , commissioner of the department of housing preservation and development it would be different if their argument was that we were doing nothing to expand housing opportunities for lowincome people but it is unfair to ask people who have been waiting for the housing there to just continue to wait we ca n't sanction what these folks have done just because time has passed the building where mr spagnuolo lives , for example , is to undergo total rehabilitation before being sold to a nonprofit community organization that will rent apartments to lowincome families and the homeless altogether , there are five buildings on the block , now occupied by squatters , that the housing agency wants to redevelop at a cost of 39 million though the city is determined to reclaim buildings where squatters have nested , evictions will not be easy , especially on east 13th street many of the squatters have been in the buildings for years and are likely to dig in their heels moreover , they have vocal supporters who have disrupted meetings and who have promised to challenge the city with force if the squatters are removed the city is also being challenged in court in june , a state supreme court judge ordered the department of housing preservation and development , which has jurisdiction over the apartment buildings the city has taken in foreclosure , to return four families to the building they had been occupying illegally on 168th street at the behest of the housing department , the police had removed them in april but justice carol h arber state supreme court in manhattan said the squatters were entitled to court hearings earlier this month , the squatters on east 13th street , believing that eviction proceedings were imminent , obtained a temporary restraining order from judge elliott wilk of civil court , barring the city from ejecting them until a hearing is held on nov 2 urging that the city reach a compromise with the squatters , judge wilk said it seemed pointless to me to take people there , to throw them out into the street to replace them with people from the street housing officials say the court action has not deterred them they say the squatters on east 13th street are trespassers whose occupancy is not only illegal but dangerous to them , their families and others on the block the electric and plumbing systems in the buildings , the officials contend , have not passed the city s building code inspections we see no legal basis that prevents us from developing these cityowned buildings as permanent housing for 41 lowincome and former homeless families , said mara neville , a spokeswoman for the housing department but the squatters argue that without them the buildings would have long ago decayed beyond any hope of repair it would be a wrecking ball , not renovation crews that the city would be bringing here if it were not for us , said sam smith , a carpenter and plumber who helped rebuild the building at 539 east 13th street , where he has lived for five years you ca n't neglect buildings the way these were and expect to come back years later and to turn them into housing again the squatters and their friends have transformed some apartments from dank hovels into decent living spaces where floors have been sanded smooth and where plasterboard , paint and new linoleum conceal the scars of years of neglect
chicago , april 13 it is showdown time at globex , the world s first international , roundtheclock electronic marketplace for futures and options traders the partnership agreement under which reuters plc , the british news and market information company , has developed the computerbased network for the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange , the world s two largest futures exchanges , is certain to be officially dissolved in two weeks and the board of trade may decide as early as tomorrow whether to pull its contracts off the twoyearold system , which has 342 computer terminals , mostly in europe and america a thumbs down from the board of trade would hurt the reputation of globex more than its performance trading in the board s contracts has accounted for a scant 5 percent of activity on the electronic network recently still , losing the board of trade s contracts , which include some of the world s most heavily traded futures contracts , would raise doubts about globex s prospects at a time when it needs to overcome a track record pocked with technological setbacks , management gridlock and unforeseen market developments the world of finance is undeniably becoming more global and electronic but not in a straightforward way expectations exceeded reality the expectations were out of sync with reality , said john f sandner , who is chairman of the merc and chief executive of the globex corporation , the joint venture with the board of trade that oversees globex the new governing system , with or without the board of trade , will allow other exchanges like marche a terme international de france , or matif , the french exchange that is globex s biggest customer , to share in control of globex and give all parties more freedom to make rules affecting their members and products the appetite for 24hour markets is n't really there yet , said patrick h arbor , the board of trade s chairman he favors staying put , but he has had trouble convincing his exchange to support changes demanded by reuters , the merc and matif board of trade members say they fear the changes could shift trading from their pits to globex s screens and undermine the board of trade s freedom to develop other alliances globex s founding premise seemed unassailable when the system made its debut with champagne and fanfare nearly two years ago traders needed a way to deal anytime , anywhere in widely held investment products like the board of trade s futures and options on treasury securities or the merc s futures on foreign currencies and standard and poor s 500 stock index futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset , like the stocks in the s p index , for a set price at a given date options are the right , but not the obligation , to strike such a deal demand for futures and options does not disappear just because an exchange that is their primary marketplace closes early this month , for instance , following the government s release on good friday of strongerthanexpected employment figures , investors , expecting stocks to drop sharply when trading resumed on monday , turned to globex in record numbers on easter to sell s p 500 futures contracts contracts used to hedge risks such contracts are speculative tools for many investors , but they also serve to hedge risks in international commerce multinational businesses , for example , protect themselves from currency shifts when they are buying and selling goods overseas , or they may guard against interest rate swings on loans one unanswered question is whether offhours demand is strong enough to attract sufficient numbers of traders to globex in the absence of such rare events as trading on easter without a reasonably strong and steady trading activity , someone who buys or sells a contract has a harder time finding an offsetting position if prices take a nasty turn and losses mount to compensate for the added risk of thin trading , or illiquid markets , wouldbe buyers tend to demand lower prices and sellers higher ones , thus widening the socalled spread as that disparity between asking prices and bids widens , it becomes harder to complete trades unless globex volume picks up , the system now seen as an investment in the future will come to be regarded as a financial sinkhole for reuters , the trading houses that subscribe to it and the sponsoring exchanges an experiment in progress it s an experiment that s still in progress , said merton miller , a professor at the university of chicago school of business and a member of the merc s board of directors i'm not sure yet whether the market niche is there the chicago exchanges originally saw globex as a way to enhance international interest in their contracts they also hoped it would head off efforts by exchanges in europe and asia to introduce competing products and stem the move by banks and other institutions to steer more of their futures and options trading to unregulated , overthecounter transactions they figured other exchanges would flock to globex , willing to accept chicago s governance and ban on competing contracts in return for the right to add the rest of their products to globex s screens

companies bell atlantic and tci decide the future can wait maybe everyone got carried away with this information highway idea maybe things were moving too fast because all the fancy talk got slammed into a wall of reality the huge merger planned by bell atlantic and telecommunications was supposed to set off a fireworkspopping transformation of , well , the world as we know it cabletelevision , communications , whoknowswhat but last week , the two compnies said , never mind the numbers do n't add up why did the deal crash \? the fcc lowering cable rates played a part , and tci s aggreasive manner did clash with staid bell atlantic but more likely it just was n't time for the cable industry to disappear into some labyrinthine , futuristic world now , said one executive , cable will not be folded into the telephone industry as quickly as people thought cable stocks , though , looked better before what should cable tv cost \? even without merger confusion , cable television is a slippery thing regulators keep trying to put a fair price tag on it , but the technological sands keep shifting last year the fcc moved to bring rates down to competitive levels , but somehow a third of consumers saw their rates rise partly because cable companies proved adept at reshuffling the channels in a basic package last week , the fcc tried again , cutting rates an additional 7 percent that , it says , is where true competition would drive them and it is trying to close the loopholes the head of the fcc , reed hundt , called it one of the greatest consumer savings when you add it up , it amounts to a couple of dollars a month soros takes a beating well , no one s invincible not even george soros mr soros has taken on a largerthanlife aura for his prescient , and hugely profitable , bets on the direction of the world s currencies a year and a half ago , he made 1 billion when he bet that britain s pound would be devalued in the midst of europe s exchangerate turmoil with such stakes , though , the day had to come when the losses would be just as huge it has last week mr soros said his quantum group funds lost 600 million on feb 14 in a bad bet on the direction of the yen giving in to cancer at tenneco michael walsh tried for a year to do two quite formidable and quite different tasks , but in the end one of them demanded his undivided attention one task had been to run tenneco , and he did that spectacularly in less than three years , he had , by all accounts , whipped the company into shape just as he had turned around union pacific before that but in january 1993 he developed brain cancer , and after a year of battling that , while staying on the job , he resigned last week at the age of 51 the stock fell 3375 over two days , to 54625 , but a more relevant point is that that s still nearly twice what it was shortly after mr walsh took charge take that , microsoft ! mighty microsoft , the fearsome competitor , got its wrist slapped last week , but it will take a lot more than that to slow it down a federal jury said the company infringed the patent of a small california company called stac electronics , which had developed a method for doubling the storage capacity of computer disks the jury awarded stac 120 million in damages which microsoft can pay out of its pocket money but the bigger question is whether this goliath will now be a bit more cautious in its dealings with various davids and it will surely cause more discussion about whether the patent concept is even relevant to something as complex as software nasa , back in the frying pan nasa ca n't seem to stay out of trouble recently it went a long way toward erasing one black mark by patching up the hubble , but last week it had another headache federal prosecutors accused nine people , some of whom work for nasa , of taking part in bribery and kickback schemes at the johnson space center in texas martin marietta agreed to pay 1 million and to help in the inquiry what s behind it \? one scientist cited nasa s loose , mom and pop accounting methods , saying , it s a lot easier to knock off a momandpop than an armored car international japan abandons hdtv \( briefly \) in japan , highdefinition television is a topic painfully close to the economic nerve it s their baby , a rare instance of japan pioneering a technology so there was an uproar last week when the government said it might abandon analog hdtv technology , into which industry had poured billions , in favor of the americans' digital system such an uproar , in fact , that the next day tokyo said , well , uh , maybe we 'll stick with it after all a token bit of national honor restored , but the damage was done who s going to put more effort into a technology that could be a dead end \? bradley slams 'japanbashing' president clinton s tough talk on trade with japan is good box office , but for the longterm good is it the right thing \? some have doubts , and last week they got a key ally in bill bradley people want to believe , the democratic senator said , that somebody is victimizing us but he wants none of it mr clinton s saberrattling is gratuitous brinkmanship , he said japanbashing for domestic consumption threats of a trade war , he said , could undermine efforts at reform in japan he will surely be heard , because he s usually a solid clinton backer easing hightech exports people are nervous about exporting fancy technology as one armscontrol advocate put it , we do n't want to send us pilots again to bomb things our industry has exported but changes in the world , and in technology , cannot be ignored and , not least , a chance to increase the nation s trade cannot be ignored not by this president anyway so last week mr clinton proposed an overhaul of export controls to fit the realities of a postcoldwar world , with the aim of easing the sale of machine tools and other hightech stuff the move seemed , politically , on target , because the protests matched up well business wanted more , armscontrol groups wanted less health reform a fatal flaw \? in his passion to fix the health care mess , president clinton faces a builtin , possibly insurmountable problem though everyone cheers the notion of universal coverage , many recoil at the idea of the government running things one lawmaker called the plan too bureaucratic , too governmental in other words , any government plan may be doomed and last week the american association of retired persons declined to support the clinton plan that one hurt the group has 33 million members with great interest in health care and mr clinton has put a lot of effort into getting its backing greenspan keeps 'em hopping alan greenspan , whose every utterance is scrutinized by the markets , tried to make something perfectly clear last week no , the fed chairman insisted before congress , inflation is under control no , there s no reason for longterm interest rates to rise just because he 'd nudged shortterm rates up president clinton liked what he heard , but the markets were of two minds , with stock and bond prices rising on tuesday , falling on wednesday and plunging on thursday before steadying on friday with rates cited as a factor all week putting the hot news on ice instant communications it practically defines our age beepers , pocket phones , mercilessly uptothesecond scheduling gadgets but wait something very curious happened last week the big story of the winter forget the snow , forget the earthquake , even forget paramount was the duel between ms apple pie and ms pool hall but when the achedfor moment came at last , most people did n't know 'til hours later they did n't want to know \( do n't ruin it for me ! \) or blocked out the fact that during primetime figure skating , it was the dead of night in norway cbs kept up the fiction , pounding every drum in reach as it opened its coverage of this great taped drama , now seven hours old heading off that first puff dr joycelyn elders is committed to cutting smoking , and last week , in the 23d surgeon general s report on smoking and health , she took the battle to a new front noting that tobacco companies lose nearly two million customers a year they either die or quit and must thus constantly recruit new ones , she urged that the focus be on preventing those first puffs young people are the chief source of new customers , she said , calling for a ban on advertising aimed at the young , like the joe camel ads the tobacco institute insisted that ads are aimed at adult smokers we do n't need to target kids , and we do n't , a spokesman said the tobacco industry got another blow on friday when the fda ruled that cigarettes could be considered drugs and face regulation as such photos an hdtv set in a tokyo store \( associated press \) the johnson space center in houston \( space center houston \) nancy kerrigan and tonya harding \( associated press \)
baseball and its peculiar , selfdestructive way of conducting business is predictable what , it s 1994 \? it must be time to hold another imagedestroying work stoppage but once in a while something that seems like a wild card is thrown out , threatening the pathetically preordained such as when peter angelos , george steinbrenner , jerry mcmorris , owners all , seemed to break from management s position even before the players went on strike after games played last thursday their words caused chain reactions , to be sure fans were given hope that the strike might not occur or would be shortlived players , predisposed to believe owners want to destroy free agency and break their union , momentarily thought they saw a conciliatory coalition forming and the news media , scrambling to read the everchurning waters around the 28 major league clubs , raced to see if the players were right reality eventually set in , sending the players out on strike and sending a reminder to all interested observers while words may sometimes titillate , they 're not important if it s more wind than wallop no matter how many good intentions the three owners who spoke had , it soon became obvious they stood alone especially when bud selig , the acting commissioner , and richard ravitch , the owners' chief negotiator , made all the owners turn off the mikes their voices , which speak the loudest for the ruling power structure of smallmarket clubs and superstation teams such as the wtbs atlanta braves and the wgn chicago cubs , are the only ones allowed to be heard now but should the leaks or the open pleading of others resume again , after , say , 50 days without baseball , here are some owners who might be players of impact , be it great or painfully little peter angelos he spoke at a news conference last week to try to suggest ways to keep the ball parks open and he appeared rational , civil and , therefore , obviously new to this game alas , the baltimore oriole owner is new that , plus the fact that he seems to have none of the low gears that veteran owners require newer owners use in their rookie years , has prevented his building any visible coalition that angelos s favorite soul mates seem to be the news media is good for the soul mates , but probably hurts his cause george w bush put a firstplace texas rangers team , a new ball park , a work stoppage and george w bush into any other season and you would might have had a powerfully dynamic force to deal with in the lone star state but this is not any other year it s 1994 and george w is no longer more noted for being the son of a president , or an owner who loved dancing on the big stage he is running for governor of texas so it is that bush has turned his attention away from the business of baseball just as the rangers are joining the game s nouveau riche , thanks to that cash cow of a new park so we 'll never know what might have been at least until next year if ann richards is still governor , if there s still a strike , if even bush s friend , robert dole , then starts questioning that antitrust exemption nelson doubleday and fred wilpon the mets' owners seem content to keep their own counsel which means that they have not deserted selig , revenue sharing or the salarycap proposition even though they , like the yankees , and other bigs like toronto and boston , have little to gain and a lot to lose in this fight still , such clubs are being downright gentlemanly , for now , for which selig must be grateful but if voices ever start emanating from places like flushing , it will be key because these are the real waking giants that could produce impressive bites as well as roars jerry mcmorris and the other new kids on the block the game has seen an infusion of young , aggressive , incredibly rich businessmenowners who play their real money games in industries that make baseball clubs look like momandpop operations they include colorado s mcmorris , drayton mclane of the astros , wayne huizenga of the marlins and peter magowan of the giants the popular belief is that if these owners ever form a coalition , their power and influence would be significant and immediate thus far , only mcmorris has asserted himself , making a most interesting waiting game within a game to see when the others might follow and what they might do peter o'malley the dodger owner s father , walter o'malley , was an influential figure , but the power center of the game has shifted from los angeles to the backyards of the great lakes coalition of selig and jerry reinsdorf that was never more apparent then this month , when the only mention of the dodgers was that they were one of 19 clubs purportedly losing money that list was revised downward to 12 the assumption is the dodgers were deleted in order to quell the laughter that was threatening to drown out the moneyminting machines at dodger stadium george steinbrenner his yankees are locked out in a fight he knows is n't his his anger over that , as well as his natural inclination to savage anyone who negotiates for owners , was bound to seep out again it did when steinbrenner publicly ridiculed ravitch s revenuesharing rationale still , no matter how much he browbeats ravitch , truth is , steinbrenner has no visible coalition because his act is as old as angelos s is new the owners are also worth watching because history almost dictates that they will change their tune and their tactics so if it gets to the point where you need a scorecard to tell one coalition from another , only then will a real showdown between the one group seeking peace and the one making war finally be at hand photo for fred wilpon , above , and his mets franchise , there is little to gain and a lot to lose financially in the current baseball strike \( associated press \)
the first move was gutsy , a risk that could lose him the ball game , and john franco knew he would be lucky to see it pan out the second move simply was smart together , the two crafty plays defused a potentially volatile ninth inning yesterday afternoon at shea stadium , as franco preserved bret saberhagen s onerun lead for a 54 mets victory over the los angeles dodgers it was the 22d save for franco this season and the 11th victory for saberhagen , who pitched into the seventh and became only the fifth national league pitcher to win 11 or more games this year 2 key tosses franco threw five pitches in the ninth inning , but none of them mattered as much as the two throws he made in the infield the first was a play to third base on a bunt by delino deshields , a bullet of a throw to bobby bonilla that got brett butler with none out the second was a surprise pickoff throw to first baseman david segui , who , with the help of shortstop jose vizcaino , caught deshields in a rundown between first and second before tagging him out johnny was kind of upset that butler got a hit like that , said bonilla , referring to the bloop double franco gave up to butler to lead off the ninth inning the last five or six outings , he s given up that one bleeder that gets them going , and he did n't want to see it happen again it was nice to see him catch a break for a change a risky decision with deshields at the plate , franco decided that if deshields laid down any kind of hard bunt , he was going after butler , rather than the sure out at first base the decision was a risky one , given that franco could wind up with runners at first and third with no outs unless the throw was perfect it was i knew if i threw the ball in there high , he was safe , said franco , who watched manager tommy lasorda of the dodgers get ejected after unsuccessfully arguing the call against butler but i was going to third , no matter what if i get him , i get him if i do n't , i do n't franco had n't thrown a pitch to mitch webster , the next batter , when he threw over to segui to nail deshields franco had been prepped by bobby wine , the mets' bench coach , that deshields likely would try to steal on the first pitch , and wine was right deshields , who has five stolen bases against the mets this season , said afterward that he did not think franco was going to first with the throw because franco held his hands differently than he usually did in that situation i guess we have a pretty good scouting team , said franco , who pointed at wine in the dugout after the play with the bases clear , webster flied out to ryan thompson in center , and the mets had taken both the game and the series from the dodgers , who lost 2 of 3 in new york to further shrink their lead in the national league west saberhagen , who watched the play on the clubhouse television after wilting in the afternoon heat , praised franco s risktaking if he gets in safe , saberhagen said of butler , there s a good possibility of tying the game or losing the game happy with victory saberhagen was happy with the victory , but was n't thrilled with his linescore 9 hits and 4 earned runs over six and onethird innings , including a solo home run to butler in the third after saberhagen allowed two runs on two hits and a sacrifice fly to start the seventh , manager dallas green made an unusual mound visit and removed him from the game it was the first time since may 21 the first time in 11 starts that saberhagen left a game prior to the seventh inning for a reason other than injury it was also the first time since june 8 that saberhagen had allowed more than three earned runs in a start for some reason today , the heat wore on me , said saberhagen , who does not like to pitch in day games it s not exactly the scenario i 'd like to finish up with luckily for saberhagen , he had been staked to a 52 lead heading into the seventh , thanks in part to a tworun homer by bonilla \( his 16th \) in the third and a tworun fourth inning that included a single by saberhagen himself and after the dodgers cut it to 54 in the seventh , josias manzanillo got five relatively clean outs to set up franco s gutsy save
everything looks deliberately askew in anthony dowell s new staging of the sleeping beauty for the royal ballet the huge columns at the sides of the stage are vertiginously tilted , and princess aurora s christening opens , unconventionally , in a crowded banquet hall with a cupola a long table set with real china and silverware tapers off toward the rear in a boldly mannerist perspective just before carabosse , the wicked fairy , makes her entrance , her attendant monsters hop onto the tablecloth or peer out from under it the empty chairs rock and rattle as new yorkers will see for the first time when the royal ballet opens a twoweek season on wednesday at the metropolitan opera house , this ghostly fanfare is only one of the production s surprises in an interview about the company during its spring tour of the united states , mr dowell , the british troupe s director since 1986 , appeared prepared for the controversy that might greet maria bjornson s radical rethinking of the sets and costumes in this beauty yet he was equally confident about the fresh look he wanted for the 19thcentury petipatchaikovsky classic that has been the royal ballet s signature ms bjornson s reputation as a designer is burdened with too much of a good thing her spectacular success with the phantom of the opera , complete with its famous falling chandelier ballet people were saying that we should n't have a designer for musicals , mr dowell said but we , in ballet , are a branch of entertainment , too ms bjornson , as he points out , is primarily an opera designer , and he added i also knew her work for the royal shakespeare company she has this gift for 18thcentury swagger in this first ballet commission , ms bjornson has , in fact , started off the sleeping beauty in the 18th century rather than the usual 17th mr dowell , by his account , was looking for something different from the royal s earlier productions of the ballet they had all become museumlike and safe i wanted to bring back some of the magic feeling when the company presented the new staging in march at the kennedy center in washington , the premiere was offered as a novelty for the twopart american tour \( the company returned to london before the met season \) many americans who saw how ms bjornson s postmodern eclecticism dominated the work were flabbergasted but the hunting scene , customarily set in autumn , was part of a beautiful and silvery winter landscape with sleighs unexpectedly , however , the early 19thcentury regency costumes for that scene seemed to go back in time to louis xiv for the subsequent wedding act visiting british critics nonetheless found something to write home about and were generally positive and that is chiefly because mr dowell kept the traditional petipa choreography as it has come down in the royal , with a few changes by frederick ashton and kenneth macmillan in fact , he added , those who wonder why there is a banquet table in the prologue will find that petipa s scenario indicates that a banquet is being prepared some of the met program will be familiar it features macmillan s 1978 mayerling , a fullevening dramatic ballet about the violent life and death of rudolf , a hapsburg crown prince the mixed bill includes ashton s dream , david bintley s new tombeaux to william walton s music and the judas tree , a vehicle for the former bolshoi star irek mukhamedov that is a contemporary tale about a gang rape the latter was macmillan s last ballet before he died in october 1992 while choreographing the revival of the rodgers and hammerstein musical carousel ballet , mr dowell said , is not all fairy tale and fantasy macmillan s death following that of ashton in 1988 left the royal ballet without a resident choreographer mr bintley , who was given a similar title , left to freelance last fall and this month was appointed artistic director of the birmingham royal ballet , the royal s sister company for the first time in our history , we have no creative force of the stature of ashton and macmillan , mr dowell said i have been criticized for not bringing in outside choreographers , but i had the two giants david , who grew up under their shadow , was the third in line circumstances affect policy , mr dowell conceded it was company tradition to groom choreographers from its own ranks and from its workshop , the royal ballet choreographic group ashley page is one of its betterknown alumni two younger dancers , william tuckett and matthew hart , have recently created pieces for the company nonetheless , the situation has changed now the doors are open wide to outside influences , mr dowell said turning to another issue , he said he did not regret inviting outsiders into the company like sylvie guillem and mr mukhamedov as well as numerous guest artists many of these were from russia and the paris opera ballet it is no secret that until a new generation headed by darcey bussell and viviana durante emerged by 1990 the company was at a low ebb but in the last two years , there have been few guests , and americans will see why in the new homegrown talent of dancers like muriel valtat and sarah wildor looking remarkably relaxed for someone who feels frequently criticized but who in fact brought the royal out of the doldrums , mr dowell denied any rumors of an imminent departure i'm not thinking of leaving , he said but i will be lying if it s not in the back of my mind occasionally he asks himself , am i the right person \? the job , the 51yearold mr dowell continued , is full of mine fields and headaches a director s job nowadays seems to involve keeping dancers happy when he was growing up in the royal , dancers were not a vocal body of people , and none of us would have questioned anything madam or fred did , he said , referring to ninette de valois , the company s 95yearold founder , and ashton the pioneers who founded ballet companies had more authority than their successors , as mr dowell concluded madam said to me , 'i had it much easier' photo mr dowell rehearses muriel valtat in the sleeping beauty i wanted to bring back some of the magic feeling , he says \( jonathan

pushchino russia , july 19 this picturesque city is a citadel of russian science its nine biological research institutes have long been considered among the finest in the world its molecular biologists , protein physiologists and biochemists have published thousands of articles in prestigious journals what better place , then , for an ambitious american high school student to prepare that allimportant entry for the westinghouse science talent search \? who could be a more perfect coach for an eager teenager than a worldrenowned specialist in the field he wants to enter \? in america do you think you could find scientists of this caliber who would spend 12 hours a day working with high school kids on their projects \? asked a wideeyed vinay gupta , a 16yearold who attends half hollow hills high school east in dix hills , l i do you think they 'd even learn our names \? low earning power there are a couple of similar programs in the united states , but none that rely on the type of scientific firepower assembled here and unlike the top researchers in russia , leading scientists in the united states earn more than 150 a month so do the technicians who clean their test tubes famous american biologists do not need to learn how to fix old equipment when it breaks they do not have to rely on municipal fields to grow vegetables to feed their families they certainly do not need to tutor high school students to supplement their paltry incomes but scientific research once the pampered pride of soviet life has taken a particularly hard fall in the new russia many of the scientists who could leave already have others , working here and throughout the country s basic research centers , consider themselves lucky to keep the electricity on so when teachers from stuyvesant high school in new york suggested last year that some of the most gifted american students would love to spend a summer month with the russian scientific elite \( and would gladly pay for it in dollars \) , few people here thought twice about it is this what i thought my life would come to \? asked viktor popov , a biologist and for 23 years a reigning expert here in the field of cell biophysics his salary of nearly 150 a month is three times the average at pushchino of course not , he said we live extremely difficult lives now we have no money for equipment , for new journals , for computers every day it seems we are on the verge of the end we do n't have 5 percent of the funding we used to have so yes , the students from america help keep us alive a struggle to achieve it is a bittersweet marriage the raw youthful talent of the united states and the experienced , beleaguered mentors of russia young people who have it all before them , and aging researchers who never dreamed they would have it so bad despite their lack of supplies , the grim direction their careers have taken , and their obvious doubts about the future , russian scientists somehow still manage to turn out important research their peers in the united states acknowledge that they still understand as much about theory and the complexity of basic biological problems as anybody but it is always a struggle maybe these kids ought to know that a life in science is n't necessarily one awards ceremony after the next , said mr popov sixteen american high school students are spending five weeks here this year all applied to the stuyvesant center for international education , which selected those it felt were most promising each is assigned to a leading researcher and works with that person all day , every day the goal of the program , its leaders say , is to help these students develop a project for the westinghouse science contest , whose awards are usually announced in march each scientist who agreed to act as a tutor this summer will earn about 1 , 000 for the work none seem bitter or resentful but none pretend they would be doing this if , say , they were tenured professors at duke or harvard , earning 80 , 000 or more a year for similar work they are aware that their institutes are barely scraping by and they know that attention from the united states can help with funds for research mixed feelings these are remarkably talented youngsters , and as fewer russian students enter the sciences i think they are the great hope for the future , said oleg a kholodkov , a senior scientist in the institute of molecular biology who is working with young mr gupta on his paper , titled cloning and expression of regulatory tet gene in the human immunodeficiency virus \( hiv \) it would be very hard not to be excited by their energy and achievement , he said but it does n't mean i would n't rather do my own work their own work at the institutes here in the green hills two hours from moscow has had to take a back seat this summer to the students they have agreed to teach the students who live in graduate student dorms , which have no hot water each paid about 3 , 000 for the fiveweek program , which includes air fare and some limited sightseeing in st petersburg and moscow the westinghouse contest is to young scientists what the tchaikovsky music competition is to emerging musical prodigies it defines talent and makes careers last year , the first in which students from the united states worked with professors from pushchino , the collaboration helped produce one finalist , william burkewhite from phillips exeter academy in new hampshire , and two semifinalists , edward shen of the delbarton school in morristown , n j , and brian herz from half hollow hills high school west in dix hills mr burkewhite , whose paper was entitled alternative translational initiation of the maize transcriptional activator tnpa yields two dna binding proteins , has returned to pushchino for this summer as an aide a cultural experience i tell all these students practically every day that if they are expecting stockholm to call with that nobel prize they are going to have some problems with this program , said john lapolla , the boyish , feverishly energetic stuyvesant biology teacher who acts as chaperon , lab guide and father confessor these kids are learning amazing things at the hands of amazing people but the cultural experience has to be at least as valuable there are other programs that prep kids for westinghouse but who wants to be in texas when you can be in russia \? of course , russia and the grueling 12 hours a day of lab work supplemented by lectures on everything from transcriptional analysis of dna material to electrophoresis the migration of certain particles through a fluid or gel subjected to an electric field is not for everybody the food is basic , and the living conditions are less than that even the laboratories leave much to be desired still , none of these young people seem to have been drawn by the quality of the research tools well we might have some equipment that is better or newer than this at school , said thomas knox , a shy 17yearold entering his senior year at phillips exeter academy this fall but big deal these guys are the biggest of the big time you know , none of our teachers are as experienced as them photo vinay gupta , left , from long island , working on his project about the human immunodeficiency virus with oleg a kholodkov , a senior scientist at the institute of molecular biology in pushchino , russia \( otto pohl for the new york times \)

canton , ny , april 15 acting as special prosecutor in a contentious rape case , state attorney general g oliver koppell asked a court here today to reinstate charges against five men who admitted having sex with a woman who had passed out in an upstate restaurant mr koppell s personal appearance in court , in a year in which he is seeking election to the post , was unusual for an attorney general also unusual , legal experts said , was mr koppell s request that a judge overrule a county prosecutor s dismissal of firstdegree rape indictments against the men after they pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges before a town justice those plea bargains to sexual misconduct , in which the defendants were fined a total of 840 , drew national attention and ignited outrage among advocates for sexualabuse victims and in the small talcmining town of gouverneur , 20 miles from the canadian border in st lawrence county jurisdiction is disputed today , in arguments that defense lawyers claimed were motivated more by politics than by law , mr koppell said the guilty pleas were not valid the town court , he said , lacked jurisdiction because felony charges were outstanding against the men in county court at the time they are as if the defendants had pled guilty in an open field or a street corner , mr koppell told eugene l nicandri , a county judge appointed as acting state supreme court justice to hear this case justice nicandri was also the judge who had dismissed the felony charges last june at the request of district attorney richard v manning , who said he did not have enough evidence to convict the men the justice did not decide on the case today but is expected to do so within 30 days none of the five defendants appeared in the ornate county courthouse today , but the victim , krista absalon , a 26yearold hospital technician , sat nervously with a row of family members and friends during the twohour hearing i just want my fair day in court , said ms absalon , who has spoken publicly about the case and has not requested that her identity be shielded that s all i ever wanted and all i ever asked for the facts of what happened in the casablanca restaurant in gouverneur are not in dispute when they entered their guilty pleas , each of the five defendants admitted having sex with ms absalon without her consent on oct 26 , 1991 , ms absalon passed out in the restroom after having several drinks the defendants , described as acquaintances , carried her to a lounge , removed her clothes and took turns assaulting her she said she only became aware of the assault two weeks after it took place , when a friend told her the men were bragging about it what remains in dispute is what should happen now lawyers for the defendants said reopening the case amounts to double jeopardy , the legal concept that bars multiple prosecutions for the same offense in sentences critics said were feeble for the offense , the men already paid fines imposed by the town justice , wallace a sibley , a fertilizer salesman who is not a lawyer one defendant , mariano g pistolesi , a son of the restaurant owner , served 200 hours of community service 'we cannot subvert the law' the lawyers said that reinstating the charges would violate their clients' right to a timely trial and that mr koppell was undermining the authority of the original prosecutor , mr manning , to try cases as he sees fit moreover , they suggested that public clamor had driven this second attempt at prosecution , begun after gov mario m cuomo appointed mr koppell as special prosecutor in february we cannot subvert the law to the political process , said gary w miles , a lawyer for one defendant and the former district attorney for nearby jefferson county but mr koppell , in an hourlong argument , said that plea bargaining restrictions do not permit a firstdegree felony to be reduced to a misdemeanor he argued further that mr manning had stacked the deck by allowing the pleas in the lower court and had ignored evidence , which included confessions , that he said could have convicted the men he said he had new evidence in the case but declined to reveal it in open court several times during the hearing , justice nicandri peppered mr koppell with skeptical questions , focusing especially on the guilty pleas and the question of double jeopardy what is it that took place in gouverneur town court \? he asked from a legal point of view , it s nothing , mr koppell said it happened , but it did n't have the effect of proper procedure mr koppell conceded after court that it was extremely rare for the state to ask for a reinstatement of charges , and legal experts interviewed today said the case was thorny with various competing precedents robert m pitler , a professor at brooklyn law school and former counsel to the manhattan district attorney , robert m morganthau , said it appeared that the town court did not have jurisdiction because the rape charges , though subsequently dismissed , were still pending in county court as a general rule , a plea in a court that does not have jurisdiction to take that plea will not bar subsequent prosecution , he said but gerald b lefcourt , a defense lawyer in manhattan , said the case seemed to be a clear case of double jeopardy he said mr koppell should not be too quick to question mr manning s reasons for dismissing a case he said seemed difficult to try there was no physical evidence and the victim , not remembering what happened , would not be able to testify it is axiomatic that you ca n't have a rape charge if the victim consented , he said in this case , because of the fact that she cannot remember , she obviously cannot say she did n't give her consent by accepting the lower court plea , mr lefcourt said , mr manning did the next best thing he could do get something out of nothing in addition to mr pistolesi , the defendants are mark a hartle , david e cummings , michael a curcio and gregory l streeter photo attorney general g oliver koppell conferred with aides during a hearing in canton , ny , where he argued for reinstatement of rape charges against five men who were allowed to plead to a misdemeanor \( michael j okoniewski for the new york times \)
piscataway , nj , jan 23 temple boasted two potential pro basketball draft picks the owls were the second nationally ranked team rutgers was facing within a few days and though playing at home , rutgers had the look of a road team because its white jerseys were n't available and it was all too much , as the scarlet knights fell , 7865 , today to the owls aaron mckie , the star senior guard for 11thranked temple , hit a 3pointer with 14 minutes 55 seconds left in the game to deflate a rutgers comeback and start an 112 run down by 18 points at the half , rutgers had gone on a 130 spree that exposed some of temple s weaknesses and made a game of this matchup for about five minutes rutgers picks up pace with rutgers coming out of intermission and down by 4628 , their senior center , chuck weiler , went in for a quick layup , and junior guard pete marcotte stole the ball from temple s rick brunson the 5foot7inch marcotte raced to the other end and dumped it off to waliyy dixon , who went in for the layup it was the best offensive series for the knights so far in the game , and it was n't over rutgers just started tearing us up , temple s coach , john chaney , said i do n't know what is was we were doing serving hot dogs and hamburgers or something while temple turned the ball over four times , coughed up two air balls and forced a shot that badly missed , rutgers caught up in a hurry a freshman guard , charles jones , hit a 3pointer , a junior forward , jamal phillips , had a layup and dixon , a sophomore guard , added 4 more points to cut temple s lead to 4641 with 15 minutes left we wanted to run by them before they could drop back in that zone , marcotte said we 've wanted to do that all game that s what happened at the start of the second half temple roars back but just as rutgers cut the lead , temple came right back after lingering around for three more minutes , the knights looked worn out , and the eddie jonesaaron mckie show began for temple they combined for 17 points in the final 12 50 , and a season from now expect to be making the big money in the national basketball association this is one of the first games that i had that many open shots , mckie said i just wanted to take advantage of them mckie finished with a seasonhigh 31 points and had 11 rebounds , 4 assists and 3 steals jones had 15 points the surprise for temple was the bench chaney usually uses a sixman rotation , but a sophomore guard , jason ivey , got a careerhigh 10 points tonight temple moved to 112 over all and 41 in the atlantic 10 , while rutgers dropped to 59 and 14 in the zone ultimately , it was temple s trademark zone that won the game rutgers came unglued early and late in the game because of it they have such long players , they can cover a lot of area , rutgers' coach , bob wenzel , said i mean pete marcotte it would take four of him for one of their guys and last year when we beat them we hit a lot of threes rutgers is a much different club from a year ago , and could use the luck its female counterparts had this week the lady knights knocked off no 1 tennessee on monday , 8777 , but the men have seen two nationally ranked teams this week , a couple of the best the atlantic 10 has to offer they lost to umass badly and , asked to compare the two , two players said umass was tougher than temple none of the five starters for rutgers average double digits in scoring , and there are only two seniors on the team one of them , center chuck weiler , leads the league with 277 blocked shots per game he had seven tonight \( his careerhigh is 10 \) and won that battle at least with jones , the atlantic 10 s secondhighest shotblocker , who had none weiler s 16 points were n't just a careerhigh , they brought him out of a shooting slump the knights were forced to wear their scarletcolored uniforms in brown athletic center tonight instead of the usual white jerseys for the home team the lettering on the white ones had cracked and peeled and were returned to the manufacturer the new ones should have been here , but because of the recent bad weather , have not yet made it to campus coincidence or not , rutgers looked and played as if it were a team on the road photo temple s eddie jones scoring 2 points just beyond the reach of rutgers' andrew kolbasovsky \( associated press \)
two novels , a volume of short stories , a memoir , two histories , two biographies and two treatises on science for lay readers are among this year s roster of best books along with an extended meditation on the colonial quest , its origins and consequences that the publisher called a novel but the author did not , a kind of freedomofchoice entry of course , the list is not that neat , anyway one biography is a foray in the continuing intellectual struggle over american history , and the memoir is a commentary on the same science taken up in the two scientific books the science is , broadly , evolutionary biology or , specifically , sociobiology , which , once it gets into your brain , can really spook you about genetics for instance , once the list was alphabetized , it suddenly became apparent that the principal subjects of the first two books were both short , loquacious and bowlegged men more ominously , the alphabet clumped the three books on sociobiology together in the list there are other patterns here , but perhaps they will not bear thinking about the writers of the books chose their subjects and titles , and the editors of the book review chose the best books none of this was done by a pool of genes these best books were chosen by 11 editors from a list of 33 titles originally nominated in a dozen weekly discussions that were , for once , disconcertingly uncombative the number of books on the list and the number of editors are unrelated each book chosen received a majority vote certain categories of books , like diaries and letters , are not eligible had they been , letters might have been stiff competitors this year , which saw publication of a translation of the splendid correspondence of walter benjamin , 191040 , edited by gershom scholem and theodor adorno collections of letters by two poets , elizabeth bishop and philip larkin the first volume of the letters exchanged by freud and sandor ferenczi and a cache of enchanting letters written by the composer leos janacek when he was old to a young , and married , woman he had fallen in love with the best books are selected from among those reviewed here since last year s christmas books issue and the descriptions of them below are drawn from the reviews they are not included among the notable books of the year , which are listed beginning on page 65 balzac a life by graham robb ww norton company i am not deep , said honore de balzac , but very wide graham robb , as chatty and urbane as his subject , confidently negotiates the vast expanses of balzac s life in an unusually witty biography that reads somewhat like a detective story as mr robb tracks down the connections between the life and the work of the greatest novelist of the 19th century balzac regarded dissipation as an investment in friends and patrons , but also in the tumult of personal experience he poured into his novels \( the human comedy alone has more than 2 , 000 acutely realized characters \) few literary lives are as exciting balzac amazes and exhausts one as he tosses in financial rapids , skirts suicide , gambles , smokes opium , seduces women , fathers bastards and creates in prodigious outbursts of writing a world almost as turbulent as he was himself conquest montezuma , cortes , and the fall of old mexico by hugh thomas simon schuster amazingly , hugh thomas has located archival treasures in spain that were missed by scholars for centuries , and he has written an encyclopedic history that supplants william h prescott s legendary history of the conquest of mexico , published 141 years ago lord thomas eloquently conjures up the grandeur , fury , mystery and tragedy of this epic story and his sensitivity to the personalities of the principal figures , and to their voices , which he evokes from his documents , makes it all new conquest does not offer the comforts of heroes and villains , but it greatly deepens our understanding of the terrible and probably unfathomable moment when two peoples , each believing itself the chosen , met in blood and fire to give birth to a new world a frolic of his own by william gaddis poseidon press even if the reader has to pay close attention to the continuous , minimally punctuated speech of dozens of characters that makes up the entire narrative of this exceptionally rich novel , the payoff is worth it in this misanthropic and often hilarious comedy , william gaddis holds up the legal profession , its minions and dupes , to mockery , and then extends the ridicule to a wide spectrum of contemporary american culture presented with swiftian glee as an unholy stew of greed , ignorance , illiteracy , corruption and childish folly his powers of mimicry allow him to flesh out the distinct , often appalling , personalities of his characters through nothing more than their spates of words , and readers who laugh their way right through to the end may find it impossible to get the rhythms and sounds of those voices out of their imaginations in the lake of the woods by tim o'brien seymour lawrence houghton mifflin

hartford , sept 28 it s back the debate over whether connecticut should have an income tax , which might have seemed finished in 1991 , when 40 , 000 shrieking protesters on the capitol lawn failed to roll back the tax , or in 1992 , when the legislature was unable to muster the votes for repeal , has reemerged in 1994 as an unexpected centerpiece in the race for governor john g rowland , the republican candidate , who said earlier this year that he believed the income tax , imposed in 1991 during a fiscal crisis , was probably here to stay , has recently staked his campaign on a promise to repeal all taxes on income in the state over five years an independent thirdparty challenger , tom scott , who led and organized the 1991 protests , has gone one better , promising to do it in four years the issue here is not just cutting taxes , though both men hold up new jersey and massachusetts as taxcut role models what has been proposed is an agenda of wholesale amputation complete elimination of the single largest category of state revenue , which accounts for more than onethird of all state tax collections the question , which generated some of the only sparks in an otherwise lackluster debate in hartford tonight , is whether a repeal plan is realistic only one state alaska , buoyed by its billions in oil industry revenues has ever repealed an income tax and if it is done , at what cost \? is the income tax really responsible , as mr rowland and mr scott argue , for connecticut s bumpy lowgrade recovery from the recession \? and would huge tax cuts jolt economic activity into high gear or simply blow apart the state government \? one of the first hurdles for the new abolitionists would be surviving the ire of the state s biggest business lobby , the connecticut business and industry association a traditional supporter of republican causes , the group strongly supports the tax , arguing that the income tax has actually made the state s business environment better a spokesman , joseph f brennan , said that because of the income tax , the legislature has been able to cut the corporate tax rate , overhaul the workers' compensation law and create new tax breaks for business , like exempting computers from the personal property tax anything that threatens those benefits , or that would add to the tax burden on business , mr brennan said , would be a threat we would be opposed to anything that would focus exclusively on individual tax reductions , he said another issue is how much the income tax is even to blame for the state s economic problems nonpartisan economists and budget experts who have looked at the connecticut situation say that the 1 billion increase in taxes that walloped the state in 1991 when the income tax took hold a 22 percent jump in one year probably did deepen and prolong the recession , by taking money from people s pockets during an uncertain economic period on the other hand , state labor department figures suggest that many of the job losses since then have had little to do with the tax structure cuts in federal military spending and turmoil in the financial services industry , especially among the big insurers in hartford , accounted for much of the employment problem since february 1992 , for example , when the state s unemployment rate reached a peak at 81 percent , through last month , when it stood at 55 percent , about 15 , 000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the state but all of that loss , and more , was accounted for in the category of transportation manufacturing , which includes most military contracting in the state about 19 , 000 jobs in that sector were lost as navy submarine contracts and jet engine orders sagged about 10 , 000 insurance jobs disappeared over the same period one factor that has made it easier to argue for tax cuts now is the changing revenue picture in 1991 , tax collections were plummeting so drastically that an income tax came to be regarded by many state lawmakers as the only workable solution to the budget crisis the outlook now calls for a string of surpluses bonds sold in 1991 to pay off accumulated budget deficits will be paid off by 1996 tax collection revenues from income and sales taxes are expected to produce a 115 million surplus this year the democratic candidate for governor , william e curry jr , has seized on the revenue growth numbers in pledging a 1 billion reduction in property taxes , through a dedicated fund system that would rebate state money to towns and cities the gubernatorial candidate from gov lowell p weicker jr s independent a connecticut party , eunice s groark , has said she would lower the sales tax , from 6 percent to perhaps 5 percent the other big question is the cost of repeal mr rowland , in his plan this week , outlined 400 million in savings achieved in part through reorganization of state agencies and reductions in borrowing and state employee overtime in the 94 billion state budget he said that over five years , half of the 26 billion in lost annual revenue from the income tax would be offset by these reductions the remaining revenue , he said , would result from increased economic activity that would spur revenues from other taxes mrs groark , who cast the deciding vote for the income tax as lieutenant governor , breaking a tie in the state senate , has attacked those assumptions she said that the budget s biggest line item , aid to local towns , could not be cut without forcing up local property taxes , and that medicaid payments , the second largest budget line , could not be significantly cut without causing sanctions from the federal government a spokesman for mr curry argued that the rowland plan misses the point , and that high property taxes are the real drag on connecticut economic activity in the debate tonight , mr curry also attacked what he called the vagueness of mr rowland s proposal at the heart of it is a set of mammoth tax cuts , mr curry said but he said that how the state would pay for those cuts , especially after the first year , was unknown none of the revenues beyond that are explained , not one penny of them , mr curry said mr scott , for his part , says the rowland plan is just wishful thinking eliminating the income tax , he says , can not be done without breaking a few eggs in the first year , for example , a scott administration would eliminate all job training and general assistance welfare , and begin dismantling the state department of education both men also do more than restore the status quo ante , calling for income on interest , dividends and capital gains , which was taxed for years before 1991 , to be fully tax free steven d gold , a researcher at the rockefeller institute of government at the state university of new york at albany , said that abolishing an income tax has been done once in american history in alaska , when the prudhoe bay fields started pumping crude oil and tax bounty to the state in the 1970 s gov fife symington of arizona has also proposed phasing out that state s income tax this year , arguing that with the economy booming , the money is not needed eliminating it in a place like connecticut , mr gold said , where the recession seems barely to have ended , would be different it could not be done painlessly or easily , he said graph ledger taxing in connecticut the governor s race in connecticut has rekindled the debate on whether the state s income tax is necessary the state has had a surplus of more than 100 million since the income tax was imposed in 1991 graphs track annual general fund surpluses and deficits since 1985 and show a breakdown of state revenues for the 1995 fiscal year \( source

washington , march 8 the law firm employee who testified before a federal grand jury about destroying documents from the files of vincent w foster jr now says he was told to shred the material after a special prosecutor had announced that he would look into the suicide of the white house aide jeremy hedges , a parttime courier at the rose law firm in little rock , ark , pinpointed the date in a telephone interview today mr hedges said that when he had fed the documents into the firm s shredder , he had already heard of the appointment of robert b fiske jr as special counsel at the time of his appointment on jan 20 , mr fiske said that he would not only be investigating the whitewater real estate venture , in which president clinton and his wife were partners , but also looking into the circumstances of the suicide in july of mr foster , a longtime friend of the clintons who was a deputy white house counsel and who in private practice represented the clintons in whitewater and other personal matters even before a subpoena is issued , the law prohibits people from intentionally impeding an investigation by destroying evidence they know investigators want what to tell investigators the courier also said today that he and the other couriers employed by the rose firm met with two of the firm s partners in february and that one partner challenged his recollection that he had shredded documents belonging to mr foster and then cautioned him against relating assumptions to investigators mr hedges said that although the partners had encouraged the couriers to cooperate fully with investigators , he felt that the sense of the meeting was i should not tell them something they did not ask ron clark , a partner in the firm and its chief operating officer , said in a telephone interview today that the meeting s only goal was to insure complete cooperation with mr fiske s inquiry mr clark , who presided over the meeting , said jerry jones , the partner who counseled against assumptions , was trying to say 'they 'll be asking a lot of questions just tell them the facts' the firm , whose former partners include hillary rodham clinton , associate attorney general webster l hubbell , and an assistant white house counsel , william h kennedy 3d , asserts that the documents mr hedges shredded were an assortment of internal firm papers that did not come from mr foster s files mr clark said that the firm had four witnesses , two lawyers and two clerks , who support this account he declined to identify them but said they were prepared to testify mr hedges said today that the explanation was hard for me to believe he said the box and all its file folders were marked vwf , the firm s shorthand for mr foster he said that he had glanced at a handful of the documents and that some were letters on the firm s stationary that bore mr foster s signature none of the documents he saw related to the whitewater development company , mr clinton s real estate investment , or james b mcdougal , mr clinton s partner in whitewater and the owner of the failed arkansas savings and loan that is at the center of mr fiske s inquiry , mr hedges said after mr foster s death , the removal of the files about whitewater from his white house office led to much of the pressure on mr clinton to ask for a special prosecutor most large law firms routinely dispose of sensitive client files by shredding them mr clark said last week that the rose firm set up a shredding system in 1991 in anticipation of greater scrutiny by reporters during bill clinton s presidential campaign questions about shredding at rose first arose in february , when the washington times reported that an unidentified employee said the firm had destroyed large quantities of whitewater documents shortly afterwards , mr fiske served subpoenas on law firm employees and issued an order admonishing the firm against destroying any evidence in the case couriers called to meeting mr hedges said the couriers were then called to a meeting with mr clark and mr jones he said mr clark began by instructing everyone to tell what they knew to mr fiske s investigators at that point , mr hedges said , he disclosed his intention to report the shredding of mr foster s documents i said , mr hedges recounted , i shredded some documents of vincent foster s three weeks ago mr jones replied with skepticism he said 'how do you know they were foster s \? do n't assume something you do n't know' mr hedges insisted he was certain the documents came from mr foster s files , but he said mr jones then told the couriers do n't assume they had anything to do with whitewater mr hedges said today that he was convinced that the documents had once been part of mr foster s files the file folders were stacked up neatly and the tabs all said , 'vwf correspondence , ' 'vwf notes , ' 'vwf pleadings' it looked like every file box i 've ever looked at in the firm , he said in addition , he said , the box had the initials vwf on its side and he looked at several letters in the file that bore mr foster s signature mr clark said the letters might be explained by the fact that the box included files from the firm s recruiting efforts mr foster , he said , routinely sent letters to lawyers the firm was seeking to hire he acknowledged , however , that the box of documents the firm says was shredded should not have had binders bearing the initials vwf i ca n't give you any fact that is going to resolve that , he said mr hedges said he had fed documents into a shredding machine for 30 minutes before being relieved by another courier , who took another 30 minutes to finish the job another employee s account clayton lindsey , the courier who took over the shredding , said in a telephone interview today that he , too , clearly remembered the vwf markings on the binders mr lindsey said that when he placed documents into the machine , he generally keeps them in their jackets the tabs , with identifying initials , are typically facing up i saw the same stuff jeremy did , mr lindsey said i saw the initials on the side of the box and on some of the manila folders it said vwf correspondence and like that i did n't look into any of them mr lindsey has been interviewed by the fbi but has not testified to the grand jury in his feb 16 testimony before the grand jury , mr hedges said only that the incident happened three weeks previously , or in the same week as mr fiske s jan 20 appointment but in the interview , mr hedges said he had distinctly recalled hearing of mr fiske s appointment when he was asked by a file clerk in the firm to carry out the shredding photo jeremy hedges , a courier at the rose law firm in little rock , ark , says he began shredding papers from the files of vincent w foster jr after a special counsel said he would look into the clinton aide s suicide \( spencer tirey for the new york times \) \( pg b7 \)
the last time i left spain , a guard was pointing a rifle at me i never did figure out why i had just spent a week in barcelona with a group of american chefs our mission was to learn the local ingredients , cook a meal to dazzle the local food elite and fall in love with catalan cuisine all of that was easy but what none of us had counted on was the giddy joy of life in barcelona it turned out to be a fabulous city bubbling with action long after midnight a city where chic people stroll past centuryold buildings more modern than anything built yesterday in new york a city with one of the world s great markets , la boqueria , and restaurants that serve some of the most exotic food i 've ever tasted a city where cocktails are served at 10 am and cava \( champagne \) is considered the proper drink at any hour i had n't thought about barcelona for a while , and then i walked through bolo s door and it all came back in a rush bobby flay and laurence kretchmer have somehow captured the spirit of barcelona in their latest venture this is n't a spanish restaurant the two are american to the core and too smart to forget it but they have taken spain as their theme somehow it works from the bold graphic collages on the wall to the gaudistyle tiles around the oven , bolo vibrates with the humorous edginess of spain s most interesting city the food has the same exuberance it is a highwire act that sometimes slips , but even when it does , you find yourself admiring the bravery of the attempt this food has guts and energy when it does n't work , it is rarely because it is too timid most of the appetizers do work little brown rings of fried squid come with a lemony parsley pesto and a lively anchovy vinaigrette , both so good that you soak them up with bread when the squid is gone baby clams are steamed in green onion broth spiked with garlic , and eggplant is baked into a marvelous mush , then layered with manchego cheese and glazed with balsamic vinegar these are forceful flavors there is one wimpy dish on the menu saltcodandpotato fritters salt cod is strong stuff and not exactly america s favorite flavor , but the chef has pulled his punches and pulled the punch right out of the dish he has added so much potato to mute the flavor of the fish that the cod becomes little more than an afterthought eating this bland dish , i could n't help thinking of petit paris , a barcelona restaurant that serves salt cod seven ways , one of them with honey still , what the fritters lack in flavor they make up in beauty , perched as they are on a bright hash of roasted peppers , surrounded by a drizzle of bright green basil oil and crowned with a pair of fried basil leaves the ovenroasted and marinated shrimp are even prettier they are served in a little casserole surrounded by a small flotilla of toasted garlic slices with wings made of flatbread shooting out the sides the dish is pretty and delicious , but somewhere in the back of my head i could n't help thinking two shrimp there are just two shrimp on this plate for 950 \? the bolo salad is a better deal too good a deal , actually with all the cabrales cheese and tomatoes , and chorizo , the very notion that this is a salad gets lost despite the interesting mixed greens , including parsley i would have liked it better without the chorizo \( and then maybe the management could have knocked a dollar off the 650 price \) the chef really runs into problems with his entrees when i saw swordfish with preserved lemon sauce and fried capers , i was very excited i was remembering walking into la boqueria and watching the american chefs exclaim over the beauty of the capers they decided to serve the capers with sweetbreads and lemons , and i remembered how the capers blossomed in the pan when they were fried , opening like flowers the severity of their flavor was the perfect counterpoint to the richness of sweetbreads here the capers were simply smashed , and their saltiness did nothing for the swordfish , which had already been overwhelmed by preserved lemons the sauce served with the roasted lamb chops is pretty powerful , too the lamb can certainly stand up to the dried figs and pine nuts it s wonderful lamb but the sauce is so sweet , so syrupy , it seems more appropriate to pancakes paella with lobster and roasted duck also seemed like too much of a good thing ordinary paella is a wellconceived dish , but here it becomes a lot of mushy rice garnished with sweet duck and some poor lost lobster that looks as if it fell into the dish and wonders how it is ever going to get out the dish never comes together in any sensible way on the other hand , roasted pork loin with apples and pomegranate is a wonderful plate of food , and the grilled quail brushed with honey and sherry vinegar is absolutely irresistible but my favorite dish is mr flay s interpretation of the great catalan noodle dish called fideus , in which a vermicellilike pasta is cooked in fish stock until it drinks it in mr flay cooks his pasta in squid ink until it is black , then tops it with grilled sea scallops and a wonderful sauce made of saffron and yellow peppers it s a bold dish with all the intensity of modern spain mr flay also plays around with rice and beans until he comes up with a version all his own he cooks black beans with fat and rice with curry until the flavors fly off in opposite directions , a jazzy new york version of a peasant dish his attempt at calcots , the great catalan country dish of charcoalgrilled onions served with a romesco sauce made of peppers , ground nuts , tomatoes and parsley , is less successful the sauce is terrific how could it not be \? but mr flay does n't grill the leeks long enough and had he read colman andrews s wonderful catalan cuisine \( atheneum , 1988 \) , he would have learned that leeks do n't make a very good substitute for green onions the texture just is n't right desserts are lovely i particularly like the caramel sorbet and the wine list is filled with such interesting choices , both spanish and american , that it is tempting to order another bottle and just linger at the table the happy energy at bolo is so appealing it is hard to leave that is exactly the way i felt about barcelona which may be why the guard decided to point his gun at me we had just discovered that the plane was oversold , that some of us might have to spend a few more days in spain that was fine with me bolo  23 east 22d street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 2282200 atmosphere the bold , bright decor adds to the electric energy of the atmosphere not the place for quiet conversation service the attractive young waiters are hip , friendly and very sweet recommended dishes fried squid bolo salad grilled octopus and white bean salad pork loin grilled quail grilled sea scallops with pasta blackandgold rice and beans apple tortilla caramel sorbet catalan custard wine list spanish and american wines , well chosen and fairly priced hours lunch mondays through fridays , noon to 2 15 pm dinner mondays through saturdays , 5 30 pm to midnight sundays beginning jan 16 , 5 30 pm to midnight price range lunch appetizers , 6 to 9 main courses , 13 to 16 dinner appetizers , 6 to 9 main courses , 16 to 2450 credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility everything on one level what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change

montes claros , brazil , july 8 in the depth of winter in brazil s backlands , a bright 85degree sun beats down on the dusty green hills , driving even the lizards to seek the shade but dozens of people are gathered at midday at a highway intersection here , their bicycles , motorcycles , cars and pickup trucks festooned with red banners an hour of waiting is rewarded when a tour bus appears through the shimmering heat on the asphalt horizon a sound truck leads the way into town , blaring between riffs of brazilian rap music every worker to portugal square meet the first worker president in the history of brazil luis inacio lula da silva and his citizenship caravan have just rolled into montes claros mechanics at a bicycle repair shop put down their tools to gawk a farm supply salesman hitches up his pants and ambles to the front of his store a small girl stands frozen , clutching a soccer ball in her arms despite the general stir , a saleswoman at a clothing store points to the heavens and says , the only leader i believe in is up there but far from little ranching towns like montes claros , pollsters and politicians are not so skeptical about the whistlestop caravans of a presidential candidate known to every brazilian simply as lula the caravans help explain the depth of support for lula , said marcos antonio coimbra , an independent pollster they 've helped to bridge feelings of distance and abandonment felt by a large part of the electorate in april 1993 , with opinion polls showing only 18 percent of the voters saying they prefer him for president , the candidate of the leftwing brazil workers' party embarked on his first caravan a 23day , 43stop tour that retraced his childhood journey in an open truck as his family fled brazil s droughtparched northeast and moved to its industrial south after 11 caravans , 600 towns and 25 , 000 miles , mr da silva doubled his standing in the polls to be the preferred candidate of 36 percent of the voters now , centrist and conservative candidates are crisscrossing brazil , trying to play catchup before the first round of the nation s presidential elections on oct 3 lula travels by bus and by boat , said paulo delgado , a workers' party congressman , as the candidate was leaving on a threeday trip down the sao francisco river , the major artery through brazil s northeast the other candidates go by airplane traveling at 30 miles an hour through each of brazil s 26 states has changed mr da silva s strategy lula is less ideological now , said ricardo kotscho , mr da silva s press adviser , the same job he held in the 1989 elections when mr da silva ran second to fernando collor de mello , who was forced out as brazilian president in a corruption scandal in 1992 on any theme , he knows the problem close up , not from position papers , mr kotscho said the party and the program are less sectarian , less closed lula has met with gold miners , indians , blacks , union people and students in 15 months , he has had 115 meetings with businessmen cornered briefly , away from fans waving ballpoint pens for autographs , the cigarchomping candidate said you ca n't govern the country without knowing the country the caravans have deepened my knowledge of brazil this campaign style so unnerved traditional politicians that they passed a restrictive television advertising law last year that is a throwback to the military dictatorship of the 1970 s in contrast to the freewheeling election advertising of 1989 , this year s television advertisements are limited to candidates speaking in studios the law bans jingles , graphs , endorsements by outsiders and video footage from outside a studio the law was passed precisely so that lula could n't use caravan images , mr kotscho said , noting that the law was backed by centerright parties that later united behind the candidacy of fernando henrique cardoso , a former finance minister who was running second in polls with about 21 percent none of the other half dozen candidates have more than 5 percent in the opinion polls in response , the workers' party has prepared a video , voyage to the heart of brazil with the campaign now turning to brazil s big cities , organizers plan to show the video on large screens at urban rallies the right underestimated the deep roots of lula s support and overestimated the possibility of pulling rabbits out of hats , said mr coimbra , the pollster here in montes claros , a 14hour bus ride from rio de janeiro , casual interviews supported his thesis lula is the only candidate who s come out here , said juckson brand , a police detective who moonlights as a taxi driver he s a guy who came up from the bottom he said that most drivers at his taxi stand plan to vote for the workers' party candidate zezinho barro de mello , a 30yearold bar owner , proudly showed a scrap of paper autographed lula , and said , most of the guys at my bar are going to vote for lula sebastiao alves de souza , a high school mathematics teacher pedaled his blue bicycle in the caravan to the rally at portugal square wearing a tshirt emblazoned with lula 1994 , he offered an insight into the workers' party s organizational edge the difference is this we buy our party tshirts the right wing parties give them away photo the candidate all brazil knows as lula , luis inacio da silva , rolling into montes claros on a bus , bringing his political caravan to brazil s hinterlands , where voters , many of whom came on bicycles to see him , have made him the frontrunner in this year s presidential

frankfurt , dec 2 one day after winning congressional approval of a vast global trade accord , the clinton administration appears to be losing the first power struggle in the new world trade order at issue is who will head the soontobecreated world trade organization , the agency that is to handle trade disputes and replace the existing genevabased bureaucracy of gatt , or the general agreement on tariffs and trade the united states has vigorously supported carlos salinas de gotari , the mexican president who left office on thursday mr salinas is seen as a champion of free trade , having led mexico into the north american free trade agreement , and he is by far the most prestigious candidate for the job but he is running a distant second the european union , led by germany and france , is backing an italian diplomat and trade expert , renato ruggiero , who served as the italian minister of foreign trade from 1987 through 1991 and is well known in european trade circles a surprisingly strong third is kim chul su , the south korean trade minister , who has the support of japan and most asian countries the issue is important because many experts say the world trade organization will emerge over time as the most important international economic agency , eclipsing the world bank and the international monetary fund in importance , as it carries out the farreaching changes in trade agreed to under gatt according to officials in the gatt building on the shores of lake geneva , mr ruggiero has more than 50 percent of the votes of the 123 member nations and pressure has built over the last week for the united states to persuade mr salinas to withdraw in favor of mr ruggiero fair is fair , said a european diplomat involved in the closeddoor negotiations we have high esteem for mr salinas and mr kim , but mr ruggiero has more than half the votes , and a consensus should form around him it is only appropriate that mr salinas and mr kim withdraw in washington , president clinton today threw his weight behind mr salinas , saying the former mexican president would bring to the helm of world trade organization a wealth of experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing country administration officials said they recognized that mr salinas faced an uphill fight but they said mr clinton had decided to issue the unusual endorsement because he believed that mr salinas would bring with him the kind of political influence the new organization will need at minimum , the officials said , the endorsement would put mr clinton in common cause with the latin american leaders with whom he will meet next week in miami at the summit of the americas officials of gatt would like to resolve the dispute by thursday , when the members meet to approve the startup of the world trade organization so that on jan 1 the agency will begin with a new director general , replacing peter sutherland , who was the managing director of gatt but so far , gatt diplomats say , none of the three sides is budging many insiders say they cannot remember when the normally collegial body of bureaucrats has been as deeply divided , and they fear a long , messy internal debate what they hope at all costs to avoid is a potentially divisive public vote gatt officials pride themselves on working by consensus for those who have criticized the world trade organization and its authority to rule unilaterally on trade disputes , the leadership struggle may confirm their worst fears most of mr ruggiero s votes come not from the major nations in europe , but from the smaller african , caribbean and pacific countries that are either former european colonies or major trading partners with the european union since each member has one vote , major powers like the united states and japan have no more voting power than many tiny nations but the current debate is not really between large and small countries it is predominantly between europe and the united states , and underscores a growing economic rivalry europe has been slow to create new trade links outside its borders , as the united states has with mexico and many european governments were shaken last month by the prospect though admittedly distant that the united states would form a giant free trading bloc with the pacific basin countries to be sure , both the europeans and americans have strong arguments for their candidates mr salinas s supporters say his presence would lift the stature of the agency and insure an audience with other world leaders at critical times but that is just what many in geneva do not want in addition to a fear that it would concentrate too much power in the hands of the americans , antisalinas sentiment stems from a belief that a lowprofile diplomat could accomplish more in the agency than one of mr salinas s stature ambassadors fear salinas would be forever going over their heads direct to the heads of states and not working through the existing process , a diplomat said this is a relatively informal agency he would n't have the security , the entourage and the kind of office he is used to in the presidential palace in mexico what does sutherland have , a couple of secretaries and an assistant or two \? this is a very collegial body , not one of great show since the organization is not about to bring the matter to a public vote , quiet canvassing is being done by hungary s delegate , andreas szepesi , hoping that once one candidate builds a commanding lead , the two others will graciously withdraw though mr szepesi refuses to give interviews , he is making his findings known despite the strong support for mr ruggiero , who is 64 , he lacks the backing of the united states , considered essential but mr ruggiero is at the same time a friend of the united states , having pushed hard for european governments to support the strategic defense initiative during the reagan administration he has held senior diplomatic posts in moscow and washington i think i am in the best position , mr ruggiero said in a telephone interview but i need the us support certainly without us support , you cannot win but it is hard to see the united states so quickly abandoning the 46yearold mr salinas , who has many years ahead of him in international politics and not that many obvious places to serve salinas was the aztec emperor for six years , and he is terribly afraid of suddenly becoming a nonentity and disappearing , said a latin american official who supports him he s got to find some way to stay afloat
is there any politician but mario m cuomo who would devote an entire campaign appearance to an impassioned , detailed history of the labor movement in america \? is there any other politician who could \? the governor has often been called an oldfashioned progressive in an era of backpedaling new democrats , the remnant of an earlier day when democrats were rousing , happy warrior populists but as he has stumped through new york for the last several weeks , mr cuomo has once again demonstrated a campaign style even more singular than that this is a candidate who simply knows things that other candidates do not know , and who says things that other candidates would never dream of saying where other politicians around the nation talk vaguely about the need for change , mr cuomo talks about the nature of change , the cycles of history where other trailing candidates belittle the polls , mr cuomo does so in a catskills routine , via the jesuits these polls , they 're wonderful too , he told a group of wealthy supporters in manhattan thursday night the polls are really great here s what the polls say i do n't look at the polls why \? they tell you your popularity has gone down nobody likes you it s like being spat upon i do n't need that i'm married it may have little to do with how he might govern in a fourth term , but he remains one of the most compelling campaigners in america any single sentence of his is likely to veer into a funny ethnic back alley somewhere in prehistoric queens before emerging into a vast cosmic statement about human morality he can be bitter and obnoxious and infuriating , but he retains the ability to bring a crowd around to his side if only for a few moments no matter how many times they 've boarded his ride his own crankiness , in fact , is part of the inside joke , as he demonstrated to a tentful of new york times executives last week at the groundbreaking for a new printing plant i think some of their editorials are lousy , he said of the paper s opinion pages , savoring the opportunity but i have trouble with some parts of the old testament , so that does n't mean anything he has always disliked the labored rituals of the stump , the conspicuous consumption of calamari at a street fair while wearing an i love mario cap and tapping a toe to italian music he will occasionally indulge the crowd with such antics , but it is often with little joy , and the creases in his face seem deeper and more pained with each tarantella last week , leaving a converted defense plant in long island , he walked across the street to a waiting crowd and listlessly shook a few hands within 15 seconds he was deep in an argument with a bystander about the public service commission after a moment of pointless heat , he waved off the man with a dismissive gesture , got back in his car and left , the handshaking over almost before it started as if in counterpoint , vice president al gore followed him out the door , tripped when his crutch caught an aide s pants cuff , and fell face down on the ground he immediately bounded up , plunged into the same crowd , and spent several happy argumentfree minutes chatting , handshaking and waving mr gore is an effusive campaigner , but he shares none of the governor s oddly distancing charisma where other politicians draw strength from a crowd s body heat , mr cuomo seems truly comfortable only when shielded from them by a lectern there are clearly variations in his mood on friday he seemed to actually enjoy chatting with bystanders in penn station but for the most part , he is most alive when a microphone is near his mouth , for it is there that he can work the levers and dials of a crowd , raising and lowering their emotional pitch with the precision of an engineer at a breakfast meeting of the communications workers of america in manhattan last week , where mr cuomo delivered his labormovement history , most of the crowd was his before he walked in the door the governor is an old friend of organized labor , and he could have read the newspaper and gotten an ovation while his listeners expected to be satisfied , however , they did not plan on being enthralled , not after 12 years of his voice swirling through the state s collective consciousness yet there was not a sound to be heard in the ballroom as mr cuomo swept them from african slavery to the sweatshops to the triangle shirtwaist fire , from the glory days of labor to the winter of reaganomics and into a promised golden future of workermanagement cooperation triumphant over the global economy no one in the room learned a thing , and no one s life was changed by his words but whether they believed in his rosy predictions or not , many of them suddenly felt much better about themselves and their movement , and their applause was fervent and prolonged man , what a way to start a morning , said elaine conchero , a cwa member from midwood he s like a good cup of coffee even his worst detractors have always conceded the raw power of his oratory and his impressive erudition his republican opponent , state senator george e pataki , enjoys confessing that he is not mr cuomo s speechmaking equal , and likes to make fun of the latin phrases and theological handwringing that are by now the governor s trademark doing so apparently makes mr pataki more familiar to the average tonguetied citizen seeking to inoculate voters from mr cuomo s spell , republicans have often tried to paint him as a kind of brilliant svengali , whose pretty words might bewitch listeners into doing something evil in the voting booth but even more than his eloquence , it is actually the sweep of his core themes that has kept what he calls his final campaign so intriguing , even to those who have heard the e b white quotes and the old neighborhood memories several dozen times his great subject is the nature of the american experience , the way the nation s immigrant history is deeply woven into its future , and he is one of the few politicians who can bring it off without sounding shallow or contrived i want a place that has room for everybody , he told a street rally in long island city earlier this month , his booming voice at its most emphatic i want a place that gives opportunity to everybody i want a place where your kid can go to school , whether he s black or white or latino or gay or lesbian or pole or russian , what the heck ever he is , we give them opportunity if you can work , if you 're willing to do your job , if you 're willing to get an education , then you can be whatever you want that s where i come from that s what queens is the words are not merely a throwback , they are an open defiance of the prevailing constrictive mood , a highwire challenge to the fundamental laws of politics and as he well knows , there is nothing more riveting than watching to see if the acrobat can survive the act photo gov mario m cuomo speaking on saturday at a restaurant in buffalo state assemblyman arthur eve is at rear , directly beyond the microphone the governor has surpassed his already large reputation as a unique , charismatic campaigner in the current runup to election day \( associated press \)
even in a country where everything from parricide to political scandal is instantly transformed into a multimedia freak show , the art exhibition that just closed at the tatou gallery in beverly hills might turn heads there , at prices up to 20 , 000 , connoisseurs purchased paintings by john wayne gacy , the condemned serial killer who murdered 33 boys and young men in a chicago suburb in the 1970 s i guess he killed people better than he painted , one patron told the los angeles times but that does n't mean there is n't a market for the killer s selfportraits , or that some enterprising scholar wo n't offer learned views on the parallels between the gacy oeuvre and , say , the early hitler watercolors this is a boom time for serial killers they 're a growth industry both as a criminal class and as an american cultural preoccupation as joyce carol oates writes in her survey of serialkiller lit in the new york review of books , there have been more serial murders reported since 1970 than in all previous american history combined there has also been a run on serialkiller entertainment and merchandise since silence of the lambs earned its oscar from books to documentary films \( aileen wuornos the selling of a serial killer \) to artifacts \( a proposed auction of jeffrey dahmer memorabilia to benefit his victims' families \) two new names have just joined the pantheon henry louis wallace , 28 , apprehended in charlotte , nc , for the murder of 10 women , and ricardo silvio caputo , 44 , admitting to four victims at his arraignment in new york last week also brought network newsmagazine rating triumphs for appearances by charles manson and mr dahmer mr caputo graces abc s prime time live tonight what fascinates us about these psychopaths \? ms oates s answer is no doubt right our uneasy sense that such persons are forms of ourselves , derailed and gone terribly wrong yet it s just as easy to keep a safe distance and see nothing of ourselves in a ted bundy or son of sam which is why i was shocked when that distance was abruptly narrowed by lionel dahmer s justpublished a father s story this bloodfree , angstfilled memoir has no prurient passages but it ended my immunity to the national case of the serialkiller creeps in measured voice , mr dahmer , a 57yearold research chemist and the son of teachers , tries to figure out what made his son practice necrophilia and cannibalism on some 17 victims his task is n't easy because jeffrey dahmer does not fit the classic serialkiller pattern he was n't an abused child he grew up not in a foster home but an actual home where he was loved , hugged and indulged despite his parents' divorce and his own alcoholism young jeffrey did n't explode in anger or ramble in conversation he passed through the sat s , state u and the army a father s story is illustrated with blackandwhite brownie snapshots of a smiling , towheaded boy so what went wrong \? lionel dahmer is finally reduced to blaming his son s monstrousness on his own unexceptional history mr dahmer judges himself a poor father because he prattled impersonally about the weather in letters to his son he also speculates that his own youthful shyness , fascination with bombs and fears of abandonment added up to a monstrous genetic inheritance if these were credible theories , this country would have more serial killers than lawyers jeffrey dahmer remains a phantom , defying logic but if we ca n't identify with the son , might we not with his caring , intelligent father \? lionel dahmer so blindly believed in his child that when the police called he at first thought jeffrey was a murder victim , not a murderer surely none of us would make that mistake but how certain can we be \? mr dahmer s story is terrifying precisely because his blindness to his son s insanity was inseparable from his love for him his book s final snapshot , worthy of diane arbus , was taken in prison last year a fatherson portrait , it s scarier than any shot in silence of the lambs the two dahmers , one a serial killer and one not , stand arminarm , looking just like twins i have a picture in my scrapbook that looks something like that do you \?
poughkeepsie , ny true , robert \( watchdog bob \) jankovics has not been a reporter very long and , true , his radio persona is modeled on dom deluise s hyperventilated watchdog reporter in the movie the best little whorehouse in texas but none of that dampens watchdog bob s earnestness about the legal battle he is fighting an effort that appears likely to end with him in prison testing the limits of the first amendment mr jankovics is one of those personalities who come along in journalism every now and again , who seem bent on trying to put their names on court decisions involving collisions of prosecutors and the press the short version of his unusual story is that federal prosecutors are investigating accusations of police wiretapping violations in this city 60 miles north of manhattan they want him to tell a grand jury the name of the person who played a tape for him the tape , secretly recorded at the police station here , was of a confidential conversation between an arrested city official and his lawyer the prosecutor , steven m witzel , an assistant united states attorney , says the courts have been clear reporters should be treated like other citizens , he said , and must respond to questions put to them by a grand jury investigation citing the first amendment , mr jankovics refused he said whistleblowers would no longer trust watchdog bob if he named his source he feared losing a pipeline to exposes for his yearandahalfold weekly show on wkipam , a talkradio station and abc affiliate here first amendment lawyers say the law is fairly well settled and is weighted heavily against mr jankovics s position but he says he is nevertheless fighting for journalists everywhere if i were to be found guilty , he said with fervor , no reporter including '60 minutes' or whoever would be protected and they would have to divulge their sources mr jankovics was found in contempt by a federal district judge and threatened with prison he appealed to the federal appeals court in new york that court , one of the most influential in the country on news media issues , quickly dismissed his appeal on friday the case is now expected to return to the district court for sentencing , but mr jankovics vowed friday night to keep fighting apparently we 're destined to go to the supreme court , he said his case has been something of a sensation here for several months but only now has the small community of national advocates for the press begun to take note and what some of them have noted is that mr jankovics could either become a hero or a scoundrel to reporters everywhere because of his stubborn insistence on taking his case as far as he can that could be good for the press , or it could be very bad for the press , depending on whether the supreme court even agrees to hear the case and whether it is sympathetic or hostile , said jane e kirtley , the executive director of the reporters committee for freedom of the press in washington the legal problem is that the supreme court devastated the news media with a landmark ruling in 1972 , branzburg v hayes the decision declared that reporters do not have an absolute privilege to refuse to answer grand jury questions when they have evidence of criminal wrongdoing that has sometimes meant they must turn over the names of people to whom they had promised anonymity state legislatures , including new york s , have enacted shield laws to create protections for reporters but in recent years , a handful of reporters have been jailed for refusing to provide testimony sought by prosecutors lawyers for news organizations say reporters have been subpoenaed more than ever , especially in federal courts , where state shield laws are often of no help against that backdrop , many lawyers for established news organizations have shied away from pursuing appeals when faced with grand jury subpoenas , preferring to avoid the risk that the courts might further limit reporters' protection also against that backdrop , watchdog bob arrived mr jankovics , who is 49 , is something of an unusual journalist he owns a big insurance agency in an old bank building downtown he also owns real estate , pay telephones , vending machines and a nearby resort he is also a partner in a private investigation firm he says he has a long history of standing up to local officials and local business executives who are unethical or not quite up to snuff until recently , he also ran a muchadvertised travel agency and worked part time as a local police officer but , as he says , that is another story to people around here , mr jankovics has long been seen as outspoken he s a publicity hound , said joseph h chiseri , the city manager he likes to see his name in the fall of 1992 , the morning man on wkip , john steffanci , heard that other local radio talk show hosts were developing investigative segments like the consumeroriented reports on television news mr steffanci spoke to mr jankovics , who was a big advertiser on the station for his travel and insurance businesses mr steffanci said mr jankovics jumped at the chance by referring immediately to the best little whorehouse character who hounded the legendary chicken ranch out of existence the watchdog of the film was the kind of guy who insisted that peanut candy bars contain whole nuts , and not , in mr deluise s words , nut chips , halfnuts or nut bits mr steffanci said that when he brought up the idea of a local investigative report , mr jankovics said did you ever see 'the best little whorehouse in texas \? ' i want to be that guy ' watchdog bob was born the station owner agreed to give him free advertising for his other businesses in exchange for his work the program went on the air watchdog bob asked whistleblowers to call him he told listeners about what he called consumer scams involving roofers and carpet installers he also began getting secret information from city workers we found things were not quite up to snuff with the political leadership of the city , the watchdog said and then , in the early morning hours last march 30 , the city manager at the time , william theysohn , was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving and given a speeding ticket from the police station , the city manager called his lawyer , who also happened to be an alderman their conversation , the content of which has never been disclosed , was captured by a hidden police tape recording system the charges against mr theysohn were later dismissed , though he resigned and is now suing the city , saying his ability to earn a living has been impaired the rest is history by the time watchdog bob got to his insurance office the morning after the incident , it appears that two separate informants had provided him with the recording he never used the tape on the air but he never denied that he had it and he says he will never tell who gave it to him he said he is focused on his legal case , and feels that he is in good hands his lawyer , thomas p halley , is a former assistant corporation counsel for poughkeepsie but mr halley also has a role of his own on the watchdog bob show mr halley is sometimes the cohost , a sort of junior watchdog bob on the air , watchdog bob has a name for him the lawyer is known as the watch puppy photo robert jankovics , a reporter for wkip in poughkeepsie , ny , who is trying to protect the identity of the source who gave him a copy of a wiretap that may have been illegally made by local police at left was john steffanci , the station s morning man \( susan harris for the new york times \)

our nation in mexico , an assassin killed luis donaldo colosio , the presidential candidate of the institutional revolutionary party we send our condolences and our prayers to his family , and i urge the mexican people at this difficult time to continue their strides toward economic and political reform and progress with the congress beginning its easter recess tomorrow , this is a good time to assess the real work we are getting done on behalf of the american people we 're moving forward on our economic plan the budget now moving through congress , when passed , will give us three consecutive years of deficit reduction for the first time since harry truman was president in 1995 , we 'll have the lowest budget deficit as a percentage of our annual income of any of the major industrialized countries our recovering economy produced two million jobs last year , and we 're on track to create two million more in '94 around the world america s efforts have helped to bring much needed calm to sarajevo and led to an important political accord between the bosnian muslims and croats our call for restraint has helped to start talks again in the middle east we 'll continue our

on a sultry summer day , when it is hard to remember a single good thing about life in new york city , the best advice i 've got is go to the rainbow room the rainbow room is a dazzling bit of fantasy where bands play without stopping , the dance floor revolves and men in fabulous clothes set fire to ice cream the magic begins the instant you enter the lobby the marble halls of rockefeller center are dark and hushed in the evening the elevators are lined with wood and even the buttons are beautiful when the doors open on the 65th floor , you find yourself in a long glass , ebony and mahogany hall that makes you feel you have stepped right into a 1930 s movie set no matter what you saw the last time you looked into a mirror , you now feel chic , beautiful and sophisticated the people pointing the way to the dining room are wearing wonderful costumes that add to the unreality in their pastel tails they smile and point up the stairs the music rises by the time you arrive in the swirling lights of the city s most glamorous setting , you are in another world even people who do n't dance do at the rainbow room who could resist the music , the chandeliers , the dazzling views \? the carpet coddles the feet the chairs are deep and comfortable the sound of the music is exhilarating anything seems possible especially after a cocktail sipping one of the delicious concoctions it is easy to understand why they were once so popular these cocktails are not explosively modern combinations of sugar and alcohol but delicately balanced blends of fresh juice and fragrant liquor their names are like poetry singapore sling , julep , sidecar they go down smoothly if life were a movie , the rainbow room would have great food unfortunately , the magic wears a little thin in the kitchen it takes careful ordering to prolong the illusion start with oysters rockefeller , big sassy mollusks sharing their shells with a pungent mix of pureed greens arrayed across a bed of rock salt , the oysters arrive piping hot but still firm and juicy rich enough to deserve their fancy name , they are seductively delicious the simply iced oysters are also impeccable but to really swing into the spirit of the restaurant , order the shellfish extravaganza , clams , mussels and lobster splashed across a pyramid of crushed ice it is the perfect dish for the rainbow room the seafood is fresh and fine , and it stays cold while you take a few turns across the floor , dancing to bigband standards or a latin beat the trio of caviars is another appropriate beginning the colorful roe golden whitefish , bright orange salmon and dusky sevruga is presented on little pads of potato puree something a little less opulent \? try the cake of wild mushrooms , a modest timbale that tumbles around the mouth in a riot of flavors any of these make dining at the rainbow room a joy but the musicians have to work hard to make up for the cold , tough chilled shrimp with zucchini chutney and it s not easy to be happy eating the rubbery snails in the escargot ragout the greasy sherried tarts on which they are served do n't help asparagus soup is only ordinary if you want something plain and green , consider the salad of field greens in an assertive mustard vinaigrette expect a lull between courses service is leisurely the rainbow room understands that you have not shown up for a quick bite watch the daylight as if fades into evening admire the city shimmering through the windows and watch the lights on the bridges flicker on until they look like necklaces flung across the rivers all this is a hard act for mere food to follow , but lobster thermidor is almost equal to the challenge the lobsters are steamed , the meat removed and then returned to the shell beneath a rich sauce combining hollandaise , whipped cream , wine and fish stock the sauce may be a little skimpy , but there is nothing wrong with the lobster in this luxurious , oldfashioned dish pommes soufflees are also reminders of another time the potato chips from the past , crisp little airfilled blimps , are served in napkinlined baskets they are just the thing to eat with grilled sirloin steak add some creamed spinach and you have a perfect meal red snapper is a little more modern , and it is also a fine dish the fish is served on a bed of sliced leeks in a rich , buttery lemongrass sauce that vibrates with the snappy flavor of ginger and the salmon , poached and served with a wonderful asparagus flan , is also satisfying i have been less impressed with the veal chop , a fatladen piece of meat served with artichokes and wild mushrooms sea scallops in gingerorangebutter sauce were unpleasantly fishy but the worst dish is the roast breast of duck , a very fatty bird served in a sweet fruity sauce laced with cumin eaten with a dreary side dish of mixed spring vegetables , it was almost enough to destroy the spell of the room but not quite the band segued into i 'll take manhattan just as the waiter arrived with baked alaska holding out the silver platter he showed off the pretty ice cream cake covered with meringue then he heated a small pot of brandy and poured the burning alcohol over the top the blue flames flickered across the frozen swirls of sugar , a joyous reminder of how much fun life can be rainbow room 30 rockefeller center , \( 212 \) 6325000 atmosphere for sheer glamour , excitement and beauty no restaurant in america can match this one service the staff is beautifully costumed and generally professional but on busy nights the waiters often become forgetful recommended dishes oysters rockefeller , trio of caviars , shellfish extravaganza , cake of wild mushrooms , field greens , lobster thermidor , red snapper with lemongrass sauce , poached salmon with asparagus flan , sirloin steak , pommes soufflees , baked alaska wine list wideranging and fairly priced the bartenders are also adept at cocktails hours pretheater prix fixe 5 30 to 6 30 pm tuesdays through saturdays dinner 6 30 to 10 15 pm , supper 10 30 pm to midnight , dancing until 1 am , all tuesdays through saturdays dinner 5 30 to 9 30 pm , dancing until 11 pm sundays closed sundays july 24 to oct 2 also closed mondays price range pretheater prix fixe 3850 appetizers , 8 to 62 \( beluga caviar \) dinner entrees , 27 to 35 supper entrees , 17 to 34 music surcharge is 20 a person on fridays and saturdays , 15 other nights all major credit cards wheelchair accessibility a ramp can be requested ahead of time for the stairs to the dining room wheelchairaccessible restrooms are available what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change
washington , aug 3 following is the transcript of president clinton s news conference , held tonight in the east room of the white house , as recorded by the new york times president clinton good evening , ladies and gentlemen tonight i want to speak with you about crime , health care and the progress of our national economic strategy as i have said so many times , the central mission of this administration , renewing the american dream , requires us to restore economic growth , rebuild american communities , empower individual citizens to take personal responsibility for their own futures and make government work for ordinary citizens again we are making progress remember , we are about now a year from the time when congress passed out economic recovery plan i remember , then , that our opponents said if that plan passed , the sky would fall , unemployment would go up , the deficit would explode well , they were wrong look at the facts we cut 255 billion in spending , raised tax rates on only 12 percent of the wealthiest americans , cut taxes for 15 million working families of modest incomes , made 90 percent of our small businesses eligible for a tax cut and 20 million americans available , or eligible , to refinance their college loans at lower interest rates now the deficit is going down three years in a row for the first time since harry truman was president we 've got almost 4 million new jobs , very low inflation , a 15 percent drop in unemployment there were other skeptics later who said the sky would fall if we passed the north american free trade agreement they , too , were wrong we can see this year that automobile sales , for example , in mexico to mexico are growing at five times the rate of last year , and our trade with mexico is growing more rapidly than that with any other country and while i know an awful lot of people are still hurting , the road ahead looks good according to fortune magazine , for the first time in a decade , all 50 states will expand their private economies next year let me say that again for the first time in a decade all 50 states will experience economic growth next year none of this came without a fight , and now we 're involved in two more historic fights the first is on crime we have a chance to pass the toughest , smartest crime bill in the history of the united states after six years of bickering over it let me remind you of what that bill will do it will put 100 , 000 police officers on the streets of our communities , a 20 percent increase it will make three strikes and you 're out the law of the land it will ban deadly assault weapons and hand gun ownership by minors it will provide tougher sentences for violent criminals and more prisons to put them in and we 've listened to police , prosecutors and community leaders who tell us that they need much more for prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to believe it or not , there are still special interests here in washington trying to derail this crime bill but we 're fighting them and the american people will win this fight too still , the recovery we are building , the communities we 're trying to make safer , the individual citizens we 're trying to empower to compete and win in the global economy , all of these people are at risk unless and until we reform health care our system still costs too much and covers too few it is actually going in the wrong direction in the past five years , 5 million more americans have lost their health insurance , almost all of them working people and their children we 're fighting for health care reform not just for those who do n't have health insurance but for those who do have it and who could use it and lose it because they have to change jobs , because someone in their family gets sick , because they simply have to pay too much for it they deserve better , and we 're fighting to see that they get it we want to guarantee private , not government , insurance for every american the plan i originally proposed has been changed , and much of it for the better the proposals before congress are less bureaucratic they 're more flexible they provide more protection and support for small business they contain a reasonable phasein time over a period of years to make sure we get it right no bureaucrat will pick your doctor you can keep your own plan or pick a better one this approach controls government spending but relies on competitive forces in the free market to restrain the growth of private health insurance premiums much of it has changed for the better but one rocksolid principle remains private insurance guaranteed for everyone we know it will work for 20 years hawaii has required employers and employees to split the cost of insuring all employees people still pick their doctors there health care is getting better there the economy is doing well there , and almost everything in hawaii is

looking for a high rate of return on their savings , some people with stellar credit histories are using what has been known as the credit card of last resort the cards , called secured credit cards , were designed for people with a bad credit record \( or none at all \) who failed to qualify for a conventional card for a minimum deposit , generally 300 to 500 , a visa or mastercard is issued with a matching line of credit but a growing market for secured cards has heightened competition and created what can be attractive deals some card issuers are offering such high rates on the amount on deposit that they have lured savers instead of borrowers a good number of our card holders admit getting a key federal secured card primarily to earn the high interest on savings deposit , said robert m bouza , senior vice president of key federal savings bank in havre de grace , md , one of the largest issuers of secured cards even if they do n't need our secured card to rebuild or establish a good credit record , these people are using our program as a highinterest savings vehicle and getting a major credit card as a bonus ruth e susswein , executive director of the bankcard holders of america , a nonprofit group in salem , va , said that restoring credit was still the main use of secured cards , but using a secured card for savings is becoming more common card holders in the key federal program currently receive an annual yield of 406 percent on up to 1 , 000 on deposit and 457 percent on amounts of 1 , 000 to 5 , 000 interest is compounded and credited quarterly on the down side , the bank requires a 400 minimum deposit , charges a 35 annual fee and 189 percent interest on balances the associates national bank of dallas pays 51 percent on deposits above 250 and charges a 45 annual fee for its card the orchard bank , in portland , ore , pays 5 percent on deposits of 2 , 500 to 15 , 000 and charges no fee for comparison , the average money market account had an annual yield of 245 percent this week and the average oneyear certificate of deposit had an annual yield of 439 percent , according to bank rate monitor in north palm beach , fla the number of secured cards in circulation grew to 925 , 000 last year from just 145 , 000 in 1988 , and is expected to reach 12 million by the end of this year , largely because millions of americans damaged their credit records in the recent recession and want to rebuild a credit history no longer the province of shady finance and credit repair companies , the cards are issued by many major banks the number of issuers has grown to 400 from 35 in 1992 robert k heady , the publisher of bank rate monitor , said that the cards were a good deal for issuers , who take little risk because the line of credit is secured by the deposit card issuers also get income from application and late fees , and usually charge high interest on purchases , often 18 to 21 percent moreover , many secured cards have no grace period , meaning interest accrues from the date of purchase secured cards make sense for people who pay off their credit card debt every month or do n't use the credit line and just use it for savings , said robert b mckinley , the president of ram research , a credit card researcher and publisher in frederick , md they can pay better rates than bank accounts , even when taking an annual fee into account graph secured cards number of credit cards outstanding that are secured by a deposit at a financial institution , at yearend '88'94 \( source ram research \)
ponte vedra , fla , march 27 under all the spectator mounds , lakes , humps and hollows of the minefield that is the stadium course , greg norman buried the last skeleton today finally and with authority , he laid to rest the one remaining censure that had haunted him like marley s ghost the one that held he could not win with the lead with a singular performance in the final round of the players championship , norman turned the proceedings into the player championship he was alone in this one with his third straight round of 67 , he obliterated the tournament scoring record and the best field of the year , cruising to a mindboggling total of 24 under par and a fourstroke victory over fuzzy zoeller , who also shot 67 there are some records that will never be beaten , said an awed deane beman , the pga tour commissioner i think this 24under is one of them all over early norman broke nick price s record of 18 under par on saturday , after 52 holes of the tournament today , all he had to do was keep from selfdestructing , the way he had in the tour championship last year when he bogeyed four of the last seven holes to lose it did n't take long for norman , 39 , to dismiss any lingering questions about his resolve and his courage under pressure on a bright and breezy day at the tpc at sawgrass , he started with a birdie on the first hole to zoeller s bogey and followed that with another birdie to zoeller s par at the par5 second that gave norman a quick sevenstroke lead , and he never looked back in my 20 years out here , i do n't think i 've seen a player play as well for 72 holes , said zoeller , 42 , who finished second for the third time in his last three starts , a sort of golfing tripledouble he just did everything extremely well he drove the ball exceptionally , putted exceptionally there was n't any whimper in his swing , none at all unbelievable , a bogey no , the only whimper anyone heard wafting across this former swamp were those of disbelief from the others in the field norman put on the bravura performance of this and most other years on the pga tour he did n't bogey a hole in the tournament until the 13th hole today , breaking a streak of 92 straight bogeyless holes that stretched back to the 10th hole of the third round at the nestle invitational last week at bay hill there was only one bad swing on this day , with a 5iron at the 13th that eliminated whatever suspense was left , because the only intrigue at that point was whether or not norman could play a spotless , hoganesque four rounds of golf on an extremely penal course maybe it was because he let his mind wander just slightly after his birdie at the 12th hole , he was six strokes ahead with six to play he then pushed his 5iron shot to the right of the 13th , 50 feet wide of his target miscalculating the grain in the green , he chipped 10 feet past the dreaded leaf as he stood over the putt , a leaf blew across his line he saw it , but chose not to step away from the putt that really disappointed me , norman said of the bogey i really wanted to see if i could play 72 holes without a bogey the disappointment did n't last long when he stepped to the 17th tee at the island hole today , he could have pumped three balls into the lake and still won the tournament so , with one last dramatic flourish , he nailed a 9iron to the flagstick , two feet from the hole it s great , a good win , an important win , said norman , who collected 450 , 000 with the victory \( his 66th worldwide \) and moved to the top of the pga tour money list with 566 , 333 in just four starts this season i 've had a great week here when you go around a pete dye golf course 72 holes without a bogey i think i 've even impressed myself in league of his own he was n't alone he made an impression that is likely to last a long , long time on his fellow competitors , on the spectators and on the golf world this final round might not have been as impressive as his closing 64 to win the british open last year at royal st george s , but it was in the shadow of the flagstick zoeller , who played the last two days with norman , knew early in the day that he was playing for second after about the sixth hole , when i did n't gain any ground , i figured it was over , zoeller said he was putting really well you can tell when a player is going to lose it he was really solid there was not much chance he was going to fall apart there was no chance the collapsible greg norman does n't exist anymore the one who showed up to bury him is a more relaxed , more focused and , as he put it , smarter player i used the win at the british open to my benefit this week , he said i learned from that , it s part of sport you put those things in your head and use them photo greg norman watches his tee shot on the third hole during the final round of the players championship \( j d cuban allsport \)

san francisco , jan 15 on san francisco s first drive today , giants safety greg jackson noticed something that almost sent him into a rage with steve young and his receivers slicing away at the defense , picking it apart the way someone plucks cherries from a tree , jackson heard players in the huddle saying how good the 49ers were the way jackson explained it , it was as if the giants wanted to ask the 49ers for autographs he would n't name the players , only that they were young ones but he knew after that first drive , with some of the young players being so star struck by young and jerry rice and others , that it was going to be a long afternoon some of the guys were saying , 'man , these guys are good , ' jackson recalled i was so mad i could n't believe it i wanted to slap some of those guys i think a lot of the young guys were n't used to that kind of competition they were shellshocked , scared some of them probably thought we were beat right from the start as it turned out , they were that first 49er drive an eightplay , 80yard masterpiece set the tone for an embarrassing 443 loss in the national football conference divisional playoff game it was the worst defeat ever for the giants in the postseason , eclipsing a 370 loss to green bay in 1961 and it was the biggest margin ever in an nfc playoff game , excluding the super bowl the 49ers will play the winner of sunday s dallasgreen bay game for the nfc championship lt says farewell the game ruined the retirement party for lawrence taylor , who after the blowout announced he was leaving pro football after 13 years he might as well get someone to write his hall of fame speech now , since he is a lock for canton i 've put in my time , he said i ca n't play until i'm 100 this is a game taylor would probably like to forget hollywood would call this one the monster that ate new york in every phase of the game the giants were dominated in what has been a terrific season for their new coach , dan reeves , the giants had not before been so badly beaten and humiliated one giants player said the turning point of the game was the national anthem i'm disappointed , as the entire team is , reeves said it hurts it leaves a bad taste in your mouth i feel bad for myself and i feel bad for our football team with the 49ers boasting the most prolific offense in the league , they were going to score some points but it was as if the giants' defense was lost or dizzy before a record crowd of 67 , 143 at candlestick park , the 49ers scored the most points ever by a san francisco team in the playoffs young , who still lives in the shadow of joe montana , had a monster game , going 17 of 22 for 226 yards and no interceptions he is one step closer to winning a super bowl and chasing the ghost away spreading around the glory constantly chipping away , he hit seven different receivers , mostly for 10 or 15yard gains then , just when the giants would start trying to stop the short stuff , he would zip one long to john taylor , who had two catches for 74 yards whenever a receiver would make a catch , there would n't be a giant within 10 feet the giants' defense has never looked so disorganized not even in two games against the defending super bowl champion cowboys it was like a track meet , reeves said they looked like they were on some fast ponies and we were on some slow mules and that was before running back ricky watters got into the act he had 24 carries his career high for 118 yards and a playoffrecord five touchdowns i still ca n't believe we were able to run as well as we did , watters said neither can mike nolan , the giants' defensive coordinator , who after the game had the look of a man who had just seen bigfoot at halftime , with the 49ers leading , 233 , the giants tried to make adjustments like using the linebackers more to stop the crossing routes of rice and taylor but nothing worked no one had a rational explanation for what was happening , except jackson , who thinks too many giants defenders were in awe hampton a nonfactor but none of that explains the giant offense new york wanted to run the ball down the throats of an inexperienced 49er defensive line that was giving up 45 yards a carry , a league high but it was the 49ers who did the jamming rodney hampton had just 7 carries for 12 yards the 49ers had about a 10minute advantage in time of possession and the giants had just 194 total yards of offense to san francisco s 413 phil simms threw two interceptions and the giants did n't earn a first down until there were three minutes left in the first half \( they got one because of a penalty \) that defensive line is a lot better than people give them credit for , said center bart oates they are big and aggressive and they just beat us around the first 49er drive was illustrative of how the entire game went young , getting little pressure , was able to sit back in the pocket and pick the giants apart he began the game completing his first six passes , and on the first drive hit three different receivers quickly and efficiently , the 49ers were able to reach the giants' 1yard line in about four minutes , and from there watters punched it in downhill after interception about the only thing that went wrong on that drive was that the kicker , mike cofer , missed the extra point san francisco then stuffed the giants , and the 49ers' offense was at it again after a 31yard punt return by dexter carter , the 49ers started at the new york 48 they ended that possession with a 29yard field goal , but after simms was picked off by tim mcdonald on a deflected pass , the 49ers later scored again on another watters 1yard touchdown run at this point it was 160 let the blowout begin there s only so much a defense can do , said cornerback mark collins you give an offense like that the ball inside the 50 so much , they are going to score despite all that , at halftime we felt we still had a shot by the end of the third quarter , they were still scoring points it was like , 'when is it going to stop \?

moscow , jan 28 while most russians are not surprised to hear that criminal gangs seem to be taking over the country , a toplevel government report has laid out the gangs' reach in stark terms organized crime has russia by the throat , squeezing the life out of the fledgling private sector and holding the government itself hostage the report , prepared for president boris n yeltsin , says 70 to 80 percent of private enterprises and commercial banks in major cities are forced to pay a tribute of 10 to 20 percent of their turnover to organized crime the report estimated that such crime through payoffs , kickbacks , debt collection , money laundering or monopoly pricing accounts for about a quarter of the inflation rate , which last year averaged 20 percent a month this is the environment that confronts international lenders and investors considering crucial economic commitments to russia in its fitful steps toward a freemarket economy in cahoots in a fivepage summary , published this week in the newspaper izvestia , the report gave a glimpse of the collusion between criminal gangs and local law enforcement in the provincial city of tver , the report said , police officers tip off local gangs when a vehicle with valuable cargo passes by a checkpoint , and entrepreneurs have to get the gangs' permission to open a store or a restaurant outside kazan , racketeers have begun to extort payoffs from farmers in st petersburg , the report estimated , there is an army of 10 , 000 fulltime hoodlums , of which 500 are considered hardened criminals there is no doubt that the heads of russian organized crime are gathering detailed dossiers on all toplevel officials and politicians , said the report , which was prepared by the analytical center for social and economic policies describing the pervasiveness of organized crime , the report continued the situation in our country differs from the situation in western europe and the united states there , organized crime controls only 'criminal' activities like prostitution , drugs and gambling in our country , it controls all types of activity squeezing the banks this conclusion echoes other reports by russian officials about the spreading tentacles of freewheeling criminal organizations , some of which are said to have links with the west aleksandr gurov , who heads a research and development institute at the interior ministry , recently told a business conference that organized crime has infiltrated russian banks by blackmailing , threatening and , in at least a dozen cases , killing bankers to gain access to their books loosely regulated banks have been used to launder and embezzle money from state and commercial accounts , with losses running in the hundreds of millions of dollars , the interior ministry says local business executives say racketeers get information from bank accounts to select which companies to exploit and how much to demand in payoffs the report to mr yeltsin was based on dozens , even hundreds of interviews with entrepreneurs in major cities , said pyotr s filippov , an economist and former parliamentary deputy who heads the analytical center , which is part of the president s administration over the last six months , the situation has become much worse because it has met with no resistance , said mr filippov , who said president yeltsin s aides had not responded to the report , which was sent to them on jan 17 trying to fight back in the last two years , the government has made several attempts to fight crime and corruption , which have contributed greatly to public discontent but none of the various commissions have managed to curb the criminality and lawlessness that now pervade life and business in russia moreover , overtaxation , heavy regulations and haphazard enforcement have all reinforced the criminal atmosphere , the report said in the absence of a functioning court system , and confronted with the indifference and even hostility of a corrupt police force , even lawabiding entrepreneurs find themselves getting sucked into the criminal world as they look to private security agencies for their own protection and as a means of collecting debts an entire generation is growing up for whom this situation is normal and who in such circumstances will not turn to official authorities , but to unofficial ones , the report said these people are more likely to hire a murderer to punish a guilty or even an unpleasant partner than to go to court or arbitration mr filippov made a series of sweeping proposals , including an elite anticrime unit answerable only to the president , whose members would get exceptionally high salaries 250 to 300 a month and would be granted special police powers to undertake such measures as preventive arrests fear of rightist populism but his most emphatic recommendation was that the anticrime unit not hire anyone who had worked in either the old interior ministry or in the security ministry , both of which have been rendered ineffective by their complicity in illegal activities

washington , sept 29 fresh signs of persistent economic vigor emerged today as the government published upbeat reports on housing and employment , while raising for a second time its estimate of total output during the spring another official report showed steppedup inflation for imported goods , reflecting , in part , the decline of the dollar taken together , the various figures fanned fears that overly rapid growth could revive inflation , and could lead the federal reserve to raise shortterm interest rates again , perhaps after next week s monthly job report for september , to slow the economy down it looks like the economy s snapping back , said joshua n feinman , an economist at bankers trust he added that the fed s inaction on rates when it met to consider raising them two days ago could prove shortlived although none of today s reports was particularly compelling on its own , the combined force all in the same direction was enough to push interest rates higher and thereby depress the stock market the system , i think , is generating economic growth that is still well above the 2 1 2 percent that is supposed to be the trend over the long term , said richard aspinwall , chief economist at chase manhattan firsttime claims for unemployment benefits , which analysts had expected to rise a bit , fell 11 , 000 last week to 310 , 000 , the lowest level of the year , the labor department reported more importantly , this fit a pattern of unmistakable improvement in recent months the fourweek claims average eased to 322 , 000 for the period ended on saturday the buoyant labor market , analysts said , has helped blunt the impact that rising interest rates have had on housing conventional mortgages command about two percentage points more than they did at their lows last autumn today , the departemtns of commerce andhousing and urban development reported that sales of new singlefamily homes climbed 97 percent in august , paced by a huge , although statistically suspect , jump in the northeast this advance , the strongest since september 1993 , was also better than expected and included gains in all four major regions but the south sales were revised downward for july , but that revision was nearly offset by an upward adjustment for june the increase in the northeast was an eyepopping 821 percent , but this was from a much lower level than other regions , and analysts said it was undoubtedly a fluke nationally , sales were 703 , 000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate , with 102 , 000 in the northeast \( up from 56 , 000 \) , 117 , 000 in the midwest \( up from 113 , 000 \) , 217 , 000 in the west \( up from 194 , 000 \) and 267 , 000 in the south \( down from 278 , 000 \) the report on gross domestic product showed output of goods and services expanded at an annual rate of 41 percent in the second quarter a month ago the pace was thought to have been 38 percent the initial estimate , made in late july , was 37 percent the biggest factor in the latest update was higher business inventories , much of it farmers' holdings of cattle but while the second quarter is now seen to have been eighttenths of a point stronger than the januarymarch period , when the growth rate was 33 percent , analysts note that much of the strength consisted of goods produced but not yet sold this implies that there will be a significantly lower gain , perhaps only half as much , in the quarter that ends friday , as inventories are worked off the fixedweight price index for gross domestic purchases was revised back to the 32 percent inflation rate that was initially reported in july last month it had ticked up to 33 percent but evidence mounted today that inflation has picked up in recent months the labor department found that the price of imported goods other than oil surged sixtenths of 1 percent for the second straight month , double the average advance during the period of march through june this partly reflected the dollar s decline in world currency markets , which means that more american currency is needed to buy a quantity of foreign goods or services than previously the american business conference , a group of chief executives at middlesized companies , predicted today that the final three months of the year would be marked by continued growth , although at a slower pace and accompanied by early warning signs of inflation and a survey of 3 , 000 executives by the dun bradstreet corporation found that prospects for higher sales , profits and hiring during the fourth quarter decreased moderately with economic growth one notch slower by the end of the year today s housing report showed that builders' inventories of new homes would last 57 months at the august sales pace , down from 6 months at the end of july the median new home price for last month s sales was 134 , 000 , the departments found , up from 125 , 000 in july this , analysts cautioned , undoubtedly reflected a change in the mix of homes changing hands , as well as price appreciation today , the departments of commerce and housing and urban development reported that sales of new singlefamily homes climbed 97 percent in august , paced by a huge , although statistically suspect , jump in the northeast
east rutherford , nj , oct 6 it is what makes chris calloway good , what has given him the inspiration and drive to go from a plan b free agent to an upandcoming star it is what makes someone who stands 5 feet 9 inches and weighs about 185 pounds knock bigger men off their feet it flows through him , powering him , energizing him to the point where , despite not being that fast by pro football standards , he seems to always find some way to get behind the secondary it is confidence that drives chris calloway so do not be surprised by what he is about to say , a statement made this week after he was asked if he feels he is as good as any wide receiver in the national football league any wide receiver i feel like i'm one of the top receivers in the league , said the former michigan player i'm lacking some speed that the top guys have , but my skills are just as good as anyone s anyone \? even , say , jerry rice \? or andre rison \? anyone \? i watch those guys on television , calloway said i see what they can do all i'm saying is that my skills compare to their skills i can do what they do these may sound like the words of an arrogant man , or an insecure man , or a person who is craving attention calloway is none of those things although if he thinks he is as good as jerry rice he has apparently taken one hit too many yet it is that same confidence that has established calloway as perhaps not only the giants' top receiver but indeed one of the best in the league no , he is not in the jerry rice echelon that s a level that only a handful will ever reach but in terms of mortals , calloway is on a high level and there is no question that he is on the same level as most receivers in the league he is indeed one of the best and maybe one of the most underrated who , until this season , had ever heard of chris calloway \? he certainly became more wellknown after a controversial taunting penalty called against him last sunday in the giants' 2722 loss in new orleans with the giants trying to rally from a 2713 fourthquarter deficit , calloway made a clutch thirddown reception at the 4yard line with a saints defender wrapped around him calloway was flagged when he jumped up and slammed the ball down , negating the catch and ruining a scoring opportunity big plays should keep adding to calloway s notoriety in the league and his popularity among his teammates i 've been in the league five years now , he said i 've learned a lot and i 've been patient i think now that a lot of the hard work over the years is finally paying off i'm in a great system with a great young quarterback and a great coach i can prosper here as long as i stay healthy through nothing but hard work those two words are often overused but definitely apply to him calloway has transformed himself from a fringe wide receiver and special teams player when he was with the pittsburgh steelers to an integral part of the giants' offense if he was ever injured , it would hurt the giants immensely he was so good that he practically bumped mark jackson , the starter at his spot last year , off the roster the work shows up in his body he bulked up on the weights in the off season , and it was noticeable how much stronger calloway got that extra strength helps him run his patterns more precisely it also has turned him into probably the best blocking wide receiver the giants have and one of the best in the league there have been many runs where running backs rodney hampton or david meggett have popped outside for additional yardage because calloway bullrushed a defensive back and put him down chris is a tough guy , said coach dan reeves , whose giants \( 31 \) play host to the minnesota vikings \( 32 \) on monday night he s a complete receiver what distinguishes him is that he s not one dimensional his strength helps him get more of an explosion off the snap calloway almost always catches the ball with his hands , so there are never those times when a ball bounces off his chest calloway was a fourthround draft pick in 1990 and spent the first two years of his career with the steelers he played in all 16 games as a rookie but in only 12 games in his second season after injuring his right knee the steelers put him on plan b after that his numbers have risen each season since joining the giants , with last season being his best as a pro he caught 35 balls for 513 yards with 3 touchdowns for calloway , who has 11 catches for 169 yards this season , it seems it was just a matter of getting a shot at playing calloway and his fellow receiver mike sherrard complement each other well sherrard leads the team in receiving with 13 catches for 198 yards and 3 touchdowns sherrard , who is no stranger to hard work coming back from more than one careerthreatening injury , is probably the most talented of the group he gets most of the attention from defenses because he is big , strong and fast sherrard is the big playmaker , but calloway ends up in a lot of single coverage and there are few defensive backs who can cover him oneonone thus calloway has some big plays of his own in fact , his 51yard touchdown catch in the second quarter against philadelphia is the giants' longest pass play from scrimmage this season and indicative of how he plays without great speed , calloway still finds a way to get open and behind his defender many of his big catches come when he is three or four steps behind people i think people look at me and say , 'look at this guy he s small and he probably ca n't run , ' said calloway then i think i surprise them he has surprised everyone except maybe himself photo wide receiver chris calloway s reputation continues to grow with each catch that he makes for the giants \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

wildwood flower , wabash cannonball and keep on the sunny side are practically a definitive roll call of the classic country music repertory , and these original performances remain startingly fresh today carter was an enigmatic figure even to those closest to him , a driven , taciturn character who spent much of his time roaming the countryside , stopping at the houses of neighbors and strangers alike , asking for songs , which he would then edit , simplify and shape , arranging them musically with the help of his wife and sisterinlaw the southern mountains were a rich repository of song from many sources in searching this material out and shaping it as he did , carter preserved a heritage that might not have survived as well otherwise but he also altered that heritage , changing oddsounding , centuriesold modal english ballads into easily singable pieces or adding a driving rhythmic base to hymns , and his work represented the beginning of something new as much as it did the preservation of the old his preoccupation with this material coincided , in one of those fitting confluences out of which american culture seems to spin itself , with the first great concerted rush by commercial recording companies to record the folk music of the region the companies' interest in what was then called hillbilly , or oldtime , music , was largely a result of troubles the recording industry found itself in during the late 1920 s by that time , radio had become a national craze , and the record companies were trying anything to reach new markets out of this attempt came the first great wave of country blues field recording in the 1920 s and , only slightly later , trips into the white mountain areas the carters' popularity was virtually instantaneous , and it has never abated what set the carters apart from the seemingly endless stream of rural fiddlers , guitarists and singers the companies took chances on would have been hard to predict none of the carters was a virtuoso instrumentalist or singer , although maybelle s guitar strum , a way of playing the melody on the instrument s bass strings and alternating it with chords , was widely influential sara s voice , while pleasing , is rarely more than deadpan , and a p , when he sings , contributes a droning , tensesounding harmony part that hovers in the background with the persistence of a jew sharp the carters were plain , and it was that plainness , in a sense , that sold their recordings in huge quantities to an audience that was already nostalgic for a way of life whose days were numbered yet the carters were never raw or disorganized their plainness was a facet of the tremendous assurance and presence they brought to the recording studio while many of the mountain players who were harvested in the record companies' talentfinding trips sound a bit out of place in front of the microphone , like obscure relatives in home movies , standing awkwardly and squinting into the sun , the carters sound completely natural and assured , as if , somehow , they had always been there they never try to put a song over , as their greatest contemporary , jimmie rodgers , often did they seemed at no pains to please anyone , except , perhaps , themselves the first two disks in the series contain some of the carters' bestknown songs , like i'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes , keep on the sunny side , wildwood flower and little moses , along with more obscure items like the humorously repetitive chewing gum from the first of their recordings , the carters' formula was in place vocals in close harmony , with sara s clear , nasal voice in the lead , over a surging guitar background by maybelle , and a p s nervoussounding bass drifting in and out of range the formula was simple and durable , and the resultant recordings proved amazingly consistent the carters simply did not make bad records the original carter family broke up for good in 1943 , when sara moved to california , without a p , who moved back to virginia maybelle went on to found a country music dynasty with her daughters june \( who married the singer johnny cash \) , anita and helen , she became a fixture on the grand ole opry by the time she appeared on the nitty gritty dirt band s 1973 album , will the circle be unbroken \?

at first glimpse , it was a typical sunday of bustle , energy and rhythm along 125th street , harlem s main commercial thoroughfare a young couple returning from church stopped to listen to a gospel tape at one vendor s table an older german man and his daughter bought from another vendor a huge , blue sweatshirt with one bold yellow word harlem across the front and a young man , his hair in dreadlocks , patronized another vendor , buying a pair of jeans that , in line with current fashion , was of a size much wider than his own waist but the atmosphere carried an unmistakable tension , as yesterday was the last full day of business as usual for the street vendors who have proliferated along 125th street today , the guiliani administration is supposed to begin forcing all sidewalk vendors off 125th street and moving many of them to an openair marketplace along 125th street yesterday , some vendors said they planned to violently resist the administration s efforts to clear them other vendors said they expected nothing more than a peaceful relocation to the openair market , at two vacant lots at lenox avenue and 116th and 117th streets still others said they planned a candlelight vigil for early this morning in a silent protest no one was certain what to expect , but uneasiness was rampant the relocation of the street vendors was the dominant topic of discussion in many parts of harlem at the abyssinian baptist church , the rev calvin o butts 3d prayed for a peaceful day several store owners said they were hiring security guards to combat any reprisals from angry vendors at sylvia s restaurant , it was the talk of the afterchurch brunch crowd there is a lot of heavy tension here , said h kenneth woods , an owner of sylvia s , just a block and a half north of 125th street on lenox avenue a lot of people think there are bound to be reprisals against the police but there is just no way to know the extent of the reprisals it s a sensitive situation just one block to the west , at muhammad s mosque no 7 , a packed congregation of the nation of islam listened to a defiant morris powell , a vendor who is president of the universal black business people s association , an organization of about 450 street vendors on 125th street we will not take this lying down , mr powell said , not specifying precisely what his group planned to do we demand to have our place at the table and we do n't want just the crumbs mr powell s views reflected those of many other vendors , who complained that they are merely seeking to make a living in a time when jobs for the unskilled are difficult to find they said that the new site on lenox avenue is far from heavily traveled 125th street a few said they planned to set up their booths at the new site but many more said they would be back on 125th street today i'm planning to be right back here , said bruce tabbs , who has sold books and artwork on 125th street , just in front of the adam clayton powell state office building , for six years the police are gearing up to take action against us but we just ca n't be idle this is our livelihood this is how we feed our families the large number of vendors some city officials estimate their numbers at more than 1 , 000 on a stretch of about five blocks has been the source of increasing complaints from local businesses many merchants complain that the vendors create dirty , clogged streets with bootleg products that are sold at huge discounts they further complain that these vendors operate illegally and pay none of the taxes that their businesses place in the city s coffers the giuliani administration s relocation of the vendors has been applauded by a number of harlem s elected officials , including councilwoman c virginia fields and assemblyman keith wright it has also been hailed by business development associations , and a wide array of merchants and businesses i fully support the mayor on this effort , said lamont r bailey , an attorney who , with his father , has a practice on 125th street you ca n't walk along the sidewalk because the vendors crowd them , mr bailey said our clients can never fund a parking space because the vendors take them all up they leave the place filthy this move is a good thing many of the vendors recalled a similar crackdown two years ago during the administration of mayor david n dinkins at that time , dozens of vendors staged a turbulent demonstration that disrupted business and traffic on 125th street , and the administration called off its effort sgt john g mccluskey , a spokesman for the police department , said that there were no plans to shut down any vendors we will simply direct them to the other location he said there were no disturbances yesterday but declined to disclose how many police officers would be assigned to 125th street today however , one officer on duty on 125th street said yesterday the department would have more than 600 officers in the area some merchants said they were ambivalent about the relocation , saying that the vendors had helped create a tourism boom that helped their own establishments indeed , there is a complex relationship of interdependence among some merchants and the vendors at their doorsteps , with some merchants receiving small rent payments for the overnight storage of vendors' merchandise we get along fine , said kenneth kim , the manager of a sports clothing store , the sports crib there are a few problems here and there , but i 've always had a good relationship with the vendors but now no one knows what s going to happen we 're entering some kind of period that will be new to all of us photo the giuliani administration s plan to move the street vendors who line 125th street in harlem to a nearby marketplace beginning today is being met with resistance and unease shoppers browsed at a stall selling children s clothing yesterday on the last day of business as usual \( andrea mohin the new york

houston the skinny on hakeem olajuwon is that he was taller when he was akeem olajuwon he used to be a 7foot center , when he played for the university of houston and for many of his years here with the rockets he never looked seven feet in fact , when he played against the boston celtics in the 1986 finals , he appeared to be dwarfed by bill walton , who was listed as 6 feet 11 inches walton was 72 , at least , but did n't enjoy the stigma that went along with it asked that year why he looked so much taller than olajuwon when he was supposed to be one inch smaller , walton said , rather testily , the floor s warped about the time olajuwon corrected the world on the spelling of his first name , he also admitted he was closer to 610 it was a good thing , too , because how demoralizing would it be for all these young giants like shaquille o'neal to have olajuwon s skills as the standard for actual 7footers \? bad enough they have to play against him i swear , when you watch him night in , night out , you realize that he s really a postup guard , like when magic used to post up for the lakers , said the veteran earl cureton , olajuwon s backup since april 21 that s a novel thought that s also the dilemma awaiting patrick ewing and the knicks , as they face off against olajuwon s rockets tonight in game 1 of the national basketball association finals no question olajuwon is true creative genius , at this point of his career as powerful an offensive force as anyone of the modern game , a pogo stick in the lane with the feet of a dancer and the touch of a surgeon the greatest players are those who make it up as they go along or as jack ramsay , the former portland championship coach and current television analyst , said people talk about how to prepare for him , but i do n't think he knows what he s going to do until he sees what the defense is doing naturally , yesterday s technical subject du jour was how the knicks would attempt to defend against olajuwon single team \? double team \? whole team \? it s a secret , said derek harper not according to ewing , who shrugged off the mention of olajuwon s twice tearing apart pat riley s supposedly singlecoverage , regularseason defense i think we 're going to play headup straight , he said , as defiantly as riley would have we 're not going to change anything no one believed that , and even riley , on the other side of the floor , was admitting the knicks will see how things develop expect ewing to get help when olajuwon turns toward the lane , more from the weakside forward than from a guard , as all of houston s guards are 3point threats also expect anthony mason and perhaps charles oakley to take a turn grinding olajuwon , allowing ewing to lend his 7foot frame he s legitimate to the interior wall expect none of this to work as well as it did against rik smits olajuwon , like ewing , has become a better passer and as a far better athlete with incredibly smooth footwork , he can make passes in traffic like an oversized guard , if not like magic and when all else fails , there is always the left baseline , where olajuwon goes to shoot the fadeaway turnaround jumper like bernard king used to , with a bit more range the most compelling aspect of olajuwon is that , at 31 , he continues to improve kenny smith remembers the baseline being where defenses used to force and ultimately frustrate olajuwon then he went to work a couple of summers ago the shot that people try to force him into taking is now the shot he wants to take , said smith not enough attention is paid to athletes like olajuwon , who quietly work and improve their craft sneaker companies prefer as their pitchmen centers who can rap or forwards who cross dress olajuwon is simply the sport s most complete player , it s most valuable player and , in shaqspeak , the man , at least until ewing proves otherwise hakeem s incredible you cannot defend him because besides his great skills , he s such a smart player , bernard king said one night at courtside during the knicksindiana series it s like people always talked about my quick release , but the key to it was my knees being bent and the fact that i pivoted on my heels , which is not what they teach you , but what i found quicker hakeem creates his offense around what defenses do that s spontaneity at olajuwon s level , that s basketball genius that s not to say the knicks , the league s most physical and best defensive rotation team , wo n't figure something out in games 4 and 5 of the utah series , i noticed felton spencer was able to push him out a bit , ramsay said then when he put the ball on the floor , they went at him it seemed to knock him out of his rhythm knowing the way these coaches devour film , the knicks' have a glimmer of hope unfortunately for the knicks , ramsay could n't do better than that
international the mexican miracle , apparently , was not what it seemed ross perot , trying to head off the north american free trade agreement , warned that if the accord became reality , mexico would devalue the peso , letting lowprice goods flood northward he may have been partly right mexico , it seems , tried mightily to prop up the peso , but last week that effort failed failed big the peso , already weakening , plummeted when mexico let it go into freefall against the dollar some costs were quick banks and other investors lost a bundle and some will stick around an abrupt loss of confidence in the new president , ernesto zedillo , and a fear of new economic chaos in a nation seemingly getting its footing so how did the mexican miracle take such a nasty spill \?

russian economic reform is barely breathing president boris yeltsin last week named a cabinet stacked with officials who want to keep the economy firmly under government control gone is yegor gaidar , the primary architect of market reform gone , for now , is boris fyodorov , who , as finance minister , was the only russian standing in the way of hyperinflation mr yeltsin appointed only one reformer , anatoly chubais , but he is rumored to want out in a few months after he completes his ambitious privatization program running policy for mr yeltsin will be gorbachevera apparatchiks like prime minister viktor chernomyrdin , who proclaims an end to the period of market romanticism , and viktor gerashchenko , head of the central bank , who wants to pump trillions of excess rubles into an economy already running inflation rates above 20 percent a month no wonder mr chernomyrdin promises to control inflation by nonmonetaristic means translation government price controls none of the new officials have voiced a coherent economic strategy it is unlikely that any of them can but what they are sure to do is funnel huge subsidies into steel mills , military factories and stateowned farms that s great news for the politicallywired managers who line their pockets with the subsidies but it is a threatening economic prescription for nearly everyone else what sense does it make to keep steel factories churning out molten metal when russia already produces almost twice as much steel as the us for an economy only oneeighth as large \? more steel wo n't feed the hungry or house the homeless but if the yeltsin government proceeds to pay subsidies with new rubles , it will drive inflation to astronomical levels , wrecking markets and pummeling the poor and elderly who are forced to survive on the vanishing value of their fixed incomes mr chernomyrdin wants the west to believe that he is serious about reform , but will make it slow and gentle but he does n't give a clue to what serious , slow reform would mean serious means a reform that stabilizes prices the way to do that is to stop printing rubles slow presumably means the government will preserve existing factories with subsidies the only feasible way for the government to pay subsidies without printing money is to boost taxes the problem is that russia has no administrative mechanism or political will to raise taxes by huge amounts nor has mr yeltsin told voters that is what slow reform requires mr yeltsin might want to run away from economic reality the danger is that if he persists , the economy will implode and pave the way for rightwing fanatics like vladimir zhirinovsky to take over and destroy democracy the west can hope that mr yeltsin comes quickly to his senses it can prepare for the day when he does by being ready to jump in without delay to help

albany , nov 12 he lost the election and the job he has held for 12 years but gov mario m cuomo has retained his equilibrium , his sense of humor and his penchant for selfexamination , even when the mirror he holds up reflects rejection and regret so it seemed in a 90minute conversation , the first extensive interview since his defeat , in which mr cuomo expressed few second thoughts about running for a fourth term and said he fell victim to swirling cross currents of voter discontent and yet , for a man who spent so much of his tenure blaming his failings on uncontrollable forces , mr cuomo did not transfer responsibility for his loss it s very difficult to say what the people wanted , he said maybe the people just did n't like mario cuomo although he is anxious about where he will live and what he will do and how his friends and employees are handling defeat , he has already put the loss in perspective my brother s son dies at 5 years of age , frozen to death in the back yard , fallen through a canal , his parents find him with his eyes open , frozen to death , 5 years , he recalled how do you say , 'geez , i'm really down now , look at what they did to me \? ' what are you talking about \? you 've got the holocaust all sorts of unexplained evil in the world in a world like that , how dare you say , you know , 'oh man , i got cheated \? ' so i have no complaints i wish i had won and my stomach does a little flip when i think about it i wish i did have a complaint i 'd feel better if i could blame somebody , take a shot at someone he did it to me , that dirty rat but it s not like that looking fit and rested despite the grueling campaign , the 62yearold mr cuomo spoke on friday while seated in a pink armchair in the drawing room of the executive mansion , where he is already packing up books just over his left shoulder , hanging above a mantle , was a portrait of franklin delano roosevelt , another democratic inhabitant of the mansion and a cuomo idol when governorelect george e pataki moves in on jan 1 , he may replace the picture with that of his own political hero , theodore roosevelt , a republican who preceded his cousin in both albany and washington it is clearly a poignant moment in the mansion mr cuomo has spent most of his time there since conceding to mr pataki on tuesday night , surrounded by family and fielding calls of consolation from the likes of president clinton and john cardinal o'connor when his 32yearold daughter , maria cuomo cole , stopped in to say goodbye before driving home to westchester county , she leaned down to give her father an embrace that lingered and lingered her mother , matilda , was gone for the day , house hunting in queens and yet , the sentimentality has not diminished mr cuomo s capacity for gallows humor when a mansion employee walked in to offer coffee , he asked impishly , did you vote \? yes , sir , she responded you ca n't blame me when a rabbi , a longtime friend , called to tell mr cuomo that he would find his defeat liberating , mr cuomo said rabbi , thank you very much , but who wanted to be liberated \? mr cuomo s phone has been ringing with job offers , but he was not ready to discuss them he said that all the possibilities that have been reported were in the mix public speaking , radio and television talk shows , teaching , lawyering , or some combination of them all he refused to comment on speculation that he might want to be commissioner of major league baseball , but his friends think the job would be too limiting for him the objective , mr cuomo said , is to find things that allow me to make a living but still allow me to be free to share what it is that i 've learned over all these years he said the message he delivered in the campaign , that government can be a force for good , that negativism and divisiveness must be conquered , is even more important now that republicans will control congress and so many statehouses my belief is that we should not now reconsider the message , he said we should reconsider ways to deliver it and to prove its plausibility the governor and his wife of 40 years have also started looking for a new home he prefers his native queens , possibly douglaston , at least partly because of its low crime rate douglaston manor is on the water and there s a very narrow neck to get to it , which from a burglar s point of view makes it a very undesirable place , he said friends are encouraging him to look in manhattan as well , for convenience mr cuomo has spoken twice to mr pataki since tuesday , once to congratulate him and once to discuss transition plans and the state s fiscal condition he said the conversations have been civil but the governor was hardly amused by mr pataki s postelection swipes about his plans to clean house of mario cuomo s political cronies and his attacks by name on cuomo appointees i have nothing negative to say about him , mr cuomo said he s gracious , at least with me those comments do n't indicate a graciousness when he s making his political arguments but i 've heard none of that in his direct conversations with me
monterrey , mexico , april 24 mexicans call them malinchistas after la malinche , the aztec , who married the spanish conqueror hernan cortes and aided his triumph over mexico today , malinchistas are mexican shoppers who cross the border into texas seeking cheaper prices , better selection or cachet they are the quarry in an intensifying battle between retailers in texas , who are trying to keep their stores full of mexican shoppers , and merchants in mexico , who want them to shop at home the mexican side appears to have the edge , helped by none other than united states retailers like walmart and sears those chains are lavishing mexicans with more made in the usa products , sold in made in the usa settings lower trade barriers , brought about partly by the north american free trade agreement , and tougher customs enforcement against mexican shoppers who load up on goods in texas , are helping stores here recapture mexican customers one of the complicating consequences of the free trade pact has been to sharpen enmities , pitting mexican retailers against texan retailers , united states apparel makers against united states merchants and united states retailing chains against themselves mexico s stores learn to compete in the last couple of years , both mexican and united states retailers operating in mexico have regained customers here with better prices and a greater variety of goods monterrey s first walmart , with 44 cash registers , was so crowded when it opened in november that police had to keep people from pushing in mexican chains are cutting their profit margins , raising their advertising budgets and stocking their stores with united states brand names meanwhile , retail sales growth has slowed in many places on the texas side of the border , with some merchants reporting declines but recapturing mexican shoppers is not easy just ask victor ramirez puente , a salesman in the jeans department at the sears here , where he got the levi s 501 s hanging on his hips laredo , he bragged without hesitation , referring to the texas border town more than 120 miles away there , in trips made almost weekly , he and his friends save about 15 a pair , and more on other purchases mr ramirez s frankness carries little risk among the customers his jeans department still cannot lure away from laredo is the store s general manager , who brings whole wardrobes back although some mexicans may call each other malinchistas , few from monterrey hesitate to shop elsewhere for the best buys , just as few wall street traders hesitate to dump american stocks when foreign markets have greater appeal skirmishes about the loyalties of mexican shoppers flare as far north as dallas , where the wealthier mexicans fly or drive , and as far south as mexico city , where some american border stores advertise but the clash is loudest along the corridor between laredo and monterrey , an area of about three million people monterrey is the largest mexican city within an easy drive of the border in the laredo area , which has a population of about 140 , 000 , retail sales in 1992 had doubled from the levels of 1987 , the year after mexico signed a global tariff agreement then last year , sales barely budged , in part because of a weakening mexican economy and separate campaigns against smuggling by mexican customs officers and united states jeans makers laredo has responded by becoming more aggressive its merchants emphasize that they still have more efficient distribution and much lower taxes on electronics , clothing and other goods from beyond the north american free trade zone they bombard drivers from mexico with sales flyers in spanish the laredo walmart , open until midnight , is often the busiest in the nation the mall del norte in laredo , with 113 stores and restaurants , is still expanding , approaching the size of the largest malls in texas customers sometimes bring so much cash tens of thousands of dollars that the sears store has installed safes near several of the cash registers richard p perez , the manager of sears , said he would teach the executives of his company , which is based in chicago , how to compete for the mexican shopper we 're pioneers , he said , as he walked past racks of women s clothing and across what must be one of the few marble floors inside a sears store in the united states if we do n't write all our own rules , we 're not doing justice as retailers as mexico goes , so goes this store mr perez said he had pressed sears to make the merchandising more exciting only now have the people in chicago started paying attention to what we 're saying , he said these days , salespeople like maru martinez , who is from monterrey , have to do more persuading she helped shoppers like silvia gaspari , look at treadmills , but the couple wanted to do some comparative shopping back home in mexico city i remember there used to be a great difference in prices , ' mrs gaspari said now , no but electronics and some other things are still much cheaper here tough customs enforcement
if it persuades haiti s military leaders to leave on their own , then sunday s un security council resolution authorizing a usled invasion will have done some good the resolution contains no deadline , and the clinton administration has no plans for an imminent military strike perhaps only the threat of force will convince haiti s top soldiers they should depart they viscerally oppose the social and economic changes they believe president jeanbertrand aristide would make if he returns and they are reportedly profiting handsomely from the status quo but the threat to use force implies a willingness actually to use it if the military leaders hold fast , and an invasion of haiti under present circumstances would be a big mistake meanwhile , the administration s strained interpretation of the un charter to classify the haitian situation as a threat to regional peace and security damages the un s legitimacy and invites trouble the resolution , orchestrated by washington , envisions several countries taking part in any invasion , but the operation would remain under direct us military and political control presumably , the clinton administration will heed its constitutional duty and seek previous congressional approval , which it may not get but even a properly authorized invasion would add to the long string of dubious us military interventions in the caribbean basin during the past century , including a 19year occupation of haiti itself some of these actions had nobler ends than others but very few did any lasting good and each poisoned us relations with the rest of the hemisphere significantly , one of the two latin american members of the security council , brazil , abstained sunday , while the nonmembers mexico , uruguay , venezuela and cuba all spoke out against an invasion the other latin member , argentina , voted yes even though president aristide implicitly endorsed the resolution , an invasion could weaken his domestic legitimacy while diminishing haiti s sovereignty and despite plans to quickly hand off peacekeeping authority to a more broadly based un force , an invasion would saddle the us with political responsibility for controlling the violent vendettas that might erupt once the present repressive structure is disarmed to justify the use of un force , washington recklessly stretched the boundaries of what constitutes a threat to international peace and security under chapter seven of the un charter gen raoul cedras s violation of the pledges he made in the governors island agreements last year is legitimately an international issue so is the tide of refugees and systematic violation of human rights but none of these issues now rise to the threshold necessary to justify invasion on many of the same grounds , cuban emigres might well lobby the clinton administration to seek un authorization for invading cuba having taken its lumps trying to be a world police force , the un has now fallen into the unhealthy habit of licensing greatpower spheres of influence in recent weeks the security council has commissioned france to send troops to rwanda and endorsed russia s peacekeepers in georgia now the us is authorized to lead an invasion of haiti such crude power politics damages the un s standing as an organization valuing the sovereignty of all its member states licensing bigpower armies was justified in cases like the persian gulf war and the korean war where the necessary level of force could only be supplied by major military powers but it is surely not justified in haiti , with a 7 , 000man regular army and a comparable number of lightly armed paramilitary troops the clinton administration , under attack from critics on the left and right for alleged timidity in deploying us military power , now reveals a dangerously low threshold for using force in haiti
the weeklong hunt for two criminally insane killers that began after they escaped at gunpoint from a psychiatric hospital ended quietly in the dark hours of yesterday morning as one of them emerged from a wooded area in brooklyn , thirsty , incoherent and covered with ticks john casablanca turned himself in to a pair of new york city police officers who had pulled over their patrol car to write a traffic ticket three hours later , his partner , herbert arnold , was arrested wandering the area at daybreak , a loaded pistol in his belt and 1186 in his pocket the two men apparently contemplated their escape for months , authorities said , arranging for a gun to be smuggled in to them and grabbing a hospital aide as a hostage on the way out but once they arrived back in the city , they had nowhere to go with long criminal records and histories of mental instability , the two fugitives set off a largescale manhunt more than 100 new york state police troopers , city police officers and a bloodhound named copperfield began watching the homes of their friends and relatives , cutting the men off from any means of support and tightening a net around the area where they were eventually found in the end , the officers who arrested the two yesterday described resigned , pitiful men dirty , tired , hungry with no fight in them the two men escaped may 28 from the midhudson psychiatric center in new hampton , in orange county , about 55 miles northwest of new york city , and apparently forced their hostage to drive them near yankee stadium , where they left the car the police said they knew little about what the two did all week the men told the police that they hid out in a marshy area near the belt parkway in east new york and ate for the last time at a diner three days ago there is no evidence they committed any crimes since their escape mr arnold told police that they decided to split up early yesterday morning when mr casablanca , 51 , a former mafia enforcer from the bronx with three murders on his record , was becoming unstable because medication he was taking to treat a psychological condition was wearing off mr arnold , 50 , a convicted murderer and rapist from brooklyn , told police he advised mr casablanca to turn himself in and planned to try to continue to elude police by himself 'i want to give myself up' at 3 am , mr casablanca found police lieut thomas moran and his partner , officer gil zimet , writing a ticket at the corner of pennsylvania and seaview avenues , in a residential neighborhood in the east new york section lieutenant moran said that even before he knew who mr casablanca was , he knew the man had a problem the officer said he was disheveled and confused 'i want to give myself up , ' lieutenant moran quoted mr casablanca as having told him he was a little dirty and babbling the officers quickly realized who the man was he offered no resistance as officer zimet handcuffed him the officers took him to the 75th precinct , where they gave him a drink of water officers flooded the area and at 5 55 am , state police investigators spotted mr arnold walking on pennsylvania avenue near twin pines drive mr arnold , who was carrying the loaded smith and wesson 357 magnum in his belt , put up no fight james l harney , the state police major who headed the hunt , attributed the peaceful conclusion to around the clock surveillance which prevented the suspects from contacting sources in new york city previous planning richard bennett , the deputy director of the midhudson hospital , yesterday confirmed a report in the times herald record of middletown that the hospital learned in september that mr arnold , mr casablanca and two others were planning an escape mr bennett said talk by patients of escaping is not unusual at midhudson , and said that they stepped up searches of the four men after they were told of their plans one of the staff members had been informed by a patient these two gentlemen and two other gentlemen were planning an escape where they would obtain a gun and go out through the front door , mr bennett said in november , he said , a woman arriving to visit mr arnold was arrested when she was found to be carrying a knife that authorities believed she was planning to pass to him mr bennett said mr arnold was considered someone who would try to introduce a weapon into the facility the two men followed their plans , taking as a hostage robert kamrowski , a treatment aide at the hospital with mr arnold holding a gun to mr kamrowski s head , guards at the hospital none of whom carry guns followed procedures and opened the doors for the two patients and their hostage at about 5 30 pm last friday an old adversary when mr kamrowski reported that the men fled to new york city , the authorities predicted their movements , largely based on the knowledge of vito r spano , a new york city police lieutenant , who knows mr arnold the way a hunter knows his prey lieutenant spano tracked mr arnold in 1991 for several months when mr arnold and two others were wanted for abducting and raping a 16yearold girl the three surrendered after a sevenhour siege during which mr arnold threatened to blow up his block lieutenant spano was familiar enough with mr arnold to know he hated being called herbert , preferring tony or anthony he also knew that mr arnold s family in the sunset park section of brooklyn , was likely to protect him at home , mr arnold is not considered a threat , nor is he viewed poorly in his neighborhood he was a nice person , he would play with the kids , lillian rivera , a neighbor on 46th street said yesterday 'a time bomb' but lieutenant spano considered mr arnold a time bomb whom he presumed would return to his neighborhood lieutenant spano talked with mr arnold s relatives by telephone , but they denied they had seen mr arnold the police flooded brooklyn , receiving reports of possible sightings the presence of the police in mr arnold s neighborhood apparently pushed the two men east into east new york and canarsie on thursday , investigators searched the swampy areas along jamaica bay and major harney said he thought copperfield picked up a scent of the two men but the investigators returned to state police headquarters in the bronx , cold , tired and pulling ticks from their skin the two men were still at large as the police were regrouping thursday night , the partnership of mr arnold and mr casablanca was falling apart chilling pasts the two killers had chilling criminal records soon after being paroled for his first murder in 1981 , mr casablanca killed a bartender in manhattan after an argument and then , a few days later , killed a friend who criticized him for killing the bartender in both cases , mr casablanca was found not guilty by reason of insanity and mr arnold , who was arrested for auto theft when he was 17 , began his adult criminal record in 1965 when he was accused of raping a 13yearold girl and killing her and her mother , crimes for which he was found mentally incompetent to stand trial but yesterday , the two surrendered quietly now the police hope they can help them discover how the gun was smuggled into the hospital to them photos herbert arnold , one of two killers who escaped from a psychiatric hospital a week ago , was escorted to a squad car outside the new york state police station at fort schuyler in the bronx after their recapture he and his accomplice spent most of the time hiding in a woods in brooklyn \( robert kalfus for the new york times \) \( pg 22 \)

uniondale , li , jan 28 the islanders pledged to make a fresh start in the second half of the season , but so far they seem to be regressing instead of regrouping we said it was going to be a new year for us , and instead we go out and lose two games , said derek king we 've got a huge cloud over our heads , and we put it there tonight , before an increasingly indignant crowd at nassau coliseum , the islanders played with more paranoia than pride and collapsed in the face of a competent attack by the bruins the islanders were almost too busy fending off the bruins to take any shots , and the imbalance cost them a 30 shutout , their third loss of the season to boston if you wait for something to happen , it s going to happen against you , said coach al arbour , who accused his team of sulking its way through the second and third periods after its firstperiod efforts failed to pay off on the scoreboard no doubt only the bruins were circling saturday s instant rematch at boston garden with a sense of anticipation the islanders look as if they would rather stay home and watch from the safety of the sofa instead of taking their lumps on the ice hopefully our frustration will leave us tomorrow , said king , who did n't look convinced the loss extended the islanders' slide to five \( 041 \) and was proof that a team can work itself into a frenzy , as the islanders did in the opening period , and emerge with nothing to show for it without pierre turgeon , who will undergo surgery on his broken cheekbone saturday and is out for two weeks , the islanders ultimately posed a threat only to themselves the first period amounted to a cavalcade of squandered opportunities for the islanders , for whom there appears to be no such thing as a ca n'tmiss shot king went wide with a grandiose swing from the slot , ray ferraro failed to connect from the right post and patrick flatley could n't corral a bouncing puck to the left of an open net in flatley s case , the puck hopped harmlessly off the heel of his stick and went wide , and he went back to the bench shaking his head the tide may have turned against us right there when i had that opportunity , he said even though the islanders controlled play in the opening period , their brisk activity amounted to only three shots on goal , all easy pickings for jon casey meanwhile , the bruins made the most of their good fortune after vladimir malakhov sent a blind pass out around the boards from behind his net without an intended receiver , the puck fell into the wrong hands at the blue line , where don sweeney whacked a slap shot that was redirected from the slot by adam oates at 15 minutes 48 seconds once again the islanders found themselves in a familiar position in arrears after the first period then oates put the bruins up , 20 , with his second of the evening on a power play 3 53 into the second period ron hextall , the islanders' selfdescribed struggling goalie , made the pad save on cam neely s shot from the slot but kicked the rebound straight into the left circle for oates again allowed free circulation in the islander zone , the bruins went up , 30 , this time at even strength , again fueled by a rebound that found oates alone on the left side this time neely zoomed in alone to the right post and tapped oates s pass from the air into the net at 7 55 the islanders , who had 7 shots after 40 minutes , were booed off the ice after the second period , with hextall receiving most of the catcalls but arbour said none of the three goals were the fault of hextall , whose confidence is at a crisis point he had no chance at any of those goals whatsoever , said arbour slap shots paul stewart had to put in exactly 40 seconds of emergency duty as the referee before the weatherdelayed richard trottier could get into his stripes and take over photo bruins goalie jon casey stopping a shot by the islanders' patrick flatley during last night s game \( alan zale forthe new york times \)

work release , a program allowing some inmates a large measure of freedom before parole , is increasingly being used in new york state to relieve prison overcrowding , officials acknowledge as a result , prisoners who would not have been eligible five years ago are enrolled , including some who have repeatedly been denied parole as the state s correction commissioner makes room for newcomers in a prison system 29 percent over capacity , he says he is being forced to take too many chances with workrelease participants we 've expanded the workrelease program to greater numbers than i feel comfortable with , said the commissioner , thomas a coughlin 3d we used to err on the side of conservatism we now are forced to err on the side of liberalism many other states facing overcrowding have expanded not only workrelease programs but also electronic monitoring and other release provisions but none have used work release so extensively as new york , which sent 24 , 200 prisoners into the program last year , up from 8 , 000 in 1989 seven workrelease centers the program , conceived to help convicts readjust to society as they approach parole eligibility , allows participants to leave prison for one of seven workrelease centers , five of them in new york city , where they sleep , get counseling and undergo regular drug testing while they look for jobs or go to work as the program expands , there are worrisome signs last year 4 , 000 prisoners ran away , compared with 400 in 1989 most were returned to custody , but more than 1 , 000 are at large , department figures show between 4 and 5 percent are arrested for new crimes while in the program , compared with 2 or 3 percent in 1990 , said james b flateau , a spokesman for the state correctional services department he said that the department did not keep statistics on the kinds of crimes committed by those inmates but that there were all sorts , including homicides still looking for job in an incident last month , 19yearold ramon garcia , under the alias of louis medina , exchanged shots with a female police officer as he and two other suspects tried to rob people in a brooklyn beauty salon , the police say mr garcia was serving three to nine years in prison after a 1992 conviction for robbery , mr flateau said he had entered the workrelease program in december and was still looking for a job another new york inmate on work release , james revell , 23 , was charged this year with robbing a gasoline station in trenton and shooting a cabdriver at one of the gas pumps mr flateau said the inmate had been sentenced in 1990 to four to eight years in prison for robbery and had been on work release since january , working as a laborer the pressure to release inmates in new york and elsewhere has mounted as the cumulative impact of tougher sentences for drug offenders is felt , correction officials say new york , though it has added more than 30 , 000 new prison beds in the last 11 years , has not kept up with the need of the state s 65 , 000 inmates , an average of 6 , 300 are now on work release at any given time in recent years , as the state legislature split between senators who want to build more prisons and assembly members who favor solutions like sentencing reform and alternatives to incarceration , an answer has been to expand work release commissioner coughlin contends that the state s prison population is swollen with nonviolent drug offenders who are more in need of treatment than confinement he advocates increasing the capacity of drug treatment programs but also adding prison beds by transforming unused psychiatric centers into prisons both matters are at issue in the legislature s current budget negotiations letters and petitions none of this makes much difference to darren mcnamara s mother and three siblings three times the family successfully fought parole for the man convicted of bludgeoning the 22yearold aspiring actor to death with a baseball bat but the last time parole was denied , the killer , unknown to the family , was already living at home in queens most days and holding a job making eyeglasses while on work release since finding out last fall , the family has sent letters to public officials , circulated petitions and , most recently , filed a lawsuit seekking to send john bonizio , who was sentenced to 6 to 18 years in 1984 for firstdegree manslaughter , back to prison they argue that a program that allows a convict to live away from a prison in effect grants parole to inmates unfit for it it maddens me to no end that i have to fight the department here , said john mcnamara , the victim s brother and a lawyer , who says his family has spent tens of thousands of dollars on the effort it s so upside down i would think they would be our closest allies mr coughlin said mr bonizio has done well on work release , but the commissioner acknowledges that he probably would have been turned down for the program in the past because there are so many parole board denials mr bonizio was denied parole in 1989 , 1991 and last year because of the savagery of the attack on mr mcnamara and mr bonizio s extensive involvement in organized criminal activity , parole division records show disciplinary problems
buffalo , june 1 girding for a challenge from newly unified republicans , new york s democrats smoothly blessed a ticketful of incumbents for reelection at their state convention today , beginning with unanimous endorsements of gov mario m cuomo and senator daniel patrick moynihan but they could not mask undercurrents of apathy , anxiety and dissension or avoid contested primaries for senator and state attorney general in hectic lastminute vote trading , district attorney charles j hynes of brooklyn fell just short of the 25 percent support of convention delegates necessary to assure him a place on the primary ballot to challenge the incumbent , g oliver koppell , but he said he would circulate nominating petitions to get on the ballot instead karen s burstein , a former state senator from nassau county and more recently a family court judge in brooklyn , also pledged to wage a primary fight for attorney general the rev al sharpton , who could not win the 25 percent support necessary to challenge mr moynihan for the senate nomination in the face of the senator s ironclad opposition , withdrew from contention on the floor today but vowed to fight on by circulating petitions around the state such scenes did their part to dim what was planned as a carefully choreographed twoday show of unity to start mr cuomo s campaign for a fourth term but the governor himself , while endorsing mr moynihan , was cognizant enough of mr sharpton s support among black new yorkers and concerned enough that they might blame him for shutting mr sharpton out that he met with him before a rally of black ministers that mr sharpton organized at st john baptist church here tonight this in no way means the governor is supporting me for senate , unless he converts at this altar , mr sharpton said as he introduced mr cuomo in the church this in no way means that we have some kind of political marriage that s not what this is about this is about discussing the issues and appealing to people to participate in a process responding , mr cuomo said , i'm grateful to the reverend sharpton for the introduction it was benign i 'll take that he added as to reverend sharpton s making the point that i'm not going to endorse him , he s right about that but i'm grateful to him i welcome his entrance into the fray , and i think this is a good thing , his voice being raised is a very good thing indeed it was mr cuomo s main appearance of the day , and allowed him to foster a show of harmony when the convention itself could not mr cuomo did not attend the convention today and is to accept his nomination thursday mr hynes won 243 percent of the delegates' votes to mr koppell s 74 percent ms burstein , who realized that she could not get 25 percent of the votes , released her delegates in a speech seconding her own nomination , she recalled how she became one of only three female state senators in the 1970 s , and she chided the convention for not assuring a woman a place on its ticket this year it s 1994 , women are still too much in poverty and too little in power , and if you think i'm not telling you the truth , look at this convention , ms burstein said fifty percent of the convention delegates are female , but if things work out as we think they will , 100 percent of the designees will be men throughout the day , delegates talked repeatedly of last week s republican convention , orchestrated by senator alfonse m d'amato , which paired state senator george pataki for governor with elizabeth mccaughey , a senior fellow at the manhattan institute , for lieutenant governor , and chose bernadette castro , who worked in her family s sofa business , for the senate but the democrats seemed to be unsure whether to envy the republicans' ticket , or scorn it , or both former representative geraldine a ferraro nominated ms burstein , saying her presence on the ticket would make a statement about diversity that no sad attempt by republicans to reach out to women of their party can even approximate a script followed in other ways , the convention went precisely according to script representative charles e schumer , who had planned to run for governor himself if mr cuomo had not , instead nominated him in a ripsnorting speech victims of the long island railroad shootings gave testimonials that seemed intended to inoculate mr cuomo against republican attacks on his opposition to the death penalty they included carolyn mccarthy , a republican whose husband was killed and son shot and who said simply i will be voting for governor cuomo senator moynihan , too , was chosen as the party s designated candidate for a fourthterm by acclamation but not before mr sharpton turned what was to have been a 2minute speech seconding his own nomination for the senate into a 15minute broadside branding the senator as out of touch with average new yorkers and insensitive to the concerns of minorities lacking the 25 percent support of the delegates to win a guaranteed spot on the primary ballot , mr sharpton dropped out of contention today , and instead said he would circulate nominating petitions around the state

philadelphia , nov 5 a day before his cardinals team was to take the field against his former eagles team , buddy ryan sat in an overstuffed chair in a meeting room of an airport hotel today getting his feet washed by a local sportscaster who vilified ryan during his tenure in philadelphia it was n't an act of subservience that howard eskins was performing , but more like an act of charity eskins , who works at kyw channel 3 in philadelphia , was fulfilling the sports fantasy of a man who donated 800 to the eagles' fundraiser for leukemia and ryan , for agreeing to having his feet washed , was receiving a free pair of boots eskins also had to apologize for all the negative things that he had said about ryan in the past it must be a great feeling for this guy being on his knees and worshiping at my feet , said ryan buddy , i beg for forgiveness , eskins said i 'll accept your apology and i appreciate the fact that you 've finally become a buddy ryan backer , ryan said nevertheless , there are more people in philadelphia that would rather have ryan s head on a platter , than help him soak his feet in warm water ryan expects there to be some boos when he returns to veteran stadium on sunday as a head coach for the first time since he was fired by former eagles owner norman braman following the 1990 season but perhaps the crowd wo n't be that tough on ryan because the cardinals are 35 and the eagles are 62 and in second place in the nfc east division one of the most enduring images of ryan s final days in philadelphia was the coach yanking quarterback randall cunningham from a playoff game three days later , he was dismissed by braman some eagle fans have never forgiven ryan for taking out cunningham and for the fact that the team never made it out of the first round of the playoffs during his tenure i thought he was an idiot , eskins said today i did n't think he could coach and i said after he was fired that no one would hire him as a head coach if bill bidwill could have come up with his first choice buddy still would n't have a job and what does eskins think of ryan now \? i think he s the same head coach now that he was when norman braman fired him the radio talk shows were lively all week with talk of ryan s return and what he did or did n't mean to the eagles from all the calls that came in you would n't have known that the sixers' season opener was about to begin , eskins said ryan seemed disappointed that this morning s press conference here was n't very well attended a handful of reporters were on hand , along with four television cameras i thought surely we 'd draw a bigger crowd this morning for this in philadelphia , ryan said i thought all my friends in the media would be here , but i guess they do n't get up this early ryan and the six former eagles players that he has on the cardinals team have been rather lowkey about their return to veterans stadium a few weeks ago , eagles offensive linemen antoine davis and david alexander took shots at linebacker seth joyner and defensive tackle clyde simmons , saying the two were a divisive force on the team last year joyner and simmons joined the cardinals as free agents during the off season none of them were really man enough to step up to my face and say what they had to say , said joyner , who played for the eagles for eight seasons now that i'm here and they do n't have to confront me every day they 're all shooting off at the mouth cunningham , meanwhile , was mum for most of the week he said he respected ryan as a coach and that he wished the lines of communications between the two were better ryan said he had spoken to cunningham three times since he left the eagles but he said he does n't really spend a great deal of time on the telephone if i had a quarterback i would n't want jimmy johnson calling him every day , ryan said he s always in the zone vikings cornerback anthony parker is the first nfl player to return turnovers \( two interceptions and a fumble \) for touchdowns in three consecutive games but for parker , it s nothing new in 1991 , he played for the new yorknew jersey knights of the world league and returned two of his 11 interceptions for touchdowns and last year , in his first season with the vikings , he returned a fumble 58 yards for a touchdown two weeks ago , when he picked up a fumbled interception by defensive end james harris and carried it the 23 remaining yards to the end zone in a game against the packers , parker was at a loss as to how he does it i do n't know how to explain it , he said sometimes you 're just in the right place at the right time that s one of the keys to playing for vikings defensive coordinator tony dungy as soon as the vikings' defense gets a turnover , it turns into a sort of return unit with everyone except the man with the ball trying to lay down a block since dungy took over minnesota s defensive strategy in 1992 , the vikings have returned 15 turnovers for touchdowns , the most in the nfl since dungy first became a coach in the nfl in 1983 , the teams that he has been associated with have scored 43 touchdowns on turnovers adams does n't sound happy oilers owner bud adams , speaking to houston reporters at last week s nfl owners meeting , took some candid shots at his team s runandshoot offense , ridiculed offensive coordinator kevin gilbride and said quarterback cody carlson might be too fragile to effectively run the team adams also said if at any point this season it looks as if the team has given up and is n't trying , he 'll dismiss coach jack pardee and his staff and replace them adams , who has mandated that the team incorporate tight end pat carter into the offense , thinks the runandshoot has run it s course we do n't have warren moon and mike munchak and the guys who made that thing run right , adams said if you do n't have the horses you 'd better adjust to what you 've got we ca n't do the same thing we did in the past we do n't have the personnel to run it there s no secret to what we 're doing , he added you put four guys out there and try to find one open regarding coaching changes , adams said if they are playing hard you ca n't fault them , because they are doing the best they can but i will make changes if the players start to lose confidence and give up i'm going to blame the staff for that and i will think about doing something you ca n't sit around and let that continue everything is ok with ot giants general manager george young , a member of the nfl competition committee , said one area of concern about pushing the kickoff back to the 30yard line has been wiped away for now that area is overtime young said committee members had been concerned that the team that received the ball in overtime would have a better chance at moving down the field and winning the game because of good field position right from the outset of the eight overtime games so far only three have been won by the team that received the kickoff to start the overtime period , young said we were worried that moving the kickoff back would be a problem but it does n't look like it s going to be when everyone is an allstar oilers defensive end kenny davidson was asked what was the difference between steelers running backs barry foster , out with a sprained knee , and byron \( bam \) morris , his replacement , who will go against houston on sunday when you 're 17 , none , davidson said
if knitters , rollerbladers and orthodontists can all have their own slick specialinterest magazines , why not people with aids \? many reasons spring to mind starting with questions of taste but none have deterred sean strub , a 36yearold entrepreneur , from starting poz \( as in hiv positive \) , which is easily as plush as vanity fair and is against all odds the only new magazine of the year that leaves me looking forward to the next issue the very concept of looking forward to future issues may sound oxymoronic when applied to a periodical focused on a terminal illness and so does the notion of slickness is a glossy aids magazine whose contributors include writers , photographers and graphic artists from the new yorker , esquire , variety , the new york times and good morning , america another example of what the writer daniel harris calls aids kitsch \? in a tart essay in harper s magazine last month , mr harris lamented the rise of aids products from teddy bears sporting red ribbons to the bathetic hbo movie of and the band played on that sentimentalize the epidemic and turn its patients into beatific poster children yet mr strub , who was already hiv positive when the virus was first identified and who has fullblown aids today , has avoided that trap poz does not portray the sick as martyrs or victims but instead urgently advances the premise , exemplified by mr strub s own history and hardly limited to aids , that it is possible to be ill and have a vital life at the same time , even if the illness is terminal if i were a woman and had suffered from breast cancer five years ago , mr strub wrote in one of the three bimonthly issues he has published so far , today i would be considered a breast cancer survivor but even though i have survived hiv for 15 years , i am still considered terminally ill how much time must pass before i am considered a survivor instead of terminally ill \? to consign oneself to terminal status , he added , leaves little choice but to plan the funeral and wait to die mr strub , whose only outward sign of illness is his low weight , is not one to wait for anything since becoming hiv positive he has run a successful directmail business , cowritten books about corporate ethics and received 45 percent of the vote in a 1990 democratic congressional primary in rockland county , ny now he invests his energy , and the proceeds of an insurance policy he sold , in poz while some copies can be found on newsstands \( including in middle america , via the vast waldenbooks chain \) , most of the 100 , 000 circulation is given away to the target readership that audience includes not just those infected by aids but those affected by aids which means just about any american but most specifically the friends , caregivers and relatives of the ill , like mr strub s mother in iowa city and his sister , megan whiting , a young married new york suburbanite who left a corporate job to sell ads for poz the audience mix can be found in the editorial mix a cover interview with the articulate pedro zamora , the 22yearold , hivpositive hero of mtv s documentary series the real world , is followed by a politically savvy rating of america s 50 most influential aids policy makers \( donna shalala and elizabeth taylor are in , bill clinton and jocelyn elders out \) hardheaded medical news appears in the back pages different doctors offer second , third and fourth opinions of mr strub s own current lab report even the lab reports look suitable for framing , and poz has not escaped criticism for its cheery image mr strub scoffs at the notion that grave illness should be relegated to typoridden newsprint this is my last legacy , he says , so i publish a magazine that s the best i can do , as beautiful as i can make it he and his editor , richard perezferia , may succeed even more than they planned to be sure , poz is an informed advocate for people with aids at a time when the virus has faded from the front page and when the job of the federal aids czar , recently vacated by the ineffectual kristine gebbie , remains undefined by the president but what makes poz most compelling is that toughminded people like mr strub fight against death with knowledge , passion and wit on every glossy page until living ceases to be a terminal condition with aids or without it no magazine can tell a story less slick than that
seattle , dec 3 it was his first boys night out of the season he had received permission from his girlfriend , promised her he would not drink and drive , and guaranteed he would change their baby s diapers the next morning but four hours into the wet evening , he never answered her page mike frier of the seattle seahawks had a broken neck by then he had been in the back seat , his teammates chris warren and lamar smith had been up front , and the loud music inside the 1992 oldsmobile bravada had shut down on impact changing lanes thursday night on a damp side street , they careened into a utility pole head on , and frier s 25yearold , 300pound frame took the brunt of it he was pinned under an extraordinarily large stereo speaker and his initial reaction was to shout intermittently for help he could feel neither his arms nor his legs , and later his surgeons coldly predicted there is a 90 percent chance he will remain at least a paraplegic the doctor , he was negative , so blunt , said kelly butler , frier s girlfriend and the mother of his daughter , who has camped out in the waiting room at overlake hospital medical center in nearby bellevue i'm disgusted by the negativity the doctor does n't know he s not god i was massaging his feet i asked him if he could feel it , and he whispered it felt funny but he could feel it he was moving both his arms today he was moving them like he was doing weights , and i said , 'yeah , we 're going to get there' the crash is the latest and most serious car accident involving national football league players this year erik williams , a pro bowl tackle of the dallas cowboys , has not played since suffering several injuries , including a damaged knee , in a onecar accident near dallas on oct 24 a week later , emmitt smith , the cowboys' star running back , escaped injury in a twocar accident a year ago , houston oiler defensive tackle jeff alm committed suicide by shooting himself shortly after a onecar accident in which his best friend was killed alm was the driver of the car frier , stowed now in an intensive care unit , has faced misfortune before just none this severe his eligibility had been seized in college , his adopted mother had died of a heart attack earlier that year , and only three weeks ago , his girlfriend s younger brother had been murdered after each catastrophe , mike frier pulled a reversal , and today after friday s threehour operation to fuse his spinal cord he had a new item on his itinerary walking he s just a young guy , in his third year and it s all stripped away from him , said butler , who is allowed to see him only three times an hour i know he 'll walk i know he will but he 'll never do his dream , football he s unbelievable , though before the surgery , he was joking with the nurses , joking with me they wheeled him into the operating room and he was still joking he knows the situation himself , but you would n't have known something was wrong with him but he had his depressing moments , too i wo n't kid you he s looked real down he said , 'all my dreams are gone they 're gone' he was apologizing and apologizing i said , 'it s all right' here he is lying in bed , hurt , and he s apologizing to me i thought that was real sweet frier is from jacksonville , nc , and was the favorite of both of his mothers beatrice poindexter gave birth to him in 1969 , but was unprepared to raise him herself her neighbors and friends , ann and ulysses frier , were more suited for the chore , and they not only adopted him , they spoiled him well , he was their only child , butler said his dad , ulysses , always bragged about him at work off frier went to appalachian state , via a football scholarship , but his grades fluctuated from good to grave he had a bunch of d s during his freshman and sophomore years , said his coach , jerry moore he went to summer school after his junior year , and he made a c and needed a cplus or b to stay eligible i had to tell him he could n't play one day at practice just months before , ann frier had died from a heart attack , and ulysses and mike had particularly leaned on each other ulysses , in fact , was at practice that august day when moore repossessed mike s shoulder pads i remember his father standing 20 feet away from us behind a chainlink fence , moore said i could see all the heartbreak in his father s face , like , 'when is this snowball going to stop heading downhill on us' mike had no choice but to wait and audition for pro scouts after the season , and he widened their eyes with a blur of a 40yard dash for a 6foot5inch , 290pounder , anyway the seahawks plucked him in the seventh round of the 1992 draft and they planned to waive him , reclaim him and place him on their practice squad , until cincinnati spoiled the grand plan the bengals , who had been to the same workouts , claimed him instead and started him nine times over a twoandahalfyear period but frier grew sullen over a lack of playing time this season , and the rift resulted in his release last oct 13 the seahawks signed him on nov 2 , and the only one more ecstatic than frier was butler they had met during seattle s 1992 training camp
dennis r curley survived an american tourist s nightmare on a winter getaway to mexico , he was seized by the police , who accused him of taking marijuana into the country they stripsearched him , threatened him , demanded to know where the drugs were and pointed a rifle at his groin , then at his head , he said i thought , 'that s it heaven , here i come , ' he said during the interrogation his panic swelled , with visions of himself rotting in a dank cell after an hour or two , he was released abruptly , no evidence against him having been found only then did he learn that the original charge against him came not from the mexican police , but from the crew of the american airlines flight that had taken him to puerto vallarta mr curley , a resident of elmhurst , queens , who works for a furniturereconditioning company , sued american airlines but three years after his ordeal , as his suit has bounced from one court system to another , he feels he may be as unwelcome in court as he felt in mexico the federal judge who is now assigned to the case has thrown out the civilrights claim that was central to the suit , leaving mr curley with claims for negligence and false imprisonment the judge is now considering whether to lay ground rules for the case that would sharply curtail mr curley s chances of success nothing more than suspicion if we lose on this , it says any airline can have you arrested in another country based on nothing more than a suspicion , said martin j birn , mr curley s lawyer american airlines officials refused to comment on the case but court documents show that during the flight to puerto vallarta , flight attendants suspected that a passenger had been smoking marijuana in a lavatory they notified the captain , who alerted american s ground crew , who summoned the mexican authorities mr curley denies smoking or carrying the drug , and court papers and discrepancies in the accounts by the flight attendants appear to support his claim and in turning him over to the police , airline officials appear to have violated their own policy , which calls for far greater certainty before notifying law enforcement shortly after the episode , mr curley sued the airline in state supreme court in manhattan the airline , based in dallas , successfully petitioned to have the case moved to federal district court in manhattan a federal judge said the suit belonged in the court of international trade in manhattan , but a judge there sent it back to district court , where it was assigned to judge whitman knapp laws of which country \? both sides are awaiting a crucial ruling by judge knapp on which laws it should be tried under mr birn argues that new york state law should apply , and is asking for 2 million in damages one theory the judge is considering is that it should be tried under an international law governing airlines , which would limit any damage award to 75 , 000 , unless mr curley can show willful misconduct at a hearing last november , judge knapp said he had seen nothing that would permit me to submit a question either of gross negligence or willfulness to a jury , so that s out , he said the judge seemed most strongly inclined toward a third possibility , that the case would be tried under mexican law that law , mr birn said , favors the police and would do little to protect mr curley s rights at the november hearing , judge knapp said the most compelling interest in the case was not mr curley s , but the interest that mexico has in the free flow of information to its police smell of marijuana on christmas day 1990 , mr curley and his companion of 19 years , al wolff , boarded a plane at kennedy airport , headed for a week s respite from the new york winter they changed planes at dallasfort worth for the final leg of the trip according to reports written later by flight attendants , two of them smelled marijuana smoke on the way to puerto vallarta and saw a man leave a lavatory that appeared to be the source of the smell one attendant reported that he went into the lavatory and found ashes in the sink we then went to his seat and talked to him and his breath smelled of marijuana , another flight attendant , michelle koetemeyer , wrote in her report to the airline but more than a year later , when questioned under oath by mr birn , she and the other flight attendants admitted that they never talked to the suspected smoker , whoever it was the flight attendants described mr curley as an older man he was 40 mr curley said that he never left his seat during the flight , and that none of the flight crew ever spoke to him he said the flight attendants may have genuinely suspected that someone was smoking marijuana , but later pointed out the wrong man not in flight manual the american airlines flight manual says a flight attendant who suspects a passenger of smoking marijuana should ask the passenger to stop if the attendant feels certain the passenger has been using the drug , it says , the incident should be reported to the fbi or the federal drug enforcement administration , but only if the passenger admits or states that he is smoking marijuana as passengers filed off the plane in puerto vallarta , they were greeted by capt frederick a kammire , who was wearing a redandwhite santa claus hat while in the procession , mr curley said , a man who he later learned was an airline employee grabbed him by the elbow and led him away it all happened so fast , al did n't even know i was gone , he said in a recent interview he was taken to a small room , where several policemen rifled through his luggage and ordered him to strip , he said one man kept asking , 'where is the marijuana \? ' said mr curley , who speaks no spanish i said , 'there is no marijuana' it went on and on like that after a while , one policeman pointed a rifle at my crotch , and the question was repeated , 'where is the marijuana \? ' mr curley said i closed my eyes , and when i opened them , the rifle was pointed at my head cleared by a doctor at one point during the interrogation , he said , he heard mr wolff s voice through the door i banged on the door and shouted , 'call the american embassy , ' he said i could n't hear a response after more than an hour , a doctor was brought in , and he smelled mr curley s breath and tested his reflexes the doctor concluded that he had not been smoking marijuana , and a short time later he was released after i was let out , the police people told us that the captain said i was smoking marijuana , he said more than three years later , mr curley said , the incident has left him brittle , subject to sudden bouts of fear , rage and anxiety he said he could not even bring himself to develop the film from his trip to mexico i keep thinking i should be over this by now , he said but it feels like it happened 15 minutes ago photo dennis r curley of elmhurst , queens , who was detained by the mexican police after being accused of using marijuana on an american airlines flight in 1990 his lawsuit against the airline is now in federal court \( nancy siesel the new york times \)
when , a few years ago , the producer andrea andermann announced his intention to televise puccini s opera tosca live from the actual sites in rome and at the actual times of day specified in the libretto , the notion had gimmick written all over it but surprise against all theatrical logic \( if there is such a thing \) , the performance , two summers ago , turned out to be very good on almost every level indeed , the project seemed an unqualified success , at least in the first two acts , and those of us in europe who staggered out of bed at 6 am for the third act were too busy reveling in our virtuous fortitude to quibble now , with the performance released on video \( teldec 450990212 vhs cassette and laser disk \) , we can check the accuracy of our recollections the video presentation faithfully matches the live telecast , the liner notes report , except that two gaffes a nasty fall by placido domingo in the first act and a momentary sighting of a camera in the second have been papered over with footage from one of the two dress rehearsals that s too bad , since the cleanup robs the performance of spontaneity , continuity and documentary verisimilitude yet in retrospect , the experience holds up remarkably well remarkably not only because of the feat s technical difficulty but also because the idea is , in theory , a dumb one , fraught with bad omens mr domingo has already made noises about doing bizet s carmen and mozart s nozze di figaro on location in seville how about tchaikovsky s yegeny onegin in st petersburg \?

amelia island , fla april 10 the crowd was not in her corner her father was in a hospital back home in spain after suffering a heart attack on tuesday her opponent was desperate to end a twoyear slump without a title but none of these troubling predicaments were sufficient to dissuade topseeded arantxa sanchez vicario from ending her own 11month drought without a title by putting up a vehement and successful defense of her 1993 bausch lomb championships she saved her most torrid tennis for the most torrid afternoon of a cloudless week on this semitropical island , saved her most energetic topspin and defiant drop shots till last sanchez vicario did everything but chase fourthseeded gabriela sabatini from the court today in crafting a 61 , 64 victory , her first title since her victory in may 1993 at the starcrossed event in hamburg , germany , where monica seles was stabbed and sidelined from the sport she 'd ruled supreme since then steffi graf has replaced seles at the top , with sanchez vicario , renowned for her durability and consistency , behind her in the ranking it was great to get to a final and finally win , said sanchez vicario , who had twice been runnerup to graf this year but had lost in the quarterfinals of her previous two tournaments but physically and mentally i was very strong this week i was always the one who controlled the match during the whole tournament takes quick lead she certainly controlled this one , just as she had in saturday s straightset semifinal against another crowd favorite , martina navratilova in that match , she shrugged off a 113 career record against navratilova in this final , she defeated sabatini for the sixth time in their last seven meetings today , sanchez vicario steamed to a 40 lead in the opening set temporarily set on her heels at the start of the second set , she remedied a 31 deficit with a threegame winning spree during which she committed just a single unforced error she really had a strategy there , said sabatini , whose curious absence from the winner s circle has now stretched to 33 events she played very deep , high balls , she said all the balls were landing close to the baseline and it was hard to do anything with them you need to be patient against her , and today i did n't have everything together there s no way you can win against her if physically you are not 100 percent , said sabatini , who nonetheless considered this week s trip to the final a positive step sanchez vicario plowed through the draw this week despite knowing her father , emilio , was ailing on tuesday he had a heart attack , but when he heard she intended to withdraw from the tournament and fly to his bedside , he insisted that she remain here to defend her title he told me to stay here and win , said sanchez vicario , accompanied here , as everywhere , by her mother and best friend , marisa i thought it would be better to be with him , but he told me not to come there so i stayed here and won this for him i thought i handled it really well she was assured that her father was out of danger and required no surgery added to motivation sanchez vicario insisted she did n't mind performing in the heat of a stadium , where the majority of sunburned spectators made no secret that their sentiments were with the retirementbound navratilova on saturday and with another threetime bausch lomb champion , sabatini , today maybe it motivated me even more , she said before heading back to work beneath the sizzling sun she and her partner , larisa neiland , defeated amanda coetzer and ines gorrechategui , 62 , 67 \( 68 \) , 64 , in the doubles final sanchez vicario called the key to her unflagging fitness a secret , but she did admit to boning up for this sport by practicing another one i play a lot of soccer , she said photo arantxa sanchez vicario returns a shot to gabriela sabatini during her victory yesterday \( associated press \)

huntsville , tex , jan 5 the death row garment factory is humming at midday condemned murderers wield scissors and razorsharp knives as they snip and finish piles of work pants at their sewing machines a few chat at the coffee urn within relaxed sight of their cagedoff guard life goes on and new work pants move as fast as time through the skilled hands of the legally doomed 58man work shift in the setting of rifle towers and razorwire fences , the simple quonset hut factory here at the ellis one unit of the huntsville prison has a strangely upbeat air , as of some brechtian production of the pajama game the booming workplace , with 115 workers and places for 85 more being planned , is the only such prison enterprise in the nation , designed for and operated exclusively by a death row community it mundanely ticks along in an almost poetic display of the assemblyline routine that is settling about capital punishment here and in other of the 36 states that allow it 'by god , i showed them' the factory is being studied lately by visitors as a better way to kill time on the nation s death rows , which have become increasingly busy since the supreme court allowed reinstitution of capital punishment in 1976 here human beings judged incorrigibly beyond the normal entitlement to freedom and life busy themselves at making some final goods for society as the bobbins whirl and the assembly line works through life case by case , convicts seize the work as a final chance to confound society s judgment of their lives' utter worthlessness a lot of people who have worked on the death row factory are dead anyway , so it s mostly to prove something to yourself , said james beathard , a 36yearold inmate who has been manning his sewing machine during legal procedures across the full seven years of the garment factory s existence we do it to say , 'by god , i showed them i'm not really the threat they think i am , ' he said of the satisfaction the factory gives in allowing a man to end life as a simple reliable worker it s weird , said mr beathard , testifying to the factory s mesmerizing quality of normalcy , but when you hit friday s shift , and arrive at the end of the week , why , everybody s looking forward to the weekend ! as if they were back in the free world but the garment workers are nowhere near free all arrive on death row by way of murder convictions there comes a moment of silence at the sewing machines the morning after an execution but then work clatters back to life , with the death row workers the most productive in the prison s statewide system of assorted manufacturing ventures , say state officials , who add that violent infractions and malingering are rare some guys turn down the factory job , saying , 'why should i be making clothes for the people who are going to kill me \? ' said todd willingham , a 25yearold condemned man who put aside such metaphysics and opted for piecework on the garment line they 're taking us hard and fast now with new laws to speed up the killing , and my mind wanders less at the sewing machine no pay but privileges the factory whose work force is voluntary and screened is less tense for prison guards , too it s been heading uphill from day 1 , the factory manager , charles duff , a corrections worker , said , summarizing the high mood and output we produce topoftheline goods of the 373 men on death row here , where the turnover rate is gradually increasing as more arrive and more are dispatched , the factory has a double shift that can accommodate up to 120 workers fourteen inmates are scheduled for execution this month , including several whose jobs in the factory have already been snapped up by men on a long waiting list the inmates make dozens of items sheets , diapers , tote bags , reflective belts for crossing guards , and uniforms for prison guards all sporting a tci label for texas correctional industries and sold to other state agencies and though the inmates get none of the profits , they are accorded highly valued privileges , including larger cells , daylong freedom to visit with nearby friends on death row after work , and , most important , freedom from being manacled in the sight of their families in grim restriction cages on visiting days in contrast , the rest of the death row is confined in lockdown in their cells all but three hours a day it s kind of a paradox , said lester bower , a 46yearold condemned prisoner and the factory bookkeeper , explaining how some of society s most dreaded people find special camaraderie in the death row factory if a condemned man shows he can exist quite well without posing a danger to his peers , what s the real reason for executing him \? he asked , regretting , like many of the workers , that the law pronouncing them beyond all rehabilitation does not provide for mitigating circumstances after sentencing camaraderie on the line mr bower s friend and fellow factory worker , james vanderbilt , a former police officer convicted of murder in the course of a kidnapping , is the state s longest surviving death row inmate , 18 years and counting in an involved legal process he is respected for legal expertise and endurance by newer inmates who , sentenced under recent laws toughened to speed appeals time , call themselves driveups since they anticipate faster service and less life

dubrovnik , croatia , july 12 in the heyday of the former yugoslavia , the dubrovnik festival was a glamorous affair although croatian and other yugoslav artists were featured , this was the country s , and really the communist bloc s , premiere forum for international performing artists and ensembles the great singers and instrumentalists and conductors performed here famous orchestras , opera companies and dance groups played on the city s many indoor and outdoor stages venturesome theatrical productions from yugoslavia and beyond were staged every summer today this extraordinary city , built between the 11th and 17th centuries but in essence a marvelously preserved 13thcentury merchant fortress , still stands as does the striking adriatic coast , with its cliffs and turquoise waters , its comforting harbors and sheltering islands and as it does every year at this time , bougainvillea spills out from every corner , painting the brilliant landscape with violet intensity but it s all eerily empty , like venice in july without in crowds the festival itself has shrunk to a wraith honorable , plucky but financially and artistically impoverished and the tourists 60 , 000 a day visited the old city as recently as 1990 have dwindled to nearly none the official line is positive i have no reason not to be optimistic for the future , said tomo vlahutin , general manager of the festival but it s hard to see how improvement can come any time soon multiple austerities the problem that this festival , and the croatian culture that government officials wish it to epitomize , shares with other eastern european countries is financial vesna girardijurkic , the minister of education , culture and sport since 1991 , said that all the ministers of what she called the countries in transition complained about the same budgetary problems national productivity and hence overall budgets have shrunk , a situation worsened by inflation if a country tries to conform to the strictures of the international monetary fund and the world bank , as croatia does , further austerities are demanded but in croatia there is also the balkan war , and without lasting peace the tourists are likely to stay away between october 1991 and august 1992 dubrovnik was under serbian siege , shocking the world with images of its ancient monuments destroyed by bombardments from the hills above and the sea beyond all told , said romana vlahutin , a festival spokeswoman , 15 percent of the buildings in the old city were destroyed or burned out and 90 percent were hit among the buildings burned was the festival s own headquarters , a 17thcentury palace full of artworks and the festival archive the costume and set warehouse took a direct hit the 1992 festival was postponed and shortened the 1993 installment took place on schedule , but audiences were still apprehensive in addition , considerable resources had to be expended just to rebuild and replace lost bleachers , light towers and equipment , which had been sacrificed to board up towers and monuments or to help build croatian army trenches and bivouacs for this summer , the zagreb government decided to make a major push to reestablish the dubrovnik festival this was partly a matter of national pride but it was also a question of reviving the flagging southern croatian tourist industry mr vlahutin said that 75 percent of the dubrovnik region s population of 70 , 000 once worked in tourism with the city s more than 50 hotels and many elegant cafes and restaurants empty , those people need employment matching subsidies hence the decision by nino bulic , the minister of tourism and himself a dubrovnik native , to match the ministry of culture s contribution to support the festival government officials from president franjo tudjman down were on hand for sunday evening s opening ceremony , a patriotictouristic pageant in which the medieval municipal rector hands over the city keys to the artists the trouble is , even with this relatively big boost in subsidy , the entire festival budget amounts to only 300 , 000 in 1990 , the figure was 2 million the 1990 opening ceremony alone cost 210 , 000 five years ago , the festival presented 120 performances now , the figure is below 40 with such a minuscule amount of money , it is hardly surprising that festival artists are almost entirely croatian westerners are limited to a couple of lesser names , although at the last minute a group of actors from the royal swedish theater agreed to a single performance there are a few orchestral concerts , including an honorable brahms german requiem from milan horvat and the zagreb philharmonic in the murky acoustics of the franciscan church on monday night but there is no opera and no ballet mr vlahutin and mrs girardijurkic , in separate interviews , tried to make this concentration on things croatian seem a virtue the festival used to be yugoslavia s window to the world , but now it s reverted to what it was always intended to be , mr vlahutin said we have a very rich heritage there was cultural life here 600 years ago when plenty of big european cities were just fields with cows it s easy to represent croatian culture to the world because we are representing ourselves deterrents to art
london it did n't take sophisticated gadgetry to beat the security system at norway s national gallery in oslo two men pulled up outside in a van just before 6 30 on the morning of feb 12 , propped a ladder against a wall , smashed a window , climbed in and emerged 50 seconds later with the nation s bestknown painting , the scream , by edvard munch done in 1893 , munch s image of an almost fetuslike figure , its head clasped in its hands and its mouth open in a cry of horror , has become increasingly familiar in popular culture around the world , a symbol of the overwhelming pressures of modern life but it has near icon status in munch s native norway , and its theft , captured on blurry videotape by a surveillance camera , jolted the country even as it basked in the glow from the opening of the winter olympics that same day in lillehammer , 110 miles to the north the case of the scream alternately enraged and captivated norway for three months , until the painting was finally recovered on may 7 only since then have details about the elaborate sting operation mounted by police begun to dribble out , filling in some of the holes in a story that encompassed strange twists and false leads among the cast of characters an abortion protester and undercover agents from scotland yard a small crime thriller is what the national gallery s chairman , jens kristian thune , called the case during a news conference after the painting s recovery yet even with the painting back in the national gallery undamaged except for a pinsize hole and under considerably tighter security the thriller still has n't reached its conclusion two men who had tried to solicit a 414 , 000 ransom were finally arrested in a hotel room in aasgaardstrand , the seaside town 50 miles south of oslo where munch spent his summers but the suspects , bjorn grypdal , 27 years old , and jan olsen , 47 , were charged only with handling stolen goods , not with theft although both have criminal records , it is not yet known whether they are also the men who stole the scream , said leif lier , the assistant police chief in oslo who is overseeing the case the police have said little about how they found the scream , and mr lier declined to provide any details while the investigation is continuing munch was born in 1863 and did most of his bestknown work around the turn of the century no longer shall i paint interiors , and people reading , and women knitting , he wrote in his journal in 1889 i shall paint living people who breathe and feel and suffer and love his paintings of that period , in a series called the frieze of life , centered on inner torment , none more so than the scream with its central figures set off from the other two people in the picture , alone against a background of lurid reds and yellows , it seemed to express an almost unimaginable anguish and loneliness munch wrote about his inspiration for the scream several years after he painted it i stopped and leaned against the balustrade , almost dead with fatigue above the blueblack fjord hung the clouds , red as blood and tongues of fire my friends had left me , and alone , trembling with anguish , i became aware of the vast , infinite cry of nature munch s work has long been admired both in and outside norway but the scream has moved into popular culture , showing up on tshirts and as an inflatable doll , appearing on magazine covers without a caption the international sign for angst it s on dorm walls across the united states what student facing finals does n't know the feeling \? 'the scream' seems to say something essential about modern man s experience , said ingvild pharo , a curator at the national gallery but it s not a likable picture nobody wants to have it at home somebody wanted the original enough to take it , though at the time of the theft , the painting was hanging on the ground floor as part of an exhibition of norwegian art mounted for the olympics when the thieves climbed in through the window , they needed only a pair of wire cutters to pop it off the wall \( according to reports in the norwegian press , the thieves left behind a note saying thanks for the poor security \) police started with only a few leads , including sightings of a gray vehicle , perhaps a mercedes van , speeding away from the gallery the case became more muddled a few days later when abortion protesters got into the act borre knudsen , a former lutheran minister who is a leader of the norwegian antiabortion movement , had been seeking publicity for his views by organizing protests during the olympics the day before the painting was stolen , 12 abortion protesters from the united states who had been invited to norway by mr borre were denied entry to the country on the grounds that they might commit criminal acts in a radio interview on feb 17 , mr knudsen suggested a tradeoff if 'the silent scream' is aired by the national television company , he promised , the painting will reappear the police said they had little reason to take mr knudsen s statement seriously , and the film the title refers to the silent scream of the fetus was never shown similarly , in early march , police showed little public interest when a lawyer working for the antiabortion movement said he had a client who could arrange the painting s return in exchange for 1 million behind the scenes , the police were apparently hard at work on another front needing assistance in his investigation , mr lier called scotland yard , which has a squad specializing in the theft of art and antiques the sequence of events from that point on is murky , and scotland yard will not discuss the case , but according to news reports in norway , the two police forces , working with officials from the national gallery , mounted an operation to trap at least two men who were seeking the ransom mr thune , the gallery s chairman , said at a news conference that he had been involved in the recovery effort , in part by enlisting the help of einar tore ulving , a wellknown art dealer he used mr ulving as a gobetween to those seeking the ransom , he said , but without revealing to him that the police were planning a trap in late april and early may , norwegian police found pieces of the painting s frame at a bus stop and various other places in nittedal , a suburb of oslo , but the police say that no link has been established between the pieces of frame and the men arrested meanwhile , according to reports in the norwegian press , two british police officers , posing as officials from the getty museum in california , put out the word that they were willing to pay to have the scream returned to the national gallery on saturday , may 7 , they were able to view the painting in room 525 of the hotel aasgaardstrand and agreed to pay a ransom they were then directed to the grand hotel in oslo , where the money was to be paid it was there that the two suspects were arrested mr ulving , the unwitting gobetween , was also briefly arrested in what police later said was a mixup whether the police investigation yields further charges against the two suspects or anyone else , museum officials , clearly embarrassed by the lax security that made the theft so easy , seemed happy just to have the scream back photos back at the national gallery in oslo a pinsize hole the only damage \( associated press \)
westchester republicans , meeting in convention , failed to agree on a candidate for the 19th congressional district last week , leaving the choice to a republican primary in september the seat is being vacated by its 13term republican incumbent , hamilton fish , for health reasons a week earlier , mr fish s son , hamilton fish jr , won a surprise victory at a democratic convention , but the ultimate winner is also likely to be determined in a fall democratic primary unlike the democrats , who restricted their convention vote to those towns and cities actually in the 19th congressional district , which includes northern westchester , putnam county and parts of orange and dutchess counties , the republican leadership , under the party chairman , anthony j colavita , sought to have the entire convention select their 19th congressional district candidate that would have favored the candidacy of guy parisi , a lawyer who has long been active in republican ranks , because the yonkers delegation , which traditionally dominates party conventions , favored mr parisi , who was mr colavita s choice this is the way we have always done it , mr colavita explained before gaveling the convention to order as he began to feel pressure from delegations representing other candidates to restrict the voting to localities within the congressional district bowing finally to pressure from upcounty republicans , mr colavita decided to restrict the vote to those communities in mr fish s district mr parisi then decided that he did not want to compete under those restrictions and said he would seek his party s nomination in the primary two of the five remaining candidates followed mr parisi s lead and also withdrew their names from the convention balloting they were john flanagan jr , a former pilot in the vietnam war and brigadier general in the air force reserve , and susan kelly , a katonah resident that left three candidates willing to test their support in the westchester part of the district they were paul w bucha , a somers resident , assemblyman paul warren of fishkill and former representative joseph j dioguardi of new rochelle mr bucha won the ensuing vote , getting 222 votes to 89 for mr dioguardi and 49 for mr warren there were 87 abstentions mr colavita said there was no winner , since mr bucha did not achieve a majority of the votes cast , which the republican leadership ruled to include abstentions there was no second level of balloting this left many delegates unsatisfied , prompting some boos and catcalls many of the delegates to the convention stayed on in clusters , as dissatisfied with the results as they were with the accommodations , an airless room in the white plains ymca too small to contain enough chairs for all the attendees and with a faulty public address system mr parisi , in dropping out of the wednesday night convention vote , said there appears to be a dispute over party rules , and my candidacy has become a pawn in this dispute it is also driving this party apart rather than allow his name to be put in nomination , he said he would start tuesday to collect signatures for the september primary mr bucha , who described his business as international marketing and said he was on the board of directors of a variety of other companies , said he was not sure what to make of the night s events he said , ask the boss , pointing at mr colavita asked if he had support in the other counties of the district , mr bucha said , i came in first in putnam and second in orange on a first ballot , but they never designated anybody , quitting after going to four ballots he said he came in second in dutchess county and was hoping for conservative party support districtwide six are better than none mr flanagan said the evening s process was democracy at its very , very best where the people are going to get an opportunity to choose without prejudice of any manipulations of political machines , or any other gerrymandering or persuasion behind the scenes mr colavita claimed to be delighted with the outcome he said , there are six fine candidates , and the outcome is the healthiest thing that could happen in this situation , and the people of the 19th congressional district will decide our rules do not provide for a runoff we have never done that i think having six candidates is better than having no candidate , a reference to his experience as state republican chairman in 1986 in not finding anyone from among 26 million party members to run for governor mr dioguardi , a twoterm congressman who was defeated by the incumbent , representative nita m lowey , said he planned to move from his home in new rochelle , which is out of the district he is seeking to represent he put his house on the market last september , he said , and will move to mount pleasant the convention came closer to settling on a candidate in the 89th assembly district , which is held now by a democrat , naomi c matusow the delegates , again restricted to those from state district , narrowly selected robert spolzino of mount kisco over county legislator richard a flynn the vote was 103 to 97 mr flynn said he would challenge mr spolzino s nomination in a primary in the 84th assembly district , where james g pretlow , a mount vernon democrat , is the incumbent , the republicans selected eric g lustig of yonkers , a programmeranalyst in an advertising agency mr colavita said a republican candidate for the 85th district , where ronald c tocci , a new rochelle democrat , is the incumbent , would be named later the republicans selected gerard gershonowitz of hartsdale to challenge the incumbent democratic assemblyman , richard l brodsky , in the 86th district county legislator michael j spano , who served less than a year in the assembly to fill out the unexpired term of terence m zaleski when he was elected mayor of yonkers , was chosen as the candidate in the 87th district to replace republican assemblywoman cecile d singer , who is retiring in the 88th district , held by audrey g hochberg , a scarsdale democrat , the republicans chose robert walsh of eastchester , a retired transportation executive the 90th district candidate , gary ajello , a yorktown councilman , will face sandra r galef , the democratic incumbent from ossining as expected , the convention endorsed the candidacy of assemblyman vincent l leibell 3d for the state senate seat in the 37th district being vacated by assemblyman george e pataki , who is challenging mario m cuomo for the post of governor mr leibell will face former westchester county executive alfred b delbello , whose last elected office was lieutenant governor under mr cuomo in other senate races , the convention backed republican incumbents guy j velella and nicholas a spano for reelection in the 34th and 35th districts but put off selections in the 33d and 36th districts , where democratic incumbents joseph l galiber of the bronx and suzi oppenheimer of new rochelle are seeking reelection the convention also selected four candidates for county judge the incumbents joseph k west and kenneth lange , fred shapiro , chief

the seclusion room on ward 9 at the bronx psychiatric center is intentionally spare naked pale peach walls a worn mattress on the terrazzo floor , and a heavy door with a wiremesh window it is here that patients have frequently been brought sometimes kicking and yelling , other times walking calmly after growing violent and endangering other patients or staff members if patients are determined to hurt themselves through scratching , say the seclusion room has been passed over for the straitjacket , or camisole , as the state delicately calls it a creamcolored canvas jacket with sleeves that wrap behind the back , immobilizing the arms for decades , the seclusion room and straitjacket have been part of the arsenal that mental hospitals have drawn on to control violence among patients but prompted by the deaths of 18 patients in restraint or seclusion in new york state psychiatric hospitals between 1988 and 1992 , along with pressure from former patients , state mental health officials began moving last week to end the use of straitjackets and to cut back on the use of other physical restraints and seclusion for hospitals like the bronx psychiatric center , the directive poses several challenges administrators need to find other ways to deal with violence , so that methods like seclusion and physical restraint are viewed not only as a last resort but also as a treatment failure to that end , the hospital has eased overcrowding , is training staff members in ways to curtail agitation before it turns to violence , has begun to reward patients for good behavior , and has started a daily review of any use of seclusion and restraint the message is that we 're going to examine this issue every day at the highest level of management , said barbara donaldson , acting director of the bronx center , which has 583 patients you ca n't have a kneejerk reaction and just put someone in seclusion , because it s going to be reviewed most of the action on ward 9 occurs in the day room where the majority of the 30 patients hang out under the cold fluorescent light , playing table tennis or watching a television set that is a little too loud a few sit in the gray haze of the smoking lounge or lie on their beds in the dormitorystyle rooms they are young and old , male and female , but the illnesses of their minds mostly schizophrenia have taken an almost uniform toll on their bodies , giving them demeanors that are haunted , withdrawn , agitatedor simply lonely it is a sad place , this locked ward , where people stay for months or years and for the staff , it is a difficult one in the last decade , the patient population has changed from an older , more docile group to a younger one that is more violent and less able to perform basic tasks as deinstitutionalization continues , the ones who remain behind in psychiatric hospitals tend to be the sickest and the most psychotic addictions elevate problems more than twothirds of the patients arrive addicted to drugs or alcohol , and just over half have been arrested , hospital officials say crack use , in particular , has made their symptoms worse crack tends to agitate patients , making them paranoid and violent and much more difficult to manage , said dr merrill rotter , the clinical director even before a state report on a twoyear investigation last week called for changes in the use of restraint and seclusion , bronx psychiatric , set on a compact campus in the morris park section , had begun to focus on its use of seclusion two years ago , when the state started posting rates of seclusion and restraint among its 22 adult hospitals on a computer network , bronx psychiatric was near the top of the list restraints were always used sparingly , but the seclusion rate was the highest in the city and one of the highest in the state then , in october 1992 , a 23yearold patient who was trying to gouge out his eye died , according to state officials , while being placed in a fourpoint restraint the restraint , in which the ankles and wrists are fastened to a bed , is no longer used by bronx psychiatric but will still be allowed under the proposed guidelines it was a wakeup call , ms donaldson said restraint use declines since then , officials at the hospital have tackled the problem of violence on several fronts and , in the last six months , have reduced the use of seclusion in january , there were 212 cases of seclusion last month , there were 113 the use of restraints fell to none last month from seven in january administrators attribute the decline to a few changes the number of patients was reducedto 583 today from 640 last fall the result , ms donaldson said , was less people pressure and more individual attention new medications , as well as older drugs traditionally used for seizures and heart disease , have proved helpful in alleviating psychosis and violent tendencies in some patients , without leaving them too sedated , doctors say clozapine , the wonder drug of recent years for schizophrenia , has made a big difference one woman was secluded , on average , 18 times every three months in the most recent quarter , when she began using clozapine , she was secluded only twice clozapine has been tremendously effective in terms of managing aggression , dr rotter said

to better understand the wretched place that may 1 , 1994 , will occupy in motor racing history , go back to april 7 , 1968 that was the day jim clark , the scotsman who was a twotime world champion and the 1965 indianapolis 500 winner , slid off the track in hockenheim , germany , and died when his lotus crashed into a stand of trees it is pointless to argue whether that loss was greater than the one that occurred on the seventh lap of the san marino grand prix yesterday , when ayrton senna s williamsrenault flew off the ferrari autodrome circuit and into a concrete wall at almost 200 miles an hour what matters is that in both cases , one of the giants of motor racing s postwar era was killed senna , a 34yearold brazilian , died of multiple skull fractures shortly after the accident , which occurred while he was leading the race senna , who could wring more speed out of a car than any other driver now practicing the craft , held the career record for formula one pole positions with 65 he had three world championships and his 41 race victories were second to the 51 by the frenchman alain prost , who retired after last season senna s loss to the circuit is immeasurable he was the only previous world champion left in formula one , after prost s retirement and briton nigel mansell s defection to indy car racing after the 1992 season the number of fatalities and injuries alone not just the stature of the victims were enough to make the san marino race one of the worst weekends in formula one history in all , five accidents took the lives of two drivers and injured another driver and four mechanics the accidents began on friday at the 32mile ferrari autodrome in imola , italy , when brazilian driver rubens barrichello lost control of his jordanhart and slammed into a tire barrier at high speed , nearly going over the barrier into a chainlink fence separating the spectator areas barrichello , 21 , suffered a slight concussion and facial bruises and did not race yesterday during qualifying on saturday , roland ratzenberger , a 31yearold austrian driver in only his third formula one race with the new team simtek slid off the course and hit a concrete barrier he died of brain damage his death made the san marino race the first grand prix with a fatality since the 1982 canadian grand prix , in which driver ricardo paletti died in an accident at the start elio de angelis of italy , who died in a private test session in france on may 15 , 1986 , was the last formula one driver before ratzenberger to die in a wreck a number of drivers ceased qualifying after ratzenberger s crash out of respect for him , including senna another driver was offered ratzenberger s starting spot , but he refused it but ratzenberger s teammate on the simtek team , david brabham , decided to compete yesterday yesterday s race was troubled from the start , when j j lehto of finland stalled most of the drivers immediately behind him on the twoabreast starting grid were able to avoid him , but pedro lamy of portugal in a lotusmugen could not when his car which , like most formula one cars , could easily accelerate to 100 miles an hour in 3 seconds from a standing start slammed into the lehto s benetton car , two wheels broke off the lotus and flew over the spectator fence into a crowded grandstand the drivers were not hurt , but seven spectators and a police officer were injured by the wheels the race continued , but at a reduced pace under a yellow flag , while the wreckage was cleared almost immediately after the race resumed at full speed following four pace laps , senna entered the highspeed sweeping lefthand corner just beyond the startfinish line at the ferrari autodrome and kept going straight , into a concrete wall along the right side of the corner television replays showed that none of senna s tires were locked up , so he hit the wall at high speed almost headon , but more toward the right side of the car organizers stopped the race while senna was removed from the car and taken by helicopter directly from the crash site to maggiore hospital in bologna , where he was pronounced dead at 6 40 pm about an hour earlier , his doctors had said the driver was brain dead in an article that appeared on the morning of his death , senna , writing in germany s biggest sunday newspaper , welt am sonntag , said of his williamsrenault my car reacts a bit nervously on this kind of race surface this stems from its special aerodynamics but it s also got to do with a difficulty in the suspension he said he had experimented with a couple of aerodynamic modifications near the end of the race , as michele alboreto of italy sped out of the crowded pit lane , his minardiford struck three ferrari mechanics and a member of the lotus team the mechanics suffered bruises the condition of the lotus crew member was not immediately known michael schumacher of germany , driving a benettonford , won the race , his third victory in three races this season a year in which senna , the best driver in the circuit s best car , was thought to be invincible in the seasonopening race , march 27 in his home country of brazil , senna spun while trying to catch schumacher on april 17 in japan , he was hit from behind at the first turn and knocked out of the race photo ayrton senna s car crashing

kings park , li , feb 22 on long island , where boaters are numbered in the thousands and sometimes must wait as long as a decade to find berths for their vessels , membership in the kings park yacht club is something of a plum the weatherworn brownshingled clubhouse , overlooking the mouth of the nissequogue river , is not a place where people in ascots and blue blazers gather to sip chardonnay nor do the members moor streamlined 60foot schooners and threebedroom luxury cruisers rather , most own small sloops and fishing boats with outboard motors but the club has one perquisite enjoyed by few others in the state for more than 40 years , it has occupied roughly four acres of stateowned shoreline and never paid a penny in rent today , after a decade of sporadic and unsuccessful negotiations , state officials said that they had had enough and had taken the first step toward evicting the boaters at a news conference in front of the club this afternoon , state comptroller h carl mccall and attorney general g oliver koppell announced that the club s commodore , robert steger , had been served on saturday with a notice to quit the property , on the edge of the 600acre grounds of the kings park psychiatric center here 'this has to stop' they 're basically ripping off the taxpayers , taking advantage of the free rent , mr mccall said this is a simple outrage , using state property without any compensation for it , and this has to stop supporters of the club , originally formed for employees of the hospital , said the state had tolerated its rentfree status for decades without any complaint , and wondered what had prompted the change of heart william p ahearn jr , the club s lawyer , said the state gave his clients little choice , either pay an unreasonable fee or get out he continued , the club has been here for over 50 years and as such the state has consented to the use of the property as a yacht club while the club incorporated itself as a nonprofit institution in 1949 , records at the state office of mental health show it operating unofficially on the property as early as 1940 around that time , club members apparently beached an old barge there and converted it into the current clubhouse assemblyman robert c wertz , republican of smithtown , said the hospital allowed the club to be established because it was seen as a perquisite to attract people to work in the psychiatric wards in what was then a littlepopulated area today , the 75member club , which reportedly has a waiting list , includes the grandchildren of some of the original members , mr wertz said , but none work at the hospital since its inception , the club has developed into even more of a bargain according to the comptroller s office , the club s annual membership fee is 365 , about onefifth the cost of four nearby marinas challenging similar deal there is one other yacht club that offers a similar deal and it too is on the hospital s grounds less than a mile away is the nissequogue yacht club , which similarly operates rent free and was established in 1966 but the difference is that the nissequogue club s membership , which numbers about 150 , is restricted to current and retired hospital employees mr mccall said that the state is challenging the nissequogue club s arrangement , but that it is a much more complicated situation to enforce because of labor laws , employees may be permitted to consider yacht club membership a legitimate benefit but the law is clear , mr koppel said , when it came to the kings park yacht club they may argue that they have a legal right to be here , but they have no contract , he said just because they used it this way in the past does not mean they can use it this way in the future if the club does not vacate the premises in 30 days , mr koppel said , the state will go to court to force the club to leave the psychiatric center though the state began negotiations with the club in the early 1980 s , little progress was made and the talks were sporadic it is not clear why the state waited almost a decade longer to stop the club from using its property rent free but in the last year , the rentfree status of the yacht club began to draw more attention , as the state s fiscal condition worsened and as officials began looking into closing the psychiatric hospital in 1997 the land occupied by the club , where the nissequogue river opens into the long island sound , was appraised by the state as being worth from 3 million to 35 million in 1989 at the same time , the kings park action committee , a neighborhood group , wrote to officials to complain about the apparent boondoggle , and state negotiators became frustrated with the club s unwillingness to pay rent mr steger , the club s commodore , declined to comment on the state action other members of the club did not return phone calls thom tubbs , a spokesman for the state s office of general services , which conducted the negotiations , said the club was given an opportunity to rent its spot on the shoreline for 9 , 000 for one year , with future years to be renegotiated it was intended as a token figure to show that the yacht club was ready to enter into meaningful talks , he said that offer was not received as gleefully as we thought it would be , so today s action proceeded , he said we finally got tired of waiting , and the commissioner said enough is enough , fiscal times are tough , and we just do n't have the luxury any longer to let this kind of money escape photo the accommodations of the kings park yacht club were always modest , but membership carried a special bonus to boat owners on long island the club paid no rent for the four acres of stateowned shoreline property attorney general g oliver koppell , left , and state comptroller h carl mccall were on the grounds of the clubhouse yesterday to announce their intention to end the state s largess \( vic delucia the new york times \)

weeks before anyone knew that a 31yearold retired basketball player named michael jordan would be playing right field , the minor league birmingham barons , as is their annual custom , distributed 46 , 000 free tickets to local schoolchildren for a baseball game last sunday night based on past experience , they figured about 2 , 000 kids would show up when mr jordan was added to the team s roster , panic set in fearing that all 46 , 000 kids would descend at once on a stadium built for 10 , 000 , the barons tried frantically to recall the tickets when that failed , they announced that none of the tickets would be honored dumb move canceling tickets , the birmingham news thundered editorially , is no way to build baseball fans a couple of disappointed high school principals also accused the barons of putting greed above civic virtue , noting that with mr jordan on the team , the barons could now sell what they had been prepared to give away at which point corporate sanity prevailed the barons announced that the tickets would be honored for any game sunday through thursday between april 11 and june 29 the only thing the kids now have to fear is that mr jordan will be elevated to the class aa barons' major league parent , the chicago white sox , before they can use their tickets that is not likely to happen uncertain with both bat and glove , michael jordan has barely begun to translate his incomparable basketball skills to the baseball field he struck out five times in seven atbats in his first two games , before getting two hits on sunday come to think of it , though , that is one very good reason the barons should encourage young people to come to the park as each day passes , it becomes clearer that mr jordan s baseball venture is not simply a publicity stunt choreographed by the white sox or a quick and painless segue from one sport to another what is genuinely intriguing now is the spectacle of a proud man chasing an improbable dream , at considerable daily risk to his ego and reputation there are lessons to be learned here , about humility , hard work and maybe , in the end , humble pie no student will be the worse off for having been exposed to them
dream city race , power , and the decline of washington , dc by harry s jaffe and tom sherwood illustrated 352 pp new york simon schuster 24 the city of the white house , the capitol , the washington monument and the lincoln memorial is perhaps the most deceptive in america as described by harry s jaffe and tom sherwood , two washington local reporters a different breed from the national reporters who cover presidents and congress the dream city on the potomac actually is a nightmare the crime rate is among the highest in the country , and the municipal government remains exceptionally inefficient , they write in their gripping , depressing book , dream city race , power , and the decline of washington , dc the infant mortality rate remains among the highest in the nation the wait for public housing is years and for drug treatment is months in 1993 , the 80 , 000student school system was ranked among the worst in the country , with more money per pupil than virtually any other jurisdiction in relentless detail , sometimes with almost novelistic drama , the authors describe the murder and mayhem , lawlessness and drug wars , addiction and despair into which a once placid , middleclass city has been allowed to descend theirs is a washington tourists seldom see \( unless they 're unlucky enough to get caught in a carjacking or a driveby shooting \) , but one that exists malevolently , within sight of the capitol , in the shadows of heroic marble monuments their culprits are many thieving realestate operators and bureaucrats , corrupt police , congressional overlords who for too long governed the city as ole massa once ruled his southern plantation , a black aristocracy too proud of its light skin and long lineage to mix with the bamas sharecroppers and their children who thronged into the city in their great postwar migration out of the south but the authors are in no doubt , and leave none , that the main villain of the piece though less villainous in their view than vain , intemperate , selfdeluding and hungry for money , power and women is marion s barry jr , himself a bama , a former civil rights worker turned drug addict who served three terms as mayor , then a sixmonth term in prison for misdemeanor cocaine possession , then was elected to the district council dream city , in fact , is primarily the sad story of the rise and fall of marion barry how a shrewd , tough young worker for the student nonviolent coordinating committee , elevated to the mayoralty with the cooperation of much of washington s white power structure , became the dazed , shocked middleaged man caught in the act of smoking crack with a woman who had set him up in a washington hotel room mr jaffe and mr sherwood fully comprehend the conflicting meanings of the latter moment for the white racist , he was a typical black man , dumb enough to walk into a trap because he could n't resist sex and drugs for many africanamericans , he was a black leader hounded and investigated , and finally humiliated by a racist white society for those who could see beyond the caricature , he was the sad civil rights leader who had risen to political power , and by his own devices , squandered his opportunity for the authors , that lost opportunity may have been unique , as is washington itself , a city that had the most prosperous , welleducated black population of any american city , they write it had a stable employer in the federal government it had a wealthy white population that was among the most liberal in the nation it was the beneficiary of one of the most lucrative development booms experienced by any city over a 10year period given the uniqueness of the setting , barry had the opportunity to help create a modern urban center that worked they believe marion barry s most damning legacy , in the face of such an opportunity , is still today the dispirited and desperate state of the city s police department , which the authors say he starved and corrupted for years to cover up his drug dependency they maintain that he also connived with developers , allowed rampant corruption , flaunted his women and his jazzy style and denounced drugs while putting cocaine up his nose but he was elected and reelected because he delivered services unseen before to a black community that feared whites would take it all away if they could , and because white leaders considered him able to contain the disenfranchised by giving them a voice , or unleash them by inciting their anger even in his final ordeal of arrest in 1990 , wearing handcuffs and being read his rights like a common criminal , marion barry remained the eternal politician the first flash of the camera taking the mayor s mug shot captured his haggard face , slumped in defeat but he was ready for the next flash he licked his lips , slapped on his wideeyed smile and grinned into the lens marion barry still had enough presence of mind to wear his mask for the fbi in the end , aided by an excellent lawyer and his appeal to washington s masses , some of whom served on his jury , mr barry was acquitted of a second charge the jury failed to reach a verdict on 12 more , including three felony perjury counts a tough judge sent him to prison anyway he served his six months , came back , and might someday be mayor again even though the other washington , the city beyond

foxboro , mass on a billboard across highway 1 from foxboro stadium , bill parcells is big and bulky in a blue patriots jacket you ca n't fake a patriot commander , the sign shouts nobody would dare to put pete carroll or his jets players on a billboard in a green jacket with that slogan but green would be the correct color that s green as in jets green and green as in , when will they learn \? when will the jets learn to pay attention \? after yesterday s 2413 loss to the patriots , the jets insisted that they had not been haunted by dan marino s sting in their 2824 loss to the dolphins the previous sunday , but maybe they would have been better off if they had been haunted maybe then they would have been alert instead of asleep again none of the jets' frustrated followers will ever forget how marino faked the jets into a lastsecond loss by pretending to spike the ball at the 8yard line before drilling the winning touchdown pass but apparently the jets forgot yesterday the jets were asleep when the patriots pretended to line up for a 48yard field goal before pat o'neill s pooch punt to the 1yard line that punt preceded ricky reynolds s 11yard touchdown dash for a 1713 lead after the patriot cornerback intercepted boomer esiason s pass on thirdand6 from the 5 on the pooch punt , todd rucci , a patriot guard , of all people , downed the ball at the 1 the jets , the 291pound , 6foot5inch lineman said , did n't seem to know what was going on put that on the tombstone for the jets' season when the jets had to win against the dolphins a week ago yesterday , they did n't seem to know what was going on when marino was pretending to spike the ball before his touchdown pass with 22 seconds remaining and when the jets had to win yesterday , they did n't seem to know what was going on when o'neill , the pats' longrange placekicker , punted over their heads and an offensive guard , instead of a speedy coverage specialist , downed it at the 1 we 've been working on that all year , parcells said no big deal the patriots wo n't be able to fool another team with that fake field goal , just as marino wo n't be able to fool another team with his fake spike but each fooled the jets with it just when the jets could least afford to be fooled just when the game had turned against them richie anderson had scored on a squirming 25yard run for what loomed as a 1710 lead , but art monk s illegal block nullified the touchdown nick lowery salvaged a 26yard field goal for a 1310 lead , but drew bledsoe s passes postioned the fake field goal that turned out to be a punt and reynolds s interception we had to try to get it out of there for a first down , esiason said of the thirddown pass that deep in jet territory reynolds made a great play i made a bad throw with a 67 record now , the jets' only hope for the super bowl xxix playoffs is to win their three remaining games against the detroit lions and san diego chargers at the meadowlands before the season finale in houston on christmas eve but what are the chances they will win even one or two \? not only did the patriots , now 76 with a fourgame winning streak , shatter the jets' playoff hopes this season , but with bill parcells as their coach and drew bledsoe as their quarterback , the patriots have established themselves as a team to be feared by the jets in the seasons to come it has never been easy for the jets to qualify for the american conference playoffs in recent years because the buffalo bills and the dolphins were in their eastern division as long as dan marino is their quarterback , the dolphins will be a contender but just when the jets finally swept the bills in their two games , the patriots have emerged as another divisional team to fear and as long as bill parcells is the patriots coach , they will only get better and if the jets fell asleep again yesterday , some of their fans ca n't complain since the jets moved in 1984 from shea stadium to what they call the meadowlands instead of giants stadium , they have had a total of more than a million noshows at their games there yesterday the patriots had only 154 noshows in an assembly of 60 , 138 parishioners at foxboro stadium maybe a few hundred of those spectators were jets fans who drove up i95 on a 60degree december day but by the final minutes those jets fans were leaving the parking lot , driving past that big billboard with bill parcells wearing that big blue patriots jacket you ca n't fake a patriot commander , but you can fake the jets at least twice
los angeles a year ago i finally got up the courage to visit the vietnam wall in washington , honoring people who had been willing to give more than i would have wanted to give , at least in that time and place we found the name of a man who had been a good friend of my wife s in high school , the name of a fellow i knew in college and i became aware of the great number of hispanic names on the wall rodriguez and perez , garcia and hernandez , by the dozens who had paid the ultimate respect to this country \( did you see a lot of washingtons and jeffersons \? asked my friend george mcelroy , a veteran journalist and world war ii veteran from houston , who , you might not tell from his name , is black there are n't a lot of whites named washington and jefferson \) those names on that wall are our ultimate national unit , names that remain fitfully on our conscience i hope i will not offend anybody by saying there is another american unit assembled at this moment that in a benign and tangential way also represents the united states of america it is much nicer to be speaking of soccer than war this world cup currently being held in the united states has been peaceful and pleasant , with none of the dreaded hooliganism the scoffers were holding up as the only image of soccer instead , we have a gigantic surprise on our hands a soccer team , as american as apple pie , as american as pizza , as american as tacos , is very close to qualifying for the second round of the most important sports tournament in the world there was still a professional basketball championship going on \( and on , and on \) in houston on the night of june 22 , but when the united states upset a demoralized colombia , 21 , that evening , the rockets had to share the front pages and the network news shows today the american soccer team has the stage for itself the yanks play romania at 4 pm eastern time in the rose bowl a victory or a tie will surely get the americans through , and they could advance even if they lose today this country has reason to be proud i return to the theme of war because the 22 american soccer players remind me of the movies i used to watch , before vietnam all right , i'm rounding up an expedition , the captain would say i'm looking for volunteers you , meola you , balboa you , harkes and when this nation got really with it , jim brown would be playing a soldier named jones , a black college man from ucla , or stewart , halfdutch , halfblack american those soldiers , those actors , had their imperfections , but we recognized them as still unspoiled , still lovable , still our brothers \( the captain was always a grizzled irish guy do n't ask me why in this movie , the coach is a serb who speaks spanish , french , italian , stengelese , before he twits you in english \) they are nice guys i'm not saying eric wynalda is n't a bit arrogant , or marcelo balboa would n't whack you with his elbow , or that most of them would n't hold out for the best financial deal that s how they got this far they had the dream of playing a sport their schoolmates , and even many ostriches in the media , ridiculed sometimes romantics make the best soldiers at the moment , they are less cynical than the dream team basketball players in the 1992 summer games who wrapped themselves in american flags to please their crass sneaker sponsors at the moment , these guys are still psychologically amateurs , unlike baseball players who have turned into 99 percent jerks in the last 10 years , or football players , with their overbuilt necks and underbuilt personalities america had its fling with the national hockey team that upset the soviet union in the semifinals and won the gold medal at lake placid in 1980 with no disrespect , i note that only 15 or 20 nations play hockey while nearly 200 nations play soccer for the united states to outplay yes , and outwill and outthink a talented side like colombia was a wonderful accomplishment , but there may be no miracles in this world cup there may merely be the delightful spectacle of nice , young athletes our lads showing off the skills they have gone out and learned in a mean and demanding world there is still the chance to discover and enjoy them in these glorious days when americans go out on an expedition , and maybe score a goal or two , and the nation cheers photo it s hugs all around for the victorious us \( associated press \)
moscow ever since the end of world war ii , a single curator at the pushkin museum of fine arts had a special and entirely secret task to monitor and maintain the artistic and archeological bounty known as priam s treasure , which had been looted from nazi germany by the red army officially , all was silence the soviet government denied any knowledge of the 4 , 500yearold treasures , which had been unearthed on the site of ancient troy between 1873 and 1890 by the german amateur archeologist , merchant and showman heinrich schliemann , whose finds astonished the world the treasures are actually a thousand years older than homer s king priam of troy , who died about 1200 bc they are a stunning collection of gold and silver diadems , bracelets , earrings , pendants , rings , plates , goblets , buttons , cups and perfume jars , which display the extraordinary artistry , technology and trading relationships of an ancient world there are 260 individually catalogued items at the pushkin , but some pieces , like necklaces , have up to 200 beads of varying types counting every bead , there are believed to be some 12 , 000 individual pieces from the 17 separate digs schliemann made at ancient troy thirteen of those caches are at the pushkin , with the rest scattered among some 45 other museums around the world but until little more than a year ago , even the new russia would not admit that the vast bulk of the schliemann treasures was here at the pushkin museum itself , according to vladimir p tolstikov , director of the department of art and archeology of the ancient world , only he , the museum director and the old curator knew that the treasure was in moscow he and the old man never spoke about it , even to each other , mr tolstikov says , and he still refuses to reveal the curator s name we need n't speak it now , he said but he should be thanked by our government and the world for preserving it so well and when irina a antonova , the director of the pushkin since 1961 , would inquire of the higherups in the communist party s culture ministry about the possibility of revealing the treasure , the answer would always come down , bluntly it s none of your business your task is to keep them and that s all mrs antonova has been criticized for her silence , especially since 1991 , when an article in art news suggested that the treasure was in the soviet union but no one could say a word against those orders , mr tolstikov said her career would have been at an end , and we would have had a worse director before people accuse her , they should remember what kind of country this was in the 1950 s , 60 s and 70 s now the order has come down from a different culture minister , yevgeny sidorov , to show at least some of the hidden treasures he has approved a public exhibition of the schliemann trove for early 1996 , with a new catalogue that takes advantage of contemporary testing methods even mr tolstikov , who had known since 1977 of the collection s safekeeping in the pushkin , saw the objects for the first time only in april the german embassy here estimates that between 30 , 000 and 100 , 000 stolen works of art are still in russian hands the russians say the germans , in turn , stole many thousands of artifacts during their occupation of the soviet union among these treasures are 12th to 14thcentury icons , many of which have been dispersed into private collections , some of which are in the united states , and for that reason they are hard to trace bonn wants a mass exchange of works the russian culture ministry talks of casebycase negotiations but even the conversations represent enormous progress it was only three years ago that the soviet culture ministry admitted to having any secret depositories of stolen art and only in august 1993 did russia admit to having schliemann s treasures mr tolstikov and mikhail y treister , the curator in his department , discussed the collection the other day in a cluttered office at the pushkin , surrounded by bits of pottery and other findings from another dig going on in crimea , in ukraine but the schliemann treasures are still locked away until the exhibition , to be shown only to experts despite schliemann s myth making , the treasures have nothing to do with king priam s troy they are much older , dating from around 2500 to 2400 bc , not from the homeric period , which was 1400 to 1200 bc schliemann said he found troy by using the iliad , and for one famous photograph he dressed his wife , sophia , in a diadem that he claimed had been worn by helen of troy schliemann actually missed the homeric layer and dug right through it without noticing , mr treister said while at the end of his life schliemann knew his mistake , he never admitted it in his writing counter to the popular perception , not everything in the collection is gold or silver there is a large bronze dish and even an artifact of iron , which mr treister said was more valuable at the time than gold i feel very lucky to be able to see these finds , he said sometimes a clay pot can be more exciting and valuable than a gold diadem
roald dahl a biography by jeremy treglown illustrated 322 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 25 once upon a time , when he was a boy , roald dahl was known as the apple , because he was his mother s favorite child he grew quickly , and when he set out to seek his fortune he was called lofty , because he was so tall , and so gallant as a young raf fighter pilot in africa during world war ii eventually he became a real grownup and got married his first wife , the actress patricia neal , was moved , more than once , to use a moniker that plenty of his acquaintances and at least some readers of his misanthropic adult fiction would have endorsed roald the rotten , because he could be so appallingly intolerant and cruel the packaging of roald dahl , in jeremy treglown s phrase , has been a tricky business for all concerned when he became a worldfamous figure , thanks to the phenomenally popular children s fiction that he wrote in his last three decades , dahl himself savvily began molding a public myth out of the private contradictions of his life his shadow also loomed over a couple of dazzled biographies produced in the wake of his success with james and the giant peach and the dozen or so books that followed now mr treglown has undertaken the delicate task from a greater distance , and with great deftness roald dahl a biography , appearing four years after its subject s death at the age of 74 in 1990 , does not at all suffer from being unauthorized in fact , it is the perfect antidote to dahl s own triumph at image making , his vivid and far from entirely truthful memoirs of his childhood and adventurous early manhood , boy and going solo mr treglown has produced a scrupulously fairminded and revealing , if hardly affectionately intimate , account that dwells , as it must , on roald dahl s less entrancing maturity in his sketch of the early life , mr treglown helpfully focuses on dahl s complicated dependence on his mother , sofie , who was abruptly left a widow and bereft mother in 1920 when her only son was 4 harald dahl , a very successful norwegian immigrant to wales , died months after the death from appendicitis of their oldest daughter , astri sofie dahl , also norwegian , bravely carried on , and was clearly a figure who loomed very large for her son doting , demanding and undemonstrative all at once the separating was not easy she cast her dear apple out at the tender age of 9 , shipping him off to a bleak english boarding school as his father had wished \( boy , the first volume of dahl s memoirs , is fixated on floggings and somewhat loose with the galling facts , mr treglown has discovered the headmaster who bloodied his best friend s backside was not , as dahl claimed , the future archbishop of canterbury \) in turn , a decade later sofie dahl stoically endured his departure to the wilds , when he disappeared into east africa , serving first as an employee of shell oil and then as a wartime recruit in the royal air force as going solo reveals , one tie tugged at dahl during what otherwise felt like a fantastic sojourn into an unreal landscape and an inhuman moment in history his mother was never far from his mind no wonder dahl ended up being so hard on the other women in his life , so eager to play the indulged son now wittily ingratiating , now rudely belligerent with his friends and acquaintances , rather than act like a responsible , respectable adult the immature and rebellious profile seems pretty plain and what could be more predictable than that such a man would conclude , as dahl proclaimed he did , that the key to success as a writer was in conspiring with children to remain childlike in defiance of adults \? but mr treglown rightly does n't endorse such a facile , therapeutic connection between the life and the work as he proceeds with his account , it becomes evident that the relationship was considerably less straightforward mr treglown makes it hard to view the man simply as a case of arrested development , or the work as an instance of purely realized revolt dahl s subsequent family life entailed plenty of grim maturing on his part and his literary career as a children s author , his biographer reveals , was hardly a spontaneous , rebellious development dahl was not quite the defiant character or the subversive great writer that he liked to claim mr treglown sticks to a studiously unsensational narrative of the domestic tragedies suffered by dahl and patricia neal that is no small feat , since there s grist enough here for a much more gothic treatment the auguries for the marriage were ominous from the start as ms neal reveals in her autobiography , as i am \( 1988 \) , she knew she did n't love him from the moment they married in 1953 still , she wanted to have beautiful children with him , and indeed they came , but so did a succession of disasters their infant son was left brain damaged in 1960 when a manhattan taxi hit the baby carriage two years later , their 7yearold daughter died of measles in great missenden , the family s english refuge three years after that , amid the bustle of hollywood , ms neal was incapacitated by cerebral aneurysms in midcareer
the mets know about bullpen disasters they tend to create them game after game , manager dallas green goes to his bullpen with trepidation , never certain what kind of performance he will get tommy lasorda must know exactly how green feels this week at shea stadium , the mets have discovered a bullpen as problemprone as their own , and it belongs to lasorda , the dodgers' manager last night at shea stadium one night after the mets nearly stole a victory from los angeles on a disastrous relief appearance by closer todd worrell new york smashed through three eighthinning dodgers relievers , scoring five runs for a 74 comeback victory the big hit came from center fielder ryan thompson , who had a twoout , basesclearing double off roger mcdowell with the score tied , 44 mcdowell was the third los angeles reliever in the inning , which started with a 42 dodgers lead and jim gott on the mound i do n't think , individually or collectively , you go out there with the idea you 're going to be a failure , said mcdowell , whose team leads the national league west despite its pitching problems a bad audition lately , the dodgers have n't had to wait long before last night s game , gott had been discussed as a possible replacement for worrell , the 35 million dodgers closer who blew his seventh save in 15 opportunities when he gave up three runs in the ninth inning monday night but it took gott just onethird of an inning to blow his audition taking over for starter kevin gross , gott gave up three hits , including a tworun single to kevin mcreynolds that tied the ball game , before he was replaced by omar daal daal gave up a double to his only batter , pinchhitter jim lindeman , bringing on mcdowell mcdowell walked jeff kent intentionally to load the bases with one out , and then got david segui to hit a sharp grounder to first that might have been a doubleplay ball had it not been for a terrific breakup slide by mcreynolds after he was forced at the plate the slide prevented dodger catcher mike piazza from making a return throw to first to nail segui mcreynolds jammed his knee on the play and was forced to leave the game , but the stage was set for thompson s big hit we do n't get a lot of hits and we do n't get a lot of clutch hits , said green , who had watched thompson go 3 for 25 at shea stadium heading into the game ryan s hit was big victory to manzanillo the victory for the mets went to josias manzanillo , who faced one batter piazza with the bases loaded in the top of the eighth and induced a ground out on one pitch , a slider john franco closed it out in the ninth for his 21st save i have to be the happiest man alive on the earth , said manzanillo , who now has three victories one pitch , and i win starter bobby jones gave up four runs over seven decent innings , his biggest mistake being a tworun home run by delino deshields with none out in the first inning jones failed in his bid to become the fifth pitcher in the national league to win 11 or more games this season , but bret saberhagen , another 10game winner for the mets , will take a shot this afternoon when the two teams meet for the final time this season saberhagen will square off against ramon martinez the dodgers only hope he can last long enough to avoid most of their bullpen i feel for them because i went through something like that last year , said franco , who did n't pitch a clean ninth \( he gave up a hit and a walk \) , but did hit 90 miles an hour on the radar gun for the first time since his elbow surgery in 1992 coming in , not being consistent i know what they 're going through inside pitch the mets have no plans to disable pete smith , but smith was given a strength test on his throwing shoulder by a team physician yesterday and will begin a strengthening program todd hundley hit his 14th homer of the season in the fourth rico brogna did not start , but his back is nearly 100 percent and he was able to pinchhit in the seventh , when he struck out with kevin mcreynolds day to day with a knee problem , the mets will likely need brogna at first and will turn to david segui to again play the outfield segui suffered cuts to his chin and lip when he was hit in the face by mike piazza while sliding into home in the eighth john franco , a met frequently mentioned in trade rumors , could n't help but smile when he was asked after the game whether the dodgers need to shore up their bullpen they could use some help , franco said a lot of teams could use help other teams apparently interested in franco include atlanta and the yankees , who are rumored to have discussed outfielder gerald williams with the mets photo mets' ryan thompson hitting a twoout , baseclearing double during the eighth inning last night at shea \( barton silverman the new york times \)
to the editor re the censorship sweepstakes \( editorial , march 10 \) please do not leave virginia out of your hall of infamy fairfax county , the richest per capita in the country , also appears to be among the least enlightened , judging by their treatment of my 1981 children s book , families i wrote families as a single mother with a 6yearold daughter because i believe that children are helped by seeing their own reality reflected in literature my daughter , corey , and i knew children living in many different family constellations , but could find none of this rich variety reflected in books children s literature seemed stuck in dickandjane time warp , where every child had two parents , two siblings , a dog , a cat and a house in the suburbs families includes not only human but animal families , ranging from lions to ants it also mirrors the ethnic variety of an upper west side public school it is narrated by a 6yearold , who lives with her mother in one city , like my daughter , and goes to see her father in another during vacations the book is being removed from the family life curriculum of fairfax county , where it has been used without incident for six years , because two parents \( leading opponents of the entire curriculum \) say it encourages lesbianism by showing two women living together and , even worse , glorifies divorce they refer to a scene that shows the narrator going to see her father during vacation , and shows one of her friends saying what one of corey s friends did say to her mother at the time , why do n't you get divorced so i can go to chicago on the airplane too \? only people who go through life inspecting the world for smut could take this as anything but a joke are the parents of fairfax county so deluded that they think the divorce rate is caused by children s literature \? are they willing to let a couple of hysterics determine their children s reading material \? and is it too much to expect a school administration to stand up to this kind of nonsense , rather than to cave in without a struggle \? people in fairfax county who may want to defend the bill of rights , not to mention realism in children s literature , can get in touch with me , the american civil liberties union or the national coalition against censorship meredith tax new york , march 13 , 1994 drawing

elizabeth , nj , april 28 valerie pentony came to new jersey superior court today looking for an antismoking order against her downstairs neighbors in the fox hill apartments in dover what she and her husband , william , got was some sympathy from the judge , along with his order that the apartment complex directors' try to solve the squabble outside of court the morris county couple were arguing in a lawsuit that the stench of cigarettes smoked by marie conrad and her daughter , mary , seeped throughout their apartment the smoke , their suit said , nauseated her at times , left him coughing , sneezing and wheezing and aggravated his asthma and allergies , stained their door with nicotine and made their carpets and bed linens smell of smoke not even a soggy towel sprinkled with air freshener and tucked against the wallboard behind their bed stopped the infiltration of smoke fumes and odors , the pentonys said the couple filed the suit in union county because the owner of fox hill apartments , the fox dover tenants corporation , and its management company , solomon management , are both based in clark both are defendants in the suit faced with a case brimming with the potential to extend the battle between smokers and nonsmokers to apartment houses , condominiums and cooperatives , judge john m boyle demurred a 'minor civil war' after a twohour hearing , he sent pentony v conrad back to the board of directors of their town house cooperative complex for a possible solution noting that smokers and nonsmokers are now locked in a minor civil war socially , judge boyle spoke about the relativity of tastes and the privacy rights of individuals to engage in legal activities , including smoking , in their homes some , judge boyle said , might sneer at the smell of gardenias and , in another analogy , he frowned on the impracticality and questionable legality of ordering people who drank heavily to keep the smell of whisky and beer from wafting from their apartment we understand we ca n't hermetically seal the apartment , judge boyle said strictly speaking , none of us live in a smokefree environment i would like to but in the real world out there , it does n't exist the trucks out on broad street below his thirdfloor courtroom , the judge said , belched fumes and smoke all day long , the judge said 'a circus atmosphere' neither ms conrad nor her daughter appeared in court today before the hearing , she told reporters through the closed door of her apartment that she had been harassed and was considering selling and moving out she said what are they going to do put me in jail \? i'm a 60yearold widow i think this is going to be a circus atmosphere and i do n't care to be a clown in it judge boyle flatly rejected a request by the pentonys' lawyer , richard c klein , to order ms conrad and her daughter to smoke in their apartment only between 9 am and 4 pm , while the pentonys are at work , valerie as a customerrelations specialist for a commodities company and william as an insurance underwriter judge boyle said such an edict would be unenforceable are we going to have a smoke detective on hand to see they do n't cheat \? he asked mr klein all this was a prelude to what the judge called a more practical approach he ordered that fox hill s board of directors transform itself into what he called a quasijudicial mediator , meet with the pentonys and the conrads within two weeks , and then send him a report immediately with possible solutions i'm satisfied we are not going to as yet intrude on the privacy of the conrads , the judge said secondhand smoke the board was named a defendant in the pentonys' lawsuit for not enforcing the coop s universal lease and house rules against creation of a nuisance for other tenants in this case , the pentonys argued , the nuisance was the conrads' secondhand smoke although the board is a defendant , judge boyle said he expected it to be a neutral conciliator in its meeting and its recommendations the board s lawyer , mark sobel , voiced no objections in the interim , judge boyle ordered the pentonys to buy what he called the best smokeeater made in the western world and to keep their receipt possibly , he said , he would make the board pay the bill you must have absolute trust in scientific improvement , the judge told mr klein they tell me these machines are miraculous judge boyle expressed support at one point to the notion that cigarette smoke can be declared a nuisance if it causes ill health but , he added , the pentonys have not proved that a nuisance existed or that the smoke entering their apartment comes from the conrads' apartment or that the board of directors has done nothing to help them of the judge s interim order , mrs pentony said as she left the courthouse , i think he acted very fairly
on the afternoon of july 26 , a rumpled man and an exhausted young girl speaking only russian appeared at the offices of a jewish aid agency in brooklyn with a tale of despair the man said that he and his 7yearold daughter had arrived three days earlier from minsk , belarus , where he was an architect the people who had invited them to the united states had not shown up at the airport , he told counselors at the agency , the jewish community house of bensonhurst they had been living in pennsylvania station , where his wallet and 1 , 000 had been stolen , he said a plastic bag held the remnants of their last meal popcorn , soda and a jar of pickles nine days later , after efforts by numerous city and private agencies to help the two , the father , mikhail kitaev , 38 , threw himself to his death from a fourthfloor window at a city shelter on catherine street in lower manhattan his daughter , who was apparently dragged down when she tried to stop him , was critically injured in the plunge on thursday afternoon the girl , lidia , is listed in critical condition with liver and kidney injuries in the intensive care unit of bellevue hospital center in manhattan he was very lost , his hands were shaking , it was terrible , said alla katsenko , a russian woman who was called in to translate for the kitaevs at a city emergency housing office in the bronx , where the father and daughter were staying two days before the suicide he loved his child very much he called her 'little rabbit' investigators and social workers say they still have many questions about what had happened to the pair but it appears that , equipped with a visitor s visa based on doctored papers , mr kitaev was hoping to settle here and build a new life instead , he and his daughter met tragedy the police have no ready explanation for the suicide , although mr kitaev was clearly distressed and conditions at the shelter have been described as harsh the authorities have also yet to reconstruct the tangled odyssey of mr kitaev and his daughter but after the suicide , the jewish community house pieced together an account of its dealings with mr kitaev , saying that he misled them on key details , especially his immigration status as the agency recounted it in a written statement , mr kitaev and his daughter came in about 3 30 pm on july 26 with the story of missing their hosts at kennedy international airport and having nowhere to go his wife , he told counselors , had abandoned them when lidia was 6 months old and he had raised her alone lidia , in a dirty tshirt , fell asleep on the office floor , recalled vladimir vishnevskiy , one of the counselors , in an interview said anat greenberg , another counselor i was concerned from the beginning that something was happening in russia they hid a lot of information from us no beds available the bensonhurst agency said that mr kitaev told them he needed to return to pennsylvania station for his luggage the agency gave him 50 and asked him to return the next day with his documents while it tried to find shelter but calls to seven agencies for the homeless yielded no beds the next day , the agency s account went on , the man and his daughter returned with passports and letters of invitation to the united states but the counselors questioned whether mr kitaev was providing a full account and called his parents in minsk , learning , the agency said , that he had sold his belongings and , despite having only a visitor s visa , had come to the united states to live and work the mother began to cry and insisted that he stay in the united states under any circumstances , that he should not be sent back , the account continued reached yesterday in minsk , mr kitaev s mother had not yet been told of her son s death she could say only that he had been making his second visit to the united states no help in rochester mrs kitaev had told the agency that the family had friends in rochester the agency called the people and discovered that mr kitaev had already been there and had been turned away the agency was suspicious about the invitation to visit the united states that mr kitaev had shown the man who signed it was tracked down in minsk we later learned from mr k that he bought the invitation letters for 100 each , the agency said but last night , a brother of the man who signed the invitation said it had been genuine , extended by eduard shneydman of brooklyn , who did business in belarus and knew mr kitaev the brother , fima shneydman of louisville , said mr kitaev had failed to notify eduard that he was coming and that eduard had meanwhile left for minsk nonetheless , on july 28 , in a freshly pressed suit and tie , mr kitaev appeared with lidia at the offices of the hebrew immigrant aid society , a nonprofit organization in manhattan , to apply for asylum according to the director , roberta hershey , he said he came from a jewish family but had not been raised as a jew he could not articulate past experiences of antisemitism or that he would face persecution on his return to belarus , ms hershey said a counselor advised him not to seek asylum in the united states and to move to israel instead he liked that idea , said ms hershey meanwhile , the bensonhurst agency found a neighborhood landlady who accepted 20 per day plus expenses to take in the pair but the woman , who declined to be interviewed , told the agency that she found empty vodka bottles behind the radiator and no longer wanted mr kitaev in her home the landlady told the agency that the child did not have enough clothes , and that she cried and sulked when the landlady tried to give her a bath she was dirty and apparently had not changed clothes for two days the landlady said she bought lidia underpants and undershirts and took the family to church and to a church luncheon , where the child played with her food and refused to eat , ms greenberg reported the next day , aug 1 , mr kitaev was told he would have to move to an emergency assistance unit city placement office at 151st street and walton avenue in the bronx he and lidia arrived late the following night ms katsenko , the russian translator , said she got a frantic call from the office about 2 o'clock the morning of aug 2 no one could communicate with the kitaevs and lidia was battling attempts to give her a routine vaccination she said the office was jammed with pregnant women and squalling infants lidia , she said , was sleeping on the floor without a blanket she likened the girl to a french croissant , so puffy with golden blonde hair and blue eyes and a proprietary manner toward her father she was his boss , ms katsenko said she calmed the little girl and her disoriented father , she said , learning some of the story mr kitaev also told the bensonhurst agency 'two of the most lost' there were two of the most lost , suffering people i ever saw in my life , she said she said that later , when she returned home , she called social and church agencies but none could offer shelter for the kitaevs at 3 am thursday , the father and daughter were moved to the catherine street shelter under the best of circumstances it s a tense environment with overcrowded conditions and sharing bathrooms with large numbers of strangers , said steve banks , coordinating attorney for the legal aid society s homeless family rights project in the summer heat it s worse ms katsenko visited lidia in bellevue on thursday night she looked bad , she said but yesterday , when she tried to visit lidia again , she was told no visitors were allowed yesterday , jewish groups around the city were organizing support services and a fund for lidia kitaev , and russianspeaking social workers had pledged to care for the child at bellevue hospital , said misha galperin of the new york association of new americans photo the catherine street shelter in manhattan where a man from belarus leaped to his death while his

instead of being a happy time , the process of sports recruiting by colleges leaves most of westchester s high school athletes and their parents feeling overwhelmed and uninformed many miss out on major opportunities because they do n't know how to selfrecruit or promote a young sports star i feel lucky , but it s also one of the worst things i 've ever gone through , said rob doerr , a highly recruited lacrosse player and senior from yorktown high school , as he spoke at a recent evening meeting covering sportsrecruiting strategies at chappaqua s horace greeley high school mr doerr was just back from a recruiting trip to syracuse university , and he has also been pursued by johns hopkins university and loyola college , both in baltimore , among others mr doerr was one of seven panelists assembled by peter kuczma , director of athletics at horace greeley high school in chappaqua mr kuczma has experienced college athletic recruiting as a greeley coach and athletic director for the last 24 years and as the parent of three college athletes to share information and expose misinformation , he invited athletes from neighboring school districts and their parents to the evening meeting last month , the second at horace greeley in two years both meetings were sponsored by the school s sports booster organization , a parents' information clearinghouse sitting next to mr doerr was kate nolan , a horace greeley senior and swimmer who was also living through the sportsrecruiting process joining them on the panel was jim bostic , an assistant basketball coach from iona college who played high school basketball in yonkers and was recruited to play college basketball and later played professional ball linda puner , a chappaqua parent who often writes and lectures on high school sports recruiting john buckley , an admissions officer from fordham university david mendelowitz , a guidance counselor from horace greeley high school , and mr kuczma mr doerr said that because of national collegiate athletic association regulations , college coaches are not allowed to call prospective players until july 1 after they have completed their junior year but on july 1 the phone starts ringing , he recalled , and absolute strangers will talk to you for hours and they sound so nice you get five or six calls a night i finally had to signal my mother to tell them that i was n't home in reality , the coaches would like an honest 'i'm not interested , ' if you 're not i even got plane tickets in the mail from a school i was n't interested in , and i had to get up my nerve to call that coach back it s better to tell them right away college recruiting has become a big business , one that involves parents , student athletes , their high school coaches , college coaches and independent recruiters , who charge 300 to 600 to send information about an athlete to schools with small recruiting budgets also in the picture are high school guidance counselors , college admissions staffers , the the athletic association s clearinghouse , authors and lecturers how do student athletes make the right connections and end up in the right school \? most participants said that a strong academic record is needed in junior and senior high school several referred to strict eligibility requirements for larger division i colleges a high school diploma , a grade point average of 25 in at least 13 core academic courses and a minimum combined score on their english and math scholastic aptitude test score of 700 , or a 20 and a combined sat of 900 requirements for division ii colleges are similar , with a 20 minimum grade point average paired with a 700 sat to prevent tampering with academic records , the association instituted the ncaa initial eligibility clearinghouse last year this year s college freshmen were the first required to use the service reached at association headquarters in overland park , kan , the director of public information , kathryn reith , said that 45 , 000 high school athletes registered in the first year , which ended in september she said it s doing what we wanted it to do it s keeping schools from certifying kids who did n't meet academic requirements ms nolan recalled that all of the college coaches she spoke to said they can help you get into their school last summer , ms nolan heard from many schools , including west point , annapolis , villanova and fordham all division i schools she decided , however , to selfrecruit and called several division iii colleges and ivy league colleges , none of which give athletic scholarships mr bostic , who was a power forward for new mexico state university s basketball team from 1971 to 1975 , said when i was playing , there was no sat requirement you could have been a moron , and they would have gotten you in mr bostic is now paid to recruit basketball players for iona , a division i school , which awards athletic scholarships he knows how strict the requirements are today he said , if the student does n't meet the ncaa academic requirements , no way
it s the voice that dates jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis not the face , not the body or the way she moves in the old television news film i watched for hours last weekend those are ageless her clothes \( the sleeveless linen sheaths , chanel suits and soft cashmere turtlenecks \) seem timeless , too jackie s image is eternally modern but the voice is pure 50 s and 60 s demure , reserved , gracious as i listen to her now , jackie sounds like a younger , more innocent cousin of marilyn monroe soft , tentative , ready to laugh , a bit surprised to find herself being addressed like marilyn , she is a childwoman , trying so hard to please , to get it right , to be a good girl which is what you did in those days if you were a woman who wanted to get ahead actually , if you wanted to get anything you charmed your way to the top spot which , for a woman , meant being next to the top you were fascinating , not competitive gracious , not ambitious poised , not strategic you were graceful , sympathetic , a marvelous listener all of which jacqueline kennedy did better than anyone else ever and her reward was to be the first lady but , of course , she was more than that she was jackie and that was a function not of genes or breeding but of her arrival at the dawn of the age of mass media television was not new to presidential politics dwight d eisenhower s ability to project his wide grin and warhero aura into american homes won him landslide victories as it happened , ike s performance was only a warmup for john kennedy s virile good looks , entourage of hollywood stars and talkshowhost ease in front of a camera but what put j f k over the top on television and arguably won him the election was his wife on even the smallest blackandwhite screen , her natural reserve and shyness came across as mcluhan esque coolness , intriguing and enigmatic her sense of personal style , her designer clothes , her patrician bearing made her a starlet she gazed straight into the camera , did n't blink and looked smashing from any angle and her star quality let a huge , restless younger generation of baby boomers connect with the first family this incongruously glamorous couple living at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in a brandnew way jacqueline bouvier kennedy became an icon named jackie public approval turned into jackie mania women dressed like her , cut their hair like her , named their daughters after her fortunately for jack and jackie , they were in the opening hours of this new kind of fame the electronic media were young , too , and did not know their own strength yet television cameras made the kennedys into newstyle celebrities , but television reporters continued to play by oldstyle rules today the price of such media attention and adulation is an automatic license to probe and discuss any action , no matter how trivial but in 1960 , reporters never thought of covering kennedy s philandering no one looked all that hard at what mrs kennedy spent on shoes or scolded her for not meeting with congressional wives or demanded to know her views on abortion or thalidomide or the woman question or anything at all instead , they let her be a beautifully polished mirror in which people could see what they wanted the first lady of their dreams the beautiful mother of an adorable little girl , pregnant with her second child during her husband s presidential campaign , she had a lock on one of the nation s favorite roles young mother and she apparently found all the fulfillment she needed in serving her husband and children i think the job of the first lady is to take care of the president , she once said in a campaign interview the most important thing is taking care of your children and your husband , she said on another occasion asked about the psychological requirements to be a successful political wife , she said such a woman has to really love her husband , for then any sacrifice she might have to make is a joy back then , if you did n't have something good to say , you remained silent although she was the first president s wife to have a press secretary , mrs kennedy never held a press conference she never made a public fuss , not about her husband s affairs , not about the permanent invasion of her privacy ever the smiling stoic , she is positively gracious as she tells an interviewer about abruptly canceling an outing to the circus with caroline because of the swarming photographers the scene she is describing sounds highly distressing , but she says only that it was a little hard , accompanying even this mild rebuke with a selfeffacing smile to reassure us that she is n't the least bit angry in november 1963 , the first television president became the first television martyr , and the perfect young wife and mother took on an unwanted new role now the cameras caught blackveiled images of transcendent grief , of noble sorrow , of unsurpassed dignity once again , we could look into that beautifully polished mirror and see what we wanted the first widow , publicly enacting pain and sorrow for all of us , looking the way we wished we could look , seeming to embody the courage and composure and faith we desperately hoped to summon up
to the editor the clinton administration s logging plan for the pacific northwest , which a federal judge has just approved \( front page , dec 22 \) , is more than a blueprint for protecting the spotted owl it is the first complete example of the administration s new policy of ecosystem management charged with devising a management plan for millions of acres of forest , thousands of miles of rivers and streams and more than 1 , 000 species tied to scarce ancient forests , five federal agencies took a new approach they identified the watersheds for salmon and protected the forests around them , added tracts of ancient forest and supplemented these areas with protected lands for species like the spotted owl and marbled murrelet other guidelines limit the type of logging in areas slated for cutting the plan demonstrates that it is possible to juggle all the components that go into managing a complex ecosystem and to arrive at a solution that balances environmental and economic concerns none of this would have happened without strong laws like the national forest management act and the endangered species act , laws that many members of congress now seem intent on crippling one can ignore disappearing species , declining salmon stocks and butchered forests for a while , but eventually the bill comes due david s wilcove senior ecologist environmental defense fund washington , dec 23 , 1994 drawing
the stone diaries by carol shields 361 pp new york viking 2195 carol shields , the americanborn canadian novelist and story writer , is often mentioned in the same breath with margaret atwood and alice munro , and her last novel , the republic of love , attracted a small but enthusiastic band of admirers , myself among them last year the stone diaries was nominated for britain s booker prize and acclaimed by many reviewers there now it has been published here , and it deserves our fullest attention the novel provides , glancingly , a panorama of 20thcentury life in north america written in diary format , it traces the life of one seemingly unremarkable woman daisy goodwill flett , who is born in 1905 and lives into the 1990 s the stone diaries includes an elaborate family tree of the sort usually found in biographies as well as eight pages of family photographs surveying the faces in these photos of ms shields s sharply drawn characters , the reader naturally wonders are these real people or the madeup kind \? the question soon becomes irrelevant indeed , the novel willfully smudges the already blurred distinctions between fact and fiction when we say a thing or an event is real , never mind how suspect it sounds , we honor it , writes one of ms shields s several diarists but when a thing is made up regardless of how true and just it seems we turn up our noses that s the age we live in the documentary age so the novelist inserts her tongue deeply into her cheek and documents everything but unlike the historian , who must cling to the enameled outer layer of reality , ms shields plunges into the interior life of her characters with all the ferocity of a major novelist as her readers , we are allowed to peer into the hearts of daisy flett and her family with gaudy indiscretion , and this voyeurism is at times unsettling humankind , as t s eliot noted , cannot bear very much reality poor daisy , our hapless flower , arrives in this world in the least hospitable of circumstances her mother , the absurdly fat mercy stone , expires at the moment of daisy s birth before she does , however , there is plenty of time for ms shields to offer a startling portrait of the erotic life of mercy and her uxorious husband , cuyler goodwill he is a stone mason \( all puns are probably intentional \) whose creative energies were focused on his profession until he was 26 , when he stunned the small manitoba community \( and himself \) by marrying an obese orphan he revels in mercy s vast regions of pink flesh he is not repelled by the trembling generosity of her arms and thighs and breasts , not at all he wants to bury himself in her exalting abundance , as though , deprived all his life of flesh , he will now never get enough he knows that without the comfort of mercy stone s lavish body he would never have learned to feel the reality of the world or understand the particularities of sense and reflection that others have taken as their right here , as in her previous fiction , ms shields writes with an almost painfully attuned ear for the nuances of language and the way they attach to feelings and probe the most delicate layers of human consciousness her words ring like stones in a brook , chilled and perfected the syntax rushes like water , tumbling with the slight forward tilt that makes for narrative the reader is caught in whirlpools and eddies , swirled , then launched farther downstream after her mother s death , daisy is adopted by a neighbor , clarentine flett , who is about to leave her husband , magnus , a dour immigrant from the orkney islands clarentine moves with the infant daisy to live with her son barker in winnipeg , where a cozy family group is established barker becomes one of the major figures in daisy s life guardian , then after a lapse of decades husband a botanist , he is obsessed with the western lady sslipper , genus cypripedium , thus sublimating his most primitive urges the intensity of his gaze on this particular organism summons other complex longings , and botanical metaphors abound as the author lets one narrative strand lengthen and twine with others cuyler goodwill eventually flees canada and the memory of his poor dead mercy to bloomington , ind , where his talents as a stone cutter are in demand he becomes a pillar of the community and a moderately wealthy man the course of his life is summarized by his daughter in his 20 s he was a captive of eros , in his 30 s he belonged to god , and , still later , to art now , in his 50 s , he champions commerce he is eloquent if somewhat voluble , given to saying things like , the miracle of stone is that a rigid , inert mass can be lifted out of the ground and given wings we follow his life tangentially through his daughter s eyes , right up to the splendid scene of his death beside a lake in spring as he lies on a patch of indiana grass like a window screen about to be rinsed off by the garden hose , he comes to a lovely sense of his place in the scheme of creation in a touching moment , he fights through the gauze of a failing memory to recall the name of his beloved mercy , at last finding it ah , mercy , he says to himself mercy , hold me in your soft arms , cover me with your body , keep me warm
microsoft art gallery the collection of the national gallery , london cdrom redmond , wash microsoft corporation 7995 it s a familiar innercity scene a queue of youngsters jostling for a place at glowing consoles , bright colors flashing as players punch the touchsensitive screens , a tussle for possession each time a computer is vacated in the narrow , overcrowded space this is no arcade , however , but a small room tucked between restaurant and cloakrooms in the new wing of the national gallery in london the micro gallery , with 12 macintosh computer screens displaying an interactive hypertext catalogue of the entire national gallery collection , more than 2 , 000 digitized pictures visible in glorious color at the touch of a finger the micro allows visitors to browse the museum s holdings , select 10 paintings , then print an itinerary through the museum to locate them easily a jabbing finger can leap from cezanne to pollaiuolo , from caravaggio to titian , from cologne in 1525 to paris in 1850 , from selfportraits to nudes the viewer navigates through several ways of organizing the collection artists' lives , historical atlas , picture types , general reference and so

the correct spanish pronunciation touch velazquez and the screen responds with several pages of velazquez s paintings at the national touch one of those and no wonder the daily queue gets impatient there s now a 20minute time limit on users when the micro gallery first opened in 1991 i asked , in halfhope , whether the system could be installed on the university of kent campus they laughed , politely passing through london last december i again pleaded , jokingly , that i wanted to take the micro gallery home as my christmas present no problem , sir , they said it s in the bookshop 45 the cdrom i bought looks like any other compact disk , a slip of silver five inches across it requires , of course , a computer with cdrom \( computer disk readonly memory \) drive , preferably sound speakers and , as always , the more memory the better there are versions for both windows and mac a touch screen is n't necessary \( clicking on a mouse does the job \) though this program , above all , justifies a highresolution color monitor i ran it happily , however , on a modest ibm machine with a standard screen installation took seconds , and i finally had the whole national gallery on my desk or rather , i had the micro gallery in the real national i could go from the computer screen to the paintings themselves sitting in my study i have no time restriction i can explore the full ramifications of this extraordinary labyrinth of vivid color images , soberly authoritative biographies , history , commentary and glossary i can browse through a million words , construct a continuous slide show of every painting , gaze for however long i like at my favorites , discover works and artists i have n't registered before i am in danger of never reemerging , even for next christmas nevertheless , a digital depiction of a duccio altarpiece is very different from standing in front of the object itself , of course though that too , as walter benjamin argued , is a profoundly different act from taking part in the religious ritual that originally gave altarpieces their meaning through successive means of reproduction , from engravings to postcards , from photographs to textbooks , from television programs to laser disks , several generations have learned to approach art as a domain of cultural information , reserving the experience itself for an actual visit to a gallery only there , often , they find a disappointment the desired aura seems absent and arthistorical knowledge an unfulfilling substitute the work itself can seem just another reproduction wellstocked bookstores and increasingly sophisticated multimedia presentations within the galleries themselves reinforce this ambivalent attitude the micro gallery and microsoft s digital version of it are shaped by this complex tendency though i ca n't use the cdrom to plan a selfguided tour of the actual gallery \( that device is omitted from this version \) , a general find facility can quickly construct a personal study agenda to search out all instances of stgeorgeandthedragon paintings or examine systematically the iconography of lilies the disk also includes some worthy educational animations , showing by overlaid diagrams how a painting is composed or how perspective is created the best of these nicely clarifies the necktwisting sidelong viewpoint required to reveal that weirdly skewed skull in the foreground of holbein s ambassadors the four guided tours of the gallery included in the program are , however , somewhat disappointing they merely reassemble existing pages , and in any updated or new edition they need to be redesigned from scratch
ooooh ! the shout of happy surprise was so loud that heads popped up across the room , searching for its source a seafood cocktail had just been placed in front of a small , grayhaired woman as she looked down , her face went pink with pleasure , taking on the excited air of a small child who has been given a cake ablaze with birthday candles the appetizer actually looked more like a party hat than a cake , a colorful confection of shrimp , mussels and scallops loopily arranged in a martini glass amid a bouquet of carrots , asparagus and green beans rings of fried potatoes were tossed casually about it was the giddiest plate of food i have ever seen the food at symphony cafe looks so fanciful it is hard to believe it is actually good to eat just take a bite these careful constructions taste as lively as they look the seafood in that cocktail is fresh and flavorful , anchored in an ocean of tangy lemon mayonnaise the vegetables contribute color and crunch it is a totally satisfying way to begin a meal order a plate of tomatoes and haricots verts and out comes a geometric arrangement of foods that is anything but your standard salad deep crimson tomatoes and bright green beans are set off by pale slices of endive bits of marinated red onions sparkle in bright basil oil a thin round of dried tomato perches nervously on top like a butterfly about to take flight it is lovely and original and tastes wonderful with the warm , crisply crusted goat cheese on the side the chef , neil murphy , took charge of the kitchen in the fall of 1993 his first menu was filled with robust fare , and he still makes an occasional concession to meat eaters there is an appealing calf s liver preparation on the lunch menu , and at night carnivores can be content with lamb tbone or sirloin steak but these days mr murphy seems to be devoting most of his energies to fish and vegetables the results are impressive a dinner appetizer of grilled endive and marinated artichokes is an ode to vegetables , a tangle of forceful flavors that embraces the sharpness of endive and the sweetness of roasted beets plain greens would not shine in such company , so mr murphy tosses a spicy watercress salad onto the plate ricotta ravioli are lovely in their basil broth still , the most forward flavors in the bowl are the grilled vegetables strewn across the top of the pasta with all those sweet grilled peppers , the ravioli turn out to be little more than pillows of texture even the club sandwich , made with chicken , tuna or salmon , is really a vegetable tour de force a mountain of grilled eggplant , zucchini and peppers is reinforced with lettuce to hold up the slices of bread the homemade ketchup on the side is so delicious it makes the mayonnaise superfluous i like the sandwiches made with chicken or tuna , but if they were not there i would not miss them what i would miss is that little pot of shoestring potatoes that comes with them mr murphy s soups are also delicious his thick chowder with potatoes , leeks , scallops and salmon tastes as if it s filled with cream it is not some days there is also a sweet , satisfying corn soup that tastes like the concentrated essence of summer one bowl would easily make a meal but mr murphy has yet to figure out how to make soup look like anything but liquid in a bowl , and presentation is such an important part of his cooking that the soups fade beside the other dishes surely the monkfish , which is so perfectly cooked it could pass for lobster , does not need to be served beneath a wild construction of potato chips but is n't it nice that it is \? the vegetable fettuccine with grilled shrimp would taste good no matter how it looked the shrimp are plump and juicy , served with an intense tomato jam with a vaguely indian flavor this dish needs no embellishment , but the crinkly disk of fried pasta balanced on the top adds a certain charm it is a seductive dish , and like almost everything at symphony cafe , far too large for one person especially a person trying to save room for dessert which any sensible person at symphony cafe will do the pastry chef , richard leach , is busy reinventing the final course , moving it beyond sugar , fruit and chocolate to some new and always surprising plateau his desserts are fabulous mr leach s edible sculptures embrace all the sensory possibilities of his ingredients color , texture , temperature one dessert , a combination of icy tangerine sorbet and subtle licorice root ice cream , is enclosed in walls of meringue and hidden beneath a veil of caramelized sugar all this crunch and crackle and creaminess sits in a cool citrus soup enlivened with tangy kaffir lime and soft bright bits of tangerine who could resist it \? i love the frozen lemon parfait , a combination of lemon ice and lemongrass sauce that would make any lemon lover ecstatic i am enamored of the fabulous cold rhubarb and banana soup that is served with a warm dish of caramelized banana gratin i am even taken with mr leach s more outre combinations , like the roasted pineapple tart with basil ice cream his assortment of sorbets and ice creams is also amazing it is just the thing to bring out the child in each of us mr leach s magnum opus is modestly called torte of bittersweet chocolate mousse i will not destroy the surprise by describing this little homage to chocolate i will advise you not to miss it with food this satisfying , it is hard not to notice that other aspects of the restaurant are not the service is pleasant , willing and slightly ditsy one day at lunch the waiter said solemnly , put your menus together in the middle of the table when you have made your decision so i 'll know you are ready to order still , the restaurant is getting busier , and each day the service gets snappier some day the waiters may even figure out how to number their orders so that the servers do n't arrive at the table asking , who gets what \?

washington , nov 30 the economy grew faster during the summer than had been previously estimated , pointing to a strong holiday shopping season , fresh government figures showed today total output of goods and services expanded at a 39 percent annual pace in the third quarter as business investment boomed in the face of progressively higher interest rates a month ago , the rise in gross domestic product for the julyseptember period was put at 34 percent this momentum is selfsustaining , said stephen s roach , a senior economist at morgan stanley company , noting that today s revision showed a bigger contribution from business investment and personal consumption and no longer any contribution from goods moving into inventory a buildup of inventories , which helped drive gdp during the first half of the year , typically represents a borrowing of activity from future periods when factories slow while stocks are pared inflation associated with the gdp accounts was revised slightly higher to 34 percent from 32 percent as gauged by the fixedweight index of domestic prices but neither economists nor the bond market expressed anxiety in its initial tally of corporate profits for the quarter , the commerce department said profits from current production had climbed 2 percent , or 107 billion while this was much less than the secondquarter surge of 75 percent , the earlier period benefited substantially from a rebound following the california earthquake in january firstquarter profits slumped 48 percent in a separate government report , a federal reserve revision showed american industry operating a bit further below inflationthreat levels than previously thought factories , mines and utilities ran at 846 percent of capacity during october still the highest since april 1989 instead of the 849 percent reported two weeks ago a utilization rate above 85 percent or so is considered in the danger area for accelerating inflation as part of scheduled revisions of capacity and production data , the fed said production was stronger in 1991 and 1992 than previously reported but slower in 1993 and 1994 the fed also raised capacity growth for 1991 , 1992 and 1993 but none of the changes significantly altered prospects for the economy , analysts said two other reports today , from corporate purchasing managers in two regions of the country , showed rising cost pressures similar to those found recently in other areas but which have yet to be much reflected at the consumer level or in wages purchasing managers in the chicago area reported that the pricespaid component of its index had jumped to 794 from 725 , while new york managers said the component there jumped to 77 from 70 , nearly twice the average rise in the three preceding months still , it was the surprisingly large upward revision of gdp that captured most of the attention today for analysts , the 39 percent annual rate of expansion confirmed economic strength they had suspected but the data also implied that vigorous growth would continue , and possibly accelerate , before higher interest rates take their toll on the economy in 1995 the numbers make me feel more confident about our 4 1 2 percent gdp forecast for the fourth quarter , said michelle c laughlin , economist at sanwa securities in new york the biggest upward revision was in fixed investment other than housing , which soared 112 billion , to a 144 percent rate of gain instead of the 7 percent initially estimated graph real economic growth tracks the annual rate of change in the gross domestic product , by quarter , seasonally adjusted , since 1990 \( source commerce department \)

orlando , fla when jim coleman took over as personnel director for the town government in the orlando suburb of longwood four years ago , he was alarmed to find that the cost of providing health care coverage for its 155 employees was rising by as much as 25 percent a year there was little he could do about it , though we really did n't have any bargaining power with the insurance companies that offered health care packages , mr coleman recalled some providers would n't even let us bid they were not not making any money off cities , so they did n't want our business then longwood joined the central florida health care coalition , a health purchasing alliance that enables employers both large and small in the orlando area to shop for health care coverage as a single entity the coalition had been created in the mid1980 s , entirely free of any government prodding or incentive , by corporate heavyweights like the walt disney company , general mills , tupperware and martin marietta in joining it , longwood got immediate results the first year , our rates were a little lower than the previous year , and we have had no premium increases in three years , mr coleman said we 've turned the clock back to pre1990 rates , and they have stayed there , saving longwood taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars lower costs , better care the city of longwood is hardly alone in welcoming the competition that the purchasing group , which represents more than 100 companies with over 500 , 000 employees and dependents , has brought to health care here at orlando regional medical center , the largest hospital in the area , administrators and doctors say efforts to meet the cost and quality standards that the coalition encourages have resulted not only in millions of dollars in savings but also in lower mortality and morbidity rates that reflect improved patient care there are already more than 100 similar health care purchasing alliances around the country , organizations that got the jump on president clinton s health care plan , which would require the creation of a vast national network of such alliances whether or not the president s plan is enacted indeed , whether or not congress enacts any health care legislation this year many of these privatesector health care initiatives have long since proved successful and none more so than the central florida health care coalition , one of the oldest and largest of them orlando is a pioneer in making health care more effective , so that all the actors in the system can get the best quality at the lowest cost , said sean sullivan , president of the national business coalition on health they offer a model that others are following because they have demonstrated results for the same reason , the coalition s operations have been closely studied by officials in tallahassee and even washington the state of florida s agency for health care administration acknowledges that its new system of governmentorganized purchasing alliances for businesses with 50 or fewer employees is inspired by orlando s example edward towey , a spokesman for the state agency , said the orlando coalition was a model for the rest of florida on at least two counts it s not only that they are pooling their buying power , he said equally important is the comprehensive collection of data , which lets purchasers see what kind of value they are getting for their money resistance , but not for long the coalition was born nearly a decade ago out of the dissatisfaction of employeebenefits managers at several of the largest companies in the orlando area health care costs here were rising by doubledigit percentages each year , and the benefits managers , who had begun to analyze hospital bills , could find no correlation between cost and quality at first , doctors and hospitals resisted many of the providers did n't even see a reason to talk with us , said dennis loney , manager of employee benefits for disney , whose 34 , 000 workers here make it the largest member of the coalition and some of those who did talk with us refused to talk about quality but the coalition plunged ahead anyway and as its members looked systematically at hospital records , many questions arose why , for example , were so many patients being held for observation over weekends , a practice so routine that monday was the no 1 day for discharge \? when the coalition simply pointed out that circumstance , administrators and doctors quickly made adjustments in their procedures over time , the coalition and hospitals learned that by sharing information and pinpointing areas for imrovement performance , all sides could benefit it s not a threatening or accusatory relationship , mr loney said of the coalition s dealings with hospitals here all we do is share the data and express a concern , and let them do the rest by the late 1980 s , new tools were available , and the coalition was quick to take advantage of them any health care provider who wished to do business with the coalition was required to install a national computerized datagathering system developed by mediqual , a company based in worcester , mass , to track every piece of information that went onto a patient s chart during a hospital stay
here is a critical look at a sampling of new york city s parks , from the vast and famous lawns of central and prospect parks to a small and struggling playground in a hard patch of bedfordstuyvesant manhattan central park the jewel in the crown this 840acre park , of almost transcendental importance to new yorkers , is often described as the first example of a deliberately planned urban park in america today , it is like an engine gathering steam , a model for the publicprivate partnership many hope will save the city s parks lord chatham s famous declaration that parks are the lungs of london , might have been written for central park , a swath of green where some 15 million people come to breathe each year they come as individuals to sit on grass and benches , or to be part of any number of events , from the new york marathon to shakespeare in the park it was just two decades ago , as new york lay mired in a fiscal straitjacket , that central park appeared to be dying erosion was gnawing away at the park s increasingly brown skin , and floods were commonplace garbage was picked up , but all other maintenance had virtually stopped even the 36 famed stone arches and bridges none identical were falling apart in truth , while the overall parks department work force was cut 23 percent during the fiscal crisis , compared with an average of 13 percent in other city agencies , the deterioration of central park was not as serious as at other , less famous parks still , central park was central park , and in 1979 , mayor edward i koch named the park s most vocal advocate , elizabeth barlow rogers , the first administrator of a city park there was no salary and no budget mr koch explained , you know something about fund raising as it turned out , people were chomping at the bit to save the park in its first 10 years , the conservancy raised more than 50 million , a pace that seems downright laggardly compared with its success so far in the 1990 s to whit , richard gilder , a conservancy trustee , offered the group a 17 million gift , on the condition it raise 17 million from other donors , and that the city contribute 17 million the city has said yes this is not to say everything is perfect , although ms rogers beams with pleasure about the renovation of the longneglected northern end of the park , harlem meer cedar hill , where dogs run , needs to be redone ball fields are badly compacted , and need major drainage repairs meadows need to be replanted paths need repair but the fact is that central park has been able to weather a cut in its maintenance staff to 91 from 138 what we 've built here is a system that will insure there s a future for the park , ms rogers said riverside park progress , bit by bit henry hudson described this riverside ribbon of green as very pleasant , very high and bold well , you ca n't change that but in recent years , the park has grown dirtier , a bit more menacing homeless people make homes in bushes , and two weeks ago , a woman was attacked in the park and defended herself with an ice pick there has also been an insidious dialectic at work when robert moses redid the park in the 1930 s , he spent far less money on the northern part than on the south despite several current capital projects to perk up the north , this perception and some of the reality persists but even as the park s workforce has fallen from 54 to 24 over the last five years , new procedures have helped to lessen the sting one reform was to cut back shrubs in which people could live , an action that has saved three staff hours a day in the middle section of the park other changes have included asking the various city council members representing sections adjoining the park to allocate money from their portion of the city s capital budget for specific projects other money comes from the riverside park fund and in dribs and drabs from the city people also pay for their own projects for example , except for one summer attendant , the tennis courts at 95th street are now totally maintained and operated by the riverside clay tennis association the 91st street playground is similar parents raised 120 , 000 and councilwoman ronnie eldridge threw in 70 , 000 that was enough to hire a landscape architect and begin the job the first step was to enlarge the pits around the dying pin oaks then , the inner part of the playground whimsical hippopotamus statues that spray water was installed other phases will be done as more money is raised the other day , diane englander , a business consultant who lives at 90th street and riverside drive , was at the playground with her son it s getting nicer , she said of the park she loves there are more flowers , more trees , more improvements to the playground high bridge park a perennial problem high on the cliffs overlooking the harlem river and the bronx , high bridge park has long been an example of the trials of maintaining a park that is tremendously important to its neighborhood but a long way , physically and economically , from city hall in the mid80 s , mr stern had ordered a huge cleanup of the park dozens of abandoned cars , hundreds of tires , refrigerators , several dead dogs and a human body were found amid the tangled brush

new information in a regulatory filing about kohlberg , kravis , roberts company s proposed acquisition of borden inc shows that a financial adviser to borden had a 10 million incentive to complete the deal with kohlberg , kravis at the same time another suitor was trying to meet with the borden board the filing with the securities and exchange commission also suggests that the board did not seek counsel from its two financial advisers about the legal and legislative liabilities of tobacco when considering the proposed swap of kohlberg , kravis s rjr nabisco stock for borden and the filing raises questions about the amount of information disclosed in a borden letter to its shareholders on oct 28 about the terms of the deal in september , after borden agreed to be acquired for 2

represented the best deal for stockholders according to an amended exchange statement filed by rjr nabisco with the sec last wednesday , borden agreed on sept 13 to pay lazard freres , the adviser to the borden board , 3 million upon the execution of the agreement to merge with the rjr nabisco holdings corporation and an additional 7 million if kkr and its affiliates acquire at least 501 percent of the outstanding borden shares in addition , in an accord signed on sept 22 , borden agreed to pay cs first boston , the financial adviser to the borden management , a fee of 3 million when an exchange offer began and 7 million if kohlberg , kravis acquired at least 51 percent of the outstanding borden shares , the filing says the federal documents show that the agreement for the 10 million incentive for lazard , freres was signed before the borden board agreed to meet with another suitor for the company , paul b kazarian that occurred during the time when lazard , freres had been hired to give objective advice to the board about alternatives to the kohlberg , kravis deal when mr kazarian was permitted to meet with borden s executives , on sept 21 , representatives of lazard , freres and cs first boston attended the meeting subsequently mr kazarian made a suggestion that borden allow its shareholders to vote on an alternative buyout proposal that mr kazarian would offer on sept 23 , frank j tasco , chairman of borden , wrote mr kazarian to say that mr kazarian had failed to provide information about his ability to finance the transaction the definitive agreement with kohlberg , kravis was signed that day mr kazarian , a former chief executive of the sunbeamoster company with experience in turning around consumer products companies , has said he will offer a borden bid , but none has been forthcoming he declined to comment yesterday the sec filing says that from time to time , in the past , lazard freres has represented kkr and received customary fees therefore , something that lazard has acknowledged executives from lazard freres have also said that they believed the deal with kohlberg , kravis represented the best interests of borden s shareholders everything that appears in our financial agreement with borden totally conforms to industry standards and practices , said louis perlmutter , a general partner at lazard freres there was absolutely no conflict of interest another industry executive with knowledge of the lazard freres deal with borden said that it represented a standard success fee arrangement and that the company would have also received a fee if a third party , like mr kazarian , had come to terms with borden these provisions were not disclosed in the sec filing though cs first boston signed its incentive agreement with borden two days after the meeting with mr kazarian , some investors presume that it was discussed and reviewed by lawyers while cs first boston was advising borden about the viability of mr kazarian s proposal a spokeswoman for cs first boston said she could not comment on the compensation agreement spokesmen for rjr nabisco and kohlberg , kravis , declined to comment , as did mr tasco and members of the borden board in september , kohlberg , kravis , a specialist in leveraged buyouts , committed itself to buy borden stock in a swap for 2 billion of its holdings in rjr nabisco the deal was valued at 1425 for each borden share in a separate transaction , rjr tentatively agreed to buy 20 percent , or 500 million worth , of the borden shares from kohlberg , kravis but in early november , rjr nabisco , which is based in new york and makes camel cigarettes and snackwell s cookies , backed out of the preliminary agreement to buy 20 percent of the stock of borden on the same day , rjr announced a plan to begin separating its food operations from its tobacco business it intends to sell 19 percent of its nabisco foods unit in an initial public offering that could raise as much as 1 billion , which the company would use to pay down debt without the participation of rjr nabisco , kohlberg , kravis will be the sole owner of borden some borden shareholders have said they are disappointed not only that their company will not get 500 million of rjr stock , which could have been converted to cash , but also that borden will not have the expertise of the rjr board members and the company s experience with its successful food business in initial borden statements and news releases , the 500 million infusion from rjr nabisco was presented as an important part of the kohlberg , kravis plan analysts , too , said the 500 million was an aid to the plans of kohlberg , kravis , because it could be used to pay down debt the sec filing on wednesday supplies the date that rjr decided to pull out of the borden deal oct 25 however , a subsequent letter from mr tasco to borden shareholders , dated on oct 28 , describing the deal , did not mention the collapse of the plan to have rjr buy 20 percent of borden s stock the deal was announced on oct 31 the oct 28 letter to shareholders was a very short letter put out for one reason to assure shareholders that they were not forgotten and would be receiving a full package of information , said nicholas r iammartino , a spokesman for borden it was not intended to give all the substantive details some investors , who spoke on condition of anonymity , expressed surprise at another paragraph in wednesday s sec document according to the filing , in evaluating the proposed acquisition by kohlberg , kravis using rjr stock , the borden board said issues like the impact of future tobacco liability litigation and governmental regulation were unknowable and could be devastating with respect to the value of the rjr common stock but , the filing said , the board believed that since neither of its financial advisers had the expertise to evaluate such future liabilities , it was acceptable to exclude such issues from the financial advisers' opinions how could the board possibly exclude the issue of tobacco liability , which is the single largest risk factor to rjr stock \? asked one investor , who spoke on condition of anonymity on friday , kohlberg , kravis cleared another regulatory hurdle , when the federal trade commission said it had no objection to the borden purchase , implying that there were no antitrust implications to the deal the deal still must pass scrutiny by the sec photo frank j tasco , borden chairman \( borden inc \) \( pg d8 \)
san francisco , oct 12 shares of the software company intuit inc rose for the second consecutive day today , at least in part on a published rumor that the company might be acquired by the microsoft corporation both companies declined to comment intuit is the producer of quicken , the leading personal finance software program , which is used for balancing checkbooks , tracking investments and analyzing loans microsoft produces microsoft money , which has not made much of a dent in quicken sales , despite collaborative agreements with several large banks that link the program to their personalcomputer home banking services intuit shares closed today at 47 , up 2375 in nasdaq trading , after moving up 1875 in heavy volume on tuesday microsoft shares rose 438 cents today to close at 5625 the rumor arose monday in notes from the field , a silicon valley gossip column in the trade magazine infoworld further fueling the rumors was the abrupt cancellation tuesday of a planned link between microsoft money and chase manhattan s home banking services , which was scheduled to be announced this week neither company would comment on why the announcement was canceled some industry analysts said that investors might see a link between the infoworld column and the microsoftchase manhattan cancelation , causing them to bid up intuit s stock while microsoft could easily afford to buy intuit , which has a market value of 5605 million based on today s closing price , analysts were skeptical that such a deal was in the works although intuit has broadened its product line , in part through internal development , and in part through the acquisition last year of chipsoft , which produced tax software , none of these other products is nearly as successful as quicken and while microsoft has shown a greater willingness to acquire companies recently , its usual practice is to stick with its own products , even when they are slow starters one analyst saw intuit s stock movement as based less on rumors and more on the company s fundamentals david readerman , an analyst with unterberg harris , noted that intuit s president , scott cook , spoke today at an industry conference people like the intuit story because he s pushing into financial planning now , probably talking about some linkups with insurance companies , mr readerman said there is n't much competition there intuit is shipping a new enhanced version of quicken this week that includes additional financial planning assistance on a multimedia cdrom the disk includes video clips of jane bryant quinn , a financial columnist for newsweek , and marshall loeb , the former editor of fortune and money magazines , offering advice on investment strategies , as well as data on various mutual funds mr cook , intuit s chairman , has said the company will expand its financial planning offerings graph rebound tracks daily closing stock prices of intuit inc since the beginning of the year \( source datastream \)
as the tide of didactic , agendadriven art begins to recede , and the complex , personal voice comes to the fore , an artist like joan snyder is starting to get the attention she deserves now in her mid50 s , she has been exhibiting for 25 years , though only fairly recently have midcareer laurels begun to be thrown in her direction one of them took the form of a survey titled joan snyder works with paper , which opened at the allentown museum in pennsylvania last fall and now appears , in a radically slimmeddown version , at hirschl adler modern actually , slimmeddown understates the case of the 50odd paintings and prints at allentown , only 15 appear here , packed into a small , difficult space under the circumstances , it is no surprise that the work , which spans two decades , does n't get a chance to build and interact the way it can when seen in bulk and that her astonishingly versatile use of paper as a medium is incompletely explored yet none of this matters all that much force of numbers has never really been important in ms snyder s case each of her works seems to exist as a kind of selfcontained emotional compression chamber , the record and relic of a psychic event and she has never respected distinctions between socalled major and minor mediums the variation on the standard works on paper moniker in the show s title points up the fact that in her collagist approach , paint and ink , canvas and paper , words and images all jostle together this results in monotypes that can be as richly textured as many another artists' paintings and paintings that have the intimacy of diary entries all these features are evident in the mixedmedia triptych titled small symphony for women \( 1974 \) in the left panel , ivorycolored paper laid over canvas suggests a notebook page filled with diagrams and words handwritten in pencil in one longish passage the writer questions why a particular college faculty persists in hiring so few women nearby the simple resonant phrases women hunger , i hunger , and blacked out as if in a gesture of selfcensorship i wanted her appear the work s central panel is slathered with thick , choppy paint and incised with a childlike drawing of a house and sun , while the right holds a deliberately painted , rather ponderous geometric abstraction incorporating pigment the color of dried blood like much of ms snyder s work , small symphony for women has a strong sense of narrative pull , in this case from troubled selfinquiry to a rupture with domestic stability , to a stoically balanced resolution in art itself this image of struggle is a reminder that ms snyder was part of a pioneer generation of feminist artists , and her particular contribution lies in a consistent assertion straight through the cool conceptualism of the 1970 s and the programmatic neoexpressionism of the 80 s of the validity of an individual expressive content it is a line that continues , much politicized , in the work of younger artists as diverse as sue williams and suzanne mcclelland it is memorably embodied in the small , distraught oh marie \( 1984 \) at hirschl adler , a mixedmediaonwood piece made after the breakup of ms snyder s marriage the upper portion is filled with a pencilscrawled copy of a letter from a friend who consoles the artist by recalling her own feelings of devastation at the death of a daughter crowding the words is the roof of a big crimsonsmeared , sticklike house , partly obscured by a screaming face in thick impasto and a quotation from virgil things have tears and we know suffering that stutters repeatedly up and down the surface not everything in the show operates at this pitch of ferocity , though a charge of tension runs through even more benign pieces in god bless the child \( 1980 \) a large horizontally extended greek cross is collaged entirely from children s drawings that have been pasted on stretched canvas the pinks and yellows look sweet enough , but here and there the cross is painted with sinister black windowlike slits and angry tangles of crayon strokes the show s surprises , though , are the monotypes , especially the recent ones made with washy lithographic inks and oil stick the delicacy that underlies all of this artist s work but that sometimes gets buried in sheer accumulations of matter surfaces here in the cloud of flecked paint imposed over a springy grid in brooklyn bean field \( 1991 \) and in the churning orbits of yellow and purple surrounded by tiny red blossoms in free to explore every corner of your imagination \( 1990 \) that sense of quest , of exploring emotions , relationships and roles not to mention unlikely materials is just what ms snyder s work movingly conveys it would be good to see the trajectory of her career traced in full \( a retrospective of paintings set to open this week at brandeis university will head for the parrish art museum in southampton , li , this summer \) but even the little bit seen in this show is better than nothing , and in the case of this artist s work , a little bit can be a great deal joan snyder works with paper remains at hirschl adler modern , 21 east 70th street ,

it s an average saturday night in america , circa 1984 a 15yearold girl stands in the back of a rock club she s watching a local band four guys playing punk rock , screaming about how much they hate the government and how much they love beer a knot of boys from the girl s high school tightens at the front of the stage bored , she hums a pretenders song , wishing she could sing as well as chrissie hynde or at least look as gorgeous as blondie s debbie harry she has n't heard of the raincoats or the slits , the bands that turned london s rock scene feminist for a moment in the late 1970 s she admires tina weymouth , talking heads' bass player still she ca n't imagine being the one female playing with three men , even if she could date one , like tina did the drummer chris franz besides , none of the guys in her local scene really even talk to her , much less ask if she 'd like to join a band switch to 1994 another 15yearold girl , born in the same slice of america , stands in the back of a similar club even the music assailing her ears does n't seem to have aged much but for this girl , everything s different the band on stage is half male , half female in a farfromperfect voice , the singer wails about being treated like a doll by men or whispers a gleeful tale of her own sexual desires the young fan smiles she loves this band , as she does belly , the breeders , hole , liz phair , l7 all the glorious female rockers she discovered watching television or reading the mainstream music press she wishes there were more bands like these to adore and emulate she s not too worried , though this afternoon , she bought her very own drum kit the band starts playing her favorite song unafraid of the mosh pit , which itself is now half male and half female , she runs toward the front of the stage , clambers up and dives into her girlfriends' upheld arms who would have thought rockandroll , that sexcrazed celebration of male bravado , which for so long had relegated most women to the role of backup singer , groupie , wife or fan , would eventually change so much under the influence of women \? but it s happening rock made by women comes in more flavors than ever before , and new , exciting artists just keep emerging what many first called a trend is now reshaping the music s norms the most obvious evidence is hype the women in rock article has become its own journalistic subgenre , appearing in nearly every major and minor publication , while record companies are signing female artists by the bushel and quickly packaging them as the next postfeminist phenomenon even a 1993 advertisement for virginia slims cigarettes pictured a leatherwearing babe wielding a guitar and although female artists grow huffy at being lumped together , they know they now receive the kind of attention that only the rare female legend \( usually a singer , usually beautiful and exceptionally talented \) earned in earlier times as offended artists and jaded critics incessantly point out , the presence of women in rock has been surprising the unobservant virtually since the music was invented and in 1994 , some kind of critical mass has been reached one critic in lincoln , neb , declared this year that 40 percent of the musicians on his local scene were women , and his remark seems to correspond to communities nationwide the sheer number of female artists makes generalizations about them difficult , if not ridiculous , and the stars among them are talented enough to be utterly distinct even if rock s current pantheon of strong , frank women were to fade , their arrival signals serious change in the landscape where this music is created and shared and those changes seem permanent , because rock s old rules simply will not work once they have been accomplished in earlier eras , because most rock performers were men and their subject was love , women were placed in the position of the love object or sex object women existed to light men s fires today s female rock stars offer a different vision to fans that of a woman setting a spark to herself even if desire for a man is articulated , the subtext is almost always the joy and liberation found in a woman s own act of expression although liz phair , the darling of alternative rock , has gained notoriety for writing offcolor lyrics , her songs actually offer less titillation than revelation they detail the thought processes of a real woman who , yes , loves sex but also wants to be treated fairly and to gain a place in the world i do n't need a support system , she tells her boyfriend in one song from her new album , whipsmart , while in another she admits her ambivalence about the spotlight thrust on her it feels like i 've got something to prove , but in some ways it s just something to do the ambiguities of ms phair s songs capture the predicament of ambitious women , informed by society that they must either achieve spectacular success or retreat it s ms phair s own problem , and one that many of her female fans also must confront whipsmart offers them a view they do n't have to strain to identify with
gainesville , fla , oct 10 when a pass by terry dean was intercepted late in the second quarter saturday against louisiana state , florida coach steve spurrier ripped off his sun visor and threw it spurrier s animated dissatisfaction with his fifthyear senior quarterback was nothing new , and it came even though dean rolled up 217 passing yards and one touchdown in a 4218 victory over lsu dean s reaction \? none that s just the way he is , dean said today you 've just got to accept it last year i had a lot of resistance to that , and i think i brought myself down , worrying about things that i really should n't have dean , who admitted he suffered through an off day against lsu , paused and then spoke as if he had found the key to his comeback season i just kind of made up my mind i was n't gonna let it bother me any more whatever the reason , dean has florida at 50 , ranked no 1 in the two major polls and no 7 in the new york times computer he has thrown for 1 , 284 yards and 18 touchdowns , and the gators are averaging 504 points a game heading into saturday s showdown here against unbeaten auburn spurrier , a former florida quarterback and heisman trophy winner , reacted a little defensively when asked if he is unconsciously putting more pressure on dean i coach terry just like i coached shane matthews , all of those quarterbacks at duke , john reaves at the bandits , spurrier said on sunday , referring to head coaching stops in college and with tampa bay of the shortlived united states football league my track record with quarterbacks is pretty decent i do n't see why i should change the way i coach quarterbacks the prospect of facing auburn figures to put even more pressure on dean as well as challenge the gators' claim to no 1 florida s top offensive lineman , left tackle jason odom , will miss the game , as will no 2 tailback elijah williams , who has a sprained ankle that leaves florida with one healthy tailback , freshman fred taylor , who ran for 136 yards against lsu the only problem here is , taylor has asthma if i break a long run , the asthma is gonna kill me , taylor said that means dean will have to lead the way newly married and deeply religious , the 22yearold said he has found the inner peace to be successful this season a year ago , he started six games , sharing the job with danny wuerffel there are other things in my life more important than football , dean said i wo n't let football control my life any more and i realize now that i got down on myself last year more than i should have so the difference from a year ago is like night and day i just feel a lot more confident than i ever have maybe i did n't show it against lsu , but i feel a lot more focus on the field last year if i had played the way i did against lsu , i would have gotten really rattled but this time i hung my head in there and i did n't let anything bother me i made some bad throws , but i kept throwing i'm just not gonna worry about throwing an interception or getting pulled dean threw up his hands when asked about auburn coach terry bowden s wisecrack last year , bowden said that the southeastern conference title game between florida and alabama was a battle of losers , inasmuch as auburn had beaten both i do n't want to get in the middle of that , dean said but i will say this whatever he might have said , we do n't need any other motivation to beat those guys this is a huge rivalry
washington , dec 27 early last month , webster l hubbell traveled to arkansas to tell a few old friends that the embezzlement charges he had denied so vehemently for so long were actually true but even now , three weeks after the former associate attorney general stood up in court to plead guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his former law firm , friends and former colleagues here and in little rock , ark , are still wrestling with some mysteries why did he steal \? where did the money go \? and how can they square the man they knew a presidential confidant , whom even opponents called a man of integrity with the sloppy , almost brazen thefts he has admitted \? nearly nine months into the case , even the investigators who have pored over his records and finances remain uncertain about his motive and how much he actually stole in pleading guilty to tax evasion and mail fraud , mr hubbell admitted to stealing at least 394 , 000 over four years , a sum that effectively doubled his aftertax income his average income from the rose law firm during his final years there was 120 , 000 to 150 , 000 before taxes , associates said at the same time , he built up substantial debts by 1993 , when he arrived in washington , he had credit card debts of 66 , 000 , car loans of 60 , 000 , a 50 , 000 unsecured loan he had recently taken out and his mortgage had nearly doubled to 400 , 000 through several refinancings he had negotiated over the last decade those debts , which in retrospect look like clues to financial distress , emerged last year during his confirmation proceedings to become associate attorney general but at the time , and in the absence of other warning signs , investigators from the federal bureau of investigation and the senate judiciary committee did not regard them as serious enough to warrant an inquiry even closest friends saw few clear signs and many of his closest friends , interviewed in recent days , say that even in retrospect they can think of few signs that he had lived extravagantly instead , they recollect what could be a piece of the puzzle here or there four children in private schools , family vacations and shopping sprees in outlining the charges against mr hubbell , prosecutors mentioned only a few expenses credit card bills at a women s clothing store in little rock and at an unidentified fur company , and clothing purchases in dallas through his lawyer , john nields , mr hubbell declined to comment about his motives or his crime by all outward appearances , mr hubbell was not a big spender he wore rumpled suits and took the subway to work in washington , where he still lives his wife did not wear fancy dresses or extravagant jewelry , and often when the couple invited friends over for dinner , it would be a potluck affair friends say he routinely had no cash in his wallet and would borrow change for sundries while he regularly played golf and would go with friends on outings to courses in florida and at hilton head , sc , he played out of the same golf bag for years friends say he was not a gambler he and his wife would also take take annual winter vacations in the caribbean or in mexico with other friends , but they were hardly exorbitant trips in interviews , little rock shopkeepers describe the hubbells as good customers , but hardly given to spending binges still , his closest friends in little rock say they have come to believe that he stole to maintain his life style , which was not particularly lavish for a top partner at one of the most prominent law firms in the south some recall a man generous to a fault one close friend recalled seeing him shake his head in disbelief when his wife and children returned to little rock from dallas with a large pile of bills and clothes from their annual shopping spree in a perverse paradox , what did him in was his generosity to his family , theorized a friend who has known him for decades it was his own selfinflicted pressure to give his family and children anything they wanted web is one of the most generous people you will ever know the nature of his scheme suggests that mr hubbell was either desperate or confident he would never be caught for instance , he altered time records of his partners , said a lawyer involved in the investigation , a move that could easily be detected prosecutors say he also listed bogus expenses , including depositions that were in fact never taken , a step that could easily be discovered mr hubbell has acknowledged that on more than 400 instances over four years , he would either bill a client or his firm for expenses and then draw the firm s checks to pay off one of the 10 mastercard , visa and american express cards that had personal charges on them many false expenses were for less than 1 , 000 , and under the firm s bookkeeping practices , they did not require a second partner to sign the disbursement checks some evidence has surfaced to suggest that mr hubbell was stealing from his firm even before 1989 , although investigators have had a hard time tracking the earlier period because credit card companies do not keep records going back that far still , one client was told by the rose firm that personal expenses charged on mr hubbell s credit card were listed on a bill earlier than 1989 as outofpocket expenses incurred by the firm for the client months of denials and countercharges
philadelphia only a short time ago , it seemed as if the dossier on matisse had been closed tens of thousands of people had crowded into the great matisse retrospective organized by john elderfield at the museum of modern art in new york by the end of their visit they were seduced , sated , uplifted and knocked flat what more could there be to see , or to say \? plenty , is the answer to prove it , you have only to go to the philadelphia museum of art , where the matisse mural of 193233 from the barnes collection is now on view that this majestic achievement should be there at all is a historic reversal of the famously bad relations that had prevailed between the barnes collection and the philadelphia museum during the lifetime of dr albert barnes \( barnes loathed the museum and amused himself by hiring people to heckle its exemplary director , fiske kimball , when he gave a public lecture \) so far from recycling hackneyed material that goes nowhere in particular , the philadelphia show is a sharpfocus affair that has just one point and sticks to it everything in it has to do with matisse and the dance , and everything in it , with one conspicuous exception , dates from 1931 to 1933 in ways made clear by the art historian jack flam , the initial point of departure for the barnes mural was the great matisse of 1909 called dance i with a collegial generosity not always met with where major loans are in question , the museum of modern art has lent dance i to the philadelphia show thereafter , from 1931 to 1933 , you are right in there with matisse , almost from day to day , while he tussles with a difficult location , an even more difficult patron and the determination to outdo and outgrow his former self the barnes mural is in itself a colossal experience , and all the more so for being shown for the first time at a height that really suits it to a degree that is impossible at the barnes , we can almost mingle with the tumultuous tumblers who leap and prance across a space that is nearly 12 feet high at its highest point and almost 48 feet wide there is \( as mr flam has suggested \) a moderndance element in the barnes mural far from looking dated , matisse s tumblers foreshadow and validate our own day if their purposeful antics remind one of anything , it is the computergenerated interaction of the dancers in merce cunningham s recent crwdspcr it is with matisse as it is with late cunningham a new way of working led not to artifice but to the release of true feeling in this context , no student of matisse will wish to pass up the chance of seeing the many sketches for the barnes mural that are normally in the matisse museum in nice , france there are also some marvelous drawings of single figures , never before seen in this country , from the estate of pierre matisse and elsewhere no such confrontation has been brought about before , and it gives us what had seemed impossible a new notion of henri matisse this new matisse was a man of immense and contradictory complication newly into his 60 s , he was possessed both by high ambition and by an overwhelming anxiety barnes had given him a free hand with a particularly ungrateful site three lunettes , set between the top of tall windows and the roof of a gallery in which great paintings \( one of them by matisse himself \) were already hanging below the lunettes were separated by pendentives , or triangular pieces of vaulting , that came way down from the roof matisse could have broken down the allotted space into three nicely contrasted but nonetheless selfcontained images but in doing that he would simply have turned the space into yet another picture gallery , slung high under the roof and in rivalry with the easel pictures below what he devised instead was a single , freerunning dynamic image dancing figures would move in and out of the given spaces where another painter might have been balked by the pendentives , or by the repeated ovals of the area left available for painting , matisse robbed these problems of all their significance it is important to know that both lisette and henriette , his two favorite models in the 1920 s , had been trained as dancers also to be remembered is that although matisse liked pretty young women , he also liked mighty young women none was mightier , in that sense , than the one in the sculpture called back iv that he had finished not long before he got the barnes commission so it made sense for his amazonian acrobats to form up as giantesses who were far too tall to fit into the frame they denied that frame , ducked and dived all around it and went out of sight whenever the fancy took them heads and shoulders , hands , legs and feet all vanished from view at such times , powered by energies that would always get their way it was as if the gray stone walls of the barnes foundation had spawned human figures that they were unable to restrain as in the two other versions of the mural , both of which are now in the musee d'art moderne de la ville de paris , there are elements of both riot and orgy in the barnes version , matisse pared down the illustrative element but in the preliminary sketches in pencil , in oil and in gouache he gave his hand free play , with results that are as voluptuous as anything in 20thcentury art this is a show that excels both on an enormous scale and on a very small scale to move from one to the other and back again is an amazing experience , and one not likely to recur the show , matisse s dance the barnes foundation mural , runs through june 12 it will not travel photo the left lunette of henri matisse s huge dance mural in the barnes collection was set between the top of tall windows and the roof of a gallery \( the barnes

it s long been known as the fabulous invalid and the great white way , but we may have to start calling it six flags over broadway while there has always been a raffish , thrillseeking side to theatergoing , the distinction between broadway and a theme park grew decidedly narrower during the 199394 season it was n't just because the walt disney company came to town , commandeered the palace theater with the stage version of one of its biggest animated features , beauty and the beast , turned the lobby into a mammoth souvenir boutique and proclaimed its intentions of renovating a theater of its very own on 42d street nor was it just because the producers of grease ! painted the eugene o'neill theater shocking pink , scrawled some of the show s mindless lyrics on the facade and then , to complete a dubious effect , piped 1950 s rockandroll hits out onto the sidewalk still , as signs go , those were clear and unequivocal you bought your ticket , took your seat and went on a ride the seats just did n't move the season was woefully short on quality , although the 48th annual tony awards , broadcast from the gershwin theater tonight \( on cbs at 9 \) , will try to convince viewers otherwise it was , however , long on glitz , special effects , flashing lights and scenery outperforming the performers all in the service of the enduring american fallacy that bigger is , if not better , at least better for box office to a degree , that has always been so ziegfeld did n't forge a name by shaving corners , after all , and it has been more than a decade since cats launched the vogue for the megamusical \( which costs megabucks and , presumably , weighs a megaton \) still , it used to be that spectacle was only a part of what broadway offered its customers now it is very nearly everything , and the pressure to go for broke can be felt in the dramas and oneperson shows too that wonderful tennessee , brian friel s imperfect but questing play about three irish couples experiencing a collective middleaged crisis , was the first dramatic flop of the broadway season was sadly prophetic ireland s greatest living playwright was writing about the unslaked thirst we all have for the spiritual or , as one character defined it fumblingly what is beyond language the inexpressible the ineffable broadway is no longer particularly receptive to the ineffable the effable has become its specialty in the mid90 s in lieu of the ever more elusive theatrical magic , we get magic tricks , which are far easier to engineer at the end of beauty and the beast , the lifeless body of the beast \( terrence mann \) rises off the castle floor , spins in midair like a propeller and emerges from the ordeal as a suitably handsome prince understandably , everybody gasps , although it s merely the latest development in stage machinery that has already brought us helicopters lifting off and chandeliers crashing down leave it to ricky jay , the charming sleightofhand artist whose oneman show ricky jay and his 52 assistants was a runaway off broadway hit , to demonstrate that magic is not a trick it s the irresistibly beguiling patter surrounding the trick the mind has to be seduced before the eye can be amazed broadway seemed to get it backward this season as if to underscore the point , mr jay s 52 assistants were a deck of playing cards size and money do not necessarily preclude quality , of course the opening montage of carousel , the season s most artful musical revival , gives you the impression you 're 10 years old again and standing inside a kaleidoscope with each turn of the revolving stage , the director , nicholas hytner , alters the picture , until the gloom of a 19thcentury new england mill has been supplanted by the giddy , comehither colors of a traveling carnival ian macneil s surrealistic set for an inspector calls , which depicts the mansion of the wealthy birling family as a glittery doll house isolated in a cobblestone moor , puts j b priestley s socialist thriller on dazzlingly fresh footing and diana rigg s rigorously intelligent performance in the title role of medea certainly justifies the final coup de theatre , in which the rusted metal walls of the palace crash to the ground , leaving her triumphantly profiled against the racing clouds writing down to the wire , tony kushner successfully delivered perestroika , the brilliant concluding installment of angels in america , his epic examination of aids and an ailing land and the frontrunner to win tonight s tony for best play everything about this twopart work has proved large its emotions , its themes , its running time \( seven hours \) largest of all , though , is the compassion the playwright extends to each of his characters roy cohn , the drama s archfiend , included the production is not without its own plethora of special effects \( including an angel who somersaults in midflight \) , but the drama would probably be equally gripping on a bare stage to prosper in today s climate , however , angels in america , lauded to the skies , has to be an eyepopping event as well
to the editor re in cornell s student housing , boundaries are drawn with the oldest kind of division \( education page , april 20 \) i am a graduate of the agriculture and life college of cornell university , class of 1993 , and i had the privilege of living on campus my entire four years the first two were spent on west campus as a resident in the class of 1918 hall \( also called university hall 4 \) the second two were as a resident adviser in mary donlon hall on north campus as an incoming freshman , i valued enormously the diversity of oncampus housing there are housing options that allow one to explore such interests as art , music , foreign languages and computer networking all of these housing options are available to all students some require applications for membership none , however , exclude students by race , sex , religion , sexual orientation or nationality you portray ujamaa , a residence hall that focuses on african studies , as an allblack residence this is just plain false white students can live in ujamaa , and do you also mislabel akwe kon as an american indian dorm under akwe kon s charter , it is required to have half of its residents nonnative american so why would white students who , according to your article , oppose integration want to live there \? it s not only because it allows a white student to experience a culture other than the dominant european one , but also because it feels comfortable ujamaa and akwe kon are known to be welcoming places to nonresidents ujamaa , for example , has a unity hour program once a week to which the whole campus is invited you quote a freshman as suggesting , maybe we could do a special integrated dorm for people who want to experience integration such places exist on campus already in the international living center and the language houses \( chinese , spanish , german , italian \) your writer counted only two blacks out of 100 students eating lunch at jansen s , the main dining hall on the heavily white west campus does this figure account for the fact that only 6 percent of cornell undergraduates are black \? also , students can eat in any of several dining halls across campus , and so the data do not necessarily reflect the racial composition of west campus if it is true that minority students \( and others perhaps \) are fleeing west campus in favor of north campus , the university has itself to blame the cultural programs i describe are disproportionately on north campus placing the latino living center on west campus is a good step students opposed the random housing solution not , as you suggest , because they opposed racial integration given the great diversity of housing available on campus , was it acceptable to let somebody else decide where you should live \? would you let somebody decide what apartment or house you can have , or what neighborhood you should live in for the greater good \? i hope not white students are disproportionately present on the cornell university campus to spread the 6 percent of black students on campus randomly would not change this fact the only hope of real integration is better recruitment eric beyer brooklyn , april 25 , 1994
belmar , nj , may 26 after years of bad news about fouled water , pinched vacation budgets and stormdamaged beaches and boardwalks , the summer of 1994 appears to be shaping up as a good one both for beachgoers and those who depend on the summertime sunandsand crowd to make a living we 've received very positive indications from a crosssection of businesses at the shore that bookings for beach rentals are up above last year and water quality is excellent , said karen shaffer , a spokeswoman for the new jersey department of tourism there is optimism as well in new york and connecticut joan k davidson , commissioner of parks , recreation and historic preservation for new york , said early reports on beach conditions are good and we hope they hold up it may be the best year in a long time pure fun and big bucks there are those who speak almost mystically of the lure of the ocean and its eternal rhythms but for people like 19yearold cindy mcguire of west orange , nj , the attraction is as plainly evident as a nutbrown suntan or a roiling ride on a breaking wave summertime without the beach would be a complete drag , said ms mcguire , a secretary for a data analysis company who skipped a halfday at work this week to ride with friends to the beach at belmar when temperatures reached the 80 s the beach is pure fun it is also big bucks the local and state economies of new york , new jersey and connecticut have billions of dollars riding on how many people throng to area beaches this summer , which unofficially begins this memorial day weekend no matter what the calendar says daytrippers and vacationers to the jersey shore s 127 miles of beaches contribute as much as 10 billion a year to the state s tourist economy new york and to a lesser extent connecticut also have extensive public and private investments that can soar or plunge depending on millions of decisions made each day of the summer by people who look at the sky and wonder if it is a good day for the beach they did not always think so in the late 1980 s , when beachfronts were plagued with floating garbage , sewage and litter , including discarded hypodermic needles by the time new york city stopped ocean dumping of waste materials and other sources of pollution were halted , a new problem washed ashore in the form of a serious recession that cut into vacation budgets then the coastline was battered by three powerful northeasters between october 1991 and december 1992 , and millions of tons of sand were stripped from beaches and dunes beachfront businesses like lynne watt s beach sweets , an ice cream and candy shop on the boardwalk in point pleasant beach , nj , were wrecked by waves last summer was a nightmare because we were still rebuilding , mrs watt said but now we 're in great shape , and i have wrinkles on my face from smiling severe erosion kept people away from fire island and a few other hardhit long island beaches last year despite a persistent heat wave and water conditions so clear bathers were frightened by fish they could see for the first time rentals have picked up this season though property sales continue to lag , said deborah alter , owner of fire island summer space , a realestate agency long island s 10 state beaches head into the summer in good shape , said susan gordon ryan , regional director of the state park system there were a lot of snowstorms last winter , but none of them caused much beach erosion , she said 'it must be the cabin fever' memory of excellent beach conditions apparently merged with a terrible winter to induce many people to start reserving accommodations early for this year on eastern long island many of the summer rentals are already booked in a market with season prices ranging from 3 , 000 for a oneroom cabana to 170 , 000 for a house on the ocean with amenities like a private tennis court in sea girt , nj , typical houses rent for 12 , 000 to 15 , 000 a summer , 30 , 000 if they are on the beach , said kathryn matthews , owner of g a murphy realtors there are very few rentals left and our beach was already crowded last weekend like it was already july , she said it must be the cabin fever feeling of being locked up by all the snow last winter while it s possible to board a new york city subway or bus for coney island or the rockaways , many people believe going to the beach means getting far away from the city in the case of lara abrash and gary gugh of hoboken , that means going to the hamptons and paying for the privilege ms abrash , a seasoned veteran of the hampton scene , says she pays 28 for a roundtrip ticket on the long island rail road for those who make the trip by car , parking at the beach costs 10 a day , she added , and bars have a 10 entrance fee in the evening it can easily cost me 100 for the weekend , and that s with eating pizzas or having barbecues , she said to reduce their costs , she and mr gugh pay 150 apiece to have access on five weekends to a oneroom bungalow that rents for 3 , 000 a summer that means , she said , that as many as 10 to 12 people pile into the structure on a weekend , with most sleeping on the floor rental agents and owners say that they discourage such overcrowding but that it makes the summer affordable for young people of modest means
federated department stores , in a bold move to create the largest department store company in america , announced yesterday that it had bought a stake in a leading rival , r h macy company if federated should succeed in taking control of macy , which some analysts said yesterday that they doubted , it would bring together some of the bestknown department stores in the country bloomingdale s , abraham straus and burdines of federated , and macy s , bullock s and i magnin , owned by macy federated paid 4493 million for half of a secured claim against macy which is operating under bankruptcy protection held by the prudential insurance company of america and has an option to buy the other half the claim represents 8325 million , plus interest , that macy owes to prudential federated , which operates nine department store chains , paid 1093 million in cash for the stake , with the balance to be paid in three years at a floating interest rate 'very shrewd move' should it exercise its option to buy the remainder of prudential s stake , federated would become macy s largest creditor and would have a voice in the outcome of its bankruptcy reorganization even with the half it now owns , federated , which emerged from bankruptcy itself in 1992 , is likely to play a far more active role in macy s bankruptcy proceedings than other creditors have so far it was a very shrewd move on federated s part , said david h ford , an analyst who follows distressed securities at the delaware bay company federated has beneficial ownership of all of the piece they bought , but they did n't have to pay for it all at once but mr ford and other bankruptcy experts cautioned yesterday that becoming a creditor , even a large and powerful one , is a far riskier way for federated to attempt a marriage with macy than a more conventional merger agreement would be buying the debt does not guarantee them in any way that they will come out with control in the end , said robert miller , the lawyer who represents macy bondholders this is a very curious move on the part of federated , and i do not have any idea whether it portends favorably or unfavorably for the macy s case 'no guarantee' allen i questrom , the chairman and chief executive of federated , said in a statement that the company was aware that the attempted merger was contingent upon what happens during macy s bankruptcy proceedings none know better than we that this will be a challenging process , with no guarantee that we will be successful in accomplishing anything more than having made a sound business investment for federated and its shareholders , he said but if , as we get further into the process , we continue to believe that it will be in everyone s best interests , and if ultimately it can be accomplished , then the end result of a combined federated and macy s department store operation will be well worth whatever effort is required federated did not tell macy of its negotiations with prudential , which transpired rapidly , until yesterday morning but mr questrom has told several people that he may be interested in acquiring all or part of macy many in the retail industry said they thought he was particularly interested in bullock s , which macy owns and which mr questrom built into one of the leading department store franchises when it was part of the federated empire surprise over timing myron e ullman 3d , the chairman and chief executive of macy , said federated s new role as a macy creditor would have little if any impact on the company we 're a little surprised about the timing , although not about their interest , he said obviously , the reorganization is going well , and there are reasons for people to be interested analysts applauded federated s acquisition for its sheer daring , although they were uncertain how it would ultimately shake out for those who were on the scene in 1988 , when macy tried to buy federated , the announcement brought an eerie wave of nostalgia that purchase was thwarted by robert campeau , the canadian real estate developer , who bought federated and saddled it with the debt that ultimately led to its bankruptcy 'crowning glory' it s a very bold move on the part of federated , which i applaud , and if it goes through will be the crowning glory of allen questrom s career , said walter f loeb , president of loeb associates inc , a retail consulting firm the combination of the two companies , which is contingent on a number of factors including the bankruptcy process , would create a department store behemoth with more than 13 billion in sales and operations in almost all areas of the country the may department stores company , with 105 billion in sales , is currently the largest number of ties the two retailers already have a number of ties , and a merger would create opportunities for more efficient operation and much greater buying power mr ullman used to work for federated and knows mr questrom and james m zimmerman , federated s president and chief operating officer , well but those relationships soured over the summer , when macy hired one of federated s senior merchants to fill its no 2 position federated already handles macy s information management systems and data processing under contract
east rutherford , nj bill fitch might have had a tearful reunion yesterday morning with derrick coleman , if only coleman had shown up for the nets' shootaround at meadowlands arena diarrhea , said butch beard , the nets' coach , embellishing coleman s phonedin excuse with a roll of the eyes offered this information , fitch could n't hold back a wicked smile coleman s stomach for practice was no longer his heartburn the nets were not his headache come to think of it , the nets , among others , were making him feel like the luckiest coach on the face of the earth you know , there are still a lot of good people in this league , he gushed this is still a great game fitch s starless los angeles clippers were packing up , as beard s colemanless nets were taking the floor two years after exiting 16w into temporary retirement , fitch was back in town , bringing with him the worst team in pro basketball all of fitch s clippers , however , showed up to run through the plays for last night s 9897 loss to the nets none of them broke his dress code , or moaned they were n't getting enough shots none cursed him out , or demanded he surrender his job none have refused to go into a game this season there are no kenny andersons , rookies who blew off training camp and expected to start the closest thing to a renegade is a guy named outlaw oh , it s all relative , fitch said we 've got the hard heads we 've got guys making millions who in the 70 s and 80 s might 've been the last cut but it s a pretty good family i like these kids the only thing they ca n't do is follow fitch s instructions to win they are 09 after blowing a 15point thirdquarter lead last night they work hard , but they are the unchallenged successors to dallas for the record for fewest victories in one national basketball association season that record is 9 , set by the 19721973 philadelphia 76ers by the time these clippers are done , those 76ers may look like a playoff team so lacking in major league talent are the clippers , fitch yesterday greeted chris morris who , like coleman , once waved off fitch s requests to enter a game with another invitation of sorts i told chris , 'you know , i could use you , ' fitch said never thought i 'd say that , but right now , we 're pretty poor the clippers are so young , so unaccomplished , so obscure , that not one of them would start for the nets the averages of their scoring leaders loy vaught and terry dehere at 153 points per game looks like something from one of those ballcontrol catholic high school teams they have a starting forward named massenburg , someone coming off the bench named fish if people are laughing at us now and they 're not in a year or two , that would be one level of goals , fitch said go ahead , laugh at fitch for taking on the postdanny manningmark jacksonron harper clippers , for climbing aboard a clearly marked titanic he is 60 years old , still loading casettes into tape machines , still teaching the offense larry bird and robert parish once loved to run , still getting out on the road , where he wants to be go ahead , laugh at fitch he still looks better , tanned and relaxed , than the title contender don nelson did on television last week i did n't agree with nellie at all when he said he 'd step down if chris webber signed , fitch volunteered i do n't think a coach should ever step aside because of a player i mean , it can get ridiculous you 'll have a little session in the locker room , and they 'll say , 'now coaching for golden state ' fitch was , as usual , making his point with derisive banter he thinks the real reason behind the warriors' trading of webber to washington may have been the new owner s reluctance to hand 80 million to a 21yearold , then have tim hardaway , latrell sprewell and chris mullin come knock at his door the notion of being held hostage by any of these leveraged , wouldbe superstars , for whatever reason , was almost enough to make fitch feel fortunate to have none , to stir dormant memories of life with coleman one of his reasons for coming back , he said , was to dispel the belief that the nets , in general , and coleman , in particular , had finished him off he did n't run me out , fitch said coleman s refusal to reenter a game late in the 199192 season , he said , was anticipated , even orchestrated , by him i knew he would n't go back in , fitch said that s why i asked so people would see what the situation was , so he would realize the last person he hurt by doing that was me fitch could see that nothing has changed with coleman , with the nets he thinks it is preposterous that coleman was rewarded for continuous impudence with 30 million , that shawn kemp gets a huge raise after a season of showing up late , that webber orders up a trade as he would tuna on rye from the corner deli those are not his problems anymore his players are nba nobodies , though he still may want to watch his back don nelson could be after his job photo bill fitch , coaching for the clippers against the nets last night , has found no defiant players but also no victories in his new job \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
washington , oct 14 federal judge today rejected representative dan rostenkowski s broad constitutional challenge to a 17count indictment charging him with corruption judge norma holloway johnson of federal district court rejected arguments that mr rostenkowski should be immune from prosecution because the charges related to his official duties the constitution , the congressman s lawyers said , explicitly protects legislators from being prosecuted for acts involving those duties the indictment charges mr rosdd nat no con tenkowski , democrat of illinois , with defrauding the government of more than 500 , 000 the constitutional provision that mr rostenkowski s lawyers invoked , the speech or debate clause in article 1 , protects members of congress from being questioned in any other place about their speeches or debates in congress but judge johnson , in a 28page opinion , said the supreme court had narrowed the interpretation of that clause to strictly defined legislative activities she evaluated each of the charges against the congressman and concluded that none of them could fairly be said to involve his official duties the supreme court generally has not disapproved criminal prosecutions of members of congress as long as such endeavors do not implicate the defendant s protected 'legislative acts , ' she wrote activities that are only casually related to a lawmaker s duties , she said , are not protected at all referring to some of the charges , judge johnson said , precedent seems to be lacking for the proposition that immunity attaches to a congressman s decision to hire employees whose duties consist of photographing his daughters' weddings , mowing the grass at his summer house , or other personal duties judge johnson also rejected a claim by mr rostenkowski s lawyers that the prosecution infringed upon the legislative branch s powers to discipline its own members for violations of house rules howard pearl , a lawyer for mr rostenkowski , said he was disappointed by the ruling and promised an appeal there are significant constitutional issues raised in this case , mr pearl said one effect of the appeal would be to delay for as long as a year what is expected to be a highly charged criminal trial that is because the issue of immunity is one of the few that courts have generally allowed to proceed up the chain of appeals before a defendant is required to stand trial mr rostenkowski is seeking reelection to a 19th term to represent the north side of chicago he says he is being victimized by prosecutors intent on bringing him down the indictment charges mr rostenkowski , 66 , with offenses including embezzlement , conspiracy , concealing a material fact and tampering with a witness the government said that he received at least 50 , 000 in cash payments disguised as stamp purchases from the house post office over 13 years in addition , prosecutors say he engaged in a kickback scheme starting in 1971 in which he hired 14 employees who did little or no official work but performed personal chores
cleveland high in the cleveland stadium press box , dick steinberg , in a blue sport shirt and khaki slacks , suffered in silence every so often during the jets' 277 disaster , their general manager glanced at a television replay or peered through his binoculars , but he seldom reacted not a grunt nor a groan not a word , not even to james harris , the assistant general manager , sitting next to him when the jets' third consecutive loss after a 20 start was over , steinberg put on a blue windbreaker , took the elevator downstairs and walked unrecognized against the tide of celebrating browns fans to his team s locker room but how long will the jets be dick steinberg s team \? if their record does n't improve quickly , if they skid to a 610 record or worse , as now seems likely after yesterday s embarrassment , wo n't it be time for their oilbaron owner , leon hess , to reassess steinberg s value after five seasons as general manager \? when steinberg changed coaches , firing bruce coslet and promoting pete carroll , after last season s 88 treadmill , the general manager seemed to be buying time for himself if the jets had remained on that treadmill this season with coslet , then steinberg would have been responsible for prolonging the treadmill by hiring a new coach , he presumably would be able to prolong his own tenure but if the jets do n't respond to carroll soon , steinberg must be held accountable for hiring him when the jets stunned the bills in buffalo , 233 , carroll was hailed for his enthusiasm when the jets followed with an 2522 overtime victory against the denver broncos , he was hailed as a football freud for having convinced his players that they were playing in the meadowlands , not in the stadium named for that other team but with the jets having lost to the dolphins , the bears and the browns , the rookie coach now has the confused look of a rookie coach we 've got to find out something about where we 're going , carroll was saying now , because we 're not going anywhere now but as a rookie coach , carroll has no experience to call on when his team is struggling no experience of leading them out of the wilderness that s also his players' problem they have no experience of having won big games together not with a 23 record after four seasons of 610 , 88 , 412 and 88 records all those jets fans who remember super bowl iii still cling to joe namath but to these jets players , joe namath is somebody they see on television commercials when these jets players need to come together to snap a slump , they have nothing to cling to , nothing to stand on , nothing to remember ronnie lott , art monk , tony casillas and bill pickel wear super bowl rings boomer esiason was all but measured for one but none of the other jets know what it is to be on a real winner as the jets' general manager , steinberg has assembled players but he has n't assembled a team and the jury is still out on his choice of carroll as a coach steinberg arrived from the patriots with a reputation as a talent scout but of his five firstround choices , only wide receiver rob moore has the look of a potential pro bowl player blair thomas never blossomed as a running back and is gone johnny mitchell has yet to mature at tight end marvin jones s development as a middle linebacker has been delayed by injuries aaron glenn is a rookie cornerback when unrestricted free agents suddenly were available in 1993 , hess opened the jets' treasury steinberg signed lott and the since departed defensive lineman , leonard marshall he used hess s millions to take esiason s contract off the bengals' hands this season he added monk , kicker nick lowery and backup quarterback jack trudeau but yesterday trudeau did n't even live up to the scouting report he had in eight seasons with the colts that he 'll win some games , but he wo n't take his team to the super bowl we 're not going to win , trudeau said , until everybody is making plays , until everybody is doing what they 're supposed to do , including me everybody on this team has to pay attention to what they 're supposed to do and do it that sounded as if some of the jets on offense did n't know their pass routes or their blocking assignments that s a player s responsibility , but it s also a coach s job it s also a general manager s job to select or sign players who will pay attention to what they 're supposed to do and do it but as the jets await their return to the meadowlands against the colts and the patriots the next two sundays , they do n't have enough of those players and if that s the reason these jets do n't have a memory of having won big games together , it s also the reason dick steinberg is suffering in silence

little rock , ark , aug 4 opponents of the death penalty , a group whose influence has dwindled amid growing public concern about violent crime , claimed new moral ground on wednesday when arkansas executed three men in less than three hours at what point will they stop \? asked kika matos of the naacp legal defense and educational fund it will soon be the mass lynchings of not so long ago she argued that a multiple execution takes away from the individuality of the person sent to his death arkansas' triple execution was the first in the united states in 32 years , and it accounted for a third of the nine inmates the state has executed since 1976 with only one exception a double execution by arkansas in may the other 246 prisoners executed in the last 18 years have gone to their deaths individually argument for efficiency arkansas prison officials argued that the multiple executions were more efficient and produced less strain on prison workers than individual executions nobody wants to get up in the morning and go kill somebody , said alan ables , a spokesman for the correction department for the previous week , guards had rehearsed the process in 15 steps the lethal injections began at 7 pm and were repeated at about onehour intervals in a small concreteblock room at the cummins unit of the state prison system the order of the executions was originally scheduled according to prisoner numbers that plan had to be abandoned when a federal court temporarily stayed the execution of the man who was supposed to die second the condemned men , hoyt franklin clines , 37 \( no sk886 \) , james william holmes , 37 \( no sk887 \) and darryl v richley , 43 \( no sk888 \) , were sentenced to death for murdering a prominent businessman in front of his family in 1981 the victim , don lehman , was beaten with a motorcycle chain and shot in the chest and head during a robbery he ran upstairs after he was shot , but the men chased him down and held him on a bed while he was shot again as his wife lay on the bedroom floor on wednesday night , each man in turn stepped out of his cell and lay down on prison s only gurney they were strapped down and wheeled about 30 feet to the death chamber , where they were injected with a fatal mixture mr clines was the first to die , at 7 11 pm fiftyeight minutes later , and an hour ahead of the original schedule , mr richley was declared dead because of the switched times , mr holmes went to his death 84 minutes later than he had expected , at 9 24 pm none had any last words but earlier , in a joint last appeal , they had argued , this scheduled mass execution , by reducing human beings to hogs at the slaughter , will exponentially increase the level of fear , uncertainty and psychological stress that someone condemned normally experiences in the usual course of events diann rusttierney , director of the capital punishment project for the american civil liberties union , said , to take mass execution as a model of efficiency only underscores how out of step we are with the rest of the world mr ables , the correction department spokesman , countered it s nice to be criticized for being efficient the people that are involved in this are very concerned that what they do is proper , done professionally and with decorum they want this to go well
exactly three months ago , nearly 100 antiabortion leaders met at a chicago hotel to plan their future but their weekend gathering at the radisson lincolnwood hotel quickly turned into a heated twoday debate on a chilling question that has split their ranks is the killing of doctors who perform abortions morally justified \? paul j hill , the former minister charged yesterday with shooting a doctor and two others at a pensacola , fla , clinic , did not say much at the chicago conference but by all accounts , his presence there and his yearlong crusade for the proposition that killing doctors who perform abortions is justifiable homicide , mandated by the bible dominated the meeting the issue has been a divisive one within the antiabortion movement ever since the fatal shooting last year of dr david gunn outside the other pensacola clinic i went to chicago because i had to confront paul hill , said the rev flip benham , director of operation rescue national , a group that once represented the most extreme end of the antiabortion spectrum i think what he s saying is heresy , it s sin , it s murder , it s wrong , and it solves nothing , only makes things worse but i think i was in the minority rick blinn , a spokesman for operation rescue who was also at the meeting , said that mr hill had handed out his position papers liberally and had tried , in informal conversations with those who disagreed with him , to use the bible to defend his position even the formal agenda of the meeting reflected the debate over killing one item listed for discussion was violence and nonviolence how to work with disagreement , and another was focus team on marginal killers many who were at the chicago meeting said they had thought the debate was purely theoretical the discussion of killing was abstract , almost theological , said the rev frank pavone of priests united for life no one was at any time talking about any kind of action however , abortion rights groups said yesterday that it was at best disingenuous for those who engage in fiery rhetoric about baby killers and the abortion holocaust to express surprise when their rhetoric leads to violence opponents of choice who call physicians 'baby killers' one day have no credibility the next when they issue polite statements of regret after physicians and escorts have been gunned down in cold blood , said the statement issued yesterday by the national abortion and reproductive rights action league and some of those who had been at the chicago meeting were hardly ringing in their condemnation of yesterday s killings , reserving most of their outrage for those who interfere with abortion protests this may be the start of the new civil war everyone has been talking about , said don treshman , the director of rescue america , who was at the chicago meeting as a result of the clinton administration s oppressive efforts to stop even peaceful prolife activities , i fear there will be more bombings and shootings up to now , the killings have been on one side , with 30 million dead babies and hundreds of dead and maimed mothers on the other side , there are two dead doctors maybe the balance is going to start to shift while several of those who were present at the chicago meeting said they were distressed by the widespread acceptance of the idea that it might be justifiable to kill those who perform abortions , none of those interviewed would identify the individuals or groups that had taken that position most strongly and in the wake of yesterday s shootings , most seemed eager to distance themselves from such thinking i went to the meeting hoping we could agree on nonviolent actions all of us could support , said joseph scheidler , director of the prolife action league but early on , we hit the item on 'violence and nonviolence how to work with disagreement , ' and that became the issue for the rest of the weekend i was surprised at how much support there was for paul hill i had always boasted that we do n't fight among ourselves in the prolife movement , but this was very divisive the issue of violence and civil disobedience in the service of stopping abortions has been touchy for years leaders of some mainstream antiabortion groups , including the national right to life committee , have always been quick to condemn unlawful actions , stressing their commitment to opposing abortion through the political process and their distance from groups such as operation rescue , which have frequently violated the law through civil disobedience yesterday s shootings brought a new outpouring of statements denouncing violence and the leaders of operation rescue national and the prolife action league said yesterday that they had argued with mr hill , before , during and after the chicago meeting , that killing doctors is not justifiable but while many antiabortion leaders sought yesterday to portray mr hill as a lone extremist , with no following , it had been apparent even before the chicago meeting that mr hill had some significant support last month , mr hill circulated a petition declaring the justice of using force to defend innocent human life whatever force is legitimate to defend the life of a born child is legitimate to defend the life of an unborn child , the petition said most of the antiabortion leaders said they first heard of mr hill , who established an organization called defensive action , only after the shooting of dr gunn last year mr hill , who was earning a living painting and cleaning cars after leaving the active ministry several years ago , thrust himself into the limelight through the force of his statements in support of michael griffin , 32 , the man convicted of the shooting the first time i ever laid eyes on him , said mr benham , the operation rescue national official , i was in jail in dallas , and he came on 'donahue' saying we should kill all the abortionists he told me later that he 'd called a radio program to talk about michael griffin , and then he 'd called phil donahue i 'd never heard of him but after 'donahue , ' it seemed like the media just gobbled him up , because he was saying what they wanted him to say mr benham and others were initially suspicious of mr hill michael conroy , a pensacola antiabortion leader , said at first we really thought he was a plant , a ringer for the other side , put here to try to discredit us we thought he was too bizarre to be real

after months of frustrating negotiations , the bell atlantic corporation and telecommunications inc said last night that they had terminated plans for the largest merger in history the 33 billion transaction , announced four months ago , would have joined bell s regional telephone business with the vast cable operations of telecommunications and those of a third company , the liberty media corporation the merger would have radically altered the landscape of the telecommunications industry by quickening the development of new technologies for home entertainment and information but last night the companies announced jointly that the talks were off they said they were unable to reach final agreement on their proposed merger and have terminated negotiations several media executives yesterday called the breakdown a terrible embarrassment for both companies and james cullen , president of bell atlantic , said in a telephone interview yesterday it s a damn big disappointment signs of strain though none of the companies would disclose details about why the discussions broke down , signs of strain had emerged over the previous months twice , bell atlantic s chairman , raymond w smith , and john c malone , president of telecommunications and chairman of liberty media , missed deadlines they had chosen for completing the merger among the issues of contention , according to people close to the deal , was the decline in the value of bell atlantic s stock since the merger announcement on oct 12 that meant bell atlantic would have had to issue more shares to purchase telecommunications and liberty media another reason cited by the companies for the breakdown was the potentially negative impact on telecommunications' earnings of cuts in cable television rates mandated by the federal communications commission on tuesday impact on growth the rate controls are expected to reduce the growth in income of telecommunications , although people in the industry said the development should not have come as a surprise to the partners , as they had been foreshadowed when the deal was first announced when the deal was announced , it was heralded by the telecommunications community as the beginning of a rash of mergers from the cable industry , phone companies are seeking experience in television programming and the highcapacity networks capable of carrying dozens , or even hundreds , of program channels in turn , the much richer phone companies can provide the switching technology that will allow twoway communications on the interactive television networks of the near future but with the bellwether merger now dead , some in the industry worry about a chilling effect on potential collaborations between these two rival camps everyone lined up alongside the thinking behind it , one media executive said last night , referring to the idea that the historic enemies could work profitably together now , that has changed you will hear less about cooperation between cable and telephone companies you will hear a lot more about war yet some other media executives pointed out that the bell atlantictelecommunications merger was excessively complex and tough to negotiate and said it did not mean that other deals would not get done in the future a couple deciding not to get married to each other is different from them deciding against the idea of marriage in general , said richard a shaffer , a principal in technologic partners , a consulting firm in new york when the two companies initially agreed to merge , bell atlantic planned to buy telecommunications , with its stock valued at 35 a share at the time , bell atlantic was paying about 1175 times the recent cash flow of telecommunications , which is generally what cable companies fetch but that price became harder for bell atlantic to swallow in the face of the fcc s new rules 'uncertainty in the marketplace' yet regulators claimed their actions put no damper on the deal i have to believe that the real reason is uncertainty in the marketplace , not regulatory action , a staff member of the senate antitrust subcommittee said last night bell atlantic knew exactly what it was going into , because last summer it filed with the fcc saying that cable rates were inflated by 28 percent they knew that cable rates were high and that with regulation they would come down indeed , one person close to the talks said that both sides had grown tired and skittish he said the deal had taken too long , in the face of too many variables but as recently as yesterday , bell atlantic still hoped to complete the deal mr malone flew to new york from denver yesterday and mr smith , whose company is based in philadelphia , traveled to new york from washington bell atlantic intended to evaluate the impact of reregulation and to adjust the purchase price , this person said there had already been a series of adjustments in earlier discussions in his view , mr malone was not willing to make any new adjustments and when the two companies could not reach an agreement , mr malone backed out executives at the two companies could not be reached for comment late last night shifting regulatory environment
london they eat all kinds of strange snack foods on these shores , including the prawnflavored crisp an acquired taste , to be sure but they have n't acquired a taste for that american staple , the corn chip , a failing that the king of saltysnack marketers , pepsico inc , is now out to remedy pepsi , the owner of fritolay , will officially introduce doritos to britain today it is spending 9 million on advertising and promotion to do so , more than half of it on a television campaign from bbdo new york that is scheduled to begin in the next few weeks , not to mention another 18 million it spent to build a stateoftheart corn chip factory pepsi and its british snackfood subsidiary , walkers smiths snack foods ltd , have high hopes for doritos in britain , a nation whose per capita consumption of potato chips , or crisps as they are known here , almost matches that of the united states but britain is merely a testbed for pepsi s real dream transforming the snack food industry from a highly fragmented business dominated by local favorites into one dominated by global brands that can be packaged and advertised much the same way anywhere , just like , say , cocacola or pepsicola , with all the economies of scale that would bring after doritos could come global campaigns for pepsiowned products like cheetos cheese puffs , ruffles potato chips and 3d s , a snack product developed by pepsi and general mills in europe or , in the marketing jargon used by christopher a sinclair , the president of pepsico foods and beverages international , if we can get three or four major global platforms on the brand front , that s where we can really build the franchise pepsi s international sales of snack foods , he said , could triple over the next 5 to 10 years , to 135 billion annually from 45 billion currently pepsi has invested heavily in its international snacks business , spending 15 billion in recent years to acquire local manufacturers and distributors , including 600 million for walkers smiths , the leading crisp maker in britain because local tastes and snacking habits vary so much , pepsi has largely viewed each market as distinct and has done little to send its brands across borders but now the company is taking the next step in the belief that adroit product development and marketing can create brands with international appeal britain , for example , is potatochip crazy consumers eat 528 pounds of potato chips per capita each year in britain , and are the closest rivals on that front to americans , who gobble 616 pounds of potato chips per person yet while americans eat another 616 pounds each of corn chips every year , the british eat almost none wondering if that void could be filled , pepsi and walkers smiths spent several years testing corn chips they found that the british liked corn chips just fine , as long as they were cut slightly thinner than americans are accustomed to more like the potato chips the british are used to and as long as they were flavored to british tastes if pepsi has learned a single important lesson from its experience with doritos in britain , in fact , it is that even global snackfood brands have to be adapted somewhat to local tastes we could not simply copy the doritos mix , we had to treat it as a new product opportunity , said martin glenn , the director of new product development for walkers smiths but pepsi is betting that advertising and packaging will be transferable across borders the bbdo new york campaign that will begin for doritos in several weeks will also be seen soon in the united states mr sinclair declined to disclose details , other than to describe the theme as cutting loose or letting loose with doritos the new packaging developed for british consumers is also expected to become the standard for the brand as it is gradually introduced in other markets around the world moreover , the packaging is being testmarketed in the united states , and mr sinclair said it would probably be adopted there as well photo pepsico is introducing doritos corn chips to britain today a pedestrian bought a bag of chips from a supermarket employee carrying a doritos display into a store in the town of pangbourne yesterday \( jonathan player for the new york times \)
a medieval sideshow to a christmas celebration newberry consort frick collection the newberry consort offered , on sunday afternoon , what is likely to be the most unusual christmas program of the season called il sollazzo music for a medieval christmas feast , the program drew on ballads and dances referred to in a manuscript by the 14thcentury italian poet simone prudenzani prudenzani s sollazzo was set in the fictional court of pierbaldo , lord of buongoverno , where ballads and dances are offered as the accompaniment to the weeklong christmas feast but except for two pieces , sovrana si' ne sembianti and nova stella , none of the music referred specifically to the christmas story instead , there were amorous songs , sprightly dances and parables about vanity and hypocrisy , including a bawdy , almost chaucerian tale about a convent and its misbehaving nuns the newberry musicians made their reconstruction look easy , but it was a complicated undertaking il sollazzo includes only incipits \( the opening phrases \) of some popular songs of the day complete versions had to be sought elsewhere and there were no musical settings for prudenzani s picturesque poetry , so the players found lauda sacred melodies with secular roots that fit the texts drew minter , countertenor , and jennifer lane , mezzosoprano , gave clearly enunciated , vocally pleasing readings of the songs in monna lisa , prudenzani s piece about a woman whose husband cures her of vanity , mr minter switched between his smooth countertenor and a baritone , which he used to sing the husband s line and the refrains ms lane gave a vivid , comic account of la badessa , the convent story david douglass , wendy gillespie and mary springfels each played with expressive virtuosity on an arsenal of period instruments that included a lute , vielles \( fiddles of various sizes and pitches \) , a rebec \( a small , pearshaped fiddle \) and a citole \( a guitarlike instrument \) allan kozinn
santa fe , nm aug 14 blond eckbert is more interesting to think about than to experience firsthand short and inscrutable , with music that is neither terribly old nor terribly new , judith weir s new piece at the santa fe opera presents us with people we do n't know much about doing things we do n't quite understand her source is the late18thcentury tale by ludwig tieck eckbert and berthe , man and wife , are visited by their friend walther to entertain him , berthe tells of her childhood flights , first from her home , then from an old woman in the forest she takes from the old woman a magic bird laying jewels as eggs she returns home , finds her parents dead , marries eckbert walther , somehow , knows the name of her dog in the forest she had forgotten it sick with worry over this , berthe falls ill and will die suspicious , eckbert murders walther in the forest eckbert flees he meets hugo , who looks like walther he comes to the old woman s house she looks like walther too i am walther , hugo and myself , says the old woman , who tells eckbert that berthe is his sister he dies explanations give us peace of mind , and if we scratch our heads , blond eckbert can be explained eckbert and berthe have forgotten who they are walther is the personification of memory , and the memories he bears are for them intolerable in one way at least , the puzzle can be solved by knowing blond eckbert we can shed its power over us francesca zambello s staging seems to lean in this direction at the start she has eckbert and berthe frown with dread and foreboding they have no reason to , or at least none is explained to us perhaps ms zambello feels the need to prepare us for later tragedies she has a point , for this is a story full of effects but bereft of causes miss weir s music operates the same way musical ideas are in short bursts , little phrases that repeat and overlap and then are dropped for something new in other words , miss weir s is not a developmental art things happen in the present , go away and then something else comes along music does n't usually think this way beethoven s themes , for example , have memory they can change , grow , metamorphose only if they remember what they used to be this makes beethoven s music profound that is , deep , not flat we can reach back behind it and find out where its materials come from blond eckbert , the story and the music , is flat it has no depth the opera s characters tell stories about themselves their pasts are not relived frozen in the present , their life is unexplained narrative is all isak dinesen tells us that the telling of stories is human activity at its most sublime blond eckbert is a story and little else its main job is not to make sense , but to get from a beginning to an end it is a little like watching a race we do n't know the participants personally or why they are out on the track we just like to watch them run to accuse blond eckbert of lacking profundity may miss the point its shallowness may be its virtue equally , when miss weir and ms zambello seek to understand why characters run away , commit murder , know things they are n't supposed to know , they too may miss the point for perhaps blond eckbert is not about incest or , indeed , about cause and effect perhaps it is interpretationproof this overeagerness to impose sense on nonsense ends up compromising a story meant more to be beheld than understood i had more fun ruminating over blond eckbert on saturday morning than i did seeing it on friday night alison chitty s aggressively ugly production is hardly a comeon girderlike scaffolding frames the stage , lighted alternately in bright whites and a garish lilac a stage within a stage rises on an elevator and slides forward there is one striking crowd scene with large green and purple cones as listeners take their seats , they see the back of the stage opened onto a desert sunset , all black outlines and pink sky these , unfortunately , have nothing to do with blond eckbert and soon vanish in the dark miss weir s vocal lines serve texts \( her own \) more than than they do music she has a sharp ear for orchestral color , but the use of instruments is quite conventional melodic gestures stretch diatonic or modal music beyond consonance , but not far in style and language , her music tells us what we already know , albeit with a certain fastidiousness and grace the cast emily golden , james michael mcguire , elizabeth futral , brad cresswell and franco pomponi sang diligently george manahan , whose work as a conductor i respect , could only draw a frazzled , uneasy togetherness from the santa fe opera orchestra blond eckbert , in the end , is neither powerful nor meek , neither moving nor anonymous indeed , one keeps defining it by what it is not this opera has fascinating implications i only wish miss weir could make more of them il barbiere di siviglia on saturday night was eminently explicable and certainly more cheerful ms zambello and her setandcostume designer , john macfarlane , turn rossini s chorus into romping commedia dell'arte figures walls swing ponderously , turning outdoors to indoors dwayne croft is a robust figaro jeffrey francis s almaviva is clear but dry as rosina , delores ziegler sounds underripe , with an attractive mezzosoprano that never seems to have grown into the size and resonance predestined for it none were at ease with rossini s fastmoving coloratura saturday s real find was evelino pido , a cultured and energizing young conductor from italy players who were often listless or muddled on wednesday through friday nights , sounded happy and professional on saturday blond eckbert opera in two acts by judith weir libretto by the composer ,

giants stadium , where the jets play , was over there somewhere to the northwest , out of sight , out of mind this game , this scene , was what football is supposed to be all about , said joe walton the 58yearold coach was glad to be here , not there joe walton s here yesterday was a smallcollege campus , wagner s , atop grymes hill on staten island , the grass field framed by autumnal trees of green , red and yellow , the capacity crowd of 5 , 000 spilling out of the wooden stands on homecoming day it was indeed a golden scene on a heavenly day the attraction was the game between wagner and robert morris , the team coached by walton , who played for the giants in the 1960 s and was head coach of the jets for much of the 1980 s playing in its first season of intercollegiate football , the robert morris team had experienced extraordinary success , winning all five of its prior games but that streak came to an end when wagner defeated them , 3821 we played hard , that s what counts , said walton , who directed the jets for seven seasons , 19831989 , then left the national football league after a few unhappy seasons as the pittsburgh steelers' offensive coordinator our kids learned how to win now they have to learn how to lose , to keep their heads up and come back we 'll regroup and keep teaching for wagner the victory was sweet indeed the team had a 14 record coming into this contest and walt hameline , the coach , had been disappointed the return of walton to the new york area had created a stir hameline s word was hoopla and a strong media response there was a lot of hype , a lot of tv and our guys were excited , said hameline the game s character was determined early wagner was ahead , 140 , before nine minutes had expired in the first period the robert morris players seemed ready to head for their buses , the ones that taken them from the campus at corapolis , pa , outside pittsburgh , to here , a sevenhour ride however , tim hall put the colonials back in the game for a while with a 70yard touchdown run hall , a 215pound fullback from kansas city , is one of the few upperclassmen on the squad and he came to robert morris from a junior college , kemper military he ran for 157 yards , scored 2 touchdowns and wore jersey number 45 that no 45 was one of the best backs i 've seen , hameline said the seahawks were ahead , 217 , after the first quarter and 2413 at the half robert morris never could catch up , as wagner s two running backs , kito lockwood and chris purdy , were too much for the colonials lockwood had 194 rushing yards for the game and purdy 132 each scored two touchdowns that was a nice team , said walton of wagner he was inconspicuous on the sideline , without the usual coaching headset but with a clipboard , a signature item for him two decades ago , when he was the offensive coordinator for the redskins and joe theisman s mentor , walton wore his baseball cap turned around with the visor in the back , one of the first to adopt that style yesterday , the visor was in the front i 've got my head screwed on straight , he told an old friend before the game walton s return to football coaching at the smallcollege level five years after his sour departure from the jets , and later from the nationmal football league , had inspired curiosity and many interviews there were more today , familiar questions about his feelings that walton mostly stonewalled did he have any thoughts about the past , the turbulent seven seasons with the jets , of which five were losing ones \? none whatsoever , he replied sharply his team had spent friday night at piscataway , nj , 30 minutes from giants stadium , where jets fans had booed walton with the chant joe must go he said , when we came over on the bus this morning all i was thinking about was the team and the game i spent 28 years around new york , from 1961 to 1989 sure , there were ups and there were downs if you stick around in football long enough there are going to be some downs i like where i am now i like the college and i like the people i live 20 minutes away it s going to take two or three years to get where we want to be walton was hired in june 1993 and had over a year to recruit the 66 freshmen who make up the bulk of his squad ninetyfive per cent , said walton the team he brought to grymes hill was no fraud the teams it had beaten waynesburg , monmouth , central connecticut , gannon and duquesne had a collective record of 1511 before today s games walton had never been on the wagner campus before , but he knew a little about the place because of rich kotite , the head coach of the philadelphia eagles kotite , wagner s most famous football player , had been a successor to walton as a tight end for the giants in the 1960 s and was an assistant coach on walton s staff with the jets kotite had returned friday night for a reunion of his 1964 wagner team , an unbeaten one , and then went to dallas with the eagles who play the cowboys there today rich called me last night , said walton not to wish him luck , he said , but just to say hello extra points robert morris , the man , was a philadelphia merchant , an early entrepreneur who helped finance the american revolution , later served as a united states senator from pennsylvania and ultimately spent time in a debtors prison the college was founded in 1921 as the pittsburgh school of accounting and acquired the robert morris name in 1935 it was a junior college until 1969 and now has 5 , 500 students and 16 varsity teams , eight for men and eight for women the colonials are classified as a division iaa nonscholarship team photo joe walton , a coach in new york city again for a day , on the robert morris college sideline yesterday at wagner college s field on staten island \( pete kuhns for the new york times \)
washington , aug 1 the treasury department s top lawyer today contradicted her bosses' accounts of how the department decided to notify the white house about an investigation that potentially involved president clinton and his wife other banking officials who testified today called the notification highly unusual at a daylong hearing before the senate banking committee , jean e hanson , the department s general counsel , said she had briefed the white house at the instruction of her immediate supervisor , deputy treasury secretary roger c altman mr altman has denied telling ms hanson to do that and she said she told treasury secretary lloyd bentsen about her discussions , contradicting mr bentsen s assertion that he was not aware of the meetings between treasury and white house officials last september and february the discussions involved an investigation into the bankruptcy of madison guaranty savings and loan , an arkansas institution run by the clintons' former business partner the resolution trust corporation , which mr altman then headed in an acting capacity , was considering referring the case to the justice department for criminal prosecution i am aware that others' recollections differ from my own , ms hanson said in her opening statement i do not question the good faith of anyone who has a differing recollection most importantly , i think these differences in recollection are irrelevant what matters is that each of the events in which i was a participant pursued legitimate objectives and was appropriate despite differences in recollections , no one to my knowledge intended to do , or did , anything wrong or unethical the actions by ms hanson and mr altman came under fire from senators sitting on the panel today mr altman first told the same senate panel of his contacts with the white house on feb 24 , and he has since amended and added to his account on several occasions in an unusual moment of bipartisanship , both democrats and republicans on the banking committee said today that mr altman had misled them through omission and that ms hanson , who was sitting next to him when he testified , should have promptly corrected his account senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , admonished ms hanson , saying that her failure to correct mr altman showed that she was less than candid and frank ms hanson , clearly exasperated , shot back sir , sir , sir , i take my responsibilities seriously , and i did everything i could consistent with my responsibilities you may disagree , sir you may disagree but i discharged my responsibilities consistent with my duties most of the democrats on the panel , including senators john kerry of massachusetts , barbara boxer of california , paul s sarbanes of maryland , richard h bryan of nevada and carol moseley braun of illinois , as well as the the committee s chairman , donald w riegle jr of michigan , said that ms hanson should have acted more quickly to correct mr altman s testimony after senator christopher s bond , republican of missouri , criticized her failure to amend mr altman s testimony , ms hanson said , senator , i really resent you questioning my professionalism mr bond responded , if there is anyone who has something to resent , i feel it us , who resent that you did n't tell us the truth several career officials of the trust corporation , which supervises the savings and loan industry , also criticized ms hanson and mr altman in testimony before the senate committee , saying it was highly improper for the treasury department to give the white house advance notice of a criminal investigation that might involve the president white house officials who testified before the house banking committee last week sought to portray the warning about the investigation as proper and routine today , the trust corporation officials who testified said they thought that mr altman , who was running their agency at the time , should have separated himself from the investigation long before public pressure forced him to do so in february one of the officials , john ryan , now the acting head of the agency , said he was surprised to hear that ms hanson , at mr altman s request , had asked the rtc s lawyer to brief the clintons' personal lawyer on the investigation the banking agency s general counsel , ellen kulka , said she thought the briefing would be improper and did not comply with the request anticipating leaks in more than six hours of testimony that went late into the evening , ms hanson said the discussions she had with the white house were intended to help the white house to deal with what she expected would be press leaks about the whitewater investigation she said leaks at the agency handling the savings and loan bailout were a fact of life ms hanson , like other administration appointees who testified earlier , said that none of her actions , or mr altman s , or those of white house officials , blocked or interfered with the madison investigation but the rtc officials said that the existence of the investigation should not have been discussed outside the treasury department because that risked compromising it they said they had implored their bosses to keep the information confidential 'extraordinary case' under questioning from senator richard c shelby , democrat of alabama , mr ryan said the madison case was treated differently from other banking investigations basically you thought this was an extraordinary case , mr shelby said mr ryan it was an extraordinary case mr shelby possibly involving some people at the white house mr ryan that s correct mr shelby asked if that was why mr ryan was surprised by the discussions with the white house i thought that it was a surprising revelation , mr ryan said and highly unusual , i suppose , mr shelby said and highly unusual , yes , sir , mr ryan replied

a special new york state committee studying the effect of cameras in the courtroom has recommended that the experiment be given permanent status a law allowing cameras to film proceedings in the state s courthouses will expire next january unless the legislature acts , which it has been reluctant to do since the experiment began in 1987 justice burton b roberts , chief administrative judge in the bronx , who headed the committee , said that 11 of the committee s 12 members agreed that allowing cameras to film court proceedings would be beneficial not only does it increase the level of fairness , it provides an educational tool for the public , said judge roberts , who noted that 35 other states already allow cameras in trial and appellate courtrooms the sole dissenter on the committee , jack litman , a defense lawyer , argued that cameras would hurt a defendant s right to a fair trial justice roberts said the committee also recommended that none of the current safeguards and restrictions on the use of cameras be changed
boston , june 29 a drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colons , a study has found ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms when steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe case , doctors almost always have to remove the patient s colon the study showed that the transplant drug , cyclosporine , was effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugs , the last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease the study , led by dr simon lichtiger and conducted at mount sinai school of medicine in new york and the university of chicago , is being published on thursday in the new england journal of medicine the researchers tested 20 patients eleven were randomly assigned to get cyclosporine injections the rest received placebo shots nine of the 11 reported substantial relief of their symptoms within a week , while none in the comparison group got better the researchers had planned to enroll 42 patients but cut the study short because they felt that , given their findings , it would be unethical to continue with the placebos five who were originally in the comparison group were later given cyclosporine , and all responded to the treatment cyclosporine is widely used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs it works by suppressing white blood cells that are part of the body s defenses against disease the drug does have side effects , however , among them possible damage to the kidneys
rome , nov 23 trying to seize the initiative in his battle with magistrates investigating him for corruption , prime minister silvio berlusconi said tonight that he was ready to sell part of his vast business empire , including a majority share in his three national television stations he also threatened to force new elections by resigning if the restive partners in his coalition did not pledge complete support for him speaking a day after receiving notice that he was under investigation , mr berlusconi said he had a contract with the voters and was prepared to quit if the government cannot take the measures needed in the interest of the country he said that this week he would summon his coalition partners , the neofascist national alliance and the federalist northern league , for verification of his government s ability to command a parliamentary majority the move is seen as a way of demanding their full support , since the two parties could lose considerable clout if the government collapses and a new election is held in a suggestion that his tactic may not succeed , however , umberto bossi , leader of the northern league , rejected the idea of holding such a gathering soon the magistrates' inquiry is said to involve bribes that some of mr berlusconi s companies reportedly paid to tax auditors before he became prime minister today the scandal threatened to widen with reports that a second inquiry may be opened into accusations that he violated antitrust laws covering his television holdings two italian newspapers reported that investigators in rome had placed him on a list of people who may be investigated in connection with accusations that he had prodded the staterun networks into sharing advertising with his commercial channels , which have about 45 percent of the viewers' market mr berlusconi made no direct reference to the articles , and magistrates did not confirm the reports but his offer to sell part of fininvest , his main holding company , seemed to be intended to head off accusations that many problems of his sixmonthold administration arise from a conflict of interest i have decided to sell my companies and to offer shares in the television sector on the stock exchange , mr berlusconi said at a news conference in naples , where he has been host this week to a big united nations conference on fighting organized crime i am thinking of keeping a share , but that will not be a majority stake mr berlusconi s bid for political support has already won strong backing from gianfranco fini , the leader of the neofascist party mr bossi , however , may be gambling that delaying a formal expression of support will increase pressure on mr berlusconi to resign when parliament has finally approved the 1995 budget interior minister roberto maroni , another member of the northern league , said the governing parties' main task was to assure passage of the unpopular budget bill , which would greatly reduce pension payments and other social benefits president oscar luigi scalfaro seemed to offer support today for a statement made on tuesday by mr berlusconi that only a parliamentary vote of no confidence could force the prime minister from office the fate of the government is in the hands of the free will of parliament , the president said in a joint statement with parliamentary leaders mr scalfaro has also made it clear that he rejects mr berlusconi s threat to force new elections , which only the president can call none of the judicial action taken so far implies guilt on mr berlusconi s part but the prime minister has nonetheless proclaimed his innocence , and has spoken of a political vendetta by the magistrates mr berlusconi has acknowledged that his companies may have paid bribes , but he has said he was not aware of the payments his position is that the payments in any case did not constitute bribery but rather extortion by government auditors today he sought to face down his critics by returning to naples to resume his role as chairman of the united nations conference on international organized crime i 'd say my state is one of calm indignation , mr berlusconi told reporters in naples i have already sworn on what i hold most dear , namely the heads of my children , that i have never committed the things i am accused of for their part , the magistrates in milan denied today that they had timed their inquiries to embarrass the italian leader at the naples conference we ca n't stop investigating just because berlusconi is prime minister , said gerardo d'ambrosio , a senior prosecutor
berlin , may 31 inside the ghostly hall of a church that was heavily damaged in an allied air raid in 1945 and has not been rebuilt , a semicircle of german actors gathered over the weekend to read from an extraordinary historical work that has become a publishing sensation here the book , called echolot a collective diary , is a 2 , 400page mosaic documenting just two months in german history , january and february 1943 this was when nazi troops lost the epic battle for stalingrad and when many germans began to fear that they might not win the war after all it was also a period of intense repression in germany and daily mass murder in death camps throughout the reich walter kempowski , who assembled the book from documentary sources and from thousands of texts he received after appealing for them in newspaper advertisements , is a wellknown german novelist he was born in the eastern port of rostock and moved to hamburg as a young man , but later made the mistake of returning to visit his family in what had become east germany there he was arrested with his mother and brother all three were convicted of spying , and mr kempowski spent eight years in prison before being allowed to return to the west most of mr kempowski s novels deal with the impact of great events on normal families , including his own several have been made into films but nothing he has written can be compared to echolot \( in german , echolot is the word for the depthfinder used by submarines \) what the voices say the public reading in the parochialkirche in berlin lasted 20 hours , only long enough to present a small sample of the work the mood was solemn , and many of the thousands of people who attended appeared deeply moved passages from echolot for the first days of january are typical of the whole work dear parents , all i ask is that you not cry too much when you learn i am no more , a german soldier wrote home from russia after explaining that the army s position was hopeless on the same day , a mother wrote to her son , also serving in russia , that she was furious to learn that the christmas cake she sent him had not arrived she added , be sure to keep your feet dry on jan 5 , the nazi propaganda minister , josef goebbels felt uneasy the situation in stalingrad is really becoming serious , he wrote in his journal the whole east has once again become a major problem a polish jew named leon wells emerged that day from two days of hiding in a cramped , dark cellar with 13 other terrified refugees after a nazi action in lemberg it was an awful sight , he wrote bodies were everywhere also on jan 5 , the german press office issued a onesentence directive forbidding newspapers to mention the harshness of the climate in the region around stalingrad heinrich himmler ordered the construction of bordellos for german troops in occupied france which assure good medical controls to prevent venereal disease and hans scholl , a 25yearold medical student who was executed six weeks later for distributing antiwar leaflets , wrote to a girlfriend that commitment to freedom has always been my guiding principle publisher is surprised mr kempowski spent six years collecting and cataloguing the contents , though he wrote none of it himself the publishers , imagining that public interest would be limited , printed 6 , 000 fourvolume sets priced at 200 they were sold in less than a week , and in the six months since then , more than 20 , 000 additional sets have been printed and sold each day s story is told by a new set of observers , victims , survivors and murderers , but some entries form patterns that resound throughout the book the first entry for each day , for example , is from dr theodor morell , hitler s personal physician , noting which drugs he gave his patient that day most days include notations from the register of the jewish cemetery in berlin , almost all of them recording suicides and each day ends with notes from the death camp at auschwitz two thousand men , women and children arrived in a transport from the bialystok ghetto , daunta czech , an auschwitz clerk , wrote on feb 8 after selection , 1 , 830 of the deportees were killed in gas chambers the book , however , is much more than just a catalogue of evil it is a rich chronicle of daily life , told by hundreds of ordinary people as well as historical figures ranging from roosevelt , churchill and pope pius xii to raymond chandler , carl gustav jung and anais nin 'rich lode' or a 'mess' \? a critic in the berliner zeitung wrote 'echolot' makes us think about human relations and about germany , about narrowminded and stupid people , about cowardly obedience but also about moral courage and honor kempowski has given us two months of our history and invited us to take responsibility for it most other critics have been equally enthusiastic one called the book a grand and monumental concert of voices , a rich lode in which we discover the inner nature of human lives at a decisive moment but because kempowski merely assembled echolot , rather than writing it , some critics have questioned its value they complain that it is too long and repetitive and that it does not lead the reader toward a clear conclusion it is a chaotic mess , asserted marcel reichranicki , host of germany s most popular literary television program it has nothing whatever in common with literature even many admirers of the book do not recommend that it be read from start to finish it is , however , a fascinating work to open at random reading just one day s entries is enough to make one understand why it has stirred such interest in germany the point of the book mr kempowski briefly took part in the marathon reading in berlin , and in an interview afterward he called the work a collection of subjective reactions which together produce something very objective my idea , he continued , is to present a collage , to give life to dead people ranging from top nazis to resistance fighters to thomas mann in his california exile it is a mirror full of images which , in the end , are reduced to a single point i cannot name this point to look for a message in 'echolot' is like looking for a message in the bible the work itself , taken as a whole , is the message evidently weakened by a recent stroke , kempowski sipped coffee and quietly suggested that world war ii changed the world irrevocably and that humanity appeared not to have learned from its horrors who lost the war \? he asked it s a hard question to answer not just germany , that s for sure the british empire never surfaced again , and france lost a great deal of its identity the whole world was set on a course of destruction speaking of the trouble in bosnia and herzegovina , he said , the destruction of the old bridge in mostar can be seen as just another delayed consequence of world war ii , because it reflects the desire to destroy history and to wipe away the idea that people can live together at his country home near bremen , mr kempowski is building another archive with three assistants he wants to produce a second echolot covering the last year of world war ii in 1999 i will be 70 years old , and the century and the millennium will both be ending , he said that would be a fine time to publish 'echolot ii , ' would n't you say \?

to the editor regarding the sept 25 soapbox , in housing court not a clue , most housing court judges come from tenant advocacy backgrounds and are loathe to order evictions this judicial philosophy is particularly onerous to small owners of lowincome housing , who often have lower incomes than the total welfare package of many of their tenants the small owners must struggle in housing court with either extremely poor legal representation or with none they usually do better with none lawyers do n't make enough money from these clients to motivate them to do a decent job to be able to keep their buildings , small owners need free or affordable legal assistance a fair way to provide it , without burdening taxpayers , would be to set up a small owners' legal defense fund financed by an annual surcharge on those large owners who have benefited from the deregulation of luxury apartments it costs taxpayers 400 a month to run every apartment taken over by the city small owners who stay in business save millions of taxpayer dollars small owners are worth saving richard boodman manhattan the writer is chairman of the housing court committee of the small property owners of new york
as a brighton beach subway train thundered overhead , a hit man pumped one fatal bullet into the back of oleg korataev s head it took four rounds in the face and chest to finish off another suspected gangster , yanik magasayev alexandre graber died thousands of miles away in a hail of automatic gunfire near the brighton beach boardwalk , a gunman ambushed naum raichel , severely wounding him with three bullets in his chest and stomach that same day in germany , mr raichel s brother , simeon , was beaten into unconsciousness and suffered a brain concussion although the five murder and assault cases occurred this year in new york , moscow and berlin , federal and new york city lawenforcement officials say the crimes have a common root cause according to the officials , a new wave of callous russian organizedcrime figures , with ties to brighton beach and the former republics of the soviet union , is responsible for the outburst of violence the brighton beach and sheepshead bay sections of brooklyn have been headquarters for a smattering of emigre russian crime gangs since the 1970 s , when the soviet union permitted the first of about 300 , 000 people to emigrate to the united states but the disintegration of the soviet union in 1991 spawned thousands of powerful crime gangs collectively known as the russian mafia and some of these groups , officials warn , are establishing bases among emigre communities in the united states , particularly in south brooklyn the ones coming in now are more violent and better organized than the oldtimers , says jim e moody , chief of the federal bureau of investigation s organizedcrime section they are maintaining links to gangs in moscow and other places in the old soviet union with money flowing back and forth to combat the latest organizedcrime threat , the justice department in january elevated the russian mafia to the highest investigative priority , the same level as the american and sicilian mafias , asian organizedcrime groups and colombian cocaine cartels because of the magnitude of the problem in the new york area , the fbi created a russian squad in its new york office in may , the first fbi unit in the country to deal exclusively with russian criminals we did n't establish the squad on a whim , said william a gavin , the head of the fbi office in new york they are dangerous , and our aim is not to allow them to gain a foothold as the italianamerican families did a disturbing sign of the russian mafia s emergence in america , officials acknowledged , is the arrival of vyacheslav kirillovich ivankov , whom russian police identify as a vor v zakone russian for a thiefinlaw the top criminal category in the old soviet union lawenforcement officials said they feared that mr ivankov s mission is to oversee and enlarge operations involving emigre racketeers here and gangsters in russia 'the first team' extends its influence in the 1970 s and early 1980 s , a wave of russianborn criminals arrived in new york and lived mainly in south brooklyn , where they concentrated largely on whitecollar crimes , especially frauds involving gasoline taxes , medicare payments and counterfeit credit cards because of the cold war and travel bans , this group had little contact with criminals in the soviet union the newcomers who have arrived in america in the last three years are labeled the first team by detectives and federal agents investigators say they have not only taken over the whitecollar crimes established by their predecessors but have expanded into other rackets , including narcotics trafficking , money laundering , extortion of emigre merchants and prostitution and drug enforcement administration agents say they have uncovered concrete evidence showing that a russian gang from brooklyn imported heroin and for the first time sold it to mobsters working for traditional american mafia families previously , veteran american mobsters imported drugs through their own networks or bought it from nonrussian suppliers while many federal lawenforcement officials portray the russian groups as a significant problem , some state prosecutors and investigators are dubious about their overall importance in the underworld we do n't see any coordination from russia or the other republics , said eric seidel , the chief of the organizedcrime bureau in the brooklyn district attorney s office there is no evidence of largescale violence or that the russians are dominant in any specific racket peter grinenko , an investigator in the brooklyn district attorney s office who speaks russian and has been working on russian crime cases in the new york area for 13 years , said the emigre racketeers in america have no defined organizational structures like those of the mafia as individuals , they are into scams and shakedowns to lay their hands on money any way they can , mr grinenko said but as organized crime groups go in america , they are a flea on a horse feeling secure in brighton beach
tokyo , oct 24 the toyota motor corporation wants a more youthful look not for its cars but for itself japan s largest automobile company has decided to set age limits for managers of certain ranks from now on , the company said last week , its deputy general managers can be no older than 53 and section chiefs no older than 50 managers who reach the age limits will be given a task like longterm strategy development in which they will have no subordinates but will receive the same salary a toyota spokesman said the move was intended to rejuvenate the management ranks japanese companies are realizing that while their factories might be second to none , their whitecollar work forces are bloated and inefficient another reason for toyota s move is to try to retain the seniority system , in which pay and status increase throughout one s career with baby boomers in their 40 s , more room must be cleared for them to be promoted by moving out older managers the spokesman said toyota did not fear agediscrimination lawsuits because employees accepted what is best for the company he said a relatively small number of the company s 1 , 000 deputy general managers and 2 , 700 section chiefs were over the new age limits the nissan motor company , toyota s main rival , has already set age limits for some positions nissan , japan s no 2 auto maker , is losing money and taking more drastic measures to cut its costs a nissan spokesman said today that the company was accelerating its plan to reduce its work force the company had a goal of reaching 48 , 000 employees by march 1996 , down from 53 , 000 in march 1993 but the goal for the reduction is being pushed forward , he said he said that the company had not laid out goals for reducing the work force further , but that setting targets was being considered
among the myriad pieces of information an investor can sort through to pick a mutual fund , are ratings or rankings more useful \? rankings , of course , says a michael lipper , who heads his own mutual fund research company where funds are ranked by performance in a recent study sent to fund industry executives , he sharply criticizes ratings , epitomized by the system used by his big rival , morningstar inc , the research company based in chicago while it is easy to dismiss mr lipper s complaint as the badmouthing of a competitor , he is highlighting an important debate for the investor and some of his points are well taken , although some are not lipper analytical services inc , of summit , nj , produces its own mutual fund reports , which are widely distributed in the industry and often quoted by fund companies in advertisements lipper breaks down the fund universe into many small categories and ranks funds over various time periods it is a rare fund group that cannot find a period in which at least one of its funds did well morningstar , by contrast , rates funds in four broad categories on a scale of one star \( poor \) to five \( excellent \) , based largely on performance over the last 3 , 5 and 10 years the ratings are adjusted for risk monthtomonth volatility of performance and are also used by funds in advertising \( morningstar also separates its risk and return ratings in some publications , producing a twosymbol rating in which , for example , 54 means high past return and relatively low past risk that rating is published in the new york times on saturdays \) in midjune , the securities and exchange commission announced it was looking for a simple measure of a fund s risk that would become an industry standard in advertising mr lipper argues that investors are giving more credibility to ratings than is warranted he says it is often a bad idea to buy fivestar funds because they may later perform poorly he has a point no system based on the past will always work in the future morningstar does not dispute that people who use the stars as magic bullets are making a mistake , said john rekenthaler , editor of morningstar mutual funds , who urges using the ratings as one tool among many what morningstar does dispute is the study s distinction between rankings and ratings ranking , the study says , is a nonjudgmental mathematical process ratings are subjective evaluations even when they use mathematical systems , the elements of the rating formula emphasize some fund characteristics over others , the study said mr rekenthaler counters that lipper s ratings are subjective , too , in that decisions about how to group funds greatly influence their relative standing the lipper study measured the performance of morningstar s fivestar funds at the beginning of each year from 1990 through 1993 , and found that more than half of the equity funds underperformed the average equity fund in the subsequent 12 months in addition , fivestar ratings did not help many investors avoid big losses in 1990 , the most recent negative year for equity funds thirtytwo percent of fivestar funds lost 10 percent or more that year , while only 27 percent of all equity funds had a loss that size , the study said further , mr lipper asserts that a fivestar strategy puts investors in the wrong fund at the wrong time at the end of 1992 , when overseas funds were poised to take off , none had five stars , he pointed out lipper can argue that using smaller categories avoids that problem , though its focus on total return encourages a similar misstep both lipper and morningstar are liable to fall into a different trap if one fund takes on extra risk and wins , it will excel but the risk taking can also backfire without warning for example , managers intermediate mortgage fund , a morningstar fivestar fund , was also lipper s topranked united states mortgage fund for the five years ended in 1993 neither system prepared investors for the fund s losing 223 percent in 1994 through june the derivatives that accelerated its performance while interest rates fell damaged it when rates rose ken gregory , editor of the noload fund analyst in san francisco , faults the lipper study s methodology , saying the 12 months studied are too short a time period and charles trzcinka , associate professor of finance at the state university of new york at buffalo , says lipper is setting a standard that no fund rating system can reach morningstar agrees that many fivestar funds come from sectors that have performed well recently and may suffer some shortterm underperformance but it points out that it does not advise a strategy of rotating into those funds that s not to say morningstar s ratings are perfect there are problems with any sort of rating system that tries to cover all funds , mr gregory said for example , applestoapples comparisons are difficult because morningstar s ratings are broken down only broadly , into equity funds , taxable bond funds , hybrids of those two and municipal bond funds that was done to avoid creating many topranked funds in many small groups , mr rekenthaler said indeed , the national association of securities dealers now forces funds to disclose the size of a group in advertisements using rankings graph showing quarterly returns and morningstar s rating of managers intermediate mortgage fund from 1991 to 1994 \( source morningstar inc \)
boston mark s ferber loved kaleidoscopes he owned 64 and claimed their dizzying patterns and unrelated parts were a metaphor for his work putting together complicated municipal finance deals they adorned his office and , as he twisted their cylinders , he could alter his vision of the city far below , especially boston harbor cleaning up the polluted harbor had become the nation s biggest public works project and , by the late 1980 s , created a bounty of fees for wall street as a partner at prestigious lazard freres company , mr ferber was the lead financial strategist on the 6 billion project carrying on in the tradition of urban financial wizardry forged by lazard s superstar , felix g rohatyn for anyone wanting to do municipal finance business here , mr ferber was the one to see with the political connections and the brainpower to get the job done so great were mr ferber s skills that even merrill lynch company , the nation s biggest broker , wanted , and got , him and just how it did that is now the talk of municipal finance merrill paid a retainer to lazard for mr ferber to steer business to merrill in a highly unusual feesplitting contract that netted both firms millions of dollars the arrangement was approved by top executives at both firms and contained provisions keeping its existence a secret the contract was a meshing of lazard s brains and merrill s brawn lazard was the nation s preeminent financial adviser to municipalities and merrill was the biggest seller of municipal bonds these are two distinct functions that government agencies want to keep separate but the contract blurred them it secretly gave mr ferber , who was paid for his independent judgment , a powerful financial incentive to compromise his independence and refer business to merrill and the cities and state agencies , including the one cleaning up boston harbor , that did business with mr ferber were never to know of this when they picked merrill to sell bonds and handle other complicated financial matters this contract , in force from 1989 to early 1993 , brought in more than 6 million in fees that the two firms split , and some 26 million in retainer payments from merrill to lazard and millions more flowed directly to merrill from mr ferber s clients the arrangement , which became public last summer , is now the subject of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission , to see if it violated antifraud provisions of the nation s securities laws by failing to disclose important information to clients in boston , the united states attorney s office is also investigating the contract though a spokesman there would not comment already , the massachusetts inspector general , the state s top investigator , has issued a blistering report calling the contract a quid pro quo that may cost taxpayers millions of dollars the arrangement is simply outrageous , said richard y roberts , an sec commissioner and municipal finance expert the entering of an undisclosed contract by an independent investment adviser violates everything an investment adviser is supposed to be , mr roberts said i hire an investment adviser to give me prudent objective advice and they have a financial incentive to skew the business to a particular party \? that s troubling , and if i were a client , i 'd have a fit for their part , mr ferber , lazard and merrill say they did nothing improper and that no public money was lost the case , troubling under any circumstances , could n't come at a worse time for municipal finance , an industry that has been rocked by scandals involving payoffs and cronyism these problems came to the fore again last week with the death , apparently from a drug overdose , of wardell r lazard his municipal finance firm , w r lazard company , is being investigated by the manhattan district attorney s office over fees from deals with a new york city agency the two lazard firms are not related , but the issues facing both are similar political connections and business favoritism the problems in municipal finance stem from the fact that elected politicians are in a position to dole out lucrative municipal business the selling of bonds to build dormitories , bridges and roads , among other things until recently , municipal finance bankers , like mr ferber , could contribute to local political campaigns that has been halted , but the ability remains to befriend politicians and influence their decisions about who on wall street gets to sell the bonds right now , more than 70 , 000 municipalities have issued more than 12 trillion in bonds more bonds than issued by corporations and many of those municipal issuers are worried that other dubious arrangements , like merrill and lazard s , have yet to be uncovered we do n't know what other side deals there might be , said milton t wells , executive director of the national association of state treasurers it s frightening we are all concerned about this happening in our own jurisdictions with a different set of actors
even as a youth , o j simpson was the one with all the charm , never out of place in any situation , always in control al cowlings was bigger , even hulking , and somehow less graceful o j moved through the streets of potrero hill in san francisco with the ease of a natural leader a c was never far behind , looking to his friend as a model , a brother and even a father figure they were rarely apart old friends of mr simpson and mr cowlings , trying to sort out the bewildering developments that concluded with their arrests on friday night after a 50mile pursuit by the los angeles police , said that at least one aspect of the saga did not surprise them in the end , it was mr cowlings at mr simpson s side i know how al was thinking , said joe bell , a friend of both men from their youth he was thinking , 'this is o j this is my friend i ca n't lose the best friend i ever had' the lives of mr cowlings and mr simpson have run together in improbable ways they lived in the same san francisco housing project they played football together in high school , then at two different colleges after mr simpson joined the professional ranks with the buffalo bills , mr cowlings followed a year later mr simpson was the dashing running back , with the crisp public persona that was a natural for the television cameras and magazine covers mr cowlings was an allamerican in his own right , but he played the less glamorous position of defensive end and was confined to a background role mr cowlings s career ended up following a journeyman s course , but the two friends finished up together with the san francisco 49'ers , retiring at the same time over the last several years , mr cowlings seemed resigned to live in his friend s shadow mr cowlings went into business ventures with mr simpson , and he even served as his standin and double in movies finally , on friday night , as mr simpson slumped in the back of mr cowlings s car with a gun to his own head , it was mr cowlings who conducted the last frantic negotiations with the police that ended with mr simpson s surrender mr cowlings , who turned 47 on friday , was arrested that night and charged with harboring a fugitive , but when he was released yesterday morning on a 250 , 000 bond , his role was still unclear crucial questions had he helped mr simpson elude the police for several hours on friday as they sought to arrest him for the murders of mr simpson s former wife and a friend of hers \? or had mr cowlings tried to talk mr simpson out of running away and perhaps even taking his own life \? people who know both men said they were sure that mr cowlings had tried to help mr simpson find a way to face the charges during those desperate moments i can imagine what al was saying to him , said tom day , a former player and coach on the bills he was telling him , 'you 've got to face this thing it 'll never go away , and there will be a stigma on your kids' in a news conference yesterday , the los angeles district attorney , gil garcetti , was asked whether mr cowlings would be prosecuted for helping mr simpson he replied a decision had not yet been made mr simpson , who will also turn 47 soon , on july 9 , grew up in the same poor neighborhood in san francisco as mr cowlings they became friends when they played football at galileo high school , where mr cowlings was a year behind in school with a few other friends , they formed a street gang , the superiors mr simpson , the leader , was adept at talking himself and the others out of fights but mr bell , who was also in the group , said that mr cowlings , who stood 6foot3 and weighed about 230 at the age of 16 , was constantly embroiled in one confrontation or another mr cowlings , who stuttered as a youth , was not so much tough , mr bell said , as he was ill at ease mr simpson had a gift when it came to wheeling and dealing , mr bell said none of us had fathers at home , including al , said mr bell , who now owns a thrift shop in richmond , calif , about 20 miles northeast of san francisco , so o j became like a father mr cowlings trusted mr simpson so much that when he had trouble with his high school girlfriend , marguerite whitley , he asked mr simpson to talk to her for him ms whitley and mr simpson soon began dating and eventually married their dating at first enraged mr cowlings , who tried to turn over a car in which the couple were sitting but mr cowlings could not stay angry with mr simpson for long , and within weeks , they were friends again marguerite was a good friend of al s when she was married to o j , said charley ferguson , a former buffalo teammate of both men wherever mr simpson went , mr cowlings followed after mr simpson went to the city college of san francisco , mr cowlings enrolled there a year later when mr simpson transferred to the university of southern california , so did mr cowlings and after mr simpson went to the bills in 1969 , he helped persuade the bills to draft mr cowlings 1970 former teammates like mr ferguson said mr cowlings had never possessed the same intense drive as his best friend a few referred to him as a gentle giant while mr simpson broke records in buffalo , mr cowlings moved on to houston , los angeles and seattle before their football careers intersected once more back in san francisco as mr simpson made an easy transition into his life after sports , mr cowlings seemed to wander he worked as a bartender , got a few small acting roles and served informally as mr simpson s bodyguard while friends and associates said mr cowlings s loyalty toward mr simpson was unswerving , they noted that mr simpson s regard for mr cowlings was harder to figure out sometimes o j would put him down , said jackie cooper , the tennis director of the la quinta hotel , who said he was a close friend of mr cowlings once o j wanted a hotel room at la quinta he said , 'i do n't want a hotel room , i want a condo i'm not like a c i can pay' that time , i wondered if o j had any heart although mr simpson may have seemed the stronger and more disciplined of the two , he was often the one who needed mr cowlings to get along , be it at charity events in poor neighborhoods or simply when mr simpson needed to catch a plane he would take care of o j , mr cooper said he was his security photos al cowlings has been a close friend of o j simpson s since they played football together at a san francisco high school in this 1970 photo , mr cowlings , at right , is with mr simpson at the desert inn in las vegas \( associated press \) al cowlings , right , who drove the car carrying o j simpson during the police chase in southern california on friday , was arrested and driven to police headquarters in los angeles after mr simpson s surrender \( reuters \)
for years the crumbling walls and sloppy administration at kings county hospital center have made it the infirmary of last resort for the impoverished residents of central brooklyn now the head of new york city s health and hospitals corporation says that the conditions have deteriorated so badly that new york s largest public hospital is in imminent danger of losing its medical accreditation as a result , dr bruce siegel , the agency s president , said he was appointing a new executive director to oversee the 1 , 250bed hospital , and was authorizing the expenditure of several million dollars to bring it up to standard before a review in october by the nation s largest hospital regulatory group e louis larkins , who has run the hospital since last august , will be reassigned to new tasks in the corporation s central office , dr siegel said in an interview yesterday jean g leon , deputy executive director for quality management at harlem hospital center , will be the interim executive director dr siegel said that if it were inspected today , kings county would lose its accreditation because of problems with its administration , its medical records and its physical plant he said he did not believe that mr larkins could bring it up to standard , and said he hoped that ms leon , who has helped several city hospitals through the review process , could turn the hospital around in a few months trying for 'fighting chance' it s a herculean task , and maybe no one can do it , dr siegel said but at least we can try for a fighting chance mr larkins s secretary said he was not available for comment yesterday several city hospitals have lost their accreditation in the past , and kings county barely got accreditation in 1992 the loss does not mean that a hospital must close its doors , but it can affect insurance payments and staff recruitment , and is always considered a serious blow to the prestige of a hospital or its parent agency it would be a painful black mark , dr siegel said it would say that we 're not doing a good job among the most critical shortcomings at the hospital , he said , were its poor medical records the files and charts that document a patient s progress and vital information like medical history many such records are lying around the building unsorted and in boxes , he said , and staff members are often unable to find an important record when it is needed another issue surveyed by the regulatory group , the joint committee on accreditation of healthcare organizations , is the strength of a hospital s leadership , which dr siegel said has been deficient previous deficiencies cited they want to get a sense of whether there is a consistent message about quality and teamwork being projected from the top , he said we 're not getting that at all right now they talk to janitors about what they think about the leadership , direction and mission of the hospital , and our sense is they would find none of that in january 1993 , the hospital was cited by the state health department for scores of deficiencies , including poor record keeping , filthy eight and 16bed wards where most patients are kept , and numerous federal fire code violations , like deadend corridors and a lack of automatic sprinklers in storage areas dr siegel said he believed a crash spending program could repair many of the physical problems , but he said he remained worried about the issues of leadership and medical records new york is one of a few states that does not automatically cut off medicaid financing when a hospital loses its accreditation , although such a loss can lead to a later state inspection that could end in a cutoff such an action is considered highly unlikely , though , because the hospital is such a vital institution in central brooklyn , where many residents use its emergency room as their doctor s office kings county s last inspection by the regulatory group was in october 1991 , when the committee initially voted to withdraw its accreditation because of many of the problems that still afflict the hospital after the hospital challenged the initial vote , the committee conducted another review in april 1992 and upgraded its decision to that of conditional accreditation , pending a plan of correction that the hospital was required to submit after a followup survey in october 1992 , the hospital s status was upgraded to full accreditation ms leon , who said she expected to return to harlem hospital center after her work is done at kings county , said she has helped restore full accreditation to three local public hospitals that were in danger of losing it harlem , metropolitan hospital center , also in harlem , and lincoln medical and mental health center in the bronx but there will definitely be more difficulty at kings county , she said , just because it is the largest facility
los angeles , june 26 as prosecution and defense lawyers labored today to prepare for a preliminary hearing on thursday on the murder charges facing o j simpson , some indications emerged about how both sides view and may try the case the prosecution said it would go beyond presenting just a skeleton of evidence , as is often the case in preliminary hearings the rules permit us just to put on the investigating officers , said suzanne childs , the spokeswoman for the district attorney but we intend to put on other witnesses when prosecutors present a parade of witnesses at a preliminary hearing , they are often trying to minimize the risk of having their case thrown out of court for lack of probable cause , even though they may tip their hand as to how much evidence they have but sometimes the prosecutors present a little extra evidence in an effort to force the defense to tip its hand a bit as to how the case will unfold defense says it s ready ms childs would not say why the prosecution adopted its strategy but whatever the rationale , mr simpson s defense team said it would not be fooled either way its investigators were seen at the suspect s home throughout the weekend , at one point taking pictures and making measurements in the driveway that activity was another indication that the simpson case would probably turn in good part on large batches of physical and forensic evidence that both sides have collected , among them extensive samples of blood and tissue in fact , f lee bailey , one of the lead defense lawyers , said this afternoon in a telephone interview that he would not be surprised if prosecutors sought to delay the preliminary hearing to be able to complete tests on some of the samples in particular , he mentioned dna tests , which in theory can pinpoint the origin of blood , tissue and hair but which still provoke considerable debate about their value in criminal proceedings of course , mr bailey added , if they delay , they have to let o j out on bail because thursday is the deadline for getting the preliminary hearing under way highprofile case mr simpson , whose career in professional football and on television made him a familiar national figure long before he was arrested in the slaying of his former wife , nicole brown simpson , and one of her friends , ronald l goldman , is charged with two counts of firstdegree murder and is being held without bail in the men s central jail in downtown los angeles he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last monday should he go to trial and be convicted , he could face life in prison and maybe even the death penalty ms childs said the prosecution intended to go through with the preliminary hearing on thursday we 'll be ready , she said so will the defense , mr bailey said the prosecutors say they have the goods , so let 'em prove it , he said that s our defense always has been you say i 've done something criminal prove it if the preliminary hearing results in mr simpson being bound over for trial , there will be no effort to defend him on grounds of insanity , as prosecutors and even a member of the defense team have speculated , mr bailey added he also said no attempt would be made to change the location of a trial , despite an avalanche of pretrial publicity that led a judge to halt a grand jury inquiry last week insanity plea is dismissed speculation about an insanity plea is nonsense because in california the prosecution has to prove its case first before you even get to that question , mr bailey said it s outrageous that they would talk this way and convict o j even before a trial has been held as for requesting a new location for a trial a change of venue , in legal parlance mr bailey said that would not be a realistic remedy you ca n't get far enough away to escape the impact of nationwide , and even international , publicity , he said this case is now known about from one coast to the other and then some mr bailey said mr simpson had a credible alibi as to where he was on the night of june 12 , when ms simpson and mr goldman were fatally slashed outside ms simpson s condominium in the brentwood section of los angeles he says he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport , mr bailey said so , if he was home , he could n't have done it , could he \? mr bailey also insisted that mr simpson was not fleeing when he led the police on a lengthy , televised freeway cavalcade that ended with his arrest at his home , also in brentwood a chase in slow motion you ca n't call it a chase when it went as slow as that ride went , mr bailey argued that does n't qualify as flight from anything he said he was going home and he did go home so , he was n't running from doing something wrong the preliminary hearing will be in los angeles municipal court before judge patti jo mckay , who conducted mr simpson s arraignment in many instances , preliminary hearings last from a few minutes to a few hours , even when the charges are murder but in a highprofile case like the simpson case , there is always the possibility that the hearing could last days , maybe even weeks how long will the simpson case hearing run \? as long as it runs , mr bailey replied we 've got a lot of questions to ask let s see what they 've got most preliminary hearings result in the accused being bound over for trial first , you must establish that a crime has been committed , which is easy enough in this case , what with the pictures of the slashed bodies , said bradley w brunon , a prominent criminaldefense lawyer in los angeles then you saddle suspicion on the accused , tie him or her to the crime suspicion at this point , not proof beyond reasonable doubt only about 1 in 100 times does the hearing result in the charges being thrown out another wellknown los angeles defense lawyer , danny davis , said the preliminary hearing would also offer the defense an opportunity to infect the case with error , even if mr simpson were sent on to trial what the defense has a chance to do , he explained , is throw up as many roadblocks as it can and hope that somewhere along the line the judge rules wrong or the prosecution slips up then , when the trial actually starts , the defense can come in , point out the mistake and ask that the whole thing be thrown out you get away with that twice and it has been done before and o j walks some members of the grand jury that was taken off the simpson case have begun to talk about their experience , though none have been willing to be identified , since grand jury business is meant to be secret over the weekend , one told the los angeles times that though members of the panel had been warned not to watch , listen or read news reports about the simpson case , some jurors had nevertheless learned about the police tapes on which mr simpson curses and threatens his wife the only way you could avoid it was not watch tv , the juror was quoted as saying it was a surprise to us when it came on another juror told the newspaper that prosecutors had almost completed presenting their evidence when the order came down for the jury to stop work on the case the juror said the panel had been shown pictures of the bodies of ms simpson and mr goldman and described them as shocking this crime was such a blood mess , the juror added still another juror said , this was butchery , absolute butchery photos o j simpson s defense team is led by some of the bestknown lawyers in the country they include alan dershowitz , left , and his brother nathan , photographed in 1992 , when they represented leona helmsley in a taxevasion case f lee bailey , left in the 1982 photo at right , and mr simpson s main lawyer , robert l shapiro , with whom mr bailey has a long association mr shapiro represented mr bailey when the boston lawyer was charged with drunken driving in san francisco in 1982 \( united press international associated press \)
colombo , sri lanka , wednesday , aug 17 after one of the most violent campaigns since this island nation gained independence in 1948 , sri lankans voted on tuesday in parliamentary elections pitting the governing party against a daughter of the political family it ousted 17 years ago partial results in colombo at midmorning today indicated that the opposition people s alliance was heading for a clear parliamentary majority , sweeping most of the seats in 11 of the 15 voting districts that make up the country s electoral map a final breakdown of seats in the 225seat leislative assembly was not expected until later in the day two fundamental factors seem fairly certain first , if the opposition wins against the ruling united national party , sri lanka s freemarket , growthoriented economic policies are likely to remain in place second , there is little prospect of a breakthough in the bloody , 11year struggle waged by tamil rebels in the north and east of the country political rivalries much of the violence that gripped sri lanka in the monthlong campaign , however , arose from rivalry between political parties at least 18 people were killed and hundreds injured in shootings , firebombings and other attacks on tuesday the government put 50 , 000 troops and police officers on alert and imposed a curfew to limit the risk of further trouble , and only scattered clashes were reported at voting stations as if to remind the government of its powers , the secessionist rebel group known as the liberation tigers of tamil eelam blew up a 4 , 000ton navy ship at the kankesanthurai base on jaffna peninsula , killing at least two men , the sri lankan military said several others were missing military officers said that underwater commandos had apparently attached limpet mines to the vessel before dawn the tamil rebel group controls a besieged enclave on the northern tip of the island around the city of jaffna and has tied down units of the sri lankan army in contested pockets of tamilinhabited territory along the east coast the election contest has focused mainly on the united national party , which has held power here for 17 years , and the sri lanka freedom party , the leading force in the coalition of opposition groups power rests with president many political analysts had predicted that none of the 39 parties taking part would gain a majority in the 225seat assembly , leading to intense jockeying among smaller parties the race is further complicated by a political system under which ultimate power rests with the president , d b wijetunga , leader of the united national party , whose term does not expire until february mr wijetunge , who took office after his predecessor , ranasinghe premadasa , was assassinated by a suspected tamil suicide bomber in colombo 15 months ago , could try to frustrate an opposition victory by holding onto much of his power , including his posts as defense and finance minister this course is said to have been urged by officials who fear a wave of corruption trials and other acts of retribution if the opposition wins the opposition s candidate to become prime minister , chandrika bandaranaike kumaratunga , 48 , is the daughter of solomon and sirimavo bandaranaike , who served separately as prime minister in the 1950 s , 60 s and 70 s robust growth rates mrs kumaratunga has said that she will continue the freemarket economic policies that were adopted after her mother , a socialist , was defeated in the 1977 election , but seek to give them a human face the economic policies of the united national party government have produced annual growth rates in recent years of 5 to 7 percent a year , among the most robust in asia mrs kumaratunga has pledged to increase social welfare benefits and take other steps to help groups that have not benefited from sri lanka s recent boom , especially the rural poor but she has said that there would be no return to the nationalizations , stringent state economic controls and rationing that characterized her mother s tenure as prime minister in the 1970 s sri lanka s currency and stock markets held mostly firm through the campaign mrs kumaratunga has used a helicopter to barnstorm the country , drawing large crowds with speeches attacking the government for crony capitalism the corruption charges appear to have struck a chord , especially among the estimated two million firsttime voters who are too young to remember the economic stagnation and corruption reportedly associated with the bandaranaike government the government responded with fullpage newspaper ads with photographs of people lining up for bread , cooking fuel and milk powder under the rule of mrs bandaranaike both president wijetunge and mrs kumaranatunga have called for a renewal of negotiations with the liberation tigers , who have fought since 1983 for a separate state for the mostly hindu tamil ethnic minority nearly 75 percent of sri lanka s population of 17 million are buddhist sinhalese
to the editor a news article april 27 notes that in the aftermath of arrests on corruption charges of police officers in new york city s 30th precinct , the police department is analyzing the background and life experiences of the officers with the hope of finding some common traits that make up a corrupt cop profile while a comprehensive case review is under way of some 50 officers charged or convicted of a crime in the last 10 years , some preliminary observations , based on the background data of the 12 recent defendants in blue can be made before entering the department , many of the officers seem to have drifted from one place of employment to another none had had significant college experience this profile is shocking to those familiar with the recommendations of major commissions on improving police work over the last six decades the national commission on law observance and enforcement \( 1931 \) , the president s commission on law enforcement and administration of justice \( 1967 \) , the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations \( 1971 \) , the american bar association \( 1972 \) and the national advisory commission on criminal justice standards and goals \( 1973 \) have all called for a college degree as a basic requirement for entry into police departments these recommendations have mostly fallen on deaf ears a police officer s role encompasses much more than enforcement the primary duties relate to a range of encounters , which involve understanding human behavior , such as intervening in family crises , dealing with the psychotic and emotionally disturbed , and defusing fights and arguments , as well as other activities requiring physical courage , good judgment and knowledge of the law the time is now to rethink the standards for entry into the police profession by refining and upgrading entry requirements , we would invite only those who are truly interested , able and skilled , and who have achieved established academic criteria , to enter treating the complicated task of being a police officer today as anything less than a profession can no longer be tolerated police commissioner william j bratton has stated more than once that it is time the police department broke out of the blue cocoon and reached outside department confines to train and prepare recruits the commissioner has announced his intention to establish a civilian board to provide input and advice on training curriculum and methodology this would bring a fresh perspective into police training by those who are less subjective and who are knowledgeable in related disciplines repeated and systemic problems of corruption must be met with systemic change for too long we have avoided the radical solutions required in favor of departmental reorganization permanent improvement begins with recruitment , screening and training , creating an environment in which each officer can become a police professional it s time to move policing into the university and expose officers to the humanities , sciences , modern technologies , ethical issues and knowledge of the multidimensional aspects of crime and its impact on society a useful model that demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating police training and university education is the city universitypolice department cadet corps program , which changes the way police are recruited , screened and trained its purpose is not merely to modify training , but also to alter the orientation of young people preparing for police work by emphasizing the helping or service responsibilities of the police role , as well as the law enforcement role the program recognizes that the alliance between the police department and the university can provide a countervailing force against the powerful acculturation process that accompanies police department entry a preparatory school for public service and public safety , drawing students throughout the city , would introduce opportunities in police and other public safety professions , as well as equip them with an education that allows them to make choices for advanced education in law schools and graduate schools the 11th grade is not too early to begin policing as a profession is long overdue gerald w lynch president , john jay college of criminal justice , cuny new york , may 2 , 1994 drawing

none of those players can touch him in postseason production and in super bowl rings it has been quite a ride for smith , age 24 , 5 feet 9 inches and 209 pounds , who is in only his fourth season from the university of florida emmitt is such a great football player , said jimmy johnson , the dallas coach i 've tried to analyze why he s so good he s the best northsouth runner i 've ever seen he gives you subtle moves but he s still always headed toward the goal line there is no wasted motion when we were evaluating him for the draft , they said he did n't have great speed he made 50yard runs , 65yard runs , 75yard runs and he was playing against some of the best football players in the country i did n't want to hear anything about speed the guy is a performer and he has as much pride as any football player i 've ever been around pride and toughness and character that sums up smith he fought for a big contract through training camp and through the cowboys' first two games both losses before finally reaching terms the dallas owner , jerry jones , and johnson believed the cowboys could win big without smith he proved both wrong and because of that pride , smith has put the ugly contract negotiations behind him but has said that he will never forget the turmoil he suffered turmoil from jones that smith felt was unjust even after last year s super bowl , smith predicted that he would have to fight for his value and that the cowboys did not fully appreciate him he predicted that aikman would sign more easily than he would and did not understand the disparity in treatment between quarterback and running back he was right but all he did was come back , not sulk and play through pain , including a leg injury in november and a separated shoulder in the regularseason finale victory against the giants that victory clinched the nfc east title and gained dallas homefield advantage throughout the playoffs that game may forever be his signature game , even more than this super bowl smith and aikman now join a long , impressive list of super bowl winners who featured a dominant back coupled with a sturdy quarterback , which is a required formula to win the championship harris and bradshaw craig and montana csonka and griese in fact , smith joins csonka as the only backs to rush for 100plus yards in consecutive super bowls smith s teammates view him as a constant source of inspiration once dallas had reached a 1313 tie , they went ahead on smith s 15yard scoring run he ran on seven of eight plays in that thirdquarter drive and gained 61 of dallas' 64 total yards and then , late in the game , with dallas at the bills' 1yard line and facing fourth down , he scored to make it 2713 and sealed the victory the only reason we went for that on fourth down is because we had emmitt , johnson said if emmitt had not been in there , we would have kicked the field goal what s next for smith \? he said he wants a 2 , 000yard rushing season five or six more super bowl rings would be nice there is so much more to definitely come , and i have a lot of room to grow as a football player and as a person , smith said my high school coach once told me that if you 're satisfied , you 're through and there is nowhere else for you to go obviously , it was a lesson that stuck smith said that no one individual is bigger than the unit on the dallas cowboys that may be true , but the way that dallas struggled without him and soared with him , this is one time that his performance speaks much louder than those words on super bowl sunday , no cowboys star shined as brightly as smith he is , truly , an impact player in his absence at the start , he was a focus of this nfl season present at the end , he was still the focus of the season emmitt makes this team go on the field and behind the scenes , said offensive guard nate newton we 've got great players , but everybody latches onto emmitt in some way and he has taken us all on one heck of a ride photo i'm quite sure once we get back in the swing of things , said emmitt smith , once the dust settles , we 'll start thinking about threepeat \( barton silverman the new york times \)

las vegas , nev , sept 18 meldrick taylor used much of last week to expound on the virtues of vindication , to say how he would get even with julio cesar chavez , to point out that his nemesis of four years ago had little left in the way of skills predicting the end for mexico s legendary champion while proclaiming the rebirth of his own career in their rematch , taylor added , eighthround knockout right round , wrong fighter on saturday night chavez summoned the determination and resilience many of his detractors believed were lost to advancing age he rocked taylor s world with a booming left hook and retained his world boxing council superlightweight title via an eighthround technical knockout chavez won his 92d fight against one loss and one draw taylor fell to 3241 , and was knocked out for the third time in his last five fights before a roaring , soldout crowd of 15 , 222 at the mgm grand garden , many of whom came from mexico to see chavez the night after mexican independence day , chavez liberated himself from the shot fighter label put upon him after two dismal performances against frankie randall this year to all those who thought i was done , said chavez , 32 , through his interpreter , gladys rosa , this is for them certainly old men are old , but they keep going strong , do n't they \? chavez , who trailed badly on the scorecards when he knocked out taylor with two seconds left on march 17 , 1990 , trailed early in this one but he forced taylor into parrying in the middle of the ring with him , and that strategy again unraveled taylor s plans for an upset mills lane ended the fight 1 minute 41 seconds into the round , with blood dripping from taylor s mouth as chavez landed several blows to his head moments earlier , chavez sent him down with a left hook to the chin over taylor s righthand lead in a delayed reaction , taylor lost his footing and began going backward , almost performing a backward somersault as he hit the canvas lane counted to eight and let him continue , but chavez began wailing away to end the bout and resurrect his career promoted by don king , the card totaled 14 million in gross gate receipts and featured a record six world title bouts , four of which were shown on pay per view frankie randall \( wba junior welterweight \) , gabriel ruelas \( wbc super featherweight \) and vincent pettway \( ibf junior middleweight \) emerged with new titles on the card , while felix trinidad rallied to keep his ibf welterweight title and the wbc strawweight king , ricardo lopez , retained his belt with a firstround knockout the card featured 14 knockdowns and wild exchanges , none of which was more exciting than the exhibition by taylor and chavez in the sixth round bobbing and weaving and scoring in bunches , taylor dictated the opening rounds , white tassels dangling from his red satin shorts with violet trim he and chavez exchanged blows after the bell in the third round , and taylor held his hands aloft after nailing chavez in the fourth round with leftright combination but two onepoint deductions for a low head butt in the third round and a low blow in the sixth round forced him into chavez s fight , a closequartered brawl waged with righthand bombs more than straight left jabs by the end of the sixth , with the crowd on their feet and chavez finally landing consistently enough to back taylor up , the champion seized control judge malcolm bulner of australia had chavez ahead 6964 after seven rounds , while dave brown of british columbia and daniel vandewiele of brussels had the fight even at 66 i thought mills stepped in too early , said taylor , although his trainer , willie rush , had no complaint of the stoppage he s a great champion i just got away from my fight i should of kept my distance for chavez , who made 1 million to taylor s 400 , 000 and may have fought his last fight at the 140pound level , the victory sets up a potential welterweight showdown sometime late this year or early 1995 with either pernell whitaker or randall , whom king said have signed a deal to fight whitaker must first defend his title against buddy mcgirt in norfolk , va , oct 1 say it again , 'julio is back , ' king yelled as his fighter walked from the ring saturday judging from the glazed look in taylor s eyes , no one posed a challenge to his words indeed , chavez had returned , triumphantly but at 32 , one can only wonder for how long punch lines don king unleashed one of his most emotional verbal tirades at the postfight news conference saturday night , insinuating he might retire but sunday , he had another news conference to say he had reconsidered king was upset over what he called the bigotry and racism directed toward him , attacking rivals , the news media and anyone else obstructing his path felix trinidad was floored in the second round before knocking out luis ramon \( yory boy \) campas with a stunning barrage at 2 41 of the fourth round , giving campas his first pro loss in 57 fights photo referee mills lane with meldrick taylor after mills ordered the fighter to stop in the 8th round julio cesar chavez celebrating in opposite corner \( reuters \)
white plains , sept 21 ronald jackson likes to compare himself with marion s barry jr and adam clayton powell jr mr jackson , 50 , has been convicted twice of using his position on the local public housing board for illegal gains and twice , his neighbors and constituents have returned him to office as their tenant representative mr jackson was reelected this spring with barely a moment to reflect on the conviction that forced him to resign from the board of the white plains housing authority and some in white plains are upset by the situation it would be nice if the law said , 'if you commit a crime , you can no longer hold office , ' said robert feder , a lawyer , who is an appointed board member but we have a tradition in this country of electing charismatic officials who have n't complied with the law for his part , mr jackson is unrepentant he attributes his 1991 conviction on forgery charges to alcohol abuse and contends that his enemies set him up in his recent conviction for attempted bribery if i 've done something so wrong that is so detrimental to this community , then the community would n't want me back , he said , pounding a park bench like a pulpit but the tenants want me runnett green certainly feels that way he s the only one who helps , said ms green , a mother of three grown children who has voted for mr jackson he 'll travel all over to find out what s going on in the buildings he 'll get on a situtation and find out what needs to be done a former janitor for the metronorth commuter railroad , who was dismissed for chronic absenteeism , and a selfdescribed recovering alcoholic , mr jackson has been elected to the sevenmember housing board every two years since 1980 two members are elected and five are appointed by the mayor he was convicted in june of asking a contractor for a 400 bribe and , as required by law , he resigned upon conviction eight days later , when a new election was held among tenants , mr jackson was returned to office in 1991 , he pleaded guilty to stealing and forging a 460 housing authority check he received probation and was reelected the next year some local officials hoped that when the court sentenced mr jackson on the attempted bribery charge , the judge would do what federal and local officials had failed to do bar him from office but they were disappointed earlier this month , judge john carey of westchester county court sentenced mr jackson to probation for five years , community service and , if necessary , drug and alcohol treatment , but refused to remove him from the housing board , saying that to do so would disenfranchise the voters the authority operates 712 units of subsidized housing at three locations it follows the guidelines of the federal department of housing and urban development , which provides it with 2 million a year , and is governed by state law and its own policy none of the laws or guidelines clearly provide for the removal of an elected official , and mayor sy schulman has said he does not plan to seek mr jackson s ouster hud cannot remove board members , but it can limit their participation by barring them from voting on or discussing issues that involve hud funds since his first conviction , hud has had such temporary sanctions against mr jackson now , the agency is considering extending those sanctions , a process called debarment , which can be imposed for three years to life all we can do is say , 'you cannot participate in our programs , ' said emmett n roden , an assistant general counsel for hud in washington we cannot say , 'undo the election' we are just interested in protecting our programs from certain people rather than punishing them ourselves mr jackson s fate is therefore up to the authority s tenants having lived in the largest housing complex , winbrook apartments , for 26 years , mr jackson has no shortage of friends out of 1 , 400 residents eligible to vote in the june election , only 109 cast ballots mr jackson won , 62 to 47 he has also gone on the offensive , suing the authority for 12 million for enforcing hud s sanctions against him and challenging hud s debarment proceedings a state supreme court judge ruled against mr jackson s lawsuit against the housing authority in august , but he is appealing i write letters , he said i make noise people know me next year , i might run for white plains common council let them try and stop me some residents say that his battles may be the secret to mr jackson s popularity robert snipes , 50 , chairman of the white plains tenant council , has tried and failed to win mr jackson s seat on the housing authority s board three times i was not surprised when he won again , said mr snipes , an examiner for the westchester county social services department he has had a long running battle with the housing authority and that is only making him a martyr to the tenants naturally , the tenants are going to be sympathetic to someone who is beat up on by the authority mr jackson s conflicts with the authority go beyond his crimes the authority has repeatedly taken him to court for not paying the 213 rent on the twobedroom apartment where he lives alone mr jackson said he has had trouble paying the rent because his 125 monthly board stipend is being garnisheed for unpaid child support and his social security checks , for disability relating to a childhood foot injury , are being withheld to recover payments he received improperly still , his supporters are unwavering in their loyalty he will stand up for me , said elizabeth hughie , 48 , a longtime resident of the winbrook apartments what he did , he did to himself he did n't hurt me photo if i 've done something so wrong that is so detrimental to this community , then the community would n't want me back , said ronald jackson in white plains but the tenants want me \( jim estrin the new york times \)
what had been official in the american league east standing for 16 days was confirmed in convincing fashion last night there are new bullies in baseball s nastiest neighborhood and they do not wear blue uniforms or play indoors they wear pinstripes and live in the bronx they are the yankees if the twotime defending world series champion blue jays lurked as the final barrier to overcome for the yankees to validate themselves as the favorites in the division , then they succeeded with a flourish by pounding dave stewart and cruising to a 61 victory at yankee stadium while it was only one game among 162 , only one night in may , there was neither fear nor nerves from the yankees as they dominated toronto behind fluridden terry mulholland s first complete game of the season regardless of what the yankees uttered or muttered publicly , this is an important twogame series , even if the jays are now wallowing eight games behind the firstplace bullies since this was the first chance for the new yankees to show the ailing jays how stylish they have become since being tied for firstplace with toronto on eight occasions last year and never grabbing the premier spot alone , it was pivotal it was a chance to send the first message and the yankees did so by pushing the jays to their eighth straight road loss they were the world champions last year , said jim leyritz , whose tworun homer off stewart in the second inning put the yankees ahead to stay this is a whole new year we got a whole new ball club here and feel like we really can make a run at it with mulholland pitching his sweetest game as a yankee against the team he defeated in game 2 of the world series for philadelphia last october , with wade boggs returning from a bruisedrib injury to drill a homer in his first atbat , with leyritz continuing to be leyritz by arriving late for a mandatory afternoon workout , incurring a fine and then crushing the decisive homer , the yanks continued winning and continued playing like the finest team in baseball with a 2913 record last october , that moniker belonged solely to the jays we got to take advantage of them right now , said luis polonia when they get hot , they get nasty this is a perfect chance for us to get all over them but most of the robotic yankees were reluctant to revel in their 13th victory in 16 games mulholland was too ill to discuss achieving the complete game he had sought since being traded to new york in february and was asleep in the trainer s room 45 minutes after he struck out john olerud to end the game by using his slider and curve and keeping the jays offbalance by pitching to both sides of the plate , mulholland erased the memory of his abysmal sixrun outing against minnesota last wednesday with a nifty fivehitter terry had a problem holding things down , manager buck showalter said of his sick pitcher he did n't have a problem keeping the ball down after roberto alomar swatted a homer in the first and paul molitor walked , it looked like another one of the mismatches the jays had executed while winning 19 of the previous 26 games against the yankees but following molitor s walk , mulholland retired 25 of the next 29 jays while the yankees went on to their 10th home victory in the last 11 efforts boggs , playing for the first time since wednesday , lined a homer off an advertising sign in right field to tie the score in the first boggs , who has a career 368 average against stewart , has 3 homers in his last 10 atbats after hitting none in his first 114 stewart walked paul o'neill to open the second and leyritz s homer helped to ruin any drama that was left the bullies won again from their standpoint , losing to us on may 24 is n't going to make them feel worse about themselves , showalter said beating them on may 24 is n't going to make us feel we got it made inside pitch john olerud , who seriously pursued a 400 average last season , thinks paul o'neill , the latest to pursue 400 , has a chance to do it even if the chance is slim someone did it in the past , so someone will do it in the future , he said o'neill was 1 for 3 with a walk against an exaggerated infield defense that played him to pull , and his batting average slipped four points to 471 joe carter , who leads the majors with 54 runs batted in , feels that a run at 200 rbi is possible photo yankees' terry mulholland pitched a fivehitter for his first complete game this season \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
bret saberhagen felt alone , no longer in control of the game he clenched his teeth and grabbed a beverage with with knots welling in his stomach , saberhagen sat in front of the clubhouse television and watched as the florida marlins scored five runs in the eighth inning a 102 mets lead was shrinking rapidly not to worry the mets always seem to find a way to win a game in which saberhagen starts last night he was nearly untouchable for five innings he left after seven innings , leading 102 and won his 13th game of the season as the mets held on for a 107 victory at shea stadium saberhagen allowed seven hits , struck out six and , of course , walked none this season he has struck out 137 batters and walked 12 for a strikeout to walk ratio of 114 in his last six victories his earned run average is 154 and his victory last night passed dwight gooden s total of 12 last season this is an amazing feat , what he s doing , said manager dallas green really , when you get into situations where you have to battle like he did , it s just amazing bobby bonilla and jeff kent each drove in three runs they 're tied for the club lead with 65 as the mets continued their march to mediocrity , pulling within one game of 500 i feel like i 've finally made my presence felt in new york , saberhagen said this is a good ball club , not a great one there s a lot of teams with more talent , but this is a good one with a lot of heart the mets have made a habit of dramafilled affairs , winning their last three in their final time at bat they decided not to wait that long , figuring the first inning would do just as well they spotted saberhagen four runs on six straight hits a double by kent drove in two and rico brogna extended his 13game hitting streak , driving in another with a single luis rivera added a pinchhit double down the leftfield line in the seventh for another run , and jose vizcaino s triple to begin the sixth ignited a tworun rally thrill a batter thrillseeking reliever mauro gozzo gave mets fans and green a few anxious moments in the eighth inning , surrendering gary sheffield s 25th home run a tworun bomb to left field in twothirds of an inning , gozzo allowed five runs two earned and gave up five hits marlins pinchhitter matias carrillo ended the onslaught , doubling in two runs off the wall in leftcenter to draw florida to within 107 i was n't particularly worried , because i had roger mason and john franco in the bullpen , green said if the guy is going to stay on a big league baseball team , he s got to protect an eightrun lead mason earned his first save this season , by popping up jerry browne to right field and inducing jeff conine into a gameending double play , the sort that brings relief to a starter stuck beside the television next to his cubicle the marlins were n't that serious about a comeback , as evidenced by their four errors two came in the outfield , which was soggy from the downpour before the game that canceled batting practice florida s david weathers , meanwhile , combined with four relievers to massage the mets s averages he surrendered eight hits and seven earned runs over three and twothirds innings and fell to 811 inside pitch injured and frustrated kevin mcreynolds , who s only played in 50 of 108 games this season , conceded his 12year major league career may be coming to an end the 34yearold outfielder , nursing strained cartilage in his right knee , is hoping , nonetheless , to be activated before the strike i 've done everything except run the bases and hit off live pitching , he said doctors have recommended that it be scoped and cleaned up a little bit i do n't know the injuries might be a way of telling me it s time to shut it down exercising an option on mcreynolds' 25 million salary this season may not be in the mets' plans with pete smith scheduled to come off the disabled list and start tomorrow , josias manzanillo will probably go on the dl he said he should be throwing again in six days , said dallas green he s got basic tendinitis in right shoulder if there is a recurrence , they may want to go in and knock the bone spur off of the possible surgery , green said if it were me , i 'd want to go in and get it done and over with , especially if the industry is going to shut down joe orsulak has again left the mets for at least a few days orsulak will travel to baltimore with his wife , adrianna , who is being treated for a malignant brain tumor photo after the rains , it was bret saberhagen s turn to shine at shea stadium last night with victory no 13 \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

it is 10 am , and 125th street is choked with people trying to weave past vendors selling tshirts , african trinkets and jewelry mounas g and several other women in colorful african print dresses stand outside a storefront that has no sign and eye the passing parade in particular , they look for those lingering at the photographs on the storefront s windows miss , miss , do you want to get your hair done \? mounas asks one shopper , who immediately points to a photo of an elaborate braid style this , can you do this \? she asks mounas smiles and says , seventy dollars the customer nods and is ushered into another world call it a makeshift hairbraiding factory mounas and two dozen other women sit on high stools , their fingers manipulating clumps of hair into intricate patterns and styles the women are so crammed together that it is difficult for them to work without bumping elbows with their neighbors and it is hot four fans move air around the salon every now and then a braider adjusts a fan to give a burst of air to a customer who is fanning herself there are no mirrors on the walls when a braid is done , the customer holds a jagged , cracked mirror up to her face sometimes she is taken next door to use the mirrors at the subway sandwich store the shop is one of the many braiding salons that seem to crop up overnight along 125th street and around the city to meet the growing demand for africaninspired braiding they have become a refuge for caribbean and african immigrants trying to stay afloat , allowing them to use skills they learned in their homelands but the shops have also raised questions about sanitary practices partly with those in mind , the state legislature recently wrote language into the cosmetology law that specifically requires braiders to be licensed mounas , a 43yearold senegalese immigrant who lives in a onebedroom apartment in west harlem , says the shop helps her make ends meet when her cabdriver husband is out of work and she needs money for her baby daughter or to send back home she says she learned about the shop a year ago through word of mouth and began renting a station over the year , more women came to set up their stations , and now there is barely space for one more braider we never turn anyone down she says friends work here relatives come in to help but now it is so full , i do n't think we are taking any more people many established braiders who are proud of the craft of locking and twisting and weaving hair into intricate patterns feel that some of the new shops diminish the status of their profession through poor standards and the use of quickbuck techniques like pulling in people from the streets some are also bothered by the immigrants' claims of authentic braiding , which they say implies that the work of american black women is somehow less genuine still , they say they are eager to pull the immigrants into the mainstream when i saw that shop on 125th , i was stunned , said diane bailey , the vice president of international braiders network , a trade group with 300 members my eyes filled with tears it was a sweat shop there was not any order people had combs stuck in their mouths and in their hair that simply is not safe braiding is about nurturing natural care , said ms bailey , a member of a state advisory committee on cosmetology it is not about a quick service we are not the mcdonald s of hair care in 20 years we will not be looked at as hair braiders we will be looked at as hustlers mounas agrees that cleanliness can be a problem some people are clean , some people are dirty that is why i want to open my own shop and keep it clean i have 10 combs when i go home , i wash them one by one and put them in paper towels the work itself is difficult and stressful , requiring long hours of concentration and repetitive motions a braider working too hard may find her fingers swelling and her back aching some develop eye trouble but in the lowpaying universe of the immigrants , the pay can be fairly good mounas says she rents her station for 140 a month and works several days a week , charging from 70 for an uncomplicated braid to 200 for a difficult and timeconsuming pattern that takes all day those rates are slightly higher than what is offered by others in the shop in a regular salon , the cost could be twice that the job could take twice as long mounas is paid in cash , which is one the reasons she insisted her last name not be used on a busy day , she may have as many as four customers some days i get three , she says some days i get two people some days no one comes but it does not last long people always want to get their hair done mounas s specialty is a braid called the senegalese twist , a style in which natural hair is twisted with synthetic hair or a wool fiber into tiny single braids that resemble rope she imports the wool from senegal for the braiders , the skill was easy to learn mounas was taught by her cousins in senegal gladys esowe , a nigerian , said in africa , we grow up with it we have an open market so anyone who wants to braid hair can go there we would cook for the person in exchange for them teaching us how to braid you just find a comb ms esowe , who is 43 , said she was trained as a housekeeper but is having trouble because she ca n't get a work permit i tried and tried to find work without a permit , she said i got frustrated i was walking down the street one day about three months ago and i saw this place what should i do \? i do n't have any alternative i like to work i want to work most of the braiders are either illegal immigrants or have no work permits mounas says she has a green card and a permit none of the braiders are licensed , so they often must move from shop to shop the women know little of the new licensing law or its grandfather clause giving braiders until next july to avoid enrollment in a cosmetology school by providing proof of experience but since most fear any contact with the authorities , the transition will be difficult no one ever asks me if i have a license , mounas says if you know how to braid hair , they pay you money for mounas , who came to the united states five years ago , the goal is to keep sending money home to senegal and eventually return there america is too violent , she says every night she watches the television news and hears about a murder she wonders if she s next life was not that hard at home , she said there was no violence africa is poor and people come here to satisfy themselves and their families a few

six years ago , rene v anselmo parlayed nearly 80 million from the sale of television stations into what seemed like a sure bet for bankruptcy launching the world s first privately owned international communications satellite despite having no customers until after the satellite reached its orbit , mr anselmo s panamsat corporation is now reaping a nice profit beaming television programming between the united states , latin america and europe for customers like cnn and home box office , the company earned nearly 17 million in profits in 1993 on 50 million in sales in the process , mr anselmo has chipped away at the virtual monopoly on international satellite traffic enjoyed by intelsat , the global consortium of more than 120 governments yesterday mr anselmo embarked on a far more ambitious agenda with more than 620 million in fresh capital from investors , panamsat launched the first of three big satellites aboard a french ariane rocket from kourou , french guiana multimilliondollar gambles mr anselmo s new plan , much like the original satellite , has involved a series of multimilliondollar gambles as envisioned , the three new spacecraft will expand panamsat s coverage to asia , africa and the indian ocean region and will beef up capacity over latin america and europe panamsat has signed contracts with more than 30 customers , from american companies like espn and hbo to a consortium of latin american broadcasters the company estimates the contracts will yield more than 1 billion over 10 years i 've never been good at writing detailed business plans , mr anselmo said this week , over dinner at a restaurant near panamsat s headquarters in greenwich , conn if something seems like a good idea , i just go ahead my theory has always been that if the thing was good , the money would come to be sure , the company faces considerable risk no longer the lone pioneer , panamsat faces growing competition from both intelsat and from new entrants but satellite customers and industry experts say panamsat has won credibility among corporate customers and is in good position to profit from the growing demand for global video distribution to reach this point , the 68yearold mr anselmo has had to survive a series of escapades worthy of the perils of pauline , often by striking unusual bargains at each turn in the road none of it seems to have discouraged the gruff and habitually unorthodox entrepreneur who drives to work in a black rollsroyce and lives in a greenwich mansion modeled after one in versailles , france however , mr anselmo s health is slowing him down in recent months , he said , he has often suffered from fatigue and breathing problems despite that , he smokes more than a pack a day of fullstrength winstons it would be hard to find a company any more unlike the buttoneddown rigor of intelsat indeed , panamsat may well be the only company in the country with a slogan that cannot be printed unabridged in a family newspaper its unofficial logo is equally provocative , and probably more perplexing to the uninitiated a cartoon dog , nicknamed spot , with its hind leg raised in the act of urinating mr anselmo came up with the symbol for his small but defiant company doing battle against intelsat the dog was part of a fullpage newspaper advertisement in 1991 , which attacked intelsat s lobbying effort to block panamsat from linking international longdistance carriers to its customers , however , panamsat is best known for reliability and responsiveness shortly before the winter olympics in lillehammer , norway , the company invested several hundred thousand dollars to lease capacity on other satellites in the event broadcasters needed emergency links the effort was completely speculative , because all of the principal video distribution had been scheduled years in advance over intelsat as the tonya harding affair unfolded , however , panamsat sold virtually all its extra capacity what they 've done is get out there and talk to customers about their needs before they started , said robert m zitter , senior vice president of technology operations at home box office , which has leased two channels on the first satellite and signed a 10year contract for a transponder on the satellite to be launched next year he hatched the idea for a worldwide network of satellites around 1990 , in collaboration with panamsat s president , frederick a landman , who is also mr anselmo s soninlaw mr anselmo persuaded hughes communications to begin work on the three satellites , even before he had raised any of the 276 million in construction costs hughes gave panamsat permission to back out of the deal within 12 months after construction got under way , provided mr anselmo agreed to pay the construction tab up to that point about 28 million the deal gave mr anselmo time to round up investors but it was n't easy c itoh , the diversified japanese conglomerate , had tentatively agreed to invest 75 million in stock , but the deal fell apart as mr anselmo was arriving in tokyo for what he thought was a signing ceremony he then flew straight to paris , where he tried to strike a deal with arianespace , the rocket company owned in part by the french government mexican investor

dr stafford smiled and said she could not say for certain but she did , indeed , experience another storm there this time over her highly controversial recommendation that chatham , a selective women s college , begin admitting men as students initially , the board of trustees unanimously supported her then came fierce opposition from the alumnae , and the governing board backed down dr stafford said she had no choice but to step down after eight years as president she returned to harvard to teach sociology for monmouth s inauguration , dr stafford decided not to take any outdoor chances again she said she wanted everything going for her at the day s events and in the years ahead the ceremony will be held in a large auditorium i can do without any more storms , she said and so far , dr stafford , who took office on july 1 , has had a calm time at the college , which has 3 , 000 undergraduate and 1 , 500 graduate students in three schools arts and sciences , business administration and information sciences and technology university role sought the college is seeking state approval to become a teaching university enrollment is up significantly for the fall , with a record freshman class of 650 students projected an intercollegiate football program that began last fall is being expanded , and dr stafford s hiring a woman as athletic director has received cheers plans are under way to build two dormitories at 2 million each other plans are being reviewed for construction of a new 15 million library and the conversion of the current one to classroom space even the president of the college s faculty union , dr margaret del guercio , said dr stafford had brought a high degree of academic excitement to the campus she is very studentoriented , said dr del guercio , an english professor and a poet i send students in to see her , and they come back smiling and happy and enthusiastic dr del guercio admits that she has to speak with care now since the faculty association salary contract expires on july 1 and negotiations have started with the administration she said the contract talks would be dr stafford s first real test here ronald j wronko , editor in chief of the outlook , the weekly student newspaper , has questioned dr stafford s decision to open a new school this fall to admit socalled underprepared students so has mary kane , president of the student government association they think the move could affect the college s efforts to raise scholarly standards dr stafford has already started to reshape the college s administrative structure , elminating any unnecessary layers and , when planning started for the twoday inauguration , she said she had capped expenses at 40 , 000 most of it being underwritten and none of it coming from education funds , she added q what do you see as the distinguishing feature of your inauguration \? a the inauguration provides an opportunity for the entire monmouth college community to meet together to recognize publicly our contributions to educating the young people of a region and to describe our vision for the future of monmouth university q is there a special message you would like to convey with the events taking place \?

bihac , bosnia and herzegovina , june 24 when the sun sets on bihac , the town is plunged into blackness nobody moves and there is scarcely a sound , save that of howling dogs and desultory machine gun fire faintly visible are the silhouettes of nearby mountains on top of them , surrounding the muslim population of this abandoned place , are serbian forces bihac by night looks a lot like the end of the world and in many ways , that is just what this muslim enclave in western bosnia has become after more than two years of encirclement by the serbs cut off from sarajevo , largely forgotten by the rest of the world , this town of 50 , 000 people has been shelled back into the 19th century on the main street , there are more horsedrawn carts than cars they move slowly past sandbagged storefronts , carrying loads of firewood , the sole source of heat cattle and goats graze by the roadside many people spend the day sitting by the road staring vacantly into space , apparently stunned by the anguish the war has brought the muslims of this once prosperous farming area feelings of abandonment at least sarajevo now has a road in , but we are still surrounded , said ifeta ibredzic , a 33yearold schoolteacher who went without pay for eight months before receiving about 100 in german marks from the local authorities this week my family survives on homemade pasta and what we can grow in our garden i try to hope , but often i feel we have just been abandoned , by the sarajevo government and by the whole world but it is not just abandonment that afflicts bihac , the largest town in an encircled bosnian pocket where more than 190 , 000 muslims live since last september , the pocket has been ravaged by a fierce internecine conflict between muslims loyal to the government and others backing a wealthy businessman named fikret abdic , who has denounced what he calls the destructive muslim nationalism of the sarajevo government and declared autonomy in the northern third of the enclave this miniwar within the wider bosnian conflict has already left more than 600 people dead , western military observers say , including about 200 killed since government forces unleashed a powerful assault on mr abdic s forces two weeks ago in an attempt to recapture his stronghold of velika kladusa no visit from president it s absolutely tragic and it looks like a fight to the finish , said one western diplomat who has tried unsuccessfully to mediate in this war between muslims but nobody seems to give a damn bosnia s president , alija izetbegovic , has not visited since the start of the bosnian war in 1992 , and his absence seems to have left many residents with the impression that there is scant hope or concern for them the bihac conflict is indeed a manysided and brutal one , even by the convoluted standards of bosnia its complexity , and the almost universal pessimism of people here , suggest that an end to the 26monthold bosnian war is still far off soldiers talk of fighting their way out of isolation by eventually securing a land link with sarajevo an enterprise against entrenched and heavily armed serbian forces that would surely take years for two years already , to the south and the east , the hastily formed fifth corps of the bosnian army has been fighting a remarkable rearguard action against the bosnian serbs , insuring that bihac was not ethnically cleansed , emptied of nonserbs , like the town of prijedor or brought to its knees like gorazde a stocky wheelerdealer to the west lie the serbian forces occupying the devastated krajina area of croatia their whim dictates how much united nations food aid reaches bihac from zagreb , the croatian capital usually the answer is very little in the last six weeks , none has been allowed through and to the north there is mr abdic , a stocky wheelerdealer who took two brigades of the fifth corps with him when he defected and has since fashioned economic alliances with the krajina serbs and croatia he calls these deals models for bosnian peace the muslimled bosnian government calls them acts of selfinterested and cowardly betrayal mr abdic is a traitor who follows the policy of the serbs , and my task is to disarm him , said atif dudakovic , the commander of the fifth corps the aim of our current operation is to accomplish that by liberating velika kladusa and this will be accomplished mr dudakovic , who does not have a formal military rank , said the fifth corps had partly overcome its logistical difficulties by setting up a makeshift factory in bihac for the production of ammunition and mortars and by taking arms from captured enemy soldiers he said 400 soldiers captured in the offensive against mr abdic had provided 400 rifles , 50 machine guns and 20 hand grenades serbian reaction is concern maj jeanfrancois philippe , an officer with a french battalion of united nations forces stationed north of bihac in coralici , confirmed that an ammunition factory was functioning in bihac the government sources have the numbers about 14 , 000 men in the fifth corps and probably the means to defeat abdic , he said but the crucial question is , what will the reaction of the serbs be if they close in on velika kladusa \? already the krajina serbs have pounded the bosnian government forces with artillery fire from positions in occupied areas of croatia , and their economic collusion with mr abdic suggests they would not be inclined to let him fall easily but beyond the outcome of the current offensive , mr abdic s defection has posed wider questions for the people of bihac although the businessman , who heads a large food and agricultural company called agrokomerc , seems to be generally hated in the south of the pocket , his economic success has caused some inevitable envy in bihac utterly determined after all , coffee costs only 6 a kilo in velika kladusa a fifth of the price here electricity is available in the north of the pocket , but rarely in the south one young man in velika kladusa , who would give only his first name , branimir , said he and four friends had paid 400 each to be steered across the lines from bihac to the relative prosperity of the north but the authorities in bihac remain utterly determined to fight their way out of their isolation we have seen how barbarous the serbs are , in prijedor and elsewhere in bosnia , said mirsad veladzic , the bosnian government minister for coordination of the bihac region yet abdic works with them he will pay a high price , and we will eventually end this brutal siege of the bihac area time , however , is pressing although mr veladzic insisted that loyalty to the government in sarajevo remained strong , it is clearly fraying to look out into the gloom of the bihac night , to contemplate the emptiness of its stores and to walk the deserted expanses of its streets is to know that this is the end of the line of muslim misery in bosnia it will be very important for the morale of the soldiers and citizens if izetbegovic came here , said arifa djulkic , a 55yearold teacher has our president forgotten us \? senad hadzic , a 21yearold student , added i do n't think our politicians are doing much they 're just lining their pockets meanwhile we have no life in bihac , nothing there used to be a night life here now there s the 10 pm curfew and darkness

moscow , nov 23 less than three months after withdrawing all his troops with fanfare from estonia , president boris n yeltsin of russia stood on his disputed border with the baltic nation today and promised that he would never yield one single centimeter of land saberrattling on issues like borders has become common for mr yeltsin , who must constantly worry about the rightwing nationalist opposition in the russian parliament but this time his remarks were particularly aggressive estonia has demanded the return of more than 750 square miles of land that russia now considers part of its territory , but that belonged to estonia before world war ii when estonia renewed its claim to those lands last june , mr yeltsin began constructing 680 border posts , many of which are now guarded by armed soldiers and linked by a fence we will not give up one single centimeter of sacred russian land no matter who covets it , declared mr yeltsin , who was accompanied on the trip by his foreign minister , andrei v kozyrev russia stands on the borders that exist we will not negotiate with estonia , latvia or any other nation on this issue the phrase the borders that exist is clearly open to challenge after more than 500 years of domination by a succession of danes , germans , poles , swedes and then russians , estonia signed a treaty with the soviet union in 1920 that recognized its right to the land mr yeltsin now says is russian under provisions of that agreement , the tartu treaty , estonia acquired many areas inhabited by russians the agreement lasted only 20 years however , until stalin annexed estonia and its neighboring baltic countries , lithuania and latvia from then on , the soviet union and russia after that acted as if the treaty never existed estonian officials expressed mild dismay over mr yeltsin s remarks today we regret that he decided to make such a trip evidently for domestic policy reasons , the estonian foreign minister , juri luik , told reporters this is not going to help normalize relations in the way that we have discussed russian political leaders , including mr yeltsin , have frequently complained about the treatment ethnic russians have received in estonia since the soviet union was dissolved in late 1991 russians must learn estonian , have a harder time getting and keeping jobs than they did in the past and have lost many benefits yet mr yeltsin chose to dwell on none of those issues today on his trip to the border point at kunichina gora instead he declared that foreign intelligence services were exploiting the border and that russia needed to be protected against smugglers from the baltic nations law enforcement officials say there is quite a bit of smuggling between russia and estonia but usually such activity involves russians smuggling valuables to europe through estonia clearly sensing the potentially incendiary nature of mr yeltsin s remarks , mr kozyrev said russia was not seeking to create a border of confrontation instead , he said , we are seeking a border of good neighborliness and a border that will help protect our frontiers from smugglers , terrorists and drug traders
hamilton , ontario , aug 11 richard matienzo , the leading scorer and rebounder for cuba at the world basketball championships , became the second cuban player to defect within the past nine months when he failed to show up for the team s game here tonight against germany matienzo , a 25yearold starting center from havana , reportedly left the team s hotel in toronto , about an hour s drive from here , and telephoned toronto newspapers from a convenience store canadian press reported that employees of the toronto star had picked matienzo up and taken him to the newspaper s office after cuba lost its game to germany tonight , 8674 , its coach , miguel calderon gomez , said he had last seen matienzo on wednesday night when the team gathered at the hotel to watch a video of germany s game against brazil that was about 8 30 , calderon gomez said the grimfaced coach would not confirm or deny the player had defected we have no information , he said he left the hotel wednesday night with some friends and he has n't come back pressed for a reaction , calderon gomez said , our team , like with the revolution , approached the game with conviction and strength regardless of what happened none of the cuban players would comment on the absence of matienzo , who had been averaging 19 points a game matienzo had been with the cuban national team since 1990 , and played against the dream team in the tournament of the americas in portland in 1992 before that game , the first for the dream team on its way to the gold medal at the olympics in barcelona , spain , the cubans asked to pose for pictures with the nba legends he played for havana in the cuban league another top cuban player , andres guibert , defected at the americas qualifying tournament last november 30 in ponce , puerto rico calderon gomez confirmed that guibert had left the team during that tournament , but , as with matienzo , said he had received no information and could not classify it as a defection cuba has been plagued by numerous defections at recent international sporting events , as economic conditions have worsened approximately 50 athletes defected last year at central american and carribean games and another halfdozen at the world university games last summer in buffalo
from the amateur s perspective , investing is like ice skating try to add a little spin and you may take a tumble managing your money well and then stretching too far to minimize taxes is a case in point having polished off their 1993 returns , many people will resolve to do everything they can to lower their tax bills next year in some cases , they will jump headlong at taxadvantaged investments that are doomed to fail or are completely inappropriate in their financial situation they may even blunder when deciding on a home or paying off debt by focusing solely on the highly coveted tax break tax saving is not a goal , said carl camp , a financial planner in fullerton , calif increasing net worth is our goal , and tax saving may be a method we use to do that but if i make tax saving a goal , i'm just going to make stupid mistakes in addition to losing their perspective , people often twist the words of a professional or take advice from the wrong one on tax matters when they should have been talking to their financial planner or cpa , they were talking to an insurance salesperson or a stockbroker , said terry schonhoff , a financial planner with ids financial services in knoxville , tenn he and other financial advisers described some common taxinspired gaffes the toobig mortgage you know the pitch it s the only writeoff you 've got left taxpayers have gotten used to hearing their accountants extol the virtue of the mortgage interest deduction so much so that many take on a bigger mortgage than they can comfortably carry just for the tax break technically , the accountant is right the big loan does save money in taxes still , many people spend considerably more on their monthly mortgage payments than they would on rent as a result , mortgages suck up discretionary income , or what s left after taxes and living expenses whenever i 've done an analysis , the person without a mortgage has more discretionary income , said william c prewitt , a feeonly financial planner in charleston , sc in other words , by buying a smaller house or by renting , you can invest in something more promising than real estate like cattle futures of course , owning a home is n't a bad idea it may appreciate in value , home ownership can be satisfying and block parties can be fun but do n't let taxes justify housing excesses the homeequity loan sucker because the interest paid on homeequity loans is deductible , people are quick to pounce on them used wisely , these loans may be money savers but too often , people take out homeequity loans to invest , and do n't earn a return big enough to justify it if your new investment with mortgage money does n't earn you more than the interest rate you 're paying , you 'll lose money , mr camp said interest on the average home equity loan is 705 percent that may be hard to beat in this market a similar foulup using homeequity loans to pay off credit cards and other debts theoretically , it is a great idea , mr camp said , but practically , it is often the equivalent of going on a chocolate bender before starting a diet people wind up in twice as much debt because they run the credit cards back up , he said i do n't recommend it unless somebody is extremely disciplined insurance lemons the life insurance industry knows that the tax deferral of annuities is an extraordinary sales tool for some people , annuities may be a great choice but annuities are a tremendous mistake for people not investing the maximum in a taxdeductible retirement plan , said michael chasnoff , president of advanced capital strategies , a cincinnati financial planning firm it s inherently more expensive to invest in an annuity , he said similarly , the private pension plans that insurers sell are simply overfunded life insurance policies you are basically buying term insurance at a very noncompetitive rate , when you do n't need it , just to get the taxdeferral , mr chasnoff said buying an insurance product without an insurance need is not a good idea to make matters worse , some investors park their annuities in lowyielding moneymarket funds bryan schmitt , an academic associate at the national endowment for financial education , in denver , said the idea of an annuity is for money to grow taxdeferred at a faster rate so if you keep it in a money market , you 're defeating the purpose you 're not even going to keep up with inflation and the annuity fees ira delusions the greatest gift of an individual retirement account is that the money grows taxdeferred yet many investors do not fully grasp that they pay absolutely zero taxes until they withdraw money from these accounts instead , they plow retirement funds into a lowyielding taxfree investment , like municipal bonds , deluded about some additional tax benefit ira s and similar accounts should be invested for the greatest potential return , at a risk that is acceptable to the owner , financial advisers said landlord blues owning rental property , a strategy often bandied about by selfchristened tax gurus , can save you money as the property depreciates but only as long as you earn less than 100 , 000 and actively participate in the management of the property before making a down payment , estimate your annual earnings for the next few years as your adjusted gross income moves from 100 , 000 to 150 , 000 , you lose the possible deductibility of any losses from rental property mr schmitt said if you 're over 150 , 000 , none of your losses are deductible and often , people look to take advantage of the lowincome housing tax credit , buying property in neighborhoods where they would be afraid to park their cars if the value of the property is going to be continuously deteriorating , you 're going to incur an economic loss , he said mistaken identities if you are in the 15 percent federal tax bracket and are considering municipal bonds or such bond funds , accept that the rich are different you and oprah winfrey may have much in common , but it stops at tax strategy no matter how much you hate to pay taxes , you 're just going to be better off with a taxable investment that has a higher yield , said isabelle v curtiss , a financial planner and certified public accountant in middlebury , conn a taxable bond paying 10 percent will give someone in the 40 percent bracket a 6 percent return after taxes , but for someone in the 15 percent bracket , the return is a much healthier 85 percent the taxfree municipal bond may not do as well timing mistakes consider the plight of the investor who spots a winning stock early and watches it rise after eight months , he is pretty sure the stock has hit its peak but holding the stock for a year would mean a longterm capital gain , with a maximum tax rate of 28 percent , rather than the shortterm rate , as high as 396 percent so he holds on to the stock , putting his entire investment at risk for months you bought something because you thought the economics were good , and now all of a sudden , you think of the tax ramifications , said david kahn , a tax partner at goldstein golub kessler company , in new york that clouds your thinking if you believe the stock has hit its potential , you should unload it drawing
gauguin is the perfect restaurant for children on expense accounts only a child could truly believe in this festive south seas atmosphere , its fake palm trees ablaze with colorful lanterns and its murals working hard to conjure up an island image children can appreciate the juice drinks strewn with paper umbrellas and plastic dolphins , even without the alcohol , and they are not embarrassed by the naked ladies on the glasses or the waitresses wrapped in sarongs unfortunately , only a very rich child could afford this particular pleasure , and seen through adult eyes the restaurant that now occupies the room that once was trader vic s can be vaguely disquieting it is too easy to sense the smirk beneath the surface trader vic s was an american institution in its heyday , the place that popularized the pu pu platter and invented the mai tai \( anybody who says i did n't create this drink is a dirty stinker , the owner , victor bergeron , once said \) served remarkably good food the first pacific rim restaurant , it proudly introduced asian concepts of cooking to an american audience over the years some of the restaurants in the chain lost their sheen , but trader vic s always had a heart gauguin , by contrast , seems all head the proprietors , who also own the restaurantnightclub tatou , have calculated that americans have an appetite for the polynesian experience they are doing their best to feed it early on there was just one pu pu platter , a tray laden with spring rolls , roast pork spare ribs , shrimp and scallop toast and peking duck pancakes but pu pu platters turn out to be the perfect accompaniment to silly drinks with names like tahitian torture and aqua breeze , so the offerings were expanded now , in addition to the traditional pu pu platter , there are also a gauguin \( tuna sushi , filipino chicken lumpia , cured salmon with riceflour blinis and asian shrimp cocktail \) , vegetarian and seafood versions and a sate platter \( chicken , scallops , mongolian lamb and shrimp on sugar cane \) the seafood version is the best of the lot it includes irresistible steamed seafood dumplings that are so light and flavorful they whet your appetite for more there are also enormous shrimp , spicy from bits of jalapeno , and thick red slices of peppercrusted tuna the single disappointment is calamari so tough you can chew it for hours the vegetarian platter is less impressive it includes skinny mushroomfilled spring rolls and various steamed and fried dumplings , one stuffed with depressingly bland mashed potatoes the best thing on this platter is the chunky fried tofu , which is very useful for absorbing the array of dipping sauces many of these items are also available a la carte this is good news in the case of those delicious seafood dumplings and the wokcharred shrimp but the mapleglazed ribs , while perfect for children , require a little more oomph to appeal to anyone over the age of 10 , and it is hard to imagine the peking duck pancakes appealing to a person of any age they come folded into triangles , their tops drizzled with hoisin sauce , their insides filled with dreary gray chunks of duck traditionally , the important part of a peking duck is its crisp skin , but that was noticeably absent in the pancakes the only crisp thing i could find on my plate was the smattering of stale cracklings sitting dispiritedly on a pile of shredded cucumber after the pancakes , it is a shock when the mahogany roast duck lands at the table the lacquered bird is a deep dark brown , its skin so crisp that it crunches audibly when bitten the endive , snow pea and citrus salad on the side echoes the sweet and sour flavors of the duck , making it the perfect accompaniment but the menu is distressingly uneven a fine salad of asian greens is lovely , decorated with a piece of deepfried won ton skin etched with the word gauguin if only the goatcheesefilled won tons on the plate were equally fresh and crisp when i had them they tasted as if they had been lounging around the kitchen for a day or two the seared rare tuna with wasabi is generous and very appealing to those who like their tuna almost raw and their wasabi very hot but the crunchy waterchestnutcrusted fish , red snapper on the day i tried it , is not at all crisp and the diced hunan vegetables are decidedly underspiced as for the sichuan stirfried shrimp , the mixture of shrimp , eggplant and tomatoes is a big , expensive plate of dull chinese food the best dish on the menu is surely the grilled shanghai lobster , which is served in the shell in the chinese manner , broken into manageable pieces the tender meat tastes terrific with the yang chow couscous , a witty reinterpretation of traditional fried rice desserts are the most playful part of the menu children love them too bad that krakatoa east of java , a lovely combination of chocolate cake , ice cream and sorbet that arrives at the table spitting flames , is adrift on a sea of bright blue curacao and that the green apple spring roll has a faint onion flavor unattractive in a dessert but gauguin s palette is lots of fun it is made of shortbread , has colorful paints of fruit essences and comes with a chocolate paint brush fruit sushi is cute , too , tidbits of rice pudding topped with fruit and served with marzipan wasabi even the creme brulee rides in on a half a coconut to children , all of this is enchanting they gather up their piles of paper umbrellas and plastic palm trees and go dancing through the crowded dining room to the bridge at the door i loved that restaurant , said one little girl to her father , climbing the redcarpeted stairway to reality her father just looked sad i think i might know why sitting in the midst of all this fake cheer

washington , jan 7 china threatened the united states today with retaliation for slashing by 1 billion the amount of textile goods it can export to america , but also signaled that it might be open for negotiations to resolve the dispute before the sanctions take effect on jan 17 secretary of the treasury lloyd bentsen extended an olive branch to the beijing authorities , saying that they had 10 days to work things out before the american punitive actions began and that they should take advantage of it the clinton administration imposed the sanctions on china on thursday for refusing to negotiate an agreement to halt the estimated 2 billion of illicit apparel exports that chinese companies send to the united states each year by disguising them under the labels of 25 other countries the chinese do this to get around the quotas that the united states imposes on their exports of sweaters , shirts , industrial cloths and other textiles to punish beijing for not halting the illicit exports , the administration has cut china s quota by about a third there s still some time , obviously , for negotiation in there , mr bentsen said at a news conference to discuss asian trade before his trip to indonesia , thailand and china next week we 've had a serious problem with transshipments that exceed the quotas that we have and up to this point feel like we have not had enough cooperation from china in trying to apprehend those we 're continuing to urge that on the chinese , and hopefully that can be worked out , that they 'll come to the negotiation table on that and we 'll make some effective progress , he said that s one of the reasons that even though the agreement has expired , some time has been left in there for negotiation with the chinese the administration today also formally lifted its ban on the sale of three satellites to china , after beijing agreed to start talks on limiting the sale of its missiles and missile technology , the state department said licenses for the launching of the satellites , which are valued at 200 million by their manufacturers , martin marietta and the hughes aircraft unit of general motors , had been frozen because of trade sanctions imposed on aug 25 by washington for china s sale of m11 missile technology to pakistan first move is china s despite the gesture on satellites , administration officials made clear that it was up to the chinese to make the first move on textiles we have said all along that we want to negotiate a bilateral agreement , mickey kantor , the united states trade representative , said and we are open to do so whenever the chinese government steps forward but unless and until we reach a satisfactory agreement , these new quota reductions are going to go into effect none of this has set well in beijing the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation said it was lodging what a spokesman called a serious protest over the irresponsible american decision to cut china s fabric and apparel quotas by 25 percent to 35 percent the decision by the clinton administration will seriously affect uschinese economic and trade relations , the staterun new china news agency quoted a trade ministry spokesman as saying the agency quoted chinese officials as saying that american consumers would be hurt by the reduced quota retaliation possible the statement by the spokesman said that china would retaliate if washington followed through with the punishing cuts to beijing s textile exports , but it did not say how china is a big importer of american aircraft , agricultural products , machinery and textile technology if the us side persists in going its own way , this will force our side to take corresponding and retaliatory measures , the statement said it added , though , that china will continue to talk according to the original plan and solve problems through negotiations but it gave no indication when china would resume discussions with mr kantor american officials said they believed that they had the upper hand with the chinese given the fact that the united states was the biggest market for china , the recipient of 38 percent of its exports it is not in their interest to harm their trade relations with the united states , a senior american trade official said i think they will eventually react in the appropriate way
cheap 100yearold household drug found to fight heart attacks , strokes , cancer , etc sounds like a toogoodtobetrue headline but dozens of studies involving more than a million people have hailed such a drug it is none other than ordinary aspirin , the standby for reducing pain , fever and inflammation the findings of recent studies strongly suggest that an aspirin a day or at least every other day may be better than an apple at keeping the doctor away aspirin , these studies indicate , can reduce a person s chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke and of developing cancers of the colon and other digestive organs it may also improve brain function in people with dementia who have suffered little strokes , ward off or reduce the severity of migraine headaches and help prevent hazardous high blood pressure in pregnant women also being studied are aspirin s possible roles in preventing cataracts and averting recurrences of gallstones and , in general , these benefits accrue from very low doses of the drug , known chemically as acetylsalicylic acid , derived from a substance in the bark of the willow tree that was used medicinally by the greek physician hippocrates in the 5th century bc but aspirin did not officially enter the medical armamentarium until the 1890 s , when a chemist who worked for the bayer division of a german pharmaceutical company developed it partly out of a desire to relieve his father s painful , crippling arthritis hailed as the closest thing to a painrelieving panacea , aspirin soon became one of the world s most widely used drugs despite heavy competition from other nonprescription painkillers in recent decades , aspirin still leads the pack americans take about 30 billion aspirin tablets a year modern aspirin when scientists in the 1960 s and 1970 s finally unraveled how aspirin works chemically in the body , the drug assumed a whole new life aspirin was found to block the production of substances called prostaglandins among many other actions , prostaglandins promote the clumping of blood cells called platelets , a crucial step in the formation of blood clots that could precipitate heart attacks and strokes the finding supported the unheeded claim of a california doctor who had observed in the 1950 s that regular doses of aspirin seemed to prevent heart attacks and strokes in a welldesigned fiveyear study of 22 , 000 middleaged doctors , those who took one ordinary aspirin tablet every other day suffered 40 percent fewer heart attacks than those given a lookalike dummy medication a similar placebocontrolled study is now under way in women it has already been noted in a sixyear study of nearly 90 , 000 nurses that those who said they took one to six aspirins a week suffered 25 percent fewer heart attacks than nonaspirin users aspirin had previously been found to be effective in treating heart attacks when given within hours of an attack \( the sooner the better \) , it was shown to reduce deaths by 25 percent and when taken regularly by heart attack patients , it reduced cardiovascular deaths by 23 percent and reduced the risk of a second nonfatal attack as well as nonfatal strokes by nearly 50 percent based on these findings , experts have urged that a supply of aspirin be kept wherever a heart attack victim might not be able to receive immediate medical attention such places include planes and ships , in backpacks , purses and cars , at health clubs and tennis courts and , of course , in homes aspirin against cancer the latest excitement surrounds the observation that regular users of aspirin have reduced rates of cancers of the colon , rectum , stomach and esophagus these cancers combined cause about 81 , 000 deaths a year in this country colorectal cancer alone is the nation s second leading cause of cancer deaths and the leading cancer killer among nonsmokers the most telling study to date , conducted by the american cancer society , involved more than 660 , 000 men and women whose health status has been monitored for a decade it suggested that as aspirin use rose , the risk of cancer death fell those who used aspirin 16 or more times a month were about half as likely to die of colon cancer as nonusers looking at all four digestive system cancers together , cancer society researchers found a 40 percent lower death rate among men and women who used aspirin 16 or more times a month for at least one year and the longer aspirin had been used , the lower the risk , they reported other studies have supported the cancer society s findings , although proof of aspirin s benefit in the form of a placebocontrolled study has yet to be obtained but one controlled study of an aspirinlike drug , sulindac , showed that it could inhibit the growth of polyps in people genetically prone to developing polyps that ultimately become cancerous aspirin may also be useful in fighting cancer it stimulates production of two cancerfighting components of the immune system gamma interferon and interleukin2 researchers are now studying its effect as an adjunct to conventional treatment proceed with caution despite its long history and popularity , aspirin does have side effects that can become serious in some people it increases bleeding tendencies and in some people causes bleeding in the stomach , an effect that can often be countered by using entericcoated aspirin the larger the dose , the more likely this problem will occur it is therefore fortunate that most of the benefits newly attributed to aspirin , especially the cardiovascular effects , involve very low doses one ordinary aspirin tablet \( 325 milligrams , or 5 grains \) every other day or one baby aspirin \( 80 milligrams \) daily more is not better in fact , it may be worse preventive aspirin therapy is most often recommended for men over 40 and women over 50 who have one or more major risk factors for heart disease , including smoking , a family history of heart attack before 55 , high blood pressure , unfavorable cholesterol levels , obesity or diabetes most researchers say it is too soon to recommend aspirin as a cancer preventive , except perhaps for those with a family history of colon cancer here again , low doses seem effective one adult or one baby aspirin each day some people should not take aspirin on a regular basis those who have had any sort of bleeding disorder \( including hemorrhagic stroke \) , stomach ulcers , uncontrolled high blood pressure , eye problems related to diabetes , kidney or liver disease or a personal or family history of cerebral aneurysms aspirin also should not be used by people already taking an anticoagulant or some other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug like ibuprofen drawing
new haven , april 22 none of the three characters in brian friel s 1979 play , faith healer , which has been given an incandescent revival at the long wharf theater , dare to look at the past straight on the soullacerating story they share can be approached only by oblique degrees , with evasive detours into silence , snatches of song and numbing recitations of place names why do n't we leave that until later \? says the play s title character , as he nears the wrenching climax of his tale why do n't we do that \? why not \? indeed faith healer , directed with exquisite care and subtlety by joe dowling , with three performances that come as close to perfection as acting gets , unfolds as a quietly devastating study of pain recollected and the transfiguring nature of memory it is one of those rare works of art audiences are destined to recall as a deeply personal experience , and you 'll find yourself trying to sort out the different visions of reality offered here long after the play is over in this difficult , darkly lyrical tale of a traveling faith healer , his wife and his manager , presented as four interconnected monologues , mr friel has created a metaphoric portrait of the artist as both creator and destroyer but the play also operates on a dizzying number of other levels , encapsulating themes that have dominated not only the work of mr friel , best known in the united states for dancing at lughnasa , but much other irish literature in this century as well exile , irresoluble cultural ambivalence , the mythic weight of the past and the subjectivity of memory like mr friel s wonderful tennessee , which closed after nine performances last fall , faith healer had a shortlived existence on broadway first presented at the longacre theater 15 years ago , in a cast headed by james mason and directed by jose quintero , it died after a mere 20 performances critics at the time complained of the work s unsatisfyingly static nature and its lack of dramatic interaction it would be difficult to raise the same objections about this production , which was first staged , like much of mr friel s work , at the abbey theater in dublin , with the cast now appearing here as acted by donal mccann , judy geeson and ron cook , the individual monologues all of which tell essentially the same story , but with enormous discrepancy in detail meld into a layered symphony of voices and the staggering contradictions in their descriptions of themselves and the events that irrevocably warp their lives stealthily generate a savage dramatic tension the first and last monologues belong to mr mccann , who portrays the fantastical francis hardy , faith healer , an irishman who possesses a genuine , miraculous power to cure the maimed and the diseased but the gift is capricious there are nights of exaltation , consummation , when frank becomes whole in myself but there are others when he knows absolutely nothing is going to happen and frank is crippled by doubts , guilt and questions that his increasing use of alcohol does little to assuage trailed by a single , isolating spotlight that casts an outsize shadow , mr mccann is palefaced , rigid and stiffjointed , like a dead man brought to life by an otherworldly ventriloquist his posture is always at a defensive angle he even speaks out of the corner of his mouth , and his eyes tend to slide to one side , as if the events he is describing were too awesome to be addressed directly his demeanor is chillingly detached and ironic , but his hands are fretful and restive frank s first monologue presents , in sharpedged fragments , all of the elements of the central story of faith healer his travels with grace , whom he describes as his mistress , and teddy , his cockney manager , throughout wales and scotland the birth and burial of his and grace s stillborn child the death of his mother the triumphant night in a welsh village where he healed all nine people who came to him , and , though he veers away from its conclusion , his homecoming visit to ireland , a country where he had hitherto avoided practicing his art and where he achieved the grim apotheosis he had always , on some level , been seeking in the three succeeding monologues , the essence of the story will change little , but its particulars will shift with a baffling , dreamlike fluidity grace will tell us that she is frank s wife , though he never identified her as such that she , too , is from ireland , though he has previously said she is an englishwoman , and that it was not frank s mother but his father who died she will remember frank burying their child and marking the grave teddy will say that it was he who did that no one agrees on what the weather was like when the child died , or on who chose the bizarre theme song , the way you look tonight sung by fred astaire , that was played during frank s healing sessions there is unanimity about the awful event that ended frank s career , but the particulars that led to it are never the same in the three accounts
the final witness for the prosecution in the world trade center bombing trial was on the stand all day yesterday , his testimony seeming to represent an effort by the government to sum up the evidence regarding the explosion that ripped through five floors of the trade center on feb 26 the witness , david r williams , who was the fbi s primary investigator of the trade center bombing , used a panoply of props two videotapes , many charts and photographs , even a scale model of the six underground floors of the trade center to give the jury an overview of the bomb , including what it was made of , how big it was , what carried it into the trade center and exactly where it was when it went off none of mr williams s conclusions came as surprises among them , for example , was that the bomb that went off in the b2 parking level of the trade center was consistent with a bomb that could have been made from the chemicals delivered to a jersey city storage locker rented , according to earlier testimony in the case , by the lead defendant , mohammad a salameh he also said definitively that the bomb had been inside the yellow ryder rental van that , the jury already knows , was rented by mr salameh three days before the trade center explosion describing bomb materials mr williams , who was the 206th prosecution witness in a case that began hearing testimony in october , was led through a long day of questioning by henry depippo , one of four government prosecutors in the case mr depippo began the day by presenting mr williams with a chart on which all of the substances either delivered to or found in mr salameh s locker at space station storage , asking him to explain whether each particular substance had some use to a bombmaker in each instance , mr williams answered in the affirmative he spoke of urea and methanol , a piece of carboard tubing , lead nitrate , aluminum powder , potassium nitrate , sulfuric acid and many other things , describing how each of them could be used in one component or another of an improvised explosive device mr williams , noting that some 1 , 500 pounds of urea had been delivered to the storage locker , and that 300 of it was left , estimated that a urea nitrate bomb between 1 , 200 to 1 , 600 pounds could have been manufactured the prosecution then played a videotape for the jury that mr williams said was of an explosion of a van carried out by the fbi in quantico , va the tape , played on the monitors scattered throughout the courtroom , showed a white van in a grassy field against a backdrop of trees suddenly vanishing in a blaze of fire and smoke , as fragments of metal sprayed radially outward from where the van had been referring to rental van the explosion , mr williams said , was caused by 50 pounds of an ammonium nitrate explosive enhanced by one and a quarter pounds of plastique , which , he said would have had a much smaller effect than a 1 , 200 to 1 , 600 pound ureanitrate bomb the purpose of the video seemed to be to show that an explosion inside a van would cause it to rupture outward in all directions that led to mr williams s testimony that the vehicle that carried the explosive had to have been the yellow ryder rental van , whose various parts were found scattered throughout the trade center rubble there was a deja vu quality to the testimony as prosecutors wheeled into the courtroom the large parts of the van s frame on which partial vehicle identification numbers had been found , enabling investigators to trace the vehicle to a ryder rental agency in jersey city scale model of center a listnessness settled over the courtroom as the tape played at length and mr williams spoke of the direction in which reinforcement rods had been bent or the nature of the damage on cars parked in the garage a security guard , several reporters , the presiding judge and at least one juror were observed with their eyes closed during this portion of mr williams s testimony but the courtroom seemed to revive a bit later when the prosecutors brought into the room an exquisite scale model of the trade center as it was right after the explosion the model , glimmering in the courtroom like a crystal doll house , showed the location of the crater at each floor it had red and yellow pillars where the red and yellow parking areas on the b2 level were , the south wall of the north tower , the fallen entry ramp leading in from west street and the escalator that went up to the concourse level mr williams placed a model of a yellow van on the b2 level at the spot where , he said , it had been parked when the 1 , 200 pounds of ureanitrate inside it was ignited the jury then examined pictures of pieces of the van later found in the rubble , while mr williams switched on tiny lights placed in the model showing where each piece had been found there were yellow lights for metal shards , white lights for tire fragments and red lights for pieces of the hydrogen gas cylinders that the government says were used in an attempt to increase the bomb s power

video business , plans its own experiments with a procedure called downloading titles are stored as digitized information in a computer and reproduced on tape or disk only when ordered by customers because the computer can store an almost infinite number of titles without turning them into physical inventory until requested , downloading is seen by some analysts as the video store s answer to video on demand for now , though , blockbuster s downloading tests will offer only sega video games the company also plans to download audio cd s , but disagreements over royalties have delayed that application eventually , blockbuster would like to download movies , but films still take too long to generate while a customer waits and there are problems with quality at present , the company seeks to make movies from scratch as a coproducer with major studios blockbuster has its own ideas about what kinds of movies to produce , and will offer film makers suggestions based on information drawn from its customer data base we have 40 million accounts on a computer , so we know consumer preferences by zip code , said ron castell , blockbuster s senior vice president for programming and

you do n't have to be theaterwise to know that the tony awards , the stage counterpart of the screen s critic s notebook oscars , reflect the exclusivity of broadway , not the wholeness of theater according to the eligibility rules for the accolades that will be bestowed tonight at the gershwin theater on broadway and broadcast live at 9 o'clock on cbs , theater is defined by 19 blocks in midtown manhattan and , for tonight , by princeton , nj the tony award to the mccarter theater outstanding regional theater is the designation attests to an awareness by the awards administration committee , upon recommendation by the american theater critics association , that theater is farther reaching than the streets where broadway shows live as a firsttime honor to a professional theater in new jersey , the mccarter s tony signals the long overdue impact of a theater in the state on the artistic consciousness of the nation the regional theater prize was established in 1977 , 30 years after the tonys were founded for all artistic intents and practical purposes , the mccarter s tony , many theatergoers feel , might as well be dubbed the mann award it was n't until the 199091 season , the first under the artistic direction of emily mann , that a consistent sense of occasion marked productions in the mccarter s theater series to many , the arrival of ms mann was tantamount to a wakeup call for a theater that had lapsed into complacency to others with a waitandsee attitude , ms mann had to prove she had the goods to hold on to a tried or perhaps tired and true audience and to attract a new one in just four seasons , she proved it listen to ms mann talk about her vision of theater and she will use such phrases as changing audience perception , breaking down barriers , feeling electricity in the air and involving audiences in nonpassive theater energy , emotion and event are recurring words the work speaks for itself sums up her credo in a conversation about theater , ms mann instinctively refers to the political scene in south africa , which is all for real he is euphoric , she said of the south african playright athol fugard of nelson mandela , she said , he pulled a miracle ms mann has been working on a screenplay about winnie mandela \( you strike a woman , you strike a rock \) , which she is turning into a stage play another a play in progress is the greensboro massacre , which confronts antisemitism and white supremacy ms mann came to the mccarter as an accomplished director and playwright with an intense social and political sensibility , notably as an innovator and specialist in documentary theater some of this comes no doubt from her father , the late arthur mann , a historian , whom she recalls wrote of multiculturalism and ethnicity before they became fashionable consider ms mann s plays , none of which have been produced at the mccarter annulla a survivor , one elderly woman s recollection of kristallnacht , with the text drawn entirely from tape recordings of the survivor still life , which is about a vietnam veteran she also worked from tapes with the man , his wife and his girlfriend and execution of justice , an epic docudrama 23 characters played 44 roles in the 1986 broadway production incorporating material culled from court transcripts the play involved the slaying of mayor george moscone of san francisco and harvey milk , a public official and homosexual activist , by dan white , another city official the verdict sparked off san francisco riots in 1978 it is no wonder that ms mann and anna deavere smith struck up an instant camaraderie when they met at a women s theater conference in the 1970 s ms smith s acclaimed theater works , fires in the mirror crown heights , brooklyn and other identities and twilight los angeles , 1992 took current events theater into yet another realm , establishing a genre that shapes oral history into theatrical monodrama and it is no wonder that ms smith chose ms mann to direct the second work in its world premiere at the mark taper forum in los angeles and then at the mccarter last season ms smith s performances at the mccarter resulted in a falling out between the two women and a singular stormy episode in ms mann s mccarter experience the journey of twilight from princeton to off broadway was less than happy or direct , with ms smith choosing another director , george c wolfe , for a new production twilight gives no program acknowledgement to the mccarter , where it was considered a work in progress oddly enough after a critically lauded los angeles run since the show moved to broadway , ms smith is up for two tony awards tonight in the categories of best play and best performance by a leading actress in a play not just topical plays for all ms mann s fervor about the theater of issues , it should not be assumed that the mccarter repertory depends on topicality alone note two plays by tennessee williams the glass menagerie , the first production of the mann era , and cat on a hot tin roof , both staged by ms mann , who is the director of two shows out of five every season
mayor rudolph w giuliani offered an impassioned plea to black new yorkers yesterday , seeking to assure them that there is nothing to fear in his mayoralty but he stuck by his refusal to meet with certain figures he views as divisive i read in the papers that there were some in the africanamerican community who fear me , a somber mr giuliani said at a ceremony at the cathedral of st john the divine commemorating the birthday of the rev dr martin luther king jr i ca n't tell you how much that hurts me except for the most external factor , we 're all the same mr giuliani s comments , delivered with former mayor david n dinkins seated just a few feet away , followed complaints from prominent blacks that he had not reached out to them , particularly after two confrontations in the preceding week between the police and black new yorkers but while he affirmed his intent to communicate with black new yorkers , the mayor made it clear in response to questions after the address that he felt some were doing a disservice to the city and would be kept at arm s length asked whether he would meet with the rev al sharpton , whose presence caused police commissioner william j bratton to cancel a scheduled meeting with muslim leaders on thursday , the mayor said some people , not only in light of the comments they made with regard to this incident , but after a long history in which they have divided this city they 're going to have to demonstrate to me at least that it would be a fruitful and productive meeting my conclusion , as a person of common sense and judgment , is that with certain people it would not be a productive meeting and when asked about criticism in recent days from representative charles b rangel , the harlem democrat , and other black elected officials , the mayor said , they 're going to have to learn how to discipline themselves in the way in which they speak mr giuliani has been criticized over his response to a brawl between police officers and black worshipers at a harlem mosque and the fatal shooting of a black youth by officers in a basement in east new york , brooklyn his address at the cathedral yesterday was made before a racially diverse audience of several hundred people , including several prominent city and state officials but his comments were clearly intended to reach a much larger audience , and specifically black new yorkers i have the same love , respect and caring for the africanamerican community as i do for all the communities of our city , he said give me a chance to show you that i will work as hard for every person in this city that i love you in the same way , and for the same reasons but he became far more pointed when speaking with reporters afterward , particularly in discussing criticism of his handling of the incident at the mosque that dispute , he said , is a created media incident in which people are going to be divided because people are being manipulated yesterday , as before , mr giuliani contended that investigation of the two cases should be left to the police department and that in the mosque incident , the victims were the eight injured police officers , not the black worshipers the fact is that no one has been arrested yet and no one has been turned in for doing that , he said this is an attempt to turn truth on its head , and i'm not going to allow that to happen the police acted properly response to rangel he also responded specifically to comments made earlier in the day by mr rangel on the wnbctv program news forum in which the congressman said mr giuliani had not done enough to reach out to black legislators and others i think he is so busy trying to prove that he s the person he campaigned to be , and that he s a good friend of the police , that he felt there s no need to communicate with anyone in the community that did not support him , mr rangel said mr giuliani , clearly exasperated , told reporters that many black officials were trying to make an issue when none exists , and i do n't know why they 're doing it they 've been doing it since the election , he said mr giuliani said that he had met with mr rangel after the election and that the talks had been cordial but he then lamented that mr rangel had criticized him afterward 'a twoway street' i want to work with everyone in the city , mr giuliani said testily i want to reach out to all the communities in the city it has to be a twoway street when asked why he believed black new yorkers might fear him , mr giuliani told reporters that it s because certain people wo n't let the stereotype go away that stereotype , he said , is that somehow there is a different standard for one community as opposed to another in this city as far as i'm concerned he insisted that he has reached out to black new yorkers since he was elected , saying , you see on my part an attempt to reach out , an attempt to show my caring , at attempt to show that i want to work for all the people of this city mr dinkins , who received the state s martin luther king jr medal of freedom at the ceremony at the cathedral , spoke briefly with mr giuliani during the event , urging the mayor not only to meet with black officials but also to make public those meetings mr dinkins said he was reluctant to comment on the matter because i know how easily these things can be misunderstood still , he said mr giuliani should meet with elected officials , especially those that represent harlem in fact , mr giuliani had met with a few black elected officials in recent days , including city councilwoman c virginia fields , who represents harlem but mr giuliani has been reluctant to disclose which black officials have attended any of the meetings 'conflicting signals' as mr giuliani spoke at the cathedral , mr sharpton was continuing his criticism of the mayor before addressing the congregation at the church of the meek , a baptist church on west 141st street in harlem , mr sharpton said it is clear to me that giuliani shoots from the hip without thinking he can not govern a city by continually sending conflicting signals and offending people referring to his strong showing among black voters in the democratic primary for united states senate in 1992 , mr sharpton added he should have some respect that i have proven a political constituency and i'm not just talking out of hand and even if we disagree , he could have been respectful another black critic of mayor giuliani , the rev dr wyatt tee walker of the canaan baptist church in harlem , faulted mr giuliani yesterday for his refusal to deal with mr sharpton and others , saying , how can you know what s in somebody s mind when you have n't talked to them \? and returning to language he directed at the mayor on a radio program on saturday , mr walker said , if he is not a fascist , he certainly behaves like one photos david n dinkins , the very rev james parks morton and mayor rudolph w giuliani attended a ceremony yesterday at the cathedral of st john the divine in manhattan honoring the rev martin luther king jr \( andrea mohin the new york times \) the rev al sharpton , center , leonard farrakhan muhammad , left , a minister of the nation of islam , and conrad muhammad , minister of nation of islam mosque no 7 in harlem , attending a news conference yesterday they discussed the brawl between police

a turkish court has sentenced eight kurdish members of parliament to prison for doing what representatives in a democracy are supposed to do speaking out in behalf of their constituents washington was right to protest this gross injustice it is a stain on turkey s human rights record even worse , it is a blow to turkish democracy it violates the principle of parliamentary immunity that is essential to representative government it also threatens to polarize turkish politics by driving kurdish dissent out of normal political channels and into the violent arms of kurdish separatists only a prompt pardon by turkey s president , suleyman demirel , and the return of the legislators to parliament could undo some of the damage washington would be wise to seek that many of the country s 15 million kurds are integrated into turkish society , but those who have sought to maintain their ethnic identity have faced discrimination and worse the kurdish language is banned kurdish human rights workers and journalists have been the victims of death squads others have disappeared while in the custody of security forces the government has turned its kurdish policy over to the army , which is seeking a purely military solution in its war on kurdish separatists it has turned southeastern turkey into a killing field , destroying villages and driving out the civilian population the main effect of this misguided strategy has been to generate recruits for separatism and radicalize kurds who want nothing more than their rights as citizens instead of seeking political accommodation with the kurds , the government banned the democracy party , which draws on kurds for support seven of its elected deputies , along with one independent , were arrested and held in preventive detention on trumpedup charges none were accused of acts of violence , and only one of any act at all allegedly giving shelter to five members of the separatist kurdistan workers party , or pkk their main offense was saying things the military and the government preferred not to hear after a procedurally tainted trial , the eight are now being sent to prison , some for 15 years ankara needs to correct this injustice and change its illconceived course

washington , march 8 lloyd n cutler was appointed special counsel to the president today and said white house aides would testify before any congressional inquiry into the whitewater case trying to demonstrate the openness that he had promised on the matter , mr clinton said at a news conference in which he announced the appointment that he would not try to use the powers of his office to shield himself from scrutiny moreover , mr cutler said , in government , as in other aspects of life , trust is the coin of the realm , and mr president , i pledge myself to do what i can to assure that trust is maintained a feeling of relief the appointment of mr cutler , 76 , who has agreed to serve as counsel for the next few months , was announced with evident relief by mr clinton as the centerpiece of the administration s effort to bounce back from recent reversals the most serious of those setbacks was the disclosure last week that white house aides and treasury department officials had discussed the federal investigation of madison guaranty savings and loan , a failed arkansas institution with ties to the clintons but white house officials also acknowledged today that there had been other contacts between white house and treasury officials about the handling of the madison investigation mr clinton said those contacts were incidental and were followup conversations which had nothing to do with the substance of the rtc investigations officials said there were only a few such conversations but would not detail them they said they would consider releasing the list of contacts after subpoenaed documents are handed over on thursday to robert b fiske jr , the special counsel investigating the investment by mr clinton and his wife , hillary , in the whitewater development company , an arkansas real estate venture , and the company s ties to madison guaranty delaying testimony while six senior white house officials have received subpoenas from mr fiske compelling them to appear in court that day , a lawyer involved in the case said at least some of them had won mr fiske s permission to delay their testimony until at least next week some have retained their own lawyers only in recent days , leaving them little time to prepare for the grand jury appearance a senior administration official said tonight that the treasury department had been served with an additional subpoena today covering all papers relevant to the inquiry and that officials there had requested more time beyond the thursday deadline to assemble the documents we ca n't possibly scour all the files by thursday , the official said the official said white house officials had now disclosed scores of contacts among them on the whitewater matter but the official characterized most of the contacts as brief conversations mr clinton appeared angry and on edge on monday , when he defended the integrity of his wife but today he appeared relaxed , insisted that he was not bitter and spoke at length about the issue do we need some changes in the system \? the president asked is lloyd cutler the person to help us do that \? i think the answer is yes i think he understands how to strike the proper balance no government pay mr cutler , a prominent lawyer who held the counsel s job in the carter white house , said during the news conference that he agreed to serve for no more 130 working days , and will work without pay but his status as a shorttime special government employee will allow him to receive at least part of his annual salary from his law firm , which associates estimated at 450 , 000 as a special employee , mr cutler can continue to represent some outside clients , and presidential aides said he would do so in one or two cases that do not involve the government in appointing mr cutler , mr clinton took pains to reach outside the circle of close friends and arkansas associates who are at the center of his recent troubles it was the most recent example of what has become almost a reflex in the white house trying to cure the problems that threaten to swamp the administration by hiring an outsider who is believed to lend support to a staff often hamstrung by its own inexperience and apparent ineptitude immediately after the news conference , mr clinton and mr cutler , along with mrs clinton , vice president al gore and the white house chief of staff , thomas f mclarty 3d , went to the east room in an effort to buoy the spirits of 400 aides assembled there in what officials described as an upbeat presentation , mr clinton reiterated his commitment to high ethical standards and urged the staff not to let the travails of the whitewater case interfere with their work both mr clinton and mr cutler declined to criticize bernard w nussbaum , the white house counsel who resigned under pressure on saturday after disclosures that he had attended all three meetings with the treasury officials that have been discussed mr nussbaum , whose resignation does not go into effect until april 5 , will continue to work in the counsel s office under mr cutler during the transition but at the news conference , both mr cutler and mr clinton asserted that business would be conducted differently in the future
six of the 15 hotels that new york city uses to house homeless families have refused to accept a cut in the city s payments , and a city official warned yesterday that the impasse could soon lead to a shortage of shelter space for such families joan malin , commissioner of the department of homeless services , said budget reductions had forced the department to cut the rate it pays to the hotels by 5 percent but some hotel owners have said they would not accept the lower rates , and ms malin said the city would no longer be able to afford to place people in those hotels ms malin identified the six hotels as the lenox in manhattan , the stadium and the town and country in the bronx and the colonial , the kings inn and the kennedy inn in queens together , ms malin said , they accommodate 516 families placed by the city , out of a total of 939 families none will be forced out ms malin said the new reimbursement schedule took effect yesterday , but that none of the families now living in the hotels would be forced out a space shortage could come , she said , as the families now living in the hotels apply to continue living there a process known as recertification families are required to prove that they still qualify to stay in a hotel at the city s expense every two weeks or 28 days , depending on their situation the city is under a court order to provide shelter for anyone who seeks it we are not asking for substantial rate cuts , ms malin said we are asking that they take 104 a night instead of 110 , or 94 instead of 99 for the past several years these hotel owners have profited handsomely she assailed the hotel owners who objected to the cuts , calling them recalcitrant and greedy and accusing them of turning away homeless families but david fuld , a partner in family center associates , which owns all of the hotels ms malin cited except the kennedy inn , rejected her characterization i am not that greedy landlord she portrayed today , mr fuld said we have not turned away anyone and we are not looking for a fight the city is our main client , he continued we are asking to negotiate because there is a significant amount of money involved , and this cut comes on top of other cuts we have been asked to take mr fuld said he had tried without success to meet with ms malin to discuss a compromise ms malin said she was confident that between the other welfare hotels , the city s shelters and other facilities , homeless families could be accommodated through the holiday weekend but ms malin said , this could mean that families will be sleeping in emergency assistance unit offices next week steve banks , a lawyer for the legal aid society s homeless family rights project , criticized the city for the potential housing shortage these families are being used as pawns in budgetbalancing fight between the city and the hotel owners , mr banks said even before the city precipitated this crisis by cutting the rates , there have been hundreds of families left to sleep in the bronx eau offices because of lack of shelter space
mexico city , nov 9 making its bid for one of the biggest prizes in the mexican economy , the att corporation announced a 1 billion alliance today with a mexican partner , grupo industrial alfa sa , that would provide longdistance telephone service when the present governmentapproved monopoly ends in 1997 analysts had expected att to decide to enter the expanding mexican market , but were surprised by its selection of alfa , an industrial group that manufactures diverse products ranging from coldcut meats to flat steel , but has no telephone experience att had been expected to choose telefonos de mexico , the privately run national telephone company known as telmex victor a pelson , executive vice president of att and chairman of its global operations team , explained that negotiations with telmex were broken off because of concern about possible regulatory problems in the united states the southwestern bell corporation bought 10 percent of telmex when the company was privatized in 1990 but the federal communications commission bars regional phone companies in the united states from entering the longdistance market mr pelson said that because of southwestern bell s involvement , the fcc could prohibit telmex from providing longdistance service into the united states traffic between mexico and the united states , that was the issue , he said the mci communications corporation and the sprint corporation have also joined mexican partners to vie for one of the treasured longdistance concessions to be granted by the government the gte corporation and motorola inc have also expressed interest but none of these would bring to the table the combination of att s technological advantages and the financial resources of alfa , which had sales in 1993 of 25 billion and has strategic alliances with 15 other multinational companies , including ford motor , du pont and oscar meyer , a unit of philip morris let s face it , said jack grubman , a telecommunications analyst at salomon brothers in new york when you take a company like att , which is clearly the world s most powerful telecommunications entity with the world s most sophisticated technology , and combine it with a company like alfa , with all its considerable financial assets , and you make it the new kid on block it s scary the exclusion of telmex did not seem to have hurt its stock much today telmex shares dropped about 1 percent in mexico and its american depository receipts closed at 56 on the new york stock exchange , down 1 at a news conference here today , officials of both att and alfa said that over the next four to six years , they were prepared to invest 1 billion to create a network that would compete with telmex in longdistance service alfa would own 51 percent of the new venture , and att the remaining 49 percent longdistance service in mexico is seen as a lucrative market with great potential for growth as the mexican economy expands under the north american free trade agreement personal phone services are also expected to grow as more mexicans can afford telephones mexico now has 8 lines for each 100 inhabitants , att said , compared with 55 lines in the united states att said the number of lines in mexico could triple by 2000 mexican regulators have not yet set out all the criteria for selecting longdistance competitors but analysts say the government could effectively control the number of companies by demanding a high level of technological expertise or what would become a multibilliondollar entrance fee such prospects have not deterred att officials i ca n't imagine that any entrance requirements would be too restrictive for us to enter the market , mr pelson of att said the chief executive officer of alfa , dionisio garza medina , said he expected the government to select the winning longdistance bidders by the end of the first quarter of 1995 he said alfa had planned to bid for the telmex concession when the company was privatized in 1990 , but decided instead to revamp its own basic businesses three years and more than 15 billion later , mr garza medina said , his company is looking for investments in longterm , highgrowth sectors like telecommunications berge ayvazian , a telecommunications industry analyst at the yankee group , a market research firm in boston , said the alfaatt alliance showed new boldness on the part of the american company , which is trying to become a force in the telecommunications markets in several other developing countries this is just the first shoe that you 'll see dropped regarding the rest of latin america , mr ayvazian said chart the company alfa keeps though alfa is far from a household name in the united states , it is one of mexico s largest industrial corporations , with 22 , 500 employees and 249 billion in sales in 1993 its ambitions and clout in its home market can be discerned in the alliances its four business groups have forged with leading foreigh companies chart lists products and alliances of the four business groups of alfa \( pg d22 \)
new york city s most inspiring architect lives in london , works in rotterdam and has yet to build a thing on the north american continent but for the next three months , rem koolhaas has the stage at the museum of modern art , where new yorkers can see for themselves how their city continues to shape the world even as their own architecture has slipped below worldclass standards considering all the fanfare this show has generated , including lavish spreads in the fashion glossies , oma at moma rem koolhaas and the place of public architecture turns out to be relatively modest in scale confined to one topfloor gallery in the modern s department of architecture and design , the show presents models and drawings for five projects designed in the last five years by mr koolhaas and his office for metropolitan architecture \( oma \) three additional models , depicting urban plans , are displayed on the landing outside \( models for three private houses are on view in the museum s education center on the ground floor \) but anticipation for this show , which was first scheduled to open more than a year ago , has been mounting for some time and the hoopla is not incidental to the work on view this is a show about buildings and cities , but it is also a show about aura the aura of the city , the role buildings play in creating that aura and the glamour that occasionally surrounds an architect of promise , leading excitable critics to plunge recklessly overboard with extravagant words of praise mr koolhaas , who was born in the netherlands in 1944 and educated at the architectural association in london , first achieved public attention with the 1978 publication of his book delirious new york , an ecstatic love poem to manhattan that challenged conventional thinking in urban design while planners and urban designers struggled to bring logic , sanity and order to the built environment , mr koolhaas argued that the glory of the city lies in the exceptional , the excessive , the extreme a champion of what he called the culture of congestion , mr koolhaas viewed the manhattan skyline as a kind of euphoric party , as if architecture had been squeezed vertically not by realestate values but by the eagerness of people to get together on a small island and laugh it up since that colorful debut , mr koolhaas has accumulated an impressive body of built work , including apartment buildings in the netherlands and japan , the netherlands dance theater in the hague and the kunsthal , an art exhibition center in rotterdam he has also pushed the limits of architecture with provocative designs for projects that so far remain unbuilt , like the jussieu library in paris but the achievement that has established him most solidly on the international map is mr koolhaas s master plan for euralille , a commercial project now nearing completion in northern france designed to exploit lille s position as a major hub for europe s highspeed trains , euralille includes buildings by the architects christian de portzamparc and jean nouvel , in addition to a trade and convention center designed by mr koolhaas these projects , too , display mr koolhaas s enduring passion for new york the glasscurtainwall skyscrapers pioneered by mies van der rohe the bustling street life of places like times square , where peril and pleasure jostle each other in a synergistic mix but mr koolhaas s most highly burnished new york touchstone is the work of the architect wallace k harrison harrison , the subject of a show organized by mr koolhaas in 1980 at the institute for architecture and urban studies in manhattan , designed such fabled new york landmarks as the united nations headquarters , the trylon and perisphere at the 1939 new york world s fair , and the hall of science at the 196465 world s fair for mr koolhaas , these projects represent the ideal of an architecture at once modern and romantic they defined an urban mythology for changing times organized by terence riley , chief curator of the modern s architecture and design department , the koolhaas show was at one point scheduled to run concurrently with last season s mammoth show on frank lloyd wright the two would have made an illuminating pair , for mr koolhaas s vision of the city is nearly the antithesis of wright s wright , at the threshold of the automobile age , championed the centrifugal city , dispersed into the suburban landscape by the car , the highway and the romantic ideal of individual autonomy mr koolhaas stands , by contrast , for the centripetal city for the urban center that , at the end of the century , continues to act as a cultural magnet and an incubator for ideas mr koolhaas s designs for archetypal urban institutions two libraries , a museum , a school , a marketplace are the core of the modern s show on a certain level , these buildings are about coping mr riley writes in the exhibition brochure that mr koolhaas and oma perceive the city as a survivor survivors are not victims they have earned the right to set their own terms cities should n't be competing with the suburbs by trying to become more like them they do n't have to turn themselves into theme parks they have better things to do than indulge the fear that their best days are behind them by encouraging architects to design new buildings that look old
the courtesan and the eunuch 28th street theater 120 west 28th street manhattan through jan 30 by terry bradberry directed by dan mckereghan sets and costumes by keven lock lighting by christopher caines stage manager , sonia belochi presented by new globe productions with blythe baten , jennifer fleming , eleonora kihlberg , john marino and paolo seganti not many morality plays are being written anymore , and after seeing the courtesan and the eunuch , a new play by terry bradberry , it is easy to understand why for one thing , good and evil are not quite as simple as mr bradberry would like us to believe for reasons that are never explained and have nothing to do with anything that happens onstage , mr bradberry sets his play in tangier 50 years in the future or perhaps the past \( it s always a troubling sign when the playwright does n't know when his story takes place \) a writer named emile convinces a paramour of moroccan high society to take back her most recently discarded young lover , a friend of the writer named leon , simply to destroy him more completely emile , who writes fairy tales for the depraved under a pseudonym , needs material for his next story and wants to see firsthand how a truly evil woman operates he taunts the courtesan with the challenge that until she has destroyed a man completely , she is just another whore his plan is for the femme fatale to feign a secret religiosity and make the unsuspecting leon \( by convenient coincidence a closet mystic \) pledge celibacy as a token of their pure love she would then seduce leon , devastating him with his own guilt if there is a certain gothic fascination to the setup , it is quickly dissolved by the predictability of the story that follows and the cliched writing with which it is told as a subplot , for example , emile has a blind daughter whom he keeps hidden and whom everyone believes to be his own secret lover by this time , the whole tale has come to resemble les liaisons dangereuses meets rigoletto in an apparent effort to inject some sense of mystery and eroticism into the play , the courtesan performs a striptease , her young lover begins to hear voices and develops stigmata , and there are several dark , inexplicable references to sums of money being owed to the italians all of this is more baffling than intriguing , partly because of the monotonous performances , none of which convey any of the menace the story so badly needs , and the staging , which is static \( and why do european expatriates living in morocco all speak in american mall accents \? \) you have to be cold to write about passion , emile smugly confides at one point as dubious as that assertion may be , even emile would concede one need not be anemic wilborn hampton
rebuilding roads has costs beyond the financial in coram a crew has disturbed an area around two historic sites at the intersection of routes 112 and 25 in stony brook residents protested when a plan to add turning lanes at the state university of new york threatened a site of geological interest and in smithtown crews killed centuriesold trees while rebuilding the bridge carrying routes 25 and 25a over the nissequogue river we are losing our historic areas , planning director frank derubeis of smithtown said it s a constant fight from the highway man s point of view , we are naive they want to build good roads , and the trees get in the way state officials say federal and state laws require historic and environmental reviews before road work begins , as well as specific approval for all work done construction crews do not have any discretion about any aspect of a job , a spokesman for the state transportation department , mel cooperman , said everything they do is dictated by the plans but smithtown residents and officials say more trees than necessary were cut in august to replace the 65yearold bridge over the nissequogue mr derubeis said the trees were outside the scope of the bridge work there was a way to preserve them , he said they have a right to change their plans it s their road but a number of those trees that came down did n't have to for the construction in august the crews removed six old trees , including a 250yearold willow at a county park near the bridge local officials said they never received final designs for the 36 million project the transportation department carefully examines all sites where tree removal is a possibility and tries to find alternatives , mr cooperman said , adding in this case , there were none all of the removals were required either to enable sound construction of the roadway and the embankment , or because their presence posed a safety hazard due to proximity to the roadway the state denied that it had failed to discuss the plans with the town , and the state has agreed to replant trees on the site of the old ones a drive through coram reflects the history of the hamlet a scattering of whiteshake buildings inscribed with dates shows that it flourished in the mid1800 s apple trees continue to grow in the stripmall parking lots along route 25 , and the coram schoolhouse , built in 1842 , can be seen behind flourishing shrubbery barely visible through the labyrinth of detours and the heavy equipment at the intersection of routes 112 and 25 stands the white steeple of the trinity united methodist church , built in 1841 work to add turning lanes , correct drainage and improve traffic dominates the busy intersection , where motorists cut through parking lots and grassy areas to avoid the maze of construction the reputed site of the first public pump in the town of brookhaven , at the southeastern corner of the intersection , and the coram fire department memorial to the burning of the coram haystacks in the american revolution are in jeopardy the small triangular patch of grass with three plaques , including histories of the haystack burnings , is being chipped away to replace curbing a memorial erected by the state and the col josiah smith chapter of the daughters of the american revolution portrays the meadow where washington ordered maj benjamin tallmadge and 12 of his men to burn a 300ton stack of hay stored by the british on nov 23 , 1780 , while long island was under english control before the construction a sign proclaimed the approximate site of the pump the sign has vanished , and dirt and construction debris cover the area mr cooperman said because the areas were not listed historic sites no special permission was required to work on them the coram fire department will replace the sign when the job is completed at another arbitrary site , he said the sign , one of several designating historic sites , was erected by the fire department several years ago the plaque stated that the well , built in 1832 with a small trough , had an oldtype chain pump and was the lone public well in the area the pump , too , fell prey to traffic according to suffolk every sunday on april 10 , 1932 , road construction demanded its removal that year there is always the possibility of losing things when you make changes , town historian david overton of brookhaven said at the state university at stony brook , plans to resurface and add turning lanes to east loop road concern nearby residents because of the nearness to glacial topography the road , which loops east off nicolls road , leads around university hospital and other buildings and reenters nicolls road a halfmile from its entrance east loop road borders the kettle hole park area , where melting blocks of glacial ice formed two large depressions the kettle holes are important , because they demonstrate dramatically what extreme topography can result from this glacial process , assemblyman steven engelbright , democrat of setauket , said they gain an insight into our natural heritage and are as important as any waterfall or cave in a national park mr engelbright , a geologist , said that after complaints from residents and environmentalists , he met twice with university officials we are concerned that the road shoulder will encroach on the depression , causing erosion and sediment to go into the kettle hole , mr engelbright said campus officials said they had redesigned the drainage to protect the kettle hole we are taking erosioncontrol measures , diverting the runoff into dry wells , the campus architect , eric anderson , said mr derubeis said building good roads did not have to conflict with protecting landscapes robert moses was one of the few highway people who ever believed in that concept , mr derubeis said we have to temper that philosophy it s a constant fight photo historical markers are on island in middle of intersection of

a few dozen elderly men gather each day in the main hall of the tung on association on division street in manhattan to drink tea and play mahjongg beneath dusty paintings of george washington and the chinese leader sun yatsen , restlessly clacking their colored tiles against the tops of worn wooden tables members of the tung on like to say that their association is as innocent as their afternoon gatherings but federal prosecutors say they can prove otherwise , and they have charged clifford wong , the tung on s longtime president , with leading a criminal enterprise that killed 10 people and participated in many other crimes , like armed robbery and heroin trafficking the tung on case has lifted a curtain on one of the most enduring mysteries about chinatown how leaders of tongs , or fraternal organizations , sometimes rely on street gangs and professional killers to protect and expand their businesses , many of them gambling operations for prosecutors , the case is a milestone while they have periodically cracked down on street gangs during the last decade , until now they have never been able to link the violent acts of a gang to a tong we 've never gone to a level this high before , said catherine e palmer , the federal prosecutor in the case , who has won convictions in several asian organized crime cases during the last eight years we 're talking about tong leaders here the central figure in the tung on case is mr wong , 39 , a man with a slightly puffy face and a head of thick , black hair prosecutors portray him as a powerful businessman who owned race horses and restaurants in florida and new york city , and who had close friends in the hong kong underworld acquaintances say that mr wong also suffered from a gambling addiction a secretive man rarely seen in chinatown without two bodyguards , mr wong cultivated the reputation of someone with dangerous friends to impress and intimidate his financial partners , and often exaggerated the extent of his wealth , acquaintances say mr wong s lawyer , barry schulman , would not comment on the charges against his client , who is being held without bail in a federal detention center in brooklyn a trial is scheduled for october unlike mafia crime families , law enforcement officials say , asian crime networks are loosely organized , making it difficult to track patterns of wrongdoing to minimize their risk in any given criminal enterprise whether operating a gambling den , importing heroin or smuggling illegal immigrants businessmen like mr wong rarely act alone and frequently shift partners court records and interviews with tong members show that mr wong s downfall came after prosecutors found gang members willing to provide evidence that he ordered crimes to protect his gambling operations with about 120 active members , the tung on led by mr wong has traditionally been known as the third most influential of chinatown s 70 tongs , after the hip sing on pell street and the on leong on mott street the fukienamerican association on east broadway has also become more prominent in recent years aid for immigrants in most of its functions , the tung on is a legitimate association of businessmen and immigrants from the same part of china , with an executive board , monthly meetings and a banquet at chinese new year when it was established early this century , named for two counties abutting hong kong whence its members came , the tong was like an unofficial social service center , helping new immigrants locate relatives and find a place to stay in recent decades , those functions dropped off as the pattern of immigration from china shifted to other parts of the country but tong members say the tung on is still a social anchor for people far from their native land prosecutors say that like many other tongs , it was also a regular home to illegal gambling operations youths from hong kong the need for guards , bouncers and debt collectors for the gambling operation led to the tong s hiring of disaffected young men from hong kong , said a member of the tung on , who spoke on the condition of anonymity a gang emerged in the 1970 s while it owed its main business to the tong , he said , it was involved in other crimes on its own , like muggings and kidnappings the ties between the tung on and its street gang were symbiotic , the association member said the tung on relied on its gang to safeguard its gambling operations , and through the association , the gang gained prestige and the right to collect protection money from merchants along division street gang members sometimes frequented tong headquarters , but were rarely allowed to join the gang , calling itself the tung on boys , did not try to hide the identity of its parent association , and the name similarity confused people outside chinatown about the relationship between the two but while the tong was a permanent club of men over 30 , the gang was an everchanging collection of 80 or 90 youths divided into separate factions that competed for work

gov mario m cuomo met with editors and reporters of the new york times for 5 hours 15 minutes on monday to discuss the issues in the gubernatorial race , his record in 12 years in office , and his goals for a fourth term a transcript of the session ran to almost 44 , 000 words here are excerpts economy the budget in a wideranging discussion of the state economy and budget , the governor was asked how his proposals to cut taxes , still partly unspecified , would affect both local governments and the state s own recurring gap between revenues and expenditures q i just wanted to make sure that i understood your view about the projections of budget gaps in the years ahead are you saying you do n't believe them or you 're saying a no , we 've had them like for , every year you have them 2 billion , 3 billion , 1 billion and then you adjust what you do is you spend less you draw back on commitments you had liberty scholarships three years ago , 70 million i did n't fund it why not \? ca n't fund it this is the argument i had with the legislature all the time i said be careful about what you 're promising people explain to everybody that every year we must redo the budget or we 'll lose credbility when they did the trust fund on transportation , i said do n't do the lock box you know , you say you 're going to lock it up you know we ca n't guarantee it s going to be locked up what if you need the money for something else \? and that s exactly what happened we had to dip into the locked box cutting taxes q what you 're saying , if i understand it , governor , is the public hunger for tax cuts is so strong that you are willing to cut services that you know the public wants to give them a tax cut why not instead say , hey , i 'd rather give you liberty scholarships , i think that s more important , that poor people can get college education a i think that those are all adjustments you have to make as governor and i would make you pause , though , over your first assumption which is that this is what the people want if you gave the people what they wanted , there 'd be no taxes you ca n't give them enough to satisfy them with tax cuts that s not why you do it i guarantee you no matter what tax cuts you do they will not be satisfied asked about the burden of state and local taxes in new york , the governor said , local taxes are high because the local government made them high he complained that a times editorial had sought to blame him for passing costs along to localities , which compensated by raising their own taxes , and denied that he had done so a it does n't make any difference , except it s the times and now it s out there in the atmosphere for everybody to read , that the the state is responsible for the local taxes what you failed to mention is that we picked up 73 billion in longterm medicaid costs since 1984 we 're trying to pick up more that our budget has gone from 58 percent for the local government to 70 percent for the local government that our budget has gone from 26 percent for the state superintendent of police and this job , all the other things to 18 percent i have done more not i , the legislature and i have done more to lift the burden off the shoulders of local government than ever before in the modern history of the state no one s even close , no one even tried , except hughie carey in 1975 , we took courts off your hands remember we had to bail out new york city that was the last time we did anything significant now , the this is n't being mentioned you fail to note that we reduced our own expenditures over a billion dollars how \? i reduced my public payroll from '90 to '92 14 percent i laid off 6 , 000 people , i gave no raises for two years until rudy giuliani when did that ever happen at the city level \? when has it ever happened at the federal level \? when has it ever happened in nassau or suffolk or westchester or rockland , the people whose taxes you want us to cut \? q if you have a billion and a half dollars that you could use , why not use it in some form to relieve local tax burdens \? a a good possibility that what would develop , what you 'd have to do , is you 'd have to call in the locals and say look , guys and gals there are two ways we can do this i can reduce my taxes or we can figure out a guaranteed way we use this wealth for you to reduce yours i want to do medicaid pickup medicaid pickup is not contingent upon you reducing your taxes let s sit down let s talk turkey let s talk topics come on , bring in the county executives if we give you this many dollars , what do you do at the local level to reduce your own costs \? i have no way of ordering that i have no way , you know , of passing a tax bill politically , it would be impossible , but even legally , jurisdictionally , i could n't pass a tax bill that said to the local governments , you 're going to get benefits from us and medicaid pickup and you must all cut your payrolls 10 percent i ca n't do that it would have to be negotiated
when baseball club owners join the strikebound labor negotiations this week , they will sit at the table saddled with greater divisions than they would like the players or anyone else to think despite management s constant claim of unity and solidarity , the division became noticeable in the last few days as a result of the federal mediators' success in inducing the owners to allow five members of their group to attend bargaining sessions already laboring under the weight of a low revenue versus high revenue conflict , which is the basic source of the ninedayold strike , the clubs found themselves at odds over the roster compiled by bud selig , their acting leader , for the talks according to two members of management , national leaguers were complaining that on his initial list , which he did not disclose publicly , selig had included too many american leaguers on the fiveperson lineup for the first meeting of the renewed talks two other highranking management people said others were complaining that the list included too many hardline owners and not enough moderates for the meeting , which is expected to be held wednesday in a recent discussion of the possibility of having owners at the table , one owner said , the problem is always the traditions and jealousies over which owners get to the table selig is not likely to alter the list to appease the moderates , but he will most likely be more sensitive to the complaints about the numbers from each league selig , however , said yesterday that he was unaware of any complaints i 've heard none of that , the acting commissioner said by telephone from milwaukee , adding that he was still working on the list , that it was n't complete and that it would be announced tomorrow selig declined to comment on the names disclosed friday by a highranking club official , but two other members of management said the list was not accurate they declined to provide specifics since the club official said he got the names from information given to owners , it is conceivable that selig already had altered the roster by the time the names appeared in print selig and richard ravitch , the owners' chief labor executive , have repeatedly said the owners are unified and strong in their support of management s salary cap proposal in addition , ravitch has often said that he has not received a call from a single owner urging him to change the proposal no dissident voices heard another member of management said he has heard no dissident voices during telephone conference calls if all of those comments are accurate , they leave the possibility that disenchanted owners are expressing their frustrations more to each other , to their executives and to reporters than they are to an ownership group they know is stacked against them the moderates , primarily owners of highrevenue clubs , simply do not have the numbers to force or even induce a change in the seligravitch strategy one owner who wanted to avert a strike indicated two weeks ago that there were not enough owners to force a change in the salary cap stance if there were , it would 've been done , but it was n't , he said so instead of making nuisances of themselves on conference calls , the moderates apparently hold their tongues , waiting for a more propitious moment , if one ever surfaces a hardline approach the group that attends the first bargaining session since the first day of the strike , aug 12 , is certain to be loaded with hardline owners or representatives of hardline owners , even though the lineup is supposed to be a mixture of lowrevenue and highrevenue clubs union officials expect the group to come in with a series of scripted remarks in a joint telephone conversion , they said they are hopeful , but they do n't expect anything substantive to result from the meeting they expect the owners to come out singing the management version of solidarity forever' and singing choruses of praise for their proposal and the proponents of it union and management officials have given no indication that they plan to change their bargaining positions the only difference will be that owners will join the talks because the federal mediators requested that some be present ravitch s solo act one owner said the owners will be there at least a week before ravitch wanted any of them there another , speaking before the decision was made , said if owners were permitted to sit at the table , it s going to have to be a change of mind because ravitch absolutely does not want an owner at the table ravitch yesterday denied holding that position that s not true , ravitch said asked why people would have that idea , he said they could have a misimpression from discussions i 've never said that one of the owners saw potentially positive results stemming from the presence of owners in the negotiations if you could possibly pick the right guy or two guys or three guys , it would be a good thing to have an owner at the table , he said , speaking on the condition that he would not be identified selig imposed a gag rule on owners the day the strike began because some had made comments contrary to management s bargaining position the missing link i do n't know how you go about selecting who that owner would be , but there are guys out there i think could make a difference , the owner said what an owner at the table does is it gives the players an idea that what they 're saying and what fehr is saying is being heard and received by guys who own clubs , as opposed to guys who are employed by clubs , and that s the link that s missing one person who has had labor experience as an owner said he believed the presence of owners in the talks was primarily a public relations matter and window dressing for the federal mediators it does n't serve any useful purpose , he said as a matter of fact , it might even set the talks back what the union is trying to do is have some disruption among the owners there could be some photo bud selig , the acting commissioner , has been criticized by colleagues for his initial list of owners who will be sitting at the bargaining table \( associated

harvey keitel is at the sushi bar a group of gorgeous sixfoot models sits nearby , passing a telephone around the table and the man just behind me is shouting , you 've really never tried prozac \? hollywood has invaded manhattan disguised as a japanese restaurant but as any of the japanese travelers who flock to the restaurant will tell you , nobu , despite its sushi bar and elegantly arranged plates of tempura , is not a japanese restaurant it is n't really an american restaurant , either , but something that seems as if it were invented on an airplane 5 miles up and 1 , 500 miles inland from either coast the decor , a cross between an enchanted forest and a set for the movie mishima , places nobu firmly in that fantasy restaurantland that recognizes no geographic boundaries when you walk through the door of this former bank , you must be prepared for a grand entertainment that it is , this brainchild of the los angeles chef nobuyuki matsuhisa , the movie star robert de niro and the restaurateur drew nieporent for eight years , mr matsuhisa has been entertaining los angeles in a modest storefront restaurant where he honed his hybrid cooking a tokyoborn sushi chef , he spent years in peru developing a taste for chilies and garlic before moving on to alaska by the time he landed in los angeles , he was ready to feed that city s insatiable appetite for experimentation his timing was good before long all of hollywood was flocking to his modest restaurant , begging for bites of his trompe l'oeil pasta made of squid and tossed with asparagus , butter and garlic even people who could n't stand the idea of raw fish were happy there , gobbling up mr matsuhisa s grilled steaks of tuna belly , his caviartopped pates , his sweet black cod marinated in miso more adventurous eaters fell for his tiradito , raw slices of snapper topped with a searing chili sauce occasionally someone would complain that the restaurant was really very ugly , or very loud , and that the service was incredibly brusque for a meal that could easily cost 70 a person , but those voices tended to get lost in the happy buzz about the place the opening of the new york restaurant makes it clear that somebody was listening the new nobu tries to fulfill every american s dream of a japanese restaurant in this bold space with its handglazed tiles and chairs with legs like chopsticks , the dishes are arranged with the spare elegance of japanese flowers , the service is thoughtful and extremely gentle , and the food offers something for every taste people who like sake can delight in the way silky hokusetsu fills the mouth with an almost oily coldness , and they can enjoy the heft of the icy bamboo pitcher each time they pick it up to pour the clear , heavy liquor into tiny bamboo cups those who do n't can console themselves with a bottle of wine from a list chosen to complement the food the food itself offers the same varieties of experience for those who like straightforward sushi and sashimi , there is raw fish of astonishing quality for those who do n't , there is new style sashimi , notquiteraw fish that is quickly seared in a mixture of garlic , scallions , ginger , sesame seeds and olive oil tempura , steamed clams , even teriyaki await the unadventurous , and people who consider japanese cuisine an exotic way to diet will be delighted to discover the menu s many salads at its best , however , nobu is anything but a lowcalorie experience if you put yourself in the chef s hands , he is likely to bombard you with riches this will inevitably include his monkfish liver pate , the foie gras of the sea , topped with a big scoop of caviar and served in a light soy dressing because mr matsuhisa tends to think in terms of contrasting flavors and textures , he might pair this with lovely pinwheels of salmon wrapped around pickled burdock and garlic and enfolded in marinated kelp for his next act , mr matsuhisa might offer a pairing of seared fatty tuna , so rich it evaporates in the mouth , and a salad of moroheiya leaves , the herbal egyptian lettuce topped with shaved dried bonito in a dressing with the distinct citric tang of yuzu , the japanese lemon the meal could go on like this for hours , a seemingly endless sequence of flavors that are sometimes comforting , sometimes shocking , never dull one night , a sashimi plate of kan pachi , the wild yellowtail that is leaner and firmer than the soft farmed fish , came on a plate with red snapper and geoduck , the crisp giant clam of puget sound it was followed by king crab legs in a creamyspicy sauce that tasted to me like so much hot mayonnaise i was also not a fan of the new style sashimi after the appealingly dry textures of raw fish , it left my mouth feeling slightly greasy but with mr matsuhisa you have only to wait something wonderful is always on the horizon one evening it was a small iron teapot filled with broth and the first matsutake mushrooms of the season the soup also contained bits of chicken , a shrimp , some ginkgo nuts a little crescent of lime came riding in on the teapot , waiting to be squeezed into the soup to make it even more

newark , del jack and pat lipinski never intended to become the parents of a figureskating phenom when their only child , tara , was born 12 years ago , jack seemed relieved to have a daughter we do n't have to worry if she s the best athlete in school , he told his wife which was fine with pat , who knew or cared little about sports , especially skating , where she could n't distinguish a double axel from a double play i ended up with more than i bargained for , jack lipinski said in july , three weeks after her 12th birthday , tara became the youngest winner at the olympic sports festival , a competition for the country s developing athletes next month , she will compete at the junior world championships in budapest if she attains her dream of competing in the 1998 winter olympics in japan , tara will have ascended among skating royalty from princess to ice queen by the doddering old age of 15 pat lipinski would love to say that she is thrilled by this prospect of course , she s proud of her daughter , but she still feels gnawing ambivalence to float tara s dream , the lipinskis have made difficult financial , familial , social and educational decisions for training purposes , tara and her mother live apart from her father tara no longer attends school , relying on a private tutor the unquenchable cost of skating has forced the family to refinance their home these choices are remarkable not because the lipinskis were forced to make them but because they are the accepted consequences for families with daughters who aspire to be olympic skaters like kristi yamaguchi , oksana baiul or nancy kerrigan it s a shame they have to do this at such a young age , pat lipinski said as women s skating becomes more reliant on triple jumps , which require boundless energy and compactness of size , the sport increasingly demands youth baiul of ukraine won the 1994 olympic title at 16 the top amateur skater in the united states , michelle kwan of los angeles , turned 14 in july some parallels can be drawn between these young skaters and tennis prodigies like venus williams of the united states and the czechborn martina hingis , both of whom are turning professional at age 14 and have raised concerns of exploitation but , in the case of tara lipinski , the differences far outweigh the similarities to tennis tara is not a professional but an amateur competing on the junior level she has no agent , no endorsements , and until she wins a medal at the olympics , no chance to become an instant millionaire unlike tennis , she has no opportunity now to compete at a dozen or more events for cash prizes worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars figure skating , along with gymnastics and speed skating , is among the most unforgiving and darwinian of sports , requiring a risky , insatiable investment and deferred satisfaction an entire career 10 or 15 or 20 years of rigorous training and enormous expense is forged or melted down in the fourminute crucible of the winter games i was once asked to put a dollar sign on how much we 've spent , jack lipinski said honestly , i 'd be afraid to he makes a comfortable living as vice president of refining for the coastal corporation , an energy company but salaries alone seldom pay for skating three years ago , he accepted a transfer from south jersey to houston , partly for career advancement , partly because the family needed more money to pay for skating we were n't spending nearly as much as we are now , but we were drowning , jack lipinski said since then , mrs lipinski said , the family has refinanced its mortgage to squeeze out still more money for training costs , which will approach 50 , 000 this year in living expenses , coaches' fees , ice time , travel and costumes two grants worth 6 , 000 have helped defray expenses , pat said , but our charge plates are killing us you pay for the skating , you put the groceries on the charge plate at least the family has its dream house in houston the paradox is , tara and her mother no longer live there in june 1993 , when tara was 11 and an emerging talent , it was decided that she should train at the university of delaware ice arena , one of a handful of elite training centers in the country so , while jack remained in houston , tara and pat took an apartment in elkton , md , near the delaware campus after 20 years of marriage , the lipinskis , who grew up in bayonne , nj , and are both 43 , now juggle their schedules to see each other once a month tara knows i'm sad being away from my husband , pat lipinski said it s hard to do it s lonely but i 'd give my daughter anything she loves it and we 're seeing results i ca n't just demand that she stop for the rest of my life , i 'd have to sit around and think , 'what if , what if \? ' still , the question wo n't go away is this all worth it \? living apart the promethean expense having tara tutored instead of placed in regular school what about the social consequences \? is tara giving up her childhood \? what if she burns out as jennifer capriati did in tennis or gets injured or has a growth spurt \? what if this is a road to nowhere \?
politically correct bedtime stories by james finn garner 79 pp new york macmillan publishing company 895 somebody had to do it and james finn garner has met the challenge manfully or , rather , like a fully realized individual , secure in his personhood and in touch with his inner child in politically correct bedtime stories , he blows the lid off classic literature s dirty little secret those fairy tales we all grew up with are disgustingly un enlightened they 're embarrassing , really litanies of conquest and oppression , full of testosteronecrazed giants , hairy trolls and other threatening social outcasts who enjoy abusing children , playing tricks on the mentally impaired , wearing fur and eating meat , sometimes human meat \( not that one should place a lesser value on nonhuman than on human animals , thus falling victim to speciescentered thinking \) and the women ! or , as mr garner prefers , wom yn tradition has exposed us to a parade of submissive ninnies \( except for the witches , more power to them \) who pass the time swooning , kissing frogs \( not because they 're open to interspecies relationships but because they ca n't get dates \) , waiting for princes to come along , spinning straw into gold \( clearly a deadend job \) and consulting the mirror on the wall for reassurance that they meet society s eurocentric whitebread standards of beauty mr garner , a writer and performer from chicago who has the grace to admit he s the descendant of dead white european males , has rewritten 13 of these offensive tales , purging them \( in the good sense , not the bulimic sense \) of their racist , sexist and monocultural bias the result is a breath of fresh air and a welldeserved slap in the face for hans christian andersen and the brothers grimm \( where are the stories of the sisters grimm \? answer me that \) when the wolf in mr garner s little red riding hood , for example , eats grandma \( who , poor thing , is as optically challenged as a bat \) , we are reminded that this was an entirely valid course of action for a carnivore such as himself when red arrives on the scene , she is no less tolerant grandma , what a big nose you have only relatively , of course , and certainly attractive in its own way another famous wolf , this one in the new and improved three little pigs , meets quite a different fate he huffed and puffed , and huffed and puffed , then grabbed his chest and fell over dead from a massive heart attack brought on from eating too many fatty foods food , in fact , along with organic gardening and responsible stewardship of the land , is a recurring theme in mr garner s fairy tales \( although he abhors that term s heterosexualist bias \) in jack and the beanstalk , a boy with overtaxed mental resources trades the family cow to a crafty old vegetarian who gives him three magic beans , which have as much protein as that entire cow but none of the fat or sodium jack s economically marginalized mother , naturally , is unhappy with the deal she used to think her son was merely a conceptual rather than a linear thinker , but now she was sure that he was downright differently abled yes , mr garner s is a better , more socially conscious world , one in which men are not impotent but experience an involuntary suspension from phallo centric activity , not short but differently statured take hamelin , for example it has everything a community could wish for nonpolluting industries , effective mass transit and a wellbalanced ethnoreligious diversity its only problem is an unsightly trailer park on the edge of town , populated by murderers of non domestic animals , former clients of the correctional system and offroad bikers hamelin s town leaders , who want this eyesore gone so they can revert to their openminded , progressive selves , take action they hire a pied piper kind of guy who dresses unconventionally and looks like he came from some world other than \( but certainly not unequal to \) our own he lures the trailerpark residents out of town by driving off over the horizon in a truck with a publicaddress system playing generally country music but also occasional classics like 'the ballad of the green berets' and 'ghost riders in the sky' that s not the whole story , of course the elitist town leaders get theirs in the end none of these tales , in fact , have the bourgeois , culturally flawed endings we 've come to expect though intellectually underendowed , chicken little uses her small brain to the best of her abilities and determines to sue the bastards responsible for the sky falling on her head cinderella achieves solidarity at last with her hostile stepsisters , who are differently visaged enough to stop a clock even rapunzel manages to escape her phallusshaped tower and move into a building with real stairs mr garner writes in his introduction that a 14th tale , the duckling that was judged on its personal merits and not on its physical appearance , was deleted for space reasons but it may turn up yet this collection is just a start , he says thank you , mr garner , for sharing 'rumpelstiltskin'
purchase , ny , dec 26 the surgery that charles oakley tried his best to avoid became unavoidable after playing in pain for weeks , the knicks' starting power forward will finally have surgery tuesday on a partly dislocated toe , a procedure that is expected to sideline oakley for six to eight weeks oakley could be gone even longer , depending upon his recovery and what is found during surgery his condition has been diagnosed as a congenital malformation of his right foot that led to the dislocation of his toe a more definitive timetable for oakley s recovery will be given following the operation , which will be performed by dr bill hamilton , a foot specialist who has monitored oakley s condition asked how long he expected to be out , oakley , after leaving practice here today , said we really do n't know we just hope it comes out positive and that the surgery goes well we 've got to get the bone in place , put a cast on it and put it in place for a period of time but losing oakley until at least midfebruary is another gutwrenching blow for the staggering knicks \( 1212 \) , who will carry a fivegame losing streak into tuesday night s game against the nets at byrne meadowlands arena not only is oakley the team s top rebounder and best lowpost defender , but he had played in 323 consecutive regularseason and playoff games until this month he also is a cocaptain and team leader who makes a large impact with his game , his words and his presence no one teammate can fill the void that oakley leaves , and enduring his absence collectively will be difficult for the knicks new york is 13 without oakley this season , and pat riley was uncertain how he would deal with this latest setback as a coach , you have to wait and see how the smoke clears , and how the pieces fit , said riley , in the midst of his longest losing streak since becoming the knicks' coach four seasons ago oak s presence has been there every game i 've never been a coach in new york that went to post without him so when you lose a cornerstone , a piece like that , you almost have to wait and see how things go until you start retooling we 're going to have do something doug christie , a 6foot6inch swingman who has been on the injured list this season recovering from ankle surgery , will probably be activated tuesday to take oakley s place on the 12man roster oakley has been hampered by the injury since training camp , but he decided to have surgery only after trying various custommade sneakers and sole inserts , none of which relieved the excruciating pain in the toe next to the big toe on his right foot the last measure was a special insert that oakley wore last thursday against the cleveland cavaliers oakley found that insert to be too cumbersome , and he returned to his normal sneaker sunday night during new york s 107104 overtime loss to the chicago bulls despite scoring 20 points and grabbing 6 rebounds against the bulls , oakley was obviously hampered , and he was beaten badly on several isolation plays it seemed pointless to put off surgery any longer yesterday i tried to do some things on the court and just could n't do it , said oakley now i just have to get it cut tomorrow and live with it riley was uncertain what lineup changes he would make to compensate for oakley anthony mason started the four games that oakley missed , but riley said that mason seemed more comfortable coming off the bench riley said he might try different starting lineups , depending upon how new york s size matches up against various opponents but no matter who starts , more pressure will fall on mason , charles smith , patrick ewing , anthony bonner and herb williams to improve their rebounding and defense , two areas that were oakley s forte both smith and williams will see more action at power forward smith , who is 6 feet 10 inches , was primarily a power forward until he was moved to small forward three seasons ago after being traded to the knicks yet , when asked if smith would be moved back to power forward , riley said i do n't know if he s capable of it , talking about being oaklike he s not charles oakley charles oakley s not him yes , he s going to have to be more of a board guy maybe playing him on the perimeter might be something we have to rethink but i think that s going to take a little time , because he s used to playing on the perimeter on both sides it is unlikely that the knicks will be able to make a trade for a player who would make a significant difference until oakley returns opponents know that the knicks are struggling , and they will ask for a lot if the knicks inquire about a quality player salarycap restrictions make a deal even more unlikely different guys have to step up and take up the slack , said ernie grunfeld , the knicks' general manager nobody s like charles , but that s one position where we have different players who can play that position we 'll just have to hold down the fort until charles gets back that will not be easy the knicks have fallen to sixth place in the eastern conference certainly , the knicks have enjoyed happier holidays they know what he does , and they know how important he is to this team , riley said of oakley and his teammates the fact that he is going to be gone for two months or however long it is , somebody is going to have to step up and replace some of his areas the team is down a little bit we hate losing until we get in into our minds that it s going to end , it wo n't end rebounds john starks said he would appeal his ejection from sunday night s game in chicago starks was tossed in the fourth quarter after he threw the ball , without much velocity , at pete myers of the bulls , who was getting set to inbound the ball starks said he was not trying to hurt myers , and that referee bob delaney misunderstood anthony bonner s father has died
tony oursler metro pictures 150 greene street \( at houston street \) soho through tomorrow in the strongest show of his career , tony oursler takes the concept of the talking head to places it has n't been before , while giving the tired art of assemblage a needed boost his discombobulated video sculptures combine projected or onscreen faces and sometimes figures with discarded furniture , fabric or scarecrowlike stuffed garments they eerily bring to life a cast of unhappy characters who natter and curse , pound their fists , disparage themselves or the rest of us , or wedge themselves into tight places the overall effect is of a nonetoocomforting stroll through a mental hospital , each piece representing a patient in a different state of torment in getaway no 2 , a woman harangues the viewer from beneath a mattress , telling all to keep away , while broken presents another videohead tangled up in chairs as if in the aftermath of a violent tantrum others seem to hallucinate i am a woman in a pile of money i am a can of soup being opened intones the artist s face , distorted by a drivel of secondary images and projected onto the stuffed head of a stuffed suit and anyone who ventures close to a bouquet of fake flowers will find a strange little butterfly of a face incessantly telling herself how awful she is , a combination that adds a new twist to surrealist montage mr oursler plays the almost comic nonchalance of his means against some very strong , in fact uncontrollable emotions , which he frequently antes up with striking technological effects for example , the face of the woman under the mattress , \( it belongs to the actress tracy leipold , who appears in several works \) , fills a smallish screen in such a way that it seems slightly squashed by the weight of the bedding , which adds to the work s claustrophobic intensity mr oursler is trolling the margins of territory already occupied by such artists as cindy sherman , bruce nauman and mike kelley he aims to make the psychological real , by compressing the crafts of the sculptor , puppeteer , performance artist , movie director and video wizard into small talking objects his work could be less physically awkward and more thoroughly visual maybe he needs to add a little nam june paik to the mix but the best of these pieces have a haunting sense of emotional exposure and lots of possibilities roberta smith
there is hope we must keep saying that if one of america s favorite fun couples can be united , then we can attain universal health care , cooler weather , no baseball strike anything can happen they are together again by they , i am not referring to the ultimate odd couple , michael jackson and lisa marie presley , a legal union so weird that i do not consider myself qualified to discuss it in a sports column rather , my hope for baseball emanates from the city of st petersburg , the one with the hermitage rather than the world s ugliest domed stadium when it was temporarily known as leningrad , the city once sent a signal to the world by withstanding a nazi siege of 900 days now in this historic city , calla and rocky are skating together again how fitting we look for any signs that the devious owners and the demanding baseball players can turn their swords into plowshares the millionaire owners were so contemptuous that they withheld their pledged contribution to the players' pension fund yesterday , the millionaire players showed their maturity by voting not to push up the strike deadline by a week after all , these guys are not exactly coal miners who turn over their water pails and stomp out of the mine when they 've got a grievance about safety conditions baseball is n't exactly life and death play another week , make another 50 , 000 or so , and hope the negotiators can think of something in the short time remaining , we must look for small signs of hope if i have to even think about football before labor day , or maybe thanksgiving , i shall go absolutely mad i am basing my faith on the modest miracle taking place in the city of peter the builder never has the name goodwill games been more appropriate calla urbanski and rocky marval coexisted grimly as national pairs champions in 1992 and 1993 , even qualifying for the 1992 winter games in albertville however , calla and rocky had about as much regard for each other as george steinbrenner and dave winfield , to name one embattled duo of delightful memory while calla and rocky were skating together , trying to look smooth and suave and maybe even friendly , the television networks had to be careful about turning up the microphones calla is a reallife waitress by trade and rocky has driven trucks and limousines for his family business both of them are hardworking grownups with none of the breathy , sheltered littleboy , littlegirl pseudoinnocence of pretonya american figure skating calla and rocky are real people only trouble was , they did n't get along with each other they would smile at the audience , but if you could read lips or pick up the audio , calla was saying things that were not exactly two over lightly with hash browns , and rocky was saying things that could not be construed as good buddy , i read you loud and clear , 104 , over and out when calla and rocky were practicing or performing , figure skating became a contact sport , like pat riley s knicks playing phil jackson s bulls or derek harper and jo jo english staging their short program and long before last january s kneewhacking nationals in detroit , calla and rocky broke up , each blaming the other it was just as well somebody was going to get hurt neither qualified for the winter games in norway although rocky and his partner , natasha kuchiki , were jobbed but shortly after the games , somebody made a phone call brenda and eddie got divorced at the end of the billy joel song burton and taylor ultimately split but calla and rocky decided to give it another whirl on the ice they were practicing their show returns when the goodwill games developed an opening recently some turner greenbacks made calla and rocky decide to dust off their old competition programs yesterday , they competed in the short program , but calla fell during the sidebyside double axels , and they are currently dead last we had five days to prepare , urbanski said and i guess that s what it looked like today is the long program at the goodwill games if i close my eyes , i hear the strains of romeo and juliet , i see the purple spotlight shining on the pristine ice , i see the glitter of spangles and the flash of steel skates i see blustery richard ravitch and sullen donald fehr , forcing their faces into facsimiles of smiles , gliding out together , side by side , performing a pas de deux , whose very gracefulness and cohesion tells us that all is not lost , that humanity can survive on this earth if calla and rocky can skate together , anybody can photo calla urbanski and rocky marval \( associated press \)
to the editor none of the second opinions on health care reform in your june 12 special supplement mention the pivotal doctorpatient relationship dr kerr l white , former deputy director for medical affairs of the rockefeller foundation , has shown that about half the impact of any medical procedure is the product of that relationship doctors who know their patients need much less time and paper , and fewer tests , than those who do not any restructuring of care should therefore have at its heart the preservation of that relationship america s public mental health system , where i spent most of my career \( i was clinical director of kingsboro psychiatric center in brooklyn \) , provides a negative lesson on the consequences of administrative destruction of doctorpatient relationships although good results have long been reported with continuity of care having the same psychiatrist caring for a patient in and after hospital administrative changes throughout america s revolvingdoor mental health system have fragmented care almost completely the parade of psychiatrists treating each patient , each with his or her own ideas on illness and treatment , agree nevertheless on diagnose 'em , drug 'em and dump 'em any reorganization of medical care will be an immensely greater problem unless patients are guaranteed a continuing relationship with primary physicians they know and trust , and who know them in their environment nathaniel s lehrman , md roslyn , li , june 20 , 1994
you need n't have cruised down the via veneto on a vespa in the 1960 s to know what is meant by la dolce vita it means ferrari , ferragamo and fellini , pucci and paparazzi italy during its years of postwar prosperity epitomized glamour beginning in the late 50 s , the country enjoyed what italians considered to be a miracle of economic and industrial expansion after the degradation of the fascist years but the biggest miracle was the number of talented people who came to maturity after world war ii and gave to resurging italy a culture and style that reached a peak by the mid60 s the italian metamorphosis , 19431968 , which fills the guggenheim museum , is a gigantic survey of what they accomplished in painting and sculpture , film and photography , fashion , architecture and design between the fall of mussolini and the rise of a generation opposed to italy s new opulence the subject is a great one the exhibition is good , not great it could have been better selected and more creatively organized to make relationships across the arts clearer still , it gives a sense of the range of achievements , and it includes , among more than 1 , 000 objects , classics like the sleek modernist olivetti typewriter that ettore sottsass designed in the late 60 s , and the teensy isetta automobile that ermenegildo preti created in the early 50 s , a twoseater with gills , a door through the front and bumpers about the size of your shins there are ornate and fabulously creative pieces of jewelry , some by artists whose work looks better on a small and decorative scale , where elegance counts , than on the scale of their paintings and sculptures and there are works by artists who deserve to be better known in america , among them mimmo rotella , whose collages like the tiger from the early 60 s , made of ripped posters , brought a distinctive brand of pop to italy at the same time that they playfully referred back , in their allover compositions , to action painting the story of postwar italian art is partly the story of a transatlantic dialogue with america , but not as chauvinistic americans tend to assume one in which we did all the talking and they did all the listening rotella is an example of an italian original francesco lo savio is another he was doing minimalism before the minimalists , hanging monochrome canvases and bent black metal sheets on walls as early as 1959 fausto melotti is yet another , a sculptor of delicate , twittering forms besides lo savio , melotti and rotella , far more important figures , like alberto burri , lucio fontana , piero manzoni and some members of the arte povera movement who came to prominence in the mid60 s using materials as unorthodox as ice and lettuce , prove that italian postwar painting and sculpture , at its best , was vital , experimental , original at its best at its worst , it was dreary , and the show provides evidence of this , too modernism was not altogether quashed under mussolini as it was under hitler geometric abstractions continued to be painted but after the war , it became necessary to redefine abstraction in italy , and artists like giuseppe capogrossi , afro balsadella , giulio turcato and piero dorazio helped to do so by making it something that represented liberalism , freedom and change symbolically significant though their works may be , however , they are ignored in america for a reason their paintings set this show off to a shaky start you get the sense that paintings and sculptures in the exhibition , on the whole , could have been more meticulously selected a bold artist like emilio vedova is represented by good and bad examples so is fontana luciano fabro , tano festa and jannis kounellis look entirely uninteresting a couple of themes emerge from the exhibition one has to do with the baroque germano celant , who headed the team of nine curators that put the show together , writes in the catalogue that italian postwar art was largely ignored by the rest of europe and by americans because it was too much in line with 'leftist' thought , to which the west demonstrated an absolute aversion but , he adds , its rejection may also have been caused by its sensual and 'baroque extremism' just look at fontana s coloredglass and stoneencrusted canvases or his ceramic crucifixion , not to mention salvatore ferragamo s shoes and arnaldo pomodoro s jewelry , to see what mr celant is referring to there s even a baroque quality to certain of the arte povera sculptures another theme has to do with materials italian artists and designers were exceptionally resourceful when roberto mango echoed a 1950 design by don knorr for his own 1952 chair , he nonetheless gave it a new twist by using string for the seat and back carla accardi made tubular sculptures out of rolled sicofoil decorated with yellow , orange and black stripes burri was more remarkable his abstractions at first looked very loosely like mondrians , then evolved into something closer to abstract expressionist paintings but his materials included scraps of burlap , which he sewed together , creating robert rauschenbergs before the fact he used rusted iron , as richard serra would do and he took sheets of plastic and burned and twisted them , to create a strangely elegant and visceral music that struck its most gothic note in the bloodred cobwebs and burn holes of red plastic \( 1964 \) manzoni s materials , too , were unusual his works from 195859 are whiteonwhite canvases creased in the middle , as if squeezed by corsets he used straw , rabbit skin and burned wood to concoct sculptures in the manner of meret oppenheim , in one case at least , and pictures that were readymade action paintings , with flying fur in place of flying paint eventually he canned his own feces then , of course , came arte povera figures like alighiero boetti , who froze sculptures , and michelangelo pistoletto , who bent and spraypainted burned corrugated cardboard into the shape of a rose , and mario merz , who used sacks of earth , neon tubing and even a raincoat arte povera is a movement mr celant defined in 1967 , so it s not surprising that he presents the whole postwar period as culminating in it the exhibition s painting and sculpture section takes up the guggenheim ramp , with the arte povera artists at the top everything else is in side galleries but the scale of the show is n't a problem , as you might think design , glassware , jewelry and ceramic sections could have been bigger , if anything there should have been one for textiles , too it s important that different media be brought together an artist like fontana , for example , painted and did sculptures , ceramics and jewelry too bad there is none of his work in neon here , just a photograph of a neon he did for the 1951 milan triennale \( a fontana neon would have looked better in the guggenheim s rotunda than gae aulenti s pointless installation of giant triangles does \) in postwar italy , as fontana illustrates , art connoted more than painting and sculpture it included everything from shoes to vacuum cleaners to the lighting of a room it was a way of life the

aides to mayor rudolph w giuliani have received copies of confidential background reports on several people who were recently hired by the city s top elected officials , a practice the elected officials and others criticized as improper randy m mastro , chief of staff to mayor giuliani , said yesterday that no one in the mayor s office had requested the information , which was compiled by the department of investigation , but that the department s investigators had inadvertently sent over copies of the findings they made in routine background checks mr mastro said the practice began in may and was stopped when the mayor s office learned of it earlier this week it s not something we 've ever done , we ever asked to be done , we are doing or will do , mr mastro said reports on 7 hevesi aides the mayor s office received confidential reports on the backgrounds of at least 11 aides hired in recent months by four elected officials the city comptroller , alan g hevesi , and borough presidents fernando ferrer of the bronx , howard golden of brooklyn and guy v molinari of staten island , mr mastro said mr molinari is a republican the others are democrats the comptroller s office said it had received confidential findings on at least seven aides hired by mr hevesi , under the normal background procedure , but that those seven reports were marked as having been delivered to the mayor s office as well , specifically to mr mastro we 're very concerned , said leah c johnson , a spokeswoman for the mr hevesi we believe the practice to be highly irregular ms johnson said the comptroller s lawyers believed the city charter intended that such reports be seen only by the officials who requested them there is really no reason for the mayor to receive this information , she said mayor s nearness to investigations other elected officials , including mr ferrer , also criticized the practice , which was reported yesterday in new york newsday , as an improper breach of confidentiality the criticism refocused attention on the role of the department of investigation and whether it should be more independent of the mayor although that question has been raised under previous mayors , mr giuliani attracted special scrutiny when he named howard wilson as commissioner mr wilson is a friend of the mayor who served as a prosecutor under mr giuliani when he was united states attorney in the 1980 s for that reason , the department has been criticized as not having enough independence from mr giuliani to investigate possible wrongdoing or waste in city government that could embarrass his administration the speaker of the city council , peter f vallone , said he was very disturbed by the disclosure that the mayor s office was receiving the confidential reports he said the council would hold hearings on the matter to determine whether the confidentiality of other reports was violated mr vallone and the public advocate , mark j green , reiterated their calls for legislation in the city council , or if necessary in the state legislature , that would give more independence to the department by making its commissioner an appointee of other elected officials in addition to the mayor it is critical that doi , both in fact and in perception , be an independent investigative agency beyond the reach of potential partisanship , mr vallone said the department has the power to conduct background checks on any city employee making more than 44 , 000 or those in sensitive or managerial positions those reviews can involve everything from an employee s finances to taxes , educational records and unpaid parking tickets practice began in may the department normally forwards its findings to the commissioner of the agency that does the hiring or to the mayor s office other elected officials , like mr hevesi , also have the option of having the department review new employees officials said the department of investigation began forwarding the reports in may , after an employee whose background check turned up a criminal conviction was hired by an agency anyway mr mastro said yesterday that the mayor s office ordered the department to send all reports on aides in mayoral agencies to mr mastro , since he oversees the hiring of highlevel mayoral appointees summaries , not details mr mastro , who would not identify the employee or agency involved , said the mayor wanted to make sure no one with a background problem slipped through the cracks and onto the city s payroll that s the good government thing to do , he said richard w mark , the first deputy commissioner of the investigation agency , said that after the mayor s order , the department also passed along copies of the reports intended for elected officials like mr ferrer that , he said , was a mistake no one thought part of this paper flow might involve people in the other offices , mr mark said mr mark added that the mayor s office received only letters summarizing the background checks of the aides , not the information the investigators actually gathered evidently none of the confidential reports revealed problems that prevented the hiring of any of the aides , whom officials would not identify despite the mayor s office s promise to end the practice , several officials said the disclosure could prove troubling for him by increasing political pressure for more independence in the investigations department meaning of 'confidential' mr ferrer said he was shocked when he received a report on one aide , dated june 30 , and saw that it had been marked as having also been sent to mr mastro when a letter says it is confidential , that means confidential , mr ferrer said this kind of thing compromises the independence and the integrity of the department , and it needs to take steps to repair its image mr green , who has not requested background checks on his aides by the department , called on the city council to pass legislation he introduced this spring that would make the department s commissioner a joint appointee of the mayor , the comptroller and the chairman of the conflicts of interest board under his proposal the commissioner would also serve a term of five years , making the position less tied to political changes
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina five years after the fall of the berlin wall , checkpoint charlie has moved 600 miles southeast to a bridge over the miljacka river in sarajevo , where coils of barbed wire and occasional tearful family reunions testify to the new divisions of europe here at the bridge , benjamin hamidovic , a bosnian muslim , stands guard he gazes out , past the wire and the french united nations soldiers in their blue helmets , to the far side , held and guarded by bosnian serbs it is very close , the other bank , but eerily distant another land in a severed city the division at this bridge is new but no less treacherous than the old one between coldwar ideologies mr hamidovic is one of the myriad people who have already fallen victim to the ethnic and religious conflicts that lurked beneath the clamp of communism and have since erupted , revealing the fragility of the societies and borders once behind the iron curtain as yet , the west has no coherent response to these conflicts indeed , the united states and western europe have been divided by them their failure to work together to end the bosnian war suggests that the security of europe , now lacking effective guarantees , will be uncertain for many years economic progress and political opening were supposed to follow communism in eastern europe they were the logical consequence of what the west saw as its victory over totalitarianism instead the caucasus has erupted , and yugoslavia has seen an atavistic retreat into nationalist fury that has cast the shadow of concentration camps and the serbian slaughter of bosnia s muslims across the european continent against this madness , grand wilsonian principles like the selfdetermination of peoples and grand institutions like the united nations and nato have proved no insurance all of them will probably have to be rethought after the death of 250 , 000 people and the displacement of two million in a bosnian conflict born of old grievances , economic stagnation , the cynical leadership of communiststurnednationalists and western disarray certainly , the gloom of bosnia has come not only from the fighting it has also stemmed from the way nato , the european union and the united nations have been revealed as cumbersome and divided before the ethnic conflicts of postcommunist europe in july , president clinton was celebrating cooperation between the united states and europe during the cold war no wall can forever contain the mighty power of freedom , he intoned in berlin , at the site of the wall that once divided the city but he did not mention the divided city of sarajevo , where american soldiers have been as conspicuously absent as they were decisively present in berlin , and his words rang hollow in a europe now increasingly bereft of american leadership of course sarajevo is not berlin , at least not yet a division of the world into hostile blocs does not lurk behind the city s barriers but it is far from clear that europe s new cleavages , rooted in the vagaries of tribal allegiance , are less menacing than those of the cold war already , the potential of bosnia s rival armies to be proxies for a resurgent islam and for panslavic sentiment is apparent across the miljacka river bridge , in the grbavica section of sarajevo , mr hamidovic had his house until old suspicions between bosnian serbs and muslims erupted into war in 1992 he and his serbian wife fled in june , 1992 , sending their 12yearold daughter to her grandmother in belgrade for what they imagined would be a brief sojourn they have not seen her since i 've tried to talk to her on a ham radio , but her voice sounds so terrible , mr hamidovic said , shaking his head i really feel totally crazy disintegration ethnic memories foster disunity already the three states in eastern europe without a clear ethnic identity the soviet union , czechoslovakia and yugoslavia have disintegrated since the fall of communism five years ago but fertile soil for the yugoslav disease exists elsewhere in eastern europe and the balkans long subservience to alien empires or communist rulers , economic backwardness , historical grievances and the general absence of democratic tradition have created receptive audiences for militant nationalism , which has a facile appeal in that it promises a glorious future on the basis of a supposedly glorious past there are more than 25 million ethnic russians outside russia , at least 23 million ethnic hungarians outside hungary , at least 22 million ethnic albanians in macedonia and the kosovo region of serbia , a vociferous greek minority in albania and a large turkish minority in bulgaria if serbian claims to territory could bring an intractable war to the balkans , what of an eventual explosion of russian nationalism under vladimir v zhirinovsky , or an albanian drive to unite its people in a single country or a sudden hungarian itch to recover the large swaths of territory lost to romania , yugoslavia and czechoslovakia after world war i \? unease is evident ethnic albanians vow to achieve autonomy , or even independent states , in kosovo and western macedonia greece has expelled more than 50 , 000 ethnic albanians in reprisal for the arrest of five ethnic greeks in albania the ethnic russians in the baltic states and the ukraine are a lingering source of tension
the justice department said yesterday that it was investigating the dealers who make nasdaq markets , an inquiry that intensifies the pressures on nasdaq to change in ways that could fundamentally alter the nature of the market at a minimum , the pressures seem likely to cut profit margins for the dealers at the center of the market the federal inquiry appears to be focusing on suspicion of pricefixing in what investors are charged when they buy and sell stocks on nasdaq , the network of securities dealers linked by computer and phone the department declined to give details of the inquiry by its antitrust division , which was first reported in the los angeles times , but it appears to stem from civil suits that were filed after an academic study raised the possibility of collusion among market makers the justice department s inquiry comes as the securities and exchange commission is pushing to change rules in ways that will allow investors to trade at better prices more often than they have in the past that initiative has led market makers to voice fears that their profits will be slashed , perhaps forcing independent market makers out of business richard g ketchum , the chief operating officer of nasdaq , said he was confident that the justice department would conclude that the nasdaq market is incredibly competitive and that there was no reason for antitrust charges to be brought a study by two professors , william g christie of the owen graduate school of management at vanderbilt university and paul schultz of ohio state university , showed that not only were spreads of 25 cents common on nasdaq , as had been well known in the past , but also that quotes at oddeighths were rare in other words , when a stock is quoted with a bid price \( the price at which a market maker will buy the stock \) of 50 and an asked price \( the price at which the market maker is willing to sell the stock \) of 5025 , it is unlikely to move by only 125 cents , to a spread of , say , 50125 50375 bids tend to rise or fall by 25 cents , they concluded , and to stay at even quarters of a dollar in the above example , when the price rises , it would likely be to 5050 from 5025 in an interview yesterday , mr christie said he had looked in vain for an economic rationale for the lack of oddeighth quotes , and could find none that led us to believe there was an implicit agreement among the market makers not to use those quotes , he said the study , released in may , prompted a wave of class action lawsuits against the main market makers those suits seem to have persuaded the justice department to have a look mr ketchum called the study extremely flawed because it ignored the fact that trades occurred within the spread all day long in recent years rules have been tightened to force that , and the sec is now pushing for rules to make it happen more often mr christie added that after the study was publicized , many market makers began to post oddeighth quotes still , shortly after noon yesterday , two of the largest and most liquid nasdaq stocks , intel and microsoft , had spreads of 25 cents and were quoted at even quarter dollars , with intel at 5975 bid and 60 asked , and microsoft at 5725 5750 by contrast , compaq computer , traded on the new york stock exchange , showed a bidasked spread of 125 cents , or 36375 3650 and there were narrow spreads in some nasdaq stocks , with apple computer quoted at 4175 41875 one reason for the wider nasdaq spreads is that competition in that market has often focused on areas other than the spread when a customer places an order for a nasdaq stock , the broker can either execute that order from its own inventory or send it to another market maker brokers sending orders outside often send most or all of their orders to a specified market maker , frequently in return for payments of a penny or two a share that market maker will get the order , even if its posted spreads are not the best , as long as it agrees to match the best spread in practice , that has meant that if a market maker posts a more aggressive spread , it will narrow the profits available to all but may not bring in a lot more orders to the broker initiating the price cut arthur levitt jr , the chairman of the sec , has identified changing nasdaq rules as a focus of protecting investors under pressure from mr levitt , nasdaq proposed a rule to let many small buy orders be executed at the lower bid price rather than the higher asked price , if customers put in what is called a limit order the sec has indicated that it wants to expand that rule to cover more orders , but mr ketchum called that proposal questionable , citing a risk of harming the marketplace to many nasdaq market makers , even the nasdaq proposal does that , threatening to drive many firms out of business and concentrate business at larger integrated firms they also contend that it would reduce the liquidity available in the nasdaq market mr levitt was at a conference in tokyo yesterday and not available for comment
washington , sept 7 completing a policy review of how to treat one of asia s emerging economic powers , the clinton administration announced today that it would expand official ties with taiwan , while continuing not to recognize it as a country separate from china republican and democratic lawmakers quickly attacked this splitthedifference policy adjustment as not treating taiwan with due respect , and the government of this island of 20 million said the new policy fell short of what was needed the new policy is intended to accord more respect to taiwan , in light of its important economic ties with the united states all without offending china , which insists that the united states not treat taiwan as a fullfledged nation our fundamental onechina policy will be continued , said a state department official who chose not to be identified the united states is committed to maintaining unofficial commercial , cultural and other contacts with the people of taiwan taiwan welcomed the revised policy today , but said it had not sufficiently addressed the needs arising from the close relationship of the united states and taiwan under the results of the policy review , the united states will not support taiwan s entry into the united nations or any other institution in which membership is open only to independent countries but the united states will support taiwan s entry into the general agreement on tariffs and trade , the world trade organization according to the new policy , american officials , including some senior officials , will be able to have contacts with taiwanese officials and visit taiwan something that administrations have shied away from the senior official who outlined the new policy said the top leadership of the united states would not visit taiwan , and washington would not permit visits by taiwan s top leaders last may , president lee tenghui of taiwan was not permitted to leave his airplane during a refueling stop in hawaii on his way to central america that move angered many members of congress , who later invited mr lee to visit their districts the official said president lee would now be able to leave his airplane president lee was also barred from attending alumni reunions at cornell university a senior official said that under the revised policy , it would still be inappropriate for mr lee to attend such reunions paul simon , an illinois democrat on the senate foreign relations committee , belittled the policy adjustments as small steps we continue to give taiwan the cold shoulder , he said taiwan has a multiparty system , free elections and a free press the things we profess to champion while we continue to cuddle up to the mainland government , whose dictatorship permits none of these under the revised policy , washington will continue to provide military material and training to help taiwan defend itself under the new policy the name of taiwan s official office in the united states will be changed to the taipei economic and cultural representative office in the united states at present , the office s name the coordination council for north american affairs does not even identify it as an organ of taiwan

san juan , pr , jan 10 while puerto rican officials worked today to clean up the hundreds of thousands of gallons of heavy oil leaking from a grounded barge , they were also frantically working to prevent a disaster for its tourism industry through faxes and telephone calls to tour packagers and travel agents around the united states , officials sought to dispel the notion that a large proportion of the island s beaches was despoiled by the gooey , black substance still escaping from the crippled barge , the morris j berman , as it sat on a coral reef just 300 yards from the san juan beachfront after all , officials say they do not know when the cleanup will be completed , and puerto rico s governor , pedro j rossello had called the incident a catastrophe just hours after it happened , a remark that travel industry figures privately criticized as illconsidered today , however , luis fortuno , the head of the government s tourism company , defended governor rossello s assessment as accurate at the time but said the weather and other factors since then had limited the spill s impact as they were declaring a qualified victory in their effort to let people know that only 3 out of 258 miles of beach here had been affected , even tourist industry officials were willing to be magnanimous toward the governor i'm sure it is a major disaster in his mind in terms of environmental impact , but i think it was overstated in terms of tourism , said richard abati , the manager of the sands hotel and casino on the isla verde section of san juan , which is five miles from the spill area but is unaffected the information we have is that tour packagers have had a lot of calls about the spill , and because they have information from us they are able to tell people that the impact is concentrated and limited mr abati , president of the island s hotel and tourism association , said there were only sketchy numbers on the impact of the spill on hotel occupancy first hearing on incident the details of what happened before the spill on friday are likely to be revealed tomorrow when the coast guard holds its first hearing and publicly questions the crew of the barge and its tug boat , the emily the chief investigator , capt larry doyle , a marine safety officer in the coast guard s miami office , said the inquiry would discover whether the cause of the incident was human error , equipment failure or regulatory inadequacies he said a final report was not expected for perhaps two or three months more than 37 million people visited puerto rico in 1992 , tourism officials said , and the industry accounts for about 6 percent or 25 billion of the island s 34 billion gross national product and employs 45 , 000 people , directly and indirectly the largest sector of the economy , manufacturing , accounts for 41 percent moving to other hotels tourism officials said that some reservations had been canceled at the five hotels whose beaches were most affected by the spill and that some frustrated vacationers had checked out early but they said the impact on tourism overall had been minimized because many visitors had transferred to unaffected hotels at the largest of the hotels affected by the spill , the caribe hilton , only 50 percent of the 733 rooms were occupied immediately after the incident the hotel lost 20 to 30 reservations a day and had to ferry an equal number of guests to hotels farther from the spill but by today , occupancy was up to 85 percent as oil skimmers , pumps and tank trucks continued to clean the hotel beachfront along a sheltered cove , where much of the oil had drifted with the currents and been corraled some of the hotel s rooms were occupied by workers brought in for the cleanup and investigation ice storms vs black sand fortunately the weather up north has outperformed the oil spill as a factor for us , said brian gamache , vice president for marketing for three hotels along the beach the snow , sleet and cold weather that have gripped the northeast have brought many people to the island , mr gamache said , regardless of the spill mr fortuno of the tourism office also said none of the 25 cruise ships that dock here in an average week had canceled stops in san juan in new york , steven lassman , a sales director for travel impressions , a tour packager , said he had talked to all of the travel agents who had booked january visits to the five beachfront hotels visitors were given the option of moving to other hotels , flying to other islands , or canceling i can tell you that the early returns were surprising because you would have thought that a lot would have been saying , 'i'm out of here , ' said mr lassman but the majority are staying put only about 35 percent wanted to move to other hotels , but very few are canceling or going elsewhere richard ellis , senior vice president for marketing for liberty gogo tours in new jersey , also said there had been no pullback in puerto rico bookings today , the white beach at the sands hotel was more crowded than usual , the numbers swelled significantly by those vacationers shuttled there in government vans from the affected hotels line broke twice in addition to announcing the start of hearings , captain doyle gave some details of the grounding he said the tow line connecting the barge with the tug boat broke for the first time at about 10 pm on thursday and was repaired so that the vessels could resume their trip to antigua a day and half away but it a few hours later it broke again , at another spot along its 1 , 000foot length , and this time the currents made the line difficult to retrieve it is impossible to make a permanent repair of the towing cable at sea , said captain doyle we will be looking at the captain s decision to go on after the first repair and whether it was prudent there are instances when this is done without any problems captain doyle said that he did not know where along the line the first break occurred but that the second break in the inchandahalf cable came at the point where it connected with the barge commander bob ross , the san juan marine safety officer directing the cleanup , said choppy seas had slowed the operation to empty the remaining oil from the crippled tanker on sunday , he estimated that workers had transferred 350 , 000 gallons of the 750 , 000 gallons of oil aboard the grounded berman but he revised his estimate today , saying that much of what had been pumped was a mixture of oil and sea water that had been carried into the vessel by surf he said that now he could say only that 850 , 000 gallons of the oilwater mixture had been transferred so far and could not predict exactly when the operation would be completed and the barge salvaged photo a public beach in san juan , pr , remained soaked yesterday in the oil from a barge grounded 300 yards from the beachfront \( associated press \)
the world cup quarterfinals have arrived , and the only three triple champions are still alive brazil , italy and germany have each won the trophy three times , and perhaps their presence in the final eight is testimony to some sort of sporting logic but perhaps not if logic held , then the fact that there are seven european teams among the final eight should mean european soccer is superior to any other , but any reasonable fan knows that is n't true as usual , soccer is more complicated than that because nationalistic feeling plays such an important role in this most international of sport , and especially in the crucible of nationalism , the world cup , there is a tendency to view everything through a stereotyping lens by that view , colombia lost because it lacked mental toughness sweden is still around because the swedes keep cool under pressure through that lens , the argentines are weakwilled and paranoid , the italians volatile and hotheaded , and the germans as precise and dependable as the berlintobonn train schedule of course , such stereotypes fall apart on inspection it is the germans who have seen their team riven by volatile tempers off the field , and who three times in four games lost control of teams they should have buttoned up easily the italians have been anything but hotheaded their major problem , until their lategame triumph over nigeria , has been pallid , befuddled effort , especially that of roberto baggio , who was supposed to be the tournament s inevitable star one of the tournament s most exciting games was argentina s 32 loss to romania , the argentines playing with great determination despite the selfinflicted loss of diego maradona , their team leader and one of soccer s geniuses , and the loss to injury of top scorer claudio caniggia whatever the actual mentality of colombia s soccer team , how well would any team play once the families of a coach and a starting player had received wellpublicized death threats \? and what of brazil , and the image of a flamboyant , easygoing , carefree people \? here we are brought up short again , by the brilliant way the brazilians have played , defensively as well as offensively , reminding everyone that , above all , worldclass soccer is about the skill and talent of players style is irrelevant until the team in question is good enough to win yes , there are national styles of play this is undeniable but there is no european style italy and spain play more like latin american countries than like bulgaria or sweden the germans , often seen as the epitome of a hardtackling , rugged , defensive style , have the tournament s leading active goalscorer in jurgen klinsmann \( his five goals top everyone except the nowdeparted oleg salenko of russia , who had six \) by contrast , it is the brazilians who lost a key starter because of a vicious foul when leonardo was suspended yesterday for four games for the elbow that sent american tab ramos to the hospital with a concussion at this level , too , the best players in the world are on stage and what had made them the best \? partly talent , partly what they learned growing up with a ball at their feet and partly what they have learned as professionals the highest level of club competition in the world is in the top european leagues because they pay the highest salaries , and therefore attract the best players among the eight quarterfinalists are three nations italy , spain and germany whose domestic leagues are , if not the three best in the world , then among the top five for this world cup , the italian and spanish rosters contain no players whose club teams are outside their own countries of the german squad , four play in italy and one in france , but the rest play in the german league brazil has a domestic league , a good one , but romario \( barcelona \) , bebeto \( deportivo la coruna \) and leonardo \( valencia \) play in spain , while three other regulars play in germany , three in france and the goalkeeper , claudio taffarel , in italy are they better players because they compete regularly in european leagues \? surely their skills would be the same no matter where they played professionally , but it may be that their physical and mental durability have been enhanced by competing at that level , against the sort of topcaliber players they would meet in world cup games the other four quarterfinalists have similar numbers of regular players whose club teams are in spain , italy , germany , france , portugal or england bulgaria \( six regulars \) , romania \( seven \) , sweden \( seven \) and the netherlands \( six \) , although the dutch have a top domestic league , too following this logic to its conclusion , of course , would mean that italy or spain will win the world cup that is no safe bet once again soccer , like other art forms , refuses to be pigeonholed by logic photo roberto baggio \( no 10 \) tries to dictate play for italy , one of three threetime champions in the quarterfinals \( associated press \)
washington , april 2 the russian military has repositioned forces along its northern and southern flanks as they return from central europe , raising concern among nato and united states officials who say the redeployment exceeds limits scheduled to take effect next year under a treaty reducing conventional weapons in europe the deployments , and moscow s effort to renegotiate the treaty to accommodate them , are emerging as a major irritant in the pentagon s efforts to forge closer relations with the russian military along with the ames espionage case , russia s increasingly assertive foreign policy and its mixed signals on cooperation with nato , the deployment is helping to stimulate a wide debate over whether moscow is a partner that washington can work with or a rival determined to use its military power to intimidate its neighbors negotiated in gorbachev era administration officials say russia s moves reflect its military s unhappiness with the arms control limits negotiated by the soviet foreign ministry during the gorbachev era and determination to maintain a strong presence in the volatile caucusus region in the south some western experts say the concerns cited by the russian military are legitimate , given the ethnic fighting in russia s own southern territory , recent civil wars in georgia and the fiveyear conflict between armenia and azerbaijan others argue that relaxing the limits would give russia too much flexibility in projecting power that threatens the near abroad the neighboring former soviet republics russia s moves are also a major worry for turkey and the scandinavian countries , who do not want to see an expansion of moscow s military power in their regions other western specialists argue that accommodating russia on the limit on conventional forces in europe would invite other countries to seek changes in the treaty after years of painful negotiations under the treaty , there is still time for the russians to reverse the buildup before the limit on the forces on its flanks formally takes effect in november 1995 but so far , russia s generals have insisted that instability in the caucasus makes the limit unreasonable the russian defense ministry has repeatedly proposed revisions of the treaty , which covers conventional arms from the atlantic to the urals , to give its military more leeway 'clarification' proposed when defense secretary william j perry visited moscow last month , gen mikhail kolesnikov , the head of the russian general staff , proposed a clarification of the treaty that would have the effect of raising the level of forces that could be stationed russia s southern border area , american officials said on the positive side , they profess a commitment to the integrity of the treaties and have shown flexibility offering ideas for change , said a ranking american official who insisted that he not be named on the other side of the ledger , he said , none of this is acceptable all the russians' suggestions to date still allow too much on the flank in the eyes of most nato countries at issue are the limits in the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , negotiated between nato and the former warsaw pact nations during the bush administration to slash the number of tanks , armored personnel carriers , artillery pieces and aircraft in europe to prevent russia from withdrawing weapons from the front and concentrating them along its northern and southern flanks a major worry for norway , turkey and other countries in nato s northern and southern tiers the accord sets a ceiling on the number of ground weapons that can be deployed in these regions limits on specific weapons the treaty limited russia to no more than 580 armored personnel carriers , 700 tanks and 1 , 280 artillery pieces in its active units in the leningrad military district on its northwestern frontier and the north caucasus military district on its southern flank areas a separate limit was placed on the amount of equipment that could be put in storage to address moscow s concern about instability in border regions , one important exception was included in the accord moscow can keep an unlimited number of armored personnel carriers on its flanks if they are manned by its internal security forces instead of regular army divisions the exception does not apply to tanks and artillery pieces but the russian army does not like the idea of turning over its armored personnel carriers to the interior security forces american officials say the russians are reducing their overall number of weapons as the treaty requires but washington is worried because the russian military seems determined to keep funneling forces into the caucasus region and is not making compensatory steps to stay within the overall flank limit by reducing excess forces in the north although the limit does not take effect until november 1995 , redeployment is complicated and costly , and the russians are not investing in the infrastructure that would be needed for the northern troops that would have to be pulled back debate among specialists a classified projection by american intelligence analysts estimates that the russians will have at least 2 , 000 armored personnel carriers , 400 tanks and 500 artillery pieces more than the flank limit allows if they keep to their current course the deployments and moscow s repeated attempt to modify the treaty have stirred a broad debate among specialists over the military s intentions paul goble , a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace and a former state department specialist , said the military deployments in the caucasus were intended to strengthen russia s leverage over georgia , ukraine and other former soviet republics mr goble also asserted that the moves reflected an underlying hostility within the russian military leadership toward arms control if they succeed in breaking this limit , there will be a whole bunch of other arms control agreements they will want to revisit , he said but steven m meyer , a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who studies the russian military , said russia s generals had reason to chafe under the new limit , because the collapse of the soviet union had changed moscow s perception of the military dangers it faced and had heightened instability along its southern frontier 'we would be doing the same' their concerns are reasonable , he said we would be doing the same thing if we were in their position we are not getting out of cuba yet if mexico exploded into violence , we would be putting army troops along the southern border but mr meyer said the main constraint facing the russian generals was not the treaty s requirements , but financial and other problems that have transformed the former soviet military from a force of more than 4 million troops into a russian military estimated at less than 15 million some administration officials say the russian military s objections also reflect a deep resentment of the 1990 treaty itself , which codified the decline of soviet military power , and of eduard a shevardnadze , the soviet foreign minister who oversaw the negotiation of the treaty mr shevardnadze is now president of his native georgia maps show the location of the north caucasus military

cleveland elvis davis was the first to be stung when he applied for money from ohio s victims' compensation program in 1991 , a computer check found an outstanding warrant for the 34yearold factory worker , who had been indicted 10 years earlier for breaking and entering so investigators at the attorney general s office told him to stop by for his money he did and was arrested the case of mr davis convinced the lawenforcement powers of cleveland that there is a cheap , easy way to catch fugitives lie tell them a check is waiting , and they will come so this summer , fugitives streamed into the state office building downtown , responding to letters that invited them to pick up nonexistent tax refunds each of the 622 who showed up left in plastic manacles via the freight elevator , to be booked at the cuyahoga county jail there were also other versions of the sting fugitives kept coming this sort of thing has been done before most famously in washington in 1985 , when federal and local agencies brought in 100 fugitives by promising a formal brunch and a redskins game \( the marshals who greeted them wore dinner jackets \) but most fugitive stings have not compared in scale to the yearlong cleveland operation , in which 952 people have been arrested among them were a handful wanted for kidnapping , arson and attempted murder the vast majority had been charged with lesser felonies carrying a concealed weapon , trafficking in food stamps , drug abuse none had had to worry much about getting caught , since the cuyahoga county sheriff s department had 13 , 000 outstanding warrants and only four to eight deputies on any given day assigned to tracking them down people can just check out of the criminal justice system , said deputy attorney general thomas c merriman , the supervising lawyer on the operation everybody says justice should be swift and harsh harsh we do , but swift is a joke the sting had several lives the arrest of mr davis , and five others who had warrants out against them when they applied for victims' compensation , became a pilot project the ohio attorney general s office and the cuyahoga county sheriff s department then devised a lure in the summer of 1993 , they sent letters to 3 , 000 fugitives , at the addresses on the warrants , saying they were entitled to settlements of about 1 , 400 from consumer class actions brought by the attorney general later , the same ploy brought in 102 people in columbus the next round involved 1 , 800 letters sent to fugitives whose names and addresses appeared on welfare rolls they were told that they were owed back benefits and would lose them if they did not respond finally , 3 , 300 were sent notices on the state auditor s stationery announcing errors in their favor on tax returns letters outperform deputies all were told to make appointments to pick up checks at the state office building while many letters were returned , many others found their way to their targets better than any deputy could some were forwarded by relatives and former roommates reporting to the governmentblue office suite , some people found it hard to comprehend that the government would deceive them mr merriman recalled that while one fugitive who had taken ill sat handcuffed to a wheelchair yelling , i'm not going to jail , four others calmly waited next door for their appointments sheriff gerald t mcfaul said one man began by asking , am i going to be arrested \? asked why he asked , the man replied , because my cousin got arrested here a few weeks ago another man brought his notice and a note from his girlfriend that began billy , i would think twice about calling these people when calls started to come in on the sting line , i got choked up , said john hathaway , the attorney general s investigator who scheduled appointments it s hard to lie to people mr merriman nodded and offered a few words on phone technique it s the government the less you try to explain , and the more abrupt and rude you are , the more real it seems the letters did draw some suspicions one fugitive who did not report for his phantom tax return was a probation violator \( theft , forgery , receiving stolen property \) who has moved to florida and become an accountant i do taxes every day , so it raised my eyebrows , he said in a recent telephone interview when i called , they told me i had a refund i could n't remember working in ohio during the years listed 'you think i'm stupid \? ' a few people left taunts on mr hathaway s voice mail y'all got that sting raid going on , said one woman y'all ai n't gonna get me , though bye ! a male voice announced , there s no such animal as this benefits adjustment thing still , he left his phone number , adding , you think i'm stupid \? not everyone found the operation hilarious the florida accountant said that if he had fallen for it , it would have been devastating , adding it would have ruined my life to me it seems wrong to do something like that , like falsification i 've spent seven years straightening out i started a new life , and i feel like a citizen again one of the many women arrested on welfare fraud charges said , a lot of the girls would like to come forward and say something about the way we were treated \( like the accountant she spoke on condition of anonymity , for fear of losing her job \) she said she was not notified that she had been indicted and believed she had reported her income properly
to the editor in jews had negligible role in slave trade \( letter , feb 14 \) , harold brackman denies the claim by louis farrakhan , head of the nation of islam , that mr brackman s 1977 phd dissertation proved that the talmud s compilers 'invented' racism by concocting the socalled 'ham myth' according to mr brackman , none of my conclusions correspond to this vicious libel but this is what the youthful mr brackman actually wrote the opening centuries of the christian era constituted an interregnum in the native african record of historical achievement separating cush s era of ancient prominence from the medieval accomplishments of the great negro states of the sudan these same centuries formed the seedbed of rabbinic judaism and this fateful coincidence goes far toward explaining why they also formed such fertile soil for the growth of jewish lore demeaning the negro the most famous of these antinegro legends cluster about ham and noah s cursing of canaan there is no denying that the babylonian talmud was the first source to read a negrophobic content into the episode by stressing canaan s fraternal connections with cush the talmudic glosses of the episode added the stigma of blackness to the fate of enslavement that noah predicted for ham s progeny \( the ebb and flow of conflict a history of blackjewish relations through 1900 , pages 7981 \) mr brackman cited what he called an important talmudic version of the myth ham is told by his outraged father that , because you have abused me in the darkness of the night , your children shall be born black and ugly because you have twisted your head to cause me embarrassment , they shall have kinky hair and red eyes because your lips jested at my expense , theirs shall swell and because you neglected my nakedness , they shall go naked \( page 81 \) i say nothing in defense of mr farrakhan but this episode demonstrates that his jewish establishment opponents are no better scholars than he is lenni brenner new york , feb 19 , 1994
after four decades in the american theater , harold prince certainly has n't lost the power to astonish this season alone he has generated more than his share of wonder , plying his fabled , highpowered stage wizardry to turn the 67yearold show boat into a galloping commercial success on broadway now with the petrified prince , the musical that opened last night at the joseph papp public theater , the director is causing jaws to drop anew , though more in consternation than delight this misbegotten production , with songs by michael john lachiusa and a book by edward gallardo , poses a searing question not unknown in the annals of musical comedy or , for that matter , in mr prince s own oeuvre how can so much talent , so much flashy stagecraft and so much conspicuous effort come to so very little \? the petrified prince , adapted from an unproduced screenplay by ingmar bergman , is a lumpy , sweetandsour stew that seems to have been concocted from a host of clashing intentions it is chockablock with an ingenious , everchanging set by the talented james youmans elaborate , abrasive costumes by judith dolan that suggest jeanpaul gaultier interpreting the age of napoleon visual gags galore , and a 27member ensemble that includes reliable pros like marilyn cooper and loni ackerman yet there is almost no tonal consistency in the book , the score or the direction as the show careers numbly between acrid cynicism and the stickiest sentimentality one moment it is sending up the cliches of conventional musicals the next it positively wallows in them even sally fields s sybil could n't manage the personality changes the petrified prince rings up in the course of two hours as a concept , it all must have looked quite enticing after all , a bergman screenplay was the source of one of mr prince s most elegant broadway productions , a little night music and mr lachiusa , who made a splash last season with first lady suite and hello again , was being hailed as the theater s hottest young composer set in 1807 in the sort of ruritanian kingdom that has always been a part of the american musical s whimsical geography , the show tells the story of young samson \( alexander gaberman \) , a mute , wheelchairbound prince who inherits the crown of slavonia when his father dies during rough sex with the evil queen katarina \( candy buckley \) , a wildly ambitious former prostitute the country quickly becomes a target for three greedy predators the mercenary pope pius vii \( ralph byers \) , the emperor napoleon \( alan braunstein \) and the fiery roberta \( ms ackerman \) , a displaced pretender to the throne living in a gypsy camp this allows mr gallardo and mr lachiusa to dabble in some facile , goofy political satire that is mostly sub saturday night live , mixed with the leering sexual content of a fraternity revue the pope has a mother fixation napoleon is a deluded wimp and roberta is a militant , unsmiling protofeminist who says things like , i hate the fact that i 've been victimized by circumstances what emotional resonance the play has hinges on the contest of wills over samson s soul between the powermad katarina and the virtuous elise \( daisy prince \) , an unwed mother who has sought refuge in the viennese brothel where the queen takes samson to be cured the outcome is guaranteed , as is elise s climactic diagnosis of samson s condition the petrified prince is petrified by the fear that no one loves him the idiosyncratic style mr lachiusa demonstrated in hello again , in which he rang modernist variations on an assortment of musical forms , is scarcely in evidence here the songs , though caressingly orchestrated by jonathan tunick and conducted by jason robert brown , are basic broadway pastiche , suggesting the inspirational swell of shows like godspell and pippin as well as sondheim for all seasons \( lyrics like if i cry then i 'll feel then i 'll hurt , this i know , might be rejects from anyone can whistle \) what there is , in abundance , is visually beguiling stagecraft that only serves to underscore the limitations of what is beneath it , which has certainly happened before in prince productions mr youmans has created a wonderful miniature empireera theater of a set with a painted audience of daumierlike figures looking on from boxes at the action below there is a human altar , made up of singing statues an animal barge with mechanized , disneyesque cows and sheep and two carnal punch and judylike shadow plays , performed in silhouette behind a scrim to onstage audiences the last device , with its confluence of voyeuristic sex and politics as theater , is pure harold prince so is the parade of joyless viennese prostitutes who strike spreadeagle poses in the manner of the kit kat girls in cabaret there is even a little scaffold \( shades of evita and sweeney todd \) on which the ensemble gathers in delacroixlike , historical tableaux indeed , the show is so full of prince signatures it could be a textbook for students of directorial handwriting none of this , however , camouflages the fact that nearly every emotional and comic punchline goes limp the actors , trapped between parody and earnestness , all settle for a flat middle ground of performance ms buckley , in an overblown diva role that should have guaranteed a camp cult audience , plays the queen in the prosaically nasty manner of a soapopera vixen mr gaberman is notable chiefly for his not inappropriate resemblance to the grownup title character of the broadway version of tommy and while ms prince , the director s daughter , has a lovely voice , she is never allowed to send up her kitschy julie andrews persona given that garth drabinsky , the producer of show boat , helped finance prince , there may be thoughts of giving it a life beyond the nonprofit environs of the public theater if so , it had better solve its serious identity problems the most telling parable in the musical is not about an emotionally paralyzed prince it s about a small musical with overweening ambitions that could never really decide what it wanted to be the petrified prince book by edward gallardo music and lyrics by michael john lachiusa based on a screenplay by ingmar bergman directed by harold prince musical staging by rob marshall sets by james youmans costumes by judith dolan

chicago the scene was something out of aliliston , lewiston , me , when muhammad ali knocked liston down with a phantom punch , then stood over his fallen opponent and dared him get up sonny liston never got up at least patrick ewing tried , for all the good it did him the knicks , all of them , might as well have been on their backs , the way they were playing into the middle of the third quarter here last night they came with the notion of putting a padlock on the chicago stadium doors they went about it as if they were handcuffed then came a thirdquarter moment , a challenge , a show of disrespect they can take back home with them to madison square garden for game 7 of this eastern conference semifinal war tomorrow afternoon on their way to a 9379 victory , the bulls were leading by 6348 and seemed to be coasting , almost toying with the knicks charles oakley took a pass on the right post and turned to shoot a layup from the weak side came horace grant grant rose and blocked oakley s layup the ball wound up in b j armstrong s hands , a fast break set in poetic motion since the bulls were passing the knicks dizzy all night , this had the look of a dazzling break , and that s what it was armstrong , running the left side of the floor , threw a crosscourt bullet to pete myers , filling the right lane ewing was back , bracing himself for myers , preparing himself to block the shot now here came pippen , flying down the left side myers spotted pippen and delivered the ball as if he were bouncing on a pogo stick , pippen went up ewing turned pippen dunked ewing fell backward , to the floor pippen s forward motion took him right over ewing s chest pippen told ewing an unprintable version of in your dreams forget that pippen then took his argument to the knicks' no 1 fan , spike lee , seated nearby forget that myers stepped up to have a word with ewing forget the players coming together for a couple of scary moments forget the technical pippen received , and deserved the night came down to the bulls' star , pippen , standing over the knicks' man , ewing the series comes down to the bulls , who were not supposed to last this long , laying their championship character on the table and telling the knicks to come across with their own of course home court had something to do with this of course you would expect the officials to make reparations to the bulls , after the last call on pippen in game 5 fifteen of the first 16 free throws awarded last night went to the bulls , but it was much more than that it was the bulls' body language , supporting phil jackson s claim that his team is sure it can beat the knicks it was the knicks' air of resignation and their state of disarray they were down by 15 in the first quarter , and they were an emotional mess anthony mason could be seen yelling at john starks oakley could be seen kicking the bench and throwing towels derek harper could be seen losing his cool , starks committing a flagrant foul on myers and deliberately tripping pippen in the backcourt pat riley , who says he accepts all officiating , good or bad , could be seen screaming at mike mathis and his crew on call after call none of it was very pretty , or very encouraging the only time the knicks showed any life was after pippen gave it to ewing ewing scored 8 points in a row and brought the knicks within 6658 for a few minutes , pippen s timing was again in question he picked the wrong time to sit down in game 3 he chose the worst moment to try to block a shot in game 5 there was the growing feeling that his arrogance might cost the bulls even more it was just a scare , one of those little runs that amount to nothing the bulls kept moving the ball the knicks continued with their wooden approach to offense , and it was in no way connected to the famous ucla coach the knicks proved , again , that they do n't have playoff road character they could n't shut the stadium down the bulls may not defend their title , but at least they defended their home it s a special place , even though it s kind of ugly in the bowels , john paxson had said before the bulls took the court down in those corridors which have the feel of a subway tunnel , down where the mice occasionally run loose , they gathered at the foot of the steep and narrow stairway they waited for pippen and grant , who were still in the trainer s room scottie , let s go , someone yelled when pippen and grant finally appeared , they formed a circle and their hands came together pippen spoke first defense , he said , quietly we 're going back to new york , armstrong said scott williams asked , what time is it \? they all yelled , winning time then there was this primal grunt and the bulls climbed the stairs , ducking their heads as they stepped into the condemned arena that is spectacularly awash in red the bulls made their statement pippen issued his challenge to ewing , to the knicks , for game 7 for another day and a half , at least , west madison street lives and broadway shudders
vladivostok , russia , may 29 in one of his early short stories , matryona s home , aleksandr i solzhenitsyn wrote a hauntingly prophetic passage about a prisoner coming home from the labor camps in the summer of 1953 i was coming back from the hot and dusty desert , just following my nose so long as it led me back to european russia nobody waited or wanted me at any particular place , because i was a little matter of 10 years overdue i just wanted to efface myself , to lose myself in deepest russia if it was there vermont is no hot and dusty desert , and the 10 years turned to 20 but mr solzhenitsyn will in a sense be following his nose back to european russia when he soon begins a journey across siberia to moscow the question is whether there is a russia that waits or wants him , and whether his deepest russia is still there mr solzhenitsyn has left no doubt of his ardent longing to devote his authority and his final years to helping his beloved motherland recover from the plague of communism but on saturday , in the first formal news conference he ever held in his homeland , he was far stronger on criticism than on constructive ideas in fact , he had nary a good word to say of anything walking through the saturday market in the main square here , he noted not the abundance but the prices , which he said made his eyes pop out of my head the adoption of foreign words into russian reflected an illness of our soul yegor t gaidar s reforms were brainless mikhail s gorbachev s perestroika was hypocrisy russia s politics were a false democracy the new countries around russia were artificial and were oppressing russians political parties were a hoax common complaints most russians would probably agree with much of that but it no longer takes a dissident to criticize mr gaidar or to bemoan prices , and these are complaints heard constantly in the streets what mr solzhenitsyn offered on the positive side were some vague ideas on democracy a strong central government and strong local governments , honorable candidates and proposing a selfcritical , nonaggressive patriotism as russia s unifying idea true , the writer is only at the start of his odyssey across russia , and he said he was prepared to revise his views as he renewed his acquaintance with his country and there were intellectuals who agreed that mr solzhenitsyn s form of honest patriotism could provide the cohesive ideology that russia so painfully lacks after the collapse of communism but if it does , there is still the question whether mr solzhenitsyn is the man who could foster it his reputation and his moral authority are beyond dispute even russians who have not read his works know of him as the man who exposed the network of stalinist labor camps in all their murderous brutality and cynicism but the impact of those works derived in great part from the tyranny they defied the power wanes mr solzhenitsyn wrote in his novel the first circle that a writer is like a second government in a dictatorship but as the piles of his unsold novels testify , the political and moral power of written or spoken truth wanes under freedom many of the first generation of russian democrats have dropped out of politics , and former dissidents who have stayed in parliament , like sergei kovalyov and the rev gleb yakunin , are now viewed more as gadflies than as moral authorities even andrei d sakharov s enormous authority began to erode before his death as his colleagues soured on his moral absolutism after the first heady taste of freedom , russians found that goodness can be less useful in politics than managerial skills and pragmatism as for whether deepest russia is still there , for the most part the russian hinterland remains much as mr solzhenitsyn left it muddy , backward , provincial , poor but russia has changed , and changed dramatically he left a state in which a tyrannical system ordered everything , and in which every life was caught in constant compromises and small lies but the tyranny also showed human traits conscience , courage , weakness , cynicism in far sharper relief , much as war exposes strength and cowardice every russian was confronted with endless choices between integrity and compromise , and there were none who escaped unscathed most people simply struggled to maintain a modicum of personal integrity in the face of the state s insatiable demand for fealty it was a harsh and cruel world , but also one in which whispered truths and smuggled books carried weight greater than money or status , in which people of conscience forged powerful bonds and defiance was a mark of greatness spirit sustained in vermont mr solzhenitsyn was formed in that world , and his seclusion in vermont often seemed like an attempt to sustain its spirit for the time when he returned he wore the same simple clothes , maintained the same spartan routine , the same secretiveness , and searched for the same truths but the country he came back to no longer lives in that spirit , or even admires it it may be unfortunate , but to romanticize that past is to overlook that it came at the cost of freedom it was disappointing to many of mr solzhenitsyn s admirers that at his news conference he had nothing to say of the fact that for all their flawed economic policies and false starts at democracy , mr gorbachev and boris n yeltsin did lift the fetters , that russia has become more free it may not be as morally attractive as the quiet suffering of the oppressed , and to mr solzhenitsyn s obvious dismay the new freedoms have brought suffering , vulgar wealth , glaring social injustice and an invasion of the western mores and pop culture against which the writer so sternly inveighed in vermont but mr solzhenitsyn is unlikely to find that many russians would trade their current hardships for the past tyranny he argues that the ugliness could have been avoided , that russia should have passed through an interim phase of authoritarian cold turkey that may be , but then many believe that mr gorbachev s mistake was precisely that he thought he could reform the system slowly when the wall cracked , the floodwaters could not be controlled old debate irrelevant in any case , it is a debate most russians have moved past what might or should have been is simply not relevant to their difficult lives the issue is not how russia got here , but how it moves on that , declares mr solzhenitsyn , makes this the exactly right moment for his return the scum of triviality has cleared , and the people have ripened enough to become conscious of their fate in its essence and depth , he declared i think it is precisely now that i am useful , not three years ago when two powers clashed like two goats on a bridge until one fell off on the first point he may be right the flings with instant democracy and instant capitalism , the universal rush to be baptized in the russian orthodox church and to acquire western goodies , have left people still feeling empty the question is whether after so long an absence , this truthseeker from a former tyranny is the man to fill that emptiness mr solzhenitsyn s form of benign patriotism is not the worst basis for unifying the nation but it will require him to recognize that his deepest russia is no longer there
the drought of leading men lincoln center theater has dropped tonight at 8 30 , a twonight cycle of seven noel coward oneact plays , from its broadway plans this year and why \? because new york is n't a big enough town to produce the right leading man at least , not one who is n't committed to a bigger town called hollywood a handsome leading man over 40 that s the toughest assignment in the theater , said andre bishop , the theater s artistic director we already had blythe danner , nancy marchand and simon jones but this needed someone in his mid40 s or older , attractive , who sings well , who dances , who can do english for real not a phonybaloney accent who can partner an actress as wonderful as blythe danner , and has a certain um cowardian insouciance whom did they talk to \?

the aggressive investment practices that drove orange county , calif , into bankruptcy have also been used by at least six other county governments in california , according to a leading wall street creditrating agency the agency , moody s investors service inc , reported late thursday evening that the six counties monterey , placer , san bernardino , san diego , solano and sonoma had engaged in significantly more aggressive investment strategies than other california counties it surveyed the strategies included investing with borrowed money , a practice called using leverage , and investing in the complex interestsensitive securities known as derivatives but moody s emphasized that none of the six counties seemed in any danger of following orange county into bankruptcy their use of these risky strategies was less extreme , and the local governments that invested in the funds were less likely to make sudden withdrawals as the moody s report was made public , the madera county , calif , office of education warned yesterday that it might default on its public debts if the bankruptcy judge handling the orange county case did not allow it to withdraw money it deposited in the illfated fund its request is still pending alarm about orange county prompted moody s to survey all the pooled investment funds in california , and to screen a broad sample of about 1 , 400 such funds across the country of the 57 such funds in california , it said that 37 reported no use of leverage or derivatives moody s national survey uncovered problems at only two government units , besides those whose losses had already been disclosed those two were cuyahoga county , ohio , and walworth county , wis according to the moody s survey of california , a total of 14 counties reported using leverage or derivatives to some degree but the six were singled out for detailed discussion , the agency said , because they reported a significantly more aggressive use of either leverage or derivatives , or both according to the rating agency , the managers of each of these pools report that they have developed or are beginning to develop strategies to address the risks posed by the nature of their pools moody s added , however , that it intended to talk or meet further with each pool manager to verify information which they have provided to us in order to better assess their strategies for example , the placer county treasurer , jenine windeshausen , said her fund , with a book value of 378 million , had approximately 42 percent of its assets invested in derivatives , with half to threequarters of them becoming less valuable as interest rates rose but ms windeshausen , who said her fund had a high level of liquidity , confirmed that moody s analysts would be meeting with her early in the year tom ford , assistant tax collector for sonoma county , disputed some of moody s findings he said the agency had understated the value of the fund , which he put at 735 million , not 565 million they agree , however , that derivatives represent about 322 million of the fund but we 're about equally exposed to upward or downward movements in rates , mr ford said he confirmed that since november the fund had faced two margin calls totaling 16 million , but he insisted that he had ample cash to cover anticipated demands while moody s said it would continue to monitor the fund , mr ford said the agency should either make a decision or move on they 've just been putting us through hoops , he added monterey county faces paper losses of about 16 million on its 338 million portfolio it has also borrowed about 237 million , secured by its securities but louis solton , the county treasurer and tax collector , said yesterday that the fund had sufficient cash to meet all its anticipated needs moody s found that solano county s 427 million fund had borrowed about 182 million through reverse repurchase agreements , making significant use of derivatives there was no answer at the county offices at the county seat of fairfield , calif , yesterday before the moody s report , it had been widely known that san bernardino county and san diego county had made substantial use of derivatives moody s did not raise any new alarms with respect to these funds , but said it would monitor the funds closely all six counties face less risk because most of their money comes from captive investors , local government units that are required to use the fund and cannot pull their money thus , unlike orange county , they need not sell at a loss orange county , with enormous paper losses in its investment portfolio , was unable to raise cash to meet investor demands it was forced to file for bankruptcy on dec 6 , sending shock waves through the taxexempt securities market
if ever there was a reason to become computer literate , it is to savor every byte of sony s complete multimedia edition of the haldeman diaries , the late chief of staff s daily chronicle of the nixon administration by loading a 6995 compact disk into the cdrom drive of the nearest pc , you can not only wallow in watergate but relive in audiovideo splendor such forgotten , golden white house moments as the pam agnew wedding , a gala east room recital by red skelton and a dinner for golda meir to which the president invited a few gentiles , like connally the haldeman diaries have become notorious in the two weeks since their publication as a nearly 700page book , especially those passages in which the president rails against the total jewish domination of the media and a neurotic henry kissinger makes dr strangelove seem tame but except for billy graham who protested that some of his best friends are jewish in a statement denying an entry in which he refers to satanic jews no one has seriously challenged mr haldeman s accuracy stephen ambrose the nonpartisan eisenhower and nixon biographer and dday historian soundly endorses the haldeman diaries in its introduction yet the book , hefty as it may be , cannot tell the whole story the cdrom version adds 700 photos , home movies , the white house appointments log and , most important , 1 , 000 more pages of diaries all summoned onto the screen and crossreferenced by the click of a mouse zipping through the multimedia edition is an addictive , if headacheinducing , joy ride that simulates what it might be like to listen to the watergate tapes , read the final days and play nintendo all at the same time you can even hear a funereal rendition of hail to the chief while the program boots up , or watch the president cut a rug in the entry titled nixon dancing what often emerges from the encyclopedic data is a period farce sort of a springtime for nixon with an unlikely cast of cameo players , from gina lollobrigida to andre malraux the president , desperate to invite frank sinatra to the white house , chooses perry como instead rather than get embroiled in a dispute between the chairman of the board and mrs bob hope after a state dinner for pierre trudeau falls flat , mr nixon is particularly down on the entertainment \( robert goulet \) sam goldwyn turns up in one film clip , as do elvis in the appointments log and the fifth dimension in a photo other images suitable for printing out and framing include an inscribed bebe rebozo recipe for grand marnier souffle , a loving portrait of a white house burn bag and a shot of ethel waters the day she reprimanded antinixon demonstrators none of this material is in the published diaries nor is a 1972 entry in which mr haldeman says the president told him that kissinger has worked hard , and i'm to call rebozo and have him give henry all of his phone numbers of girls that are not over 30 but by using a computer program s search function you can leap to every occurrence of the word jewish , for instance the dark side of this white house charges out of hyperspace mr nixon s defenders have tried to rationalize his paranoia about jewish cabals by arguing that he was letting off political , not antisemitic , steam at a time when there were in fact many jews among his press adversaries but in the unexpurgated diaries mr nixon is cited as identifying our enemies as youth , black , jew in 1970 and it s hard to find a political alibi in this 1971 cdrom exclusive the president came back from camp david for white house church he called me a little disturbed at discovering that we were having a rabbi again he made the point that there are only 5 million jews out of 200 million people , so one rabbi service in the first term would have been enough we should n't have had a second one , and he certainly does n't want any more this term by the time a hacker overdoses on the multimedia diaries , the only real mystery that remains about the white house is mr haldeman himself , a fly on the wall so devoid of personality and emotion that he could be the butler who faithfully serves his disgraced lord in the remains of the day alas , the voiceover narration in the multimedia haldeman diaries is not spoken by anthony hopkins but by the less mellifluous , if rehabilitated , watergate criminal dwight chapin
the protean self human resilience in an age of fragmentation by robert jay lifton 262 pp new york basic books 25 in greek mythology proteus is the seer whose apparent identity is so unstable that no one knows who he is first he poses as an old man , then a tall green tree , then a blinding fire he is constantly changing form this capacity for shapeshifting suits proteus , for he is a reluctant wizard who wants to evade his clients because proteus has the power to radically transmogrify his identity , no one can pin him down long enough to make him reveal the truth robert jay lifton is not a reluctant seer he is a psychiatrist who is eager to reveal the truth that consistency is not a virtue in the protean self , dr lifton constructs a postmodern character type , a shapeshifter capable of assuming multiple identities without pathological fragmentation first a hippie , then a member of students for a democratic society , then a jew for jesus , then a business executive the upbeat message of dr lifton s book is that a protean self is a source of strength and value and ought to be accepted as a new psychological ideal a person with a protean self is a willful eclectic who draws strength from the variety and disorderliness of historical change and upheaval his or her integrity is defined by an ability to stay on the move between partial , incomplete and irreconcilable realities according to dr lifton , life is not a straight line instead , it is , and ought to be , experienced as a collage the protean self is not alone in the contemporary world it has , as an alter ego , the fundamentalist self , which is the second character type constructed by dr lifton the fundamentalist self is a consistency freak who avoids psychological fragmentation by defending the world against evil , embracing a totalizing world view and looking forward to the end of time unlike the protean self , the fundamentalist self responds to the mix and complexity of existence with a sense of gnostic revulsion so profound that even a nuclear war seems welcome the idea of apocalyptic conflagration is endowed with a divine purpose bringing the world to an end is a way to clean the messy slate both character types , protean and fundamentalist , have their many voices in dr lifton s book among the proteans there is francine c , an agnostic who hangs around with buddhist monks from sri lanka , and arthur m , the abused child from a strange jewish family \( they did n't read books ! \) who becomes a human rights advocate and there are lucy g and george r and carol c , as well as vaclav havel and salman rushdie then there are many allusions to protean personalities from the writings of james joyce , don delillo , saul bellow , erica jong and others among the fundamentalists there is nigel t , who discusses his conversion experience while being interviewed in his private club , and ian x , a church organist who has centered his life on the return of jesus and thinks that nuclear holocaust will somehow play an important role in millennial events unlike proteus , dr lifton does not evade his clients for several decades he has interviewed people involved in social movements in the united states many people have talked to him , in various disaster areas and political hot spots of the world like china and eastern europe their disjointed and tangled life stories , pasted together by the author yet narrated with a ring of authenticity , are the core of his book in the protean self dr lifton is an enthusiastic and wideeyed author who marvels at the idea that inconsistency is a source of resiliency in human beings undoubtedly some readers will perceive a deep irony in his advocacy of proteanism as a psychological ideal , because dr lifton himself does not appear to be a shapeshifter over the years , in volumes like the nazi doctors and death in life survivors of hiroshima , he has been a rather unwavering voice speaking out against the wraiths and shadows of modernism that darken the 20th century his own career trajectory looks integrated , almost linear some chapters from his life story are narrated in the book indeed , his voice almost comes to seem juxtaposed with the voices of carol c , george r and the rest other parts of his curriculum vitae are well known there is not much that is protean , contradictory or elusive about the identity of a nomadic , secularized , jewish male of eastern european background who becomes a distinguished member of the intellectual circle that once surrounded erik erikson \( the near legendary and very seerlike ego psychologist , psychoanalyst and humanist \) and then searches for transcendental values in new york city while directing the center on violence and human survival at john jay college why is this rather undivided author in awe of discontinuous change \? why is he eager to view the power to alter the self in a glorious light \? to answer that , one must understand something of postmodern discourse , because when dr lifton looks into his heart of hearts at his own rather fundamental identity , what he sees is an affirmative postmodern soul
if our wonderful baseball owners can get over their gripping obsession with the salary cap , baseball fans may have to give thanks to a strange new ally football my theory is that king football and particularly a new american sporting hero named jeffrey lurie had a great deal to do with the wonderful owners scurrying to new york yesterday we know the wonderful owners do n't like to spend their own money , but there they were , splurging on fullfare , spurofthemoment airline tickets , to deal with this ruinous strike , now nearly a month old about time , would n't you say \? it is quite likely that football pushed the owners in two different ways first , a few diehard loonies like me may have missed baseball over the labor day weekend , but from what i gather , millions of others were quite occupied with football this may have sent a shiver of mortality into the baseball owners , not otherwise known for their perceptiveness the owners could see an entire september and october of north americans settling into their dens and bars and watching brutes whacking into brutes they are already spooked by football they 've got players trying to see a fastball in lateafternoon angled sunlight , and postseason games starting at children s bedtimes , and they wo n't play baseball at all on monday nights in october because of football then there is the specter of the o j simpson trial , coming soon to a television set near you this ugly melodrama is not a sports story or a football story , but it is surely a television extravaganza that could keep people from clicking the dial the baseball owners saw the need to get back to work before their sport was totally irrelevant but football may have contributed to the potential end of the baseball strike in another powerful way football exposed the salary cap as the last refuge of weasels up to now , the salary cap has gotten pretty good press because it helped the national basketball association get its house in order but the nba of a decade ago is not the national football league of today in this brave new world , the proud owner of the new york giants , wellington mara , was not able to make a large and loyal offer to his old quarterback , phil simms , because the giants were backed right up against that demon of a salary cap mara was sad and simms was enraged at the new order \( that george young , who made the decision not to pay simms , may have been right in his football judgment is a different story mara would have paid simms handsomely to be a tutor in uniform \) but the worstcase scenario of the salary cap happened in philadelphia a football fanatic named jeffrey lurie recently called in some family money to purchase the eagles for a reported sum of 185 million , the highest ever paid for a professional sports franchise the fee was even higher than the 173 million paid last august for the baltimore orioles , a team currently not operating because of the ghastly economics of baseball , if you can follow that reasoning this lurie began having pangs about all the money he had shelled out or maybe he just ca n't help himself from putting the squeeze on people he began circulating among his new players , forcing at least three eagles to take salary cuts or else risk being dropped from the team lurie s reason \? that wicked old salary cap the eagles promptly went out and lost their first game maybe they 'll lose all 16 it would serve lurie right the sight of an owner personally trying to knock back salaries in the week before the season opened is a new low among the moneyed set sure , charles o finley tried to fire an oakland second baseman during the world series , and sure , george steinbrenner lambasted a yankee thirdbase coach and various pitchers during postseason games , but the salary cap has introduced a new ownership excuse the devil made me do it , as flip wilson used to say a few of the brighter baseball owners just might have observed this lurie in action , ruining his team s morale , destroying his image , in the name of the great idol of a salary cap i am also guessing that the baseball players watched lurie perform , and that was enough to stiffen their resistance to the salary cap why give the baseball owners a chance to be like that guy \? none of this guarantees that the owners and the players will be able to save the season both sides were bumbling around yesterday , doing homework they could have done a year ago , if you ask me but if they manage to hold onto the world series this year , they should thank football for scaring them into action football wo n't ask much in return just stay out of its way that s enough
for anyone who lived through the 1960 s , photographs of the civil rights struggle will always stir up deep feelings that struggle disrupted and changed the nation those pictures helped sway the public s mind a reality that northern whites had acknowledged but seldom felt suddenly leaped to life on the front pages of the papers in the midst of postwar prosperity and a continuing sense of national triumph , events and images presented examples of immense courage as well as ample reason to be ashamed of america week after week the news amounted to a call to action many responded a quarter of a million people marched on washington in august of 1963 to hear martin luther king jr say i have a dream real changes were made , some of them radical , but race issues are still tearing this country apart and images of the 60 s continue to resound appeal to this age photography of the civil rights movement , 19541968 , organized by steven kasher for the howard greenberg gallery in soho , brings a lot of that conflict flooding back \( the show will be on view through july 30 , with a travel schedule still in flux \) some of these 76 photographs charles moore s images of blacks pounded by fire hoses , for instance , or james karales s picture of marchers making their way from selma to montgomery , ala , beneath a baroque sky have achieved the status of classics without losing any of their emotional clout some that are not as frequently reprinted , like fred ward s picture of gloria richardson confronting guardsmen and a bayonet , still have the edgy immediacy of so much of the closein reporting of that era others are as simple and to the point as declan haun s photograph of a young woman holding a sign that says justice a number are carefully composed gordon parks s picture of the black muslim women s corps was posed for life , nat herz s overview of the march on washington turns the crowd into an overwhelming formal pattern , and ernest withers s photograph of striking memphis sanitation workers forges a hypnotic rhythm from endless signs saying i am a man but works like dan weiner s white rider alone on a bus during the 1956 bus boycott in montgomery , ala , would not be so much without captions to explain them , and a few images are unimpressive even with their captions yet the subject , the events , sweep all before them news photographs propose their own standards of quality even if these were not good pictures , they would still be immensely meaningful they were not the only witness to this history television came into its own during the 60 s and proved its power to focus public attention and shape opinion david j garrow , a historian of the civil rights movement , has written that during the 1965 protests in selma , congress referred frequently to pictures , especially newspaper photographs , but that after bloody sunday , when police swinging billy clubs waded into peacefully marching crowds , more legislators referred to television coverage than ever had before probably the best cumulative record of the movement ever made is the 1987 pbs television series eyes on the prize , which used both film and still photographs but as the novelist milan kundera reminds us , memory does not make films it makes photographs moving images write potent messages on the mind , but recollection preserves only an urgent word , a telling frame here and there still images compress what they have to say into a space that slots easily into memory appeal to this age makes a point of including work by black photojournalists , and emphasizes that the student nonviolent coordinating committee \( sncc \) maintained its own cadre of movement photographers and worked to distribute its pictures within the movement as well as to the mainstream press \( which was almost entirely under white control \) the show makes no attempt to trace this distribution or to differentiate sncc s point of view from other photographers' the movement was instrumental in shattering the myth of objectivity that had grown up around photojournalism reporters with cameras prided themselves on being neutral and uninvolved , on telling it like it was it may be that the only truly neutral camera is one nailed to a post and programmed to snap a picture at regular intervals human beings , even with cameras in their hands , have sympathies and biases and fears for a long while , reporters and photographers preferred to believe otherwise but they gave up that pretense in the south , at least in the early 60 s there is no mistaking charles moore s outrage at seeing a black man with his trousers torn by one police dog and menaced by another s bared fangs , or the fierce criticism in moore s image of a mississippi police officer laughingly demonstrating his billyclub swing to a group of cronies who get the joke the press was drawn into the cause by its evident rightness as the writer renata adler put it in 1966 , reporters have become , despite their neutrality as observers , an integral part of the movement as they cover one of the last of the just wars

just last week , todd martin , seeded ninth at the united states open , admitted that a stubborn injury was threatening his selfesteem by making him too sore to display the pride and joy of his game his dogged accuracy whether under pressure or safely ahead on cruise control without those reliable strokes , said martin , he could n't be proud of himself or his game yesterday , martin s pride , and his place in the open s draw , were again threatened by the groin strain that has made normal playmaking painful , normal marksmanship unreliable , and forced him into the uncomfortable , preventive measure of wearing a pair of insulated rubber shorts before he knew it , martin was down two sets to none against a 91stranked frenchman , guillaume raoux , out on the grandstand court , a spot where the lingering shadows make for the sort of chill that causes sore , stiff muscles to tighten up rather than loosen up but martin , despite the gravity of his plight , did n't give up saving 3 match points in a 3hour20minute torture session in which he not only had to fight his way into a fifth set but needed to save 3 match points against his serve upon getting there , martin prevailed by playing flawless tennis in the decisive tie breaker his 67 \( 47 \) , 46 , 63 , 64 , 76 \( 71 \) victory marked just the second occasion in his career that he has negotiated a safe return from the precipice of a twoset deficit martin s groin strain was n't the only injury to intrude into the workings of a match it was medic alert day at the open yesterday , where only 13thseeded lori mcneil suffered the indignity of being upset by an upstart , anna smashnova but the contenders seemed to have aches and pains and everything but a note from their doctor in their back pocket steffi graf , michael stich , stefan edberg , jim courier , lindsay davenport and gabriela sabatini were among the host of seeded players who advanced without incident , if not without complaint , and 15thseeded marc rosset forged a martinesque comeback from two sets down against mark woodforde for a 46 , 16 , 63 , 76 \( 75 \) , 63 victory martin , a 24yearold late bloomer among the american bumper crop that includes courier , pete sampras , andre agassi and michael chang , put himself in arrears by playing a disastrous firstset tie breaker ahead , 40 , and apparently in full control , martin suffered an uncharacteristic breakdown of concentration and squandered 7 straight points to lose the set further inaccuracy from martin , who made 63 unforced errors in all , produced the errant backhand that granted the smoothserving raoux a set point in the second set that he converted with a service winner then it became fun but martin was unwilling to exit in the first round here for the first time since his 1990 debut , and he worked his way back into contention in the third and fourth sets it was an awful lot of fun after the first two sets for me to be out there , said martin it was just nice to finish the job i started i think it s just natural to have too much pride to give up matters were dead even in the final set until martin served himself into trouble in the 10th game a buoyant backhand pass ruined raoux s first match point , and a netted crosscourt backhand from the frenchman eliminated the second raoux thought he 'd caught an advancing and desperate martin out of position on the third match point only to slam his surething forehand pass just wide once he got in front , 40 , in the deciding tie breaker , martin took care to guard his lead raoux earned just a single point , with a service winner , and he never bothered to chase the forehand return that martin ripped back at him to end the match oddly enough , martin was forced to make precisely this brand of improbable recovery here last year in the open s first round with a 57 , 46 , 61 , 63 , 62 comeback victory against yet another of the circuit s hungry underdogs , jordi burillo mcneil is upset the one seeded player who could n't turn back the challenge of an underdog was mcneil the 30yearold , who has been bothered by tendinitis in her right knee all summer , could n't find her timing or the quickest path to the net and was ousted , 62 , 64 , by smashnova , israel s 18yearold baseline sensation the defending champion , steffi graf , discoursed on the state of her debilitated back , an infirmity that disappeared miraculously as she blitzed through her firstround match but begged for its daily chiropractic realignment as soon as she left the stadium court five double faults were the only glitch in the graf arsenal during her 62 , 61 dismissal of 19yearold anne mall , a 139thranked californian who had never before appeared in a grand slam graf said she was treating the residual irritation from last year s stress fracture in her lower back with all kinds of treatments to just keep the inflammation down , and it s been working well the german agreed that , injury or not , she is the favorite to repeat as champion the fact that she has been unable to retain her 1993 french open and wimbledon titles has left her exceedingly protective of this one conditions good for edberg
washington , may 18 eight years after it voted to drastically tighten the purity standards for tap water , the senate decided today that it had overreached and voted 95 to 3 to loosen them again whether the senate s changes , made to the safe drinking water act , would actually increase the existing tiny risks of drinking tap water was in some dispute environmental groups called the vote a victory for the pesticide lobby and for financially strapped water companies and said the bill would let water utilities leave more cancercausing compounds in their water the senators , in turn , argued that the current law was so draconian that no one had been able to meet all its dictates anyway , including the environmental protection agency , which has the responsibility to enforce the law awkward moment in 1986 , congress passed amendments to the safe drinking water act which overdid it , went too far , said the chief sponsor of the latest amendments , senator max baucus , democrat of montana we are trying to make the system work better than it would work under the 1986 amendments it was an awkward moment for the clinton administration , which came to power with the environmental movement s backing but endorsed the senate legislation anyway the house was expected to take up its version of the water law later this summer , and administration officials expressed hope that it would produce a tougher measure environmental groups would prefer the core of the current law it requires the epa to establish levels at which 83 specific pollutants pose absolutely no risk to human health , and to set safe levels for another 25 pollutants every three years the law then requires utilities to reduce pollutant levels in tap water to as close to the norisk levels as possible , using the best technology they could find norisk levels the problem , the senate concluded , is that many of the country s 200 , 000 water systems cannot afford such technology all but 12 , 000 of those systems serve fewer than 10 , 000 customers moreover , the environmental agency has not met deadlines for setting the norisk levels on many pollutants and some others have not been addressed at all , including the protozoan cryptosporidium , which sickened 400 , 000 milwaukee residents last year , killed at least 40 more and contributed to illnesses that milwaukee officials say have killed scores more and none of that includes what many experts believe is the single greatest health threat in water supplies contaminants , some of them cancercausing , that are left behind by the very chemicals that utilities use to make their water potable the senate s tapwater bill addresses all those issues , but not always in ways that all sides like the chief water regulator for the environmental protection agency , assistant administrator bob perciasepe , said it included about 70 percent of the major changes that the administration was seeking among scores of changes , the bill includes a 66 billion revolving loan fund 600 million of it in 1994 to help utilities buy the equipment needed to meet federal purity standards the epa says the total cost is about 85 billion utilities say it is far greater new market the bill also allows small water systems to obtain waivers to allow them to filter pollutants with less costly and slightly less effective machinery than the stateoftheart equipment the law now requires officials expect that to spur innovation by creating a brandnew market for small treatment plants the proposal also sets a federal standard for levels of cryptosporidium in water systems and it changes the existing requirement that cancercausing pollutants be reduced to the norisk level , saying instead that if a utility can save money on water treatment without significantly raising the cancer risk , it can seek a waiver to do so finally , it orders states to take steps to remove a cancercausing gas called radon from water systems radon is the secondleading cause of lung cancer , after smoking utilities like all those changes environmentalists are especially upset over the change in the norisk standard we say significant' is a dangerously vague standard , said carolyn hartmann , an attorney with the us public interest research group , a ralph nader organization if it s your kid that gets that one extra case of cancer , it s not necessarily protecting the public 'a billkiller' many groups also criticized an amendment added on wednesday evening by senator bob dole of kansas , the minority leader , that would require every government agency to conduct a separate analysis of any proposal that could either confiscate private property or affect its value it could end up being a billkiller , said erik olson , a lawyer with the natural resources defense council , an national environmental group , who called it an attempt to shackle federal agencies that issue regulations how much difference all this makes to a water system that is already the world s cleanest is uncertain , even to experts it s difficult to say which side is right , said james symons , a university of houston professor and former epa official who teaches graduate courses on the pollution and treatment of drinking water the great difficulty in deciding how pure water ought to be , he said , is that the existing data on the health effects of treated water is at best poor slight caner risk most experts , including mr symons , believe the vast bulk of water systems are extremely safe if you eliminate all the carcinogens in drinking water , i believe you 'd never see a change in the overall cancer rate , because so little cancer comes from drinking water , he said but he added that that was no excuse to stop working toward still purer tap water , especially in smaller systems asked if consumers had any reason to worry that the bill s changes in waterpurity standards would endanger their water supplies , mr perciasepe of the epa replied i do n't think so we have the best drinking water in the world photo the senate has voted to loosen purity standards for tap water , angering critics who think tougher standards are warranted last year , the protozoan

the men of the knights of columbus hall in woodside , queens , had to quit lending their floor polisher to honey s , the bar next door , after it went topless about 10 years ago i mean , how would that look , a k of c helping out a topless place \? said joe clancy , the manager of the hall at 50th street and queens boulevard but mr clancy , talking with the other regulars in the dark bar area of the knights hall , said the members of the roman catholic service organization had long ago made their peace with the presence of halfnaked women on the other side of their common wall really , they 've been no problem to us , he said maybe a few broken bottles outside in the morning , but you never know where they came from it s not a great advertisement for us , but i guess we just kind of coexist yeah , said jim mcmahon , a regular sitting on the next barstool they do n't bother us , we do n't bother them for the managers of many of the other businesses that share the block between 49th and 50th streets , it does n't seem possible that honey s is one of the targets of a new effort by mayor rudolph w giuliani to crack down on adultoriented establishments and move them to isolated industrial areas the five other merchants on the block with honey s said the topless bar had never produced any crime , loss of business , or any significant problems other than occasional doubleparking by patrons the manager of the ellenville deligrocery next door said the bar had actually improved his business , by sending him customers for cigarettes and sundries honey s \? no problem , said carl ferraro , the manager of the state farm insurance office three doors down they keep the young people out , and they do n't bother me the sentiments were repeated without exception in interviews with neighbors of several other longtime adult establishments that dot queens boulevard honey s is one of dozens of neighborhood topless bars that over the years have quietly become part of the landscape of queens and other parts of the city many were there long before the current round of protests against newer , flashier establishments that offer similar entertainment most , however , would be affected by the mayor s proposed zoning ordinance , which if approved would eventually force them to move out of areas near homes , schools or houses of worship their ability to operate for years with virtually no community opposition illustrates how difficult it is to make sweeping statements about the nature and effects of adult entertainment in new york city even the most vehement supporters of the mayor s proposal concede that places like honey s or the merrygoround in sunnyside which has offered topless entertainment for 20 years have had virtually no impact on the quality of life in their neighborhoods those neighborhood places are not a big problem , said marcia lynn , who has helped lead many of the most public protests outside new establishments in queens but we do n't want any more of them coming in because bars like honey s or the merrygoround have been operating so quietly for so long , they sometimes seem to be in a different world from the garish triplex video stores or the fancy nightclubs that have drawn so much antagonism such bars , however , actually constitute more than twothirds of the adult entertainment industry outside manhattan , which itself is dominated by video stores and more touristoriented bars of the 44 adult establishments in queens , 30 are topless bars , according to a survey of the industry compiled by the city planning department , and most are small , neighborhoodoriented bars that have been there for years in the bronx , brooklyn and staten island , 17 of the 26 establishments are topless bars when he announced the zoning proposal , mayor giuliani appeared in front of a new video store in elmhurst that is about four blocks away from a new allnude nightclub called wiggles in rego park both have been the sites of regular community pickets but in between them on queens boulevard is a lowkey topless bar called virginia s that has been there for 13 years the last eight of them topless and has never been the target of a protest virginia s is a dark bar with a lit exterior sign that says topless in a muted manner that few of the newer bars would imitate as in most such establishments , the women dance on raised runways to loud music and blinking colored lights , leaning and spinning around on poles the customers sit on the opposite side of the bar with their drinks , their faces as passionless as those of the dancers those who watch and those who are watched rarely have any contact with each other , except in the exchange of tips the scene is repeated , with virtually no variation , from one end of queens boulevard to the other that these longtime bars have aroused virtually no community protests over the years provides some insight into the opposition that is driving the new zoning proposal if , as even the protest leaders acknowledge , the older bars have had little impact on the quality of life after many years of operation , why should the new establishments be any different \? opponents of the newer establishments give a variety of reasons for leaving the old bars alone they attract a different clientele , they do n't draw customers from outside the neighborhood , they do n't sport flashy exteriors you ca n't tell me that these old places are as sexually arousing as the new allnude bars , said ms lynn , who lives at the other end of queens in bayside these new places are to me much more of a crime zone than the topless gogo places the nature of the older bars , however , would seem to make them more conducive to crime than the newer places the nude bars usually have a high cover charge that attracts a more upscale clientele than the old bars , which generally do not have cover charges and the nude bars are not allowed by state liquor statutes to serve alcohol , while drinking is allowed at a topless bar \( patrons at the nude bars have been known to pour small , hidden bottles of liquor into their juice \) but police statistics for the older liquor bars do not show a clear relationship to crime the city planning study , which examined police department complaints for sunnyside and four neighborhoods outside queens , showed a slightly higher crime rate for blocks in sunnyside that contain established topless bars than for blocks that do not the difference , though , could be explained by any number of other urban factors , like proximity to subway stations , the study said karen koslowitz , the councilwoman who represents the forest hillsrego park area , has been in the forefront of the recent protests against new bars and video stores that she says degrade the quality of life in neighborhoods like her middleclass district a bar like virginia s , she said , had not affected the quality of life in rego park , nor has the larger , brightpink goldfinger s topless bar across queens boulevard but any more bars would , she said it s the proliferation of these places that we do n't want , she said when you see a lot of them , then you think twice about moving into the neighborhood how many topless places does a neighborhood need , anyway \? ms koslowitz said a bar like virginia s serves an older , local clientele that is unlikely to be rowdy , while wiggles brings in younger people from outside the rego park area who will disrupt the neighborhood the people at virginia s come from the neighborhood , she said none of these wiggles patrons contributes to our community in any way they do n't patronize our stores and they take up our parking spots in our streets , you know , parking is at a premium photos honey s , a topless bar on queens boulevard between 49th and 50th streets , is one of the targets of a new effort by mayor rudolph w giuliani to crack down on adultoriented establishments the five other merchants sharing the block with honey s , the merrygoround , above , and other adult establishments said that the bars had never caused problems like crime or loss of business \( photographs by monica almeida the new york times \)
argonaut management , one of the biggest and most prominent hedgefund companies started in the last year , said yesterday that its no 2 partner and head trader , m barry bausano , had resigned the resignation , which took effect on monday , has raised questions among some of the firm s investors about its ability to continue , although its president , david gerstenhaber , asserted yesterday that argonaut would definitely remain in business the value of argonaut s two funds has fallen more than 25 percent this year , causing many investors to withdraw money as a result , the funds' assets have fallen from a peak of 395 million early this year to 200 million and they are expected to lose more as of aug 16 , the first anniversary of the two funds' founding , when some of the other investors will have the right to make withdrawals several fund investors said the departure of mr bausano , 31 , was likely to encourage more people to withdraw their money one investor in argonaut , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , called mr bausano s departure a serious blow to the firm s business it was always david s show , this person said he was the leader but it s always important to have a strong inside guy if he has lost confidence or is leaving , it makes outside investors uncomfortable mr bausano was not available for comment last night , but mr gerstenhaber said mr bausano chose to resign for personal reasons in recent days , wall street trading desks were filled with rumors that argonaut was in danger of collapse and that the firm s banks had cut off its credit mr gerstenhaber forcefully denied such rumors we 're in it for the long haul and we will stay that way , he said we have credit lines all over the street and none of them has been pulled or reduced one senior executive at a large investment bank confirmed that it had not cut back its credit lines to argonaut , largely because the funds' portfolios are in highly liquid instruments yet the investment banker was also worried by the departure of mr bausano and the investor withdrawals when you lose money , you get redemptions then you lose more money and get more redemptions , the banker said it can cascade down hedge funds are private partnerships , available only to rich individuals and to institutions , that typically use more aggressive investment strategies than mutual funds aimed at the mass market they can sell stocks short , invest in complex derivative instruments and use leverage investing with borrowed money so as to amplify gains and losses unhappy and costly surprises many prominent hedge funds have suffered significant losses this year as bond and currency markets moved sharply in unanticipated ways indeed , several funds managed by askin capital management that invested in mortgagebacked securities collapsed in february , wiping out investors mr gerstenhaber , 34 , previously headed an investing group intended to capitalize on macroeconomic trends for the tiger management corporation , a huge hedgefund group run by julian h robertson jr while mr robertson is a traditional stock picker , mr gerstenhaber specializes in picking out broad economic and interestrate trends around the world mr bausano was the head trader in tiger s macro group mr gerstenhaber and mr bausano left tiger in the spring of 1993 to found their own funds and raised more than 300 million , an enormous amount for any startup , not to mention one by two people in their early 30 s with no independent track record while mr gerstenhaber spotted broad trends , mr bausano would find trades to capitalize on them , often using complex customized financial instruments barry was one of the most talented execution persons in the hedgefund community , the wall street investment banker said he has a rapid grasp of complexity and how to break something down to understand its value nonetheless , the argonaut funds were hurt by the same unexpected drop in many foreign interest rates and in the value of the dollar that plagued other macroeconomic funds in the second quarter , argonaut lost money on european stocks and bonds , and in july it was hurt because it sold short bonds and dollars shortly before both of those markets rallied as a result , the funds have sold most of their european , asian and latin american stocks and pulled back from much of their shortterm trading activity , according to a recent letter to investors thinner pay envelopes with the funds now down more than 25 percent for the year , the opportunity for earnings by argonaut s partners are substantially limited like most hedge funds , argonaut is paid an annual fee of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits such arrangements made many hedge fundmanagers multimillionaires in the boom times of the last few years , but the paychecks are likely to be much thinner at such firms this year mr gerstenhaber said pay was not a factor in mr bausano s resignation he also argued that the asset withdrawals reflected a deliberate choice by argonaut to allow investors to get out earlier than their contracts allowed most hedge funds allow withdrawals only once a year , but argonaut decided to accommodate withdrawal requests from some socalled funds of funds , which spread investments among different hedgefund managers , a move that has been widely praised among investors we decided not to hold investors to their lockup clauses in order to provide them with greater flexibility in the interests of building longterm partnerships , mr gerstenhaber said he said he had no plans to cut any of the firm s 24 fulltime staff positions
washington , sept 28 in a cordial , almost jocular atmosphere , president clinton and president boris n yeltsin agreed today to speed destruction of nuclear weapons , but they made only limited progress on several other issues relations between our nations are moving forward at full speed , mr clinton said at a joint news conference in the east room of the white house after the signing of documents pledging cooperation on economic and security matters on most things , mr yeltsin said , for peace , for humanity , for mankind , for our whole planet , we have agreed two things made this , the fifth summit meeting between the two leaders , different from the others first , the contentious questions today are small potatoes compared with those of the recent past , like arms control and the very survival of the russian reformers second , mr yeltsin appears to have regained his stride after having seemed offbalance for months following the attempt to oust him a year ago the two leaders , burly extroverts who obviously enjoy each other , agreed to speed implementation of the start ii agreement , reached in 1993 , which calls for the reduction of each nation s arsenal to between 3 , 000 and 3 , 500 longrange nuclear warheads by 2003 instead of taking the nine years allowed , mr clinton said , dismantling will begin as soon as the accord is ratified but start ii cannot be ratified until an earlier agreement , start i , comes into effect the administration hopes that will happen by the end of the year and that ratification can be completed and dismantling can therefore get under way by mid1995 congressional approval seems sure a struggle is expected in the russian parliament , but mr yeltsin will probably prevail obviously delighted with what he had accomplished during two days in washington , the russian leader hammed it up with reporters , taunting them for falling behind you ca n't think fast enough \? he asked , stretching out his words to comic extremes mr clinton did not quite manage to keep a straight face earlier , at the library of congress , mr yeltsin robustly rebutted those who have suggested recently that the united states and russia will eventually come into conflict i would like to tell you , he said in his booming baritone , that we never fought the united states , and i believe i can say as president of russia that we will never fight the united states in the future instead , we will focus on building a world of decency and welfare but on bosnia , cooperation between the two nations is still imperfect , and only limited progress was made a close adviser to mr yeltsin said , if it were easy , the thing would have been settled long ago russia , in part because of its cultural links to the serbs , has long opposed the lifting of the international arms embargo against the former yugoslavia , which would benefit the muslimled government in bosnia the british and the french , who have peacekeepers in bosnia , are also opposed but under congressional pressure , mr clinton had pledged to ask the united nations to lift the ban by oct 15 an open split was averted when the bosnian prime minister , haris silajdzic , suggested a sixmonth delay in authorizing arms shipments secretary of state warren christopher expressed hope that some settlement could be reached during this period , but mr yeltsin was blunt after a meeting with united states senators , he said that at the end of six months , perhaps we can decide once and for all that this should not be done at all on another vexing question , that of russian arms shipments to iran , mr clinton said only , we 've made progress in fact , american officials said , mr clinton was not able to extract from mr yeltsin any firm pledge to slow the flow of submarines , tanks and airlaunched missiles , which amounted to more than 1 billion last year the russian leader said russia would honor a contract signed with iran in 1988 but would sign no new deals but we do n't know how long or how wide the current pipeline is , an american expert said without that information , it is hard to say whether the russian s new pledge has much significance mr yeltsin also refused to budge much on russian intervention in other nations of the former soviet union concerned about what might happen if russian troops went into nagornokarabakh , which is disputed between armenia and azerbaijan , the conference on security and cooperation in europe has asked to monitor any intervention so far russia has balked , and mr yeltsin showed no sign that he would yield instead he reasserted his claim to a russian sphere of influence not unlike that which washington claims in its hemisphere these are our neighbors , he insisted yesterday we lived in the same house , in the soviet union they 're our blood , right \? come on , let s be honest in the economic discussions , the emphasis was on american private investment , not american government aid the russians promised to improve the laws governing business , which are so lax and change so often that most foreign business executives have shied away the clinton administration , for its part , pledged 525 million in financing and insurance for new investments in russia , and additional agreements are expected to raise the total to 1 billion in the days when squabbles between the united states and the soviet union shook the world , american presidents encountering stormy political weather at home looked to summit talks for a bit of distraction but this meeting was so lowkey , so normal , that mr clinton , hardpressed in the midterm elections , can probably expect little in the way of direct obvious benefit still , the change in the relationship has been remarkable when mr clinton was in moscow in january , he spent most of his time with mr yeltsin , even though the political situation was confused , with reformers and pragmatists struggling for power some russians and some diplomats complained , arguing that mr clinton should have paid more attention to prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin , an economic gradualist all that seems like ancient history mr chernomyrdin did not come with mr yeltsin to washington he is required by the constitution to stay at home when mr yeltsin is out of the country but the two have long since reached an understanding on the pace of economic reform , and mr yeltsin praised his erstwhile rival this week several times he even used a very chernomyrdinlike word pragmatism eight months ago that word would have upset american officials because it would have sounded like a signal that mr yeltsin planned to ease reform measures as a concession to russian nationalists this week , none of the americans who heard him batted an eye photo president clinton , right , and the russian president , boris n yeltsin , demonstrated their mutual affection yesterday as they left the east room after signing agreements this was their fifth summit meeting \( david scull the new york times \)
robert shaw s performance of britten s war requiem on sunday afternoon at carnegie hall , the culmination of a weeklong choral workshop sponsored by carnegie and led by mr shaw , was , as expected , a sublime event , sure to live in the memory but to a listener who had followed the sessions leading up to it , the concert seemed almost beside the point for by then mr shaw , in his inimitably earthy manner , had presided over a weeklong humanistic exercise of the highest order it did n't seem so at the start the first rehearsals of the adult chorus , last tuesday at the manhattan center in midtown , struck an observer who has always admired mr shaw s results as oddly mechanistic affairs mr shaw s method is to isolate aspects of the music rhythm , for example , through the singing of beat numbers instead of text or enunciation , with words chanted on a single pitch these were , after all , highly experienced choristers , most of whom had sung with mr shaw before , many in previous carnegie workshops the annual event , now in its fourth season , is intended for choral teachers and conductors from around the country participants this year were joined by singers from the robert shaw festival in france and the robert shaw choral institute at ohio state university and here they all were , laboring britten s noble melodies long and hard to one , two , tee , four \( mr shaw s level of precision requires tee , shorter than three , for uniformity of movement \) on tuesday evening , mr shaw shifted gears and spoke feelingly to the chorus about the texts , which mingle the latin requiem mass with powerful antiwar poetry of wilfred owen , who was killed in world war i the conductor , who comes of evangelical preaching stock , concluded his hourlong analysis of the work s multiple meanings , its juxtapositions of horror and consolation , with lofty , slightly inscrutable , eloquence for still others it might suffice that after all , there is still in our being and our unbeing a mystery into which none of the statistical forms of man s intelligence can carry him that it involves a life beyond the present most men have hoped and few gainsaid for me , it is wonder enough that owen s words and britten s vision are a part of the life force in the manthing whether any one of us 'makes it' in a hereafter i find somehow less important than the presence of humanity such as this it was still far from clear how such sentiments tied into the elementary exercises or into the little tricks the old wizard began to apply for better projection when the music was treated whole half the chorus whispering pitchlessly while the other half sang half the chorus singing kydie while the other half voiced a proper kyrie but the chorus was getting good , no question it seemed utterly plausible when , on thursday afternoon , mr shaw said this is an extraordinary chorus i do n't know its equal anywhere in the world , and it s two and a half days old now the orchestra of st luke s joined in the rehearsals , and the honing and refining and perfecting intensified it was becoming evident that mr shaw , seemingly inexhaustible though not quite ageless at 77 , had constructed and was now putting the finishing touches on a glittering china shop of a performance the american boychoir and two of the vocal soloists , richard clement , tenor , and christine goerke , soprano , fitted beautifully into his fastidious conception but on thursday evening , he dropped a bombshell , explaining to the chorus that the baritone , benjamin luxon , had gone almost totally deaf in recent years the difficulties of mr luxon s situation , caused by a rare deficiency in the immune system , were unimaginable , but they took shape in subsequent rehearsals in the two full runthroughs of the piece , at the manhattan center on friday and at carnegie hall on saturday , mr luxon , who is prone to sharpness but refuses to play safe , entered high by a good margin in the concluding let us sleep now both times he realized the problem and shook his head in exasperation in fact , these flaws were badges of courage , eminently appropriate to the nature of the piece but what suddenly became obvious was that mr shaw had invited a bull into his fine china shop he put all of that painstaking preparation at risk because , he said , mr luxon brings a human quality to this piece that i have never heard anywhere else on sunday , mr luxon pretty much nailed that pesky entry in a performance of overwhelming dignity and pathos , scoring a personal triumph and rewarding mr shaw s confidence but even if he had missed again , it would not have mattered humanity had been richly served all around , and that is precisely the point of the piece mr shaw s praise of owen s and britten s humanity might just as well apply to his own and mr luxon s what also finally became apparent was that mr shaw s approach was all of a piece , that the same humanity that underlay the risktaking also underlay the elaborate failsafe mechanism the esthetics and the modification of social behavior that come from a love of beauty and from the disciplines of accomplishment are terribly important to our civilization , mr shaw said in conversation before the dress rehearsal , especially in a society where both religion and political organizations have abdicated their responsibilities for human behavior in a carnegie video release of excerpts from the 1990 workshop on brahms s german requiem , he puts the point more simply everything , everything , quality of tone , quality of rhythm , quality of enunciation finally becomes spirit he says it with such placid conviction that you want to believe him then you hear the performance , and you have to believe him photo in preparation for the sunday performance of britten s war requiem , robert shaw directed a rehearsal saturday with richard clement and benjamin luxon , right it was the culmination of a weeklong workshop \( chris lee

washington , june 5 top officials at the nation s central bank have concluded that growth in the american economy has slackened slightly and that inflation is under control , making further interest rate increases much less likely in the coming weeks three of the federal reserve board s five governors said they did not believe that unemployment had dropped to an alarming extent , given contradictory information on hiring that the labor department released on friday along with an announcement that unemployment had fallen to 6 percent in may from 64 percent in april the federal reserve has already raised shortterm interest rates by a total of 125 percentage points in four stages in the last four months as a result , the interest rates that americans pay on their mortgages , credit cards and smallbusiness loans have climbed the federal reserve has long regarded steep drops in unemployment as one of the two or three clearest signals of an overheating economy and future inflation if the drops come when unemployment is already low the economic panorama in separate interviews on other topics on friday and saturday , the three governors said they regarded the fall in the unemployment rate in the context of other recent announcements like a slight fall in consumer spending and slowing sales of new cars and in light of other employment information released on friday that suggested the fall in the unemployment rate might not be reliable we actually had a mixed week in terms of statistics i do n't think anyone is alarmed , said lawrence b lindsey , one of the governors the overall pattern of recent economic indicators clearly points to a slowing of economic growth and reduced risk of inflation , said edward w kelley jr , another fed governor recent data do seem to imply that is what is going on now it does not surprise me and does not disturb me , he said john p laware , the third governor , noted that personal consumption spending and new factory orders have ebbed slightly and the leading economic indicators are unchanged they do n't look like runaways to me , he said such sentiments make it much less likely that the federal reserve will raise interest rates , though this can never be absolutely certain , particularly if economic indicators in coming weeks show unexpected strength an eye on wages mr laware was more cautious than mr lindsey and mr kelley , warning that he would be watching these indicators closely and would be particularly attentive to any sign that wages were beginning to rise quickly enough to feed inflation i do n't have any real feel for what this second quarter is going to look like , mr laware said the federal reserve might also raise rates if alan greenspan , its chairman and most influential voice on monetary policy , decides that the fall in unemployment is worrisome but a hallmark of mr greenspan s tenure at the central bank has been his reluctance to respond to any single economic indicator , especially if it is inconsistent with other indicators joseph r coyne , the federal reserve s press secretary , said on friday that mr greenspan would not comment on the unemployment figures or the economy but he is understood to share the view that prospects for inflation are less ominous than they appeared earlier this spring clinton administration officials have a policy of not commenting on the federal reserve or shortterm interest rates , but are likely to welcome the cautious words of the central bank s top officials treasury secretary lloyd bentsen has said that he urged mr greenspan on may 15 to signal that interest rates would stop rising after the next increase the federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates by half a percentage point two days later while issuing a statement indicating that it had substantially finished its current round of rate increases but the statement also included a sentence hinting that the fed might move again if it thought subsequent economic indicators required a response from the central bank the rough consensus has been that the federal reserve would not raise interest rates again soon but some economists , like david c munro at high frequency economics , a new york consulting company , have predicted that the fed would increase rates as soon as last friday or in the next few days two democrats on the senate banking committee , senator paul s sarbanes of maryland and senator jim sasser of virginia , have strongly criticized the federal reserve for being too quick to think that the economy is in danger of overheating they have warned that the higher interest rates might needlessly choke off economic growth none of the governors interviewed expressed concern that a current leveling off or slight slowing in economic growth might turn into another recession they also contended that the last four interest rate increases were appropriate , particularly given the fall in the unemployment rate i think that the 6 percent is proof that we probably did the right thing to raise rates earlier this year , mr lindsey said i'm sure glad we did it looking at longterm rates

the chairman of the house ways and means committee , dan rostenkowski , predicts that congress will pass major health care legislation this year senator nancy landon kassebaum , republican of kansas , disagrees she detects considerable slippage in support for such legislation in the three months since president clinton addressed a joint session of congress lawmakers , administration officials and outside experts see the battle over health care as the biggest political challenge facing congress in 1994 but their expectations of the outcome , expressed in interviews last week , differ widely they were invited to forecast the results by answering these questions will congress in 1994 pass a comprehensive bill guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all americans \? if so , how closely will it resemble president clinton s proposal \? under the clinton plan , the most ambitious government program congress has considered since the new deal , all americans would have a right to comprehensive health benefits that can never be taken away mr clinton wants to require all employers to help pay for coverage of their workers , under a proposal known as an employer mandate most people would get coverage through purchasing groups known as health alliances , which would bargain with networks of doctors and hospitals in an effort to control costs , the government would set limits on insurance premiums this combination of freemarket forces and government regulation , often called managed competition , is a source of fierce debate because it would thoroughly reorganize the health care system there appears to be bipartisan support for more modest proposals that would , for example , prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people with a history of illness robert pear dr lonnie r bristow , chairman of the american medical association congress will pass a comprehensive bill in 1994 the centerpiece will be universal coverage , perhaps phased in over a decade the final bill will have a passing resemblance to the clinton proposal , but it will not be a close copy it will be a hybrid of all the bills currently in congress it will place less reliance on government regulation and will have less bureaucracy than the president s proposal john c rother , director of legislation and public policy , american association of retired persons congress will pass a bill assuring health security to every american congress will recognize that anything short of this standard will not be viewed as adequate by the american people congress will make modifications to the substance , financing and timing of the clinton bill but the final product will closely approximate the full scope of the administration s proposal michael d bromberg , executive director of the federation of american health systems , a trade group for 1 , 400 hospitals the odds are dropping i'm not as optimistic as i was a few months ago congress will take a significant first step , with reform of the health insurance market and some other things but it will probaby fall short of being a grand scheme it will look like a small part of the clinton plan , but not the whole design i hear more and more comments from members of congress saying how massive this is and suggesting that we do n't have to do it all in one gulp representative pete stark , democrat of california , chairman of the ways and means subcommittee on health if we get going early enough in 1994 , we may be able to pass something if congress passes a bill that guarantees coverage to every american , it will not resemble the president s plan in its present state i do n't believe that the president s plan is workable in a technical sense the costs will make it more unattractive it will take major changes to accomplish his laudable goal of universal coverage i do n't believe that there will be mandatory alliances i do n't think we will be able to give away tens of billions of dollars to major corporations for unfunded retiree liabilities the benefit package is too ambitious , too costly you will end up with insurance reform some form of mandate , a requirement that every individual have insurance a way to subsidize lowincome individuals who ca n't afford it , and a conglomeration of taxes to pay for the subsidies every employer will have to pay in the form of a payroll tax or a mandatory premium some share of every employee s health care costs donna e shalala , secretary of health and human services absolutely , congress will pass legislation guaranteeing universal coverage from the farmers in iowa to the small business people in florida to the working folks in wisconsin , everyone is sending the administration and congress the same message we want the security of knowing that our family and friends will have health insurance coverage that can never be taken away the bill that eventually passes will parallel the administration proposal quite closely representative dan rostenkowski , democrat of illinois when congress quits at the end of 1994 , there will be a major new health law on the books that will include a schedule to provide health insurance for all americans it will also contain real costcontainment mechanisms that will make this added insurance affordable we will not enact the president s precise plan there will be changes but the president will sign what we create and get political credit for it he 'll deserve it senator nancy landon kassebaum , ranking republican on the labor and human resources committee i do n't think congress will pass a comprehensive health care bill in 1994 there has been considerable slippage in support since the president s speech to a joint session of congress the public has grown increasingly confused about the complexity of this issue , and those who are opposed have managed to create further seeds of doubt the public worries about the cost and about the ability to have choices in the system i'm just finding growing opposition the question becomes , should we do interim steps like insurance reform \? it seems more likely we will approach it that way if i had to make a prediction something less than a comprehensive approach will be designed in incremental steps it will be portrayed as containing enough of what the president wanted so he 'll declare victory dr paul m ellwood , president of the jackson hole group , a conclave of health care executives and policy analysts congress will pass a bill that guarantees universal coverage but the coverage will come in stages congress will not approve the clinton plan in its present form and will , in all likelihood , substitute its own version the congressional version will be more conservative financially , but more radical in pushing competition congress will retain the managed competition format , with health plans competing on price and quality congress will eliminate provisions of the clinton proposal under which the government would regulate health insurance premiums firms with more than 500 employees will generally not be allowed to participate in the alliances clinton will get and deserve the credit for having triggered this process of major reform representative dick armey , chairman of the house republican conference clinton ca n't pass his bill members of congress cannot go home and defend a vote for a nightmarish bureaucratic infrastructure or jobkilling mandates like those in the clinton bill if clinton gets out of his partisan ideological box on health care by the end of april , then he has a 60 percent chance of passing a bill like the one sponsored by representative bob michel and senator trent lott that bill builds on the strength of the market while correcting failures of current government policy senator john h chafee , republican of rhode island congress will pass comprehensive health care reform that provides universal coverage the bill that passes will incorporate features from a host of different proposals will it be modeled after managed competition \? yes will it involve purchasing groups \? yes will it lower the rate of increase of health care costs \? yes will it rely heavily on regulation \? no will it have price controls \? no will it be a program that commits to new spending without savings' being realized \? no representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on health it will be a tough legislative battle but by the end of the year , we will pass legislation that guarantees health insurance coverage to all americans members of congress will be reluctant to face voters in 1994 without being able to take credit for such legislation congress will accept the outlines of president clinton s proposal and will make a lot of changes but we will have to have an employer mandate none of the alternatives achieve the goal of universal coverage representative benjamin l cardin , democrat of maryland a bill guaranteeing universal health insurance will pass in 1994 but to win passage , there will be modifications of the president s plan for example , health alliances may well be dropped or made optional for states much of what the president hopes to accomplish with health alliances can be achieved through insurance reform henri a termeer , chairman of the genzyme corporation i believe that congress will enact a comprehensive health care plan this year but i also expect that the president s proposal will be revised to eliminate unnecessary reliance on price controls that would discourage the development of innovative new drugs gerald w mcentee , president of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees there is going to be national health care reform in this session of congress within the clinton plan , there are some problems having to do with medicaid , the employer mandate , the type of universal coverage , the private and public sectors' being treated differently whereas they should be treated the same but the legislation that eventually passes will resemble the clinton proposal more than any other jack a meyer , president of new directions for policy , a private research organization that specializes in health and social policy congress will probably pass a comprehensive health care reform plan in the fall of 1994 this plan will be much less sweeping than president clinton s blueprint , but considerably more substantial than minor tinkering i believe that a breakthrough will occur in negotiations between the white house and a coalition of conservative democrats joined by moderate republicans the basis for the deal will be white house agreement to scale back and delay premium controls , reduce the scope of health care alliances and ease up on cutbacks in medicare and medicaid spending growth the conservative democrats and moderate republicans will , in return , agree to accept some version of an employer mandate , along with expenditure targets that are kept voluntary for a trial period kenneth s abramowitz , a health care securities analyst at sanford c bernstein company , in new york congress will pass major health care reform before the 1994 elections the democrats will have no choice but to compromise away 75 percent of the clinton plan in order to keep the 25 percent that makes sense there will be fewer government controls and less income redistribution than would be required under the clinton plan representative thomas j bliley jr , ranking republican on the energy and commerce subcommittee on health it s going to be very dificult for the president to produce 218 votes in the house and 51 votes in the senate to support his proposal for mandated coverage , which would call for a payroll tax on most companies of 79 percent if you remove the employer mandate , you can get a bill , but trying to get the mandate through will be exceedingly difficult senator john d rockefeller 4th , democrat of west virginia congress will pass a comprehensive bill providing universal coverage the american people will not allow any other result it will resemble the clinton plan more than any other proposal because he faithfully built his plan around americans' priorities
mittelherwigsdorf , germany several dozen residents of this eastern german village turned out to meet heinz eggert on a recent evening , but none asked him about the great issues that have preoccupied him since he became saxony s interior minister three years ago the questions were not about his success in combating rightwing violence , his criticisms of german unification or his prickly relationship with his party leader , chancellor helmut kohl most questions were about local or personal problems property rights , farm subsidies and a proposed new garbage dump on the edge of town nonetheless , the 47yearold mr eggert peppered his responses with sharp comments directed at the bonn government a lutheran minister , he was not afraid to speak out under the former communist government , when he so angered the secret police that they tried to blackmail and poison him he has continued to challenge authority since unification , and it has made him one of the most popular politicians to emerge from eastern germany i do n't see the holiness of what is called the state of law' in germany , because the government s idea of justice does n't always apply to us in the east , he said at one point bonn is a place where almost everyone pursues narrow personal interests , and that means we in the east are often left behind mr eggert also gently chided his fellow easterners for what he said was their tendency to wait for government help instead of taking charge of their own lives for 40 years we 've been used to having everything arranged for us , and we have n't broken that habit , he said before you write me a letter asking for help , think about whether what you 're asking is really something for the government to worry about or whether you can resolve it yourself mr eggert s speeches have the air of sermons , and his background as a lutheran preacher , not easy during the communist era , shines through his words and precepts but he has also proved to be extraordinarily effective at maintaining law and order , a job for which religious training is not often considered relevant after the collapse of east germany and its unification with west germany in 1990 , mr eggert won election as local governor in the region around zittau , which is near the polish and czech borders , and was soon named the state s interior minister , giving him control over law enforcement his most immediate challenge was the swift rise of violent rightist radicalism saxony was then considered a heartland of neonazism , with the police confused and discouraged and skinheads rampaging mr eggert moved swiftly to crack down on racist violence i have made clear that any police officer in saxony who looks the other way when violence is being committed , whether it s against a foreigner , a german or an asylumseeker , will be fired , he said after beginning his campaign he started counseling programs that every neonazi who was arrested was required to complete perhaps most important , he began spending his evenings in bars frequented by young rightists , talking with them for hours on end saxony now has one of the lowest rates of rightist violence of any german state many local neonazis have evidently drifted away from violence , though some may have moved to states where efforts to control them are less forceful with that success behind him , mr eggert made his debut on the national political scene in 1992 he decided to seek a position on the executive board of his party , the christian democratic union when chancellor kohl and other party leaders refused to put him on the official slate , he took the extraordinary step of running anyway to the astonishment of many , mr eggert won his race , displacing a prominent member of the party establishment , defense minister volker ruhe emphasizing his outsider status , he appeared at the next party convention wearing blue jeans in the 1980 s mr eggert was a target of the communist secret police , known as the stasi he found out when the stasi files became public after unification angered by his sermons criticizing communist rule and his close ties with student groups , the stasi sent women to try to seduce him for blackmail purposes and when that did not work , they tried sending men when those efforts failed , the stasi apparently succeeded in poisoning him , causing him to fall ill after he took office as interior minister , mr eggert dismissed hundreds of police officers who had worked for the stasi in recent weeks he has been criticized after he acknowledged that several hundred others are still on his payroll because not enough trained officers are available to replace them despite the criticism , he is building a highly positive national reputation if saxony s premier , kurt biedenkopf , is called to a high position in bonn after this year s national election , as some expect , mr eggert would be his most likely successor in an interview before the public meeting , mr eggert was asked about that prospect he smiled and replied , i never imagined i 'd have a job like the one i have now , and i ca n't imagine another one that would be this much fun photo heinz eggert , right , interior minister of saxony , is one of the bestliked politicians in eastern germany a lutheran pastor , he is given much of the credit for reducing the violence of the rightist fringe \( thomas lehman zb \) map shows the location of mittelherwigsdorf , germany
los angeles , oct 24 the turmoil at time warner s music group grew worse today when the president of warner brothers records , lenny waronker , said he would not succeed the group s highly regarded chairman , mo ostin , who will step down in january after 25 years the announcement led to industry speculation that both executives could join the new label being formed by david geffen , the recording industry billionaire people close to mr waronker , who has been president of warner brothers records for 12 years and who had accepted the top job in august , said the reversal reflected the executive s growing apprehension shared by other music executives about the way that robert j morgado , the warner music group s chairman and chief executive , was managing the record labels the corporate structure is getting bigger and bigger , and decisions that were once made at the label level are now being made at the corporate level , and that has many people nervous , said one music industry executive close to warner brothers this is a business based on relationships with artists mr morgado was not available for comment mr waronker said he would remain as president , fulfilling his contract , which expires at the end of 1995 however , some people in the company speculated that he might renegotiate his contract once mr morgado chooses a successor to mr ostin this job was simply not for me , mr waronker said i had to do what was in my heart , and not having it feel right was a bad sign he would not elaborate people close to mr ostin and mr waronker said the executives might join mr geffen as part of his new venture to form a major entertainment company with jeffrey katzenberg , the former disney studio head , and the director , steven spielberg david reveres mo , a music industry executive said , noting that geffen records got its start under warner brothers in 1980 and mo and lenny are a team if lenny and mo join geffen , they would probably take a lot of warner brother executives and artists with them that could be devastating to warner brothers mr waronker s decision is one more sign of instability at the warner music group , which is the world s biggest distributor of recordings its atlantic , warner brothers and elektra companies have all experienced changes in their top management since july the head of the atlantic group , doug morris , was named to the newly created position of president and chief operating officer of warner music north america , putting him in charge of all three labels the new reporting layer is said by industry executives to have rankled robert krasnow , the head of elektra , who resigned within weeks , as well as mr ostin , who had been accustomed to bypassing even mr morgado and reporting directly to the head of time warner in august , mr ostin said he would step down at the end of the year to become a consultant to time warner time warner has lost some of the best talent in the industry in mo , bob krasnow and now lenny , said an executive at a competing label you have employees and artists who are extremely devoted to these people among warner brother s top artists are tom petty , neil young , eric clapton , paul simon and rem some of them might look for new homes as their contracts expire , some people speculated none of them could be reached for comment artists and warner executives are also troubled by the expected appointment of seymour stein , the head of sire records , another part of warner brothers , as president of elektra entertainment sire may be put under the elektra umbrella to build up that group fifty artists could be transferred with seymour to elektra , one person at warner said artists have no say , but they will have to deal with all new people in marketing , sales , product management , and that is very unsettling

east rutherford , nj the second round would have been better for willis reed the conference final would have been heaven on swamp , if not on earth the first round against the knicks is what the new jersey nets get , but that is going to do , just fine that is the best offer reed and the nets have had in years we have a chance to knock them off , he said yesterday we have a chance to make people notice us , maybe expand our fan base here the nets have a chance to ruin it all for pat riley s knicks and with all the other subplots that make this as delicious a firstround event as we could expect , willis reed s team can walk into madison square garden and hold the number of championship banners to the two reed helped raise in 1970 and 1973 reed can go back to the garden and purge the worst experience of his professional life , once and for all that s many years ago , when i left , he said life s gone on i 've gone on then reed began talking about the knick team that was taken from him by the late sonny werblin in 1978 , when he was excised from the organization he had sacrificed and bled for , the team he and frazier , et al , put on the pro basketball map the pace of reed s conversation quickened his eyes were alive i thought we had a chance to be a good team , a damn good team , he said of those bob mcadoomarvin webstermicheal ray richardson knicks it is ancient history , by pro basketball standards , a couple of eras already past but to someone who grew up with the knicks of reed and frazier and debusschere , someone who remembers reed s gallant limp onto the court for game 7 , may 8 , 1970 , against the lakers of wilt and west , watching reed walk off in another direction was , likewise , an unforgettable sight it was early november 1978 , friday afternoon , and the knicks had returned from a long western trip werblin , the new garden president , summoned reed , right from the airport reed was 14 games into his second season as knick coach , 6 and 8 , and he was about to get fired it was nearly midnight when werblin stepped outside his office and said he was bringing red holzman back to coach someone asked where reed might be werblin said he had slipped out a side door out on 31st street , a hulking figure could be seen walking a slight limp , of course toward eighth avenue alongside reed , a question was asked , and when he turned , there was just enough light from the street lamps to see that his lower lip was quivering willis reed , the fiercest knick , was so stunned by his dismissal that he could barely speak forget how ready he was to coach he was canned for political reasons by werblin , who wanted to put his stamp on the garden teams reed gave him openings by being outspoken once , during the previous summer , he told a reporter that his team could n't win unless it had a center the reporter said , what if you do n't get one \? reed said , i might quit his public relations guy , jim wergeles , was sitting right there willis , no he said reed waved him off that was his way , straightforward , until werblin sent him away from his beloved knicks that sad experience surely shaped reed s postplaying career it took him 10 years to get back , as head coach of the nets he worked at st john s , as lou carnesecca s unpaid assistant he coached college kids at creighton university he worked a couple of assistant jobs back in the pros with the nets , he showed , as he had with the knicks , that his true talent was finding players more than deploying them he has manufactured a wealth of them for a team that had none some were squandered by the nets' queasy shareholders , for whom reed has occasionally been the front man , left to explain what went wrong but he learned , the hard way , what it means to turn his frustration against the boss i like the jersey area , he said , smiling i hope to retire here this season , by all rights , could have been one miserable plunge that sent everyone away a team whose very foundation was built in marshlands seemed to be up to its ears , sinking fast a car crash had taken drazen petrovic , a burgeoning star another popular player , chris dudley , bailed out , never looked back derrick coleman was going to be next , kenny anderson after him chuck daly would n't last as coach some of the owners wanted to sell the nets had blown it all , this time for good they would never be a legitimate presence in greater new york , never be any kind of threat to the bigtown knicks and somehow , reed , in the crossfire between the timorous gents who sign the checks and those who bank the crazy money , held this team together , kept it moving toward some kind of future the way it works is that daly gets most of the public credit for the nets winning 46 games , making the playoffs he is a character , of course , and a mighty fine coach , but it is time to recognize that this was reed s deal , from stabilizing a wreck of a roster to getting coleman to commit to the team in his master plan , kevin edwards would 've backed up petrovic , dudley and benoit benjamin would have been cocenters you ca n't always plan life , reed said not so much in this league by last summer , reed s team was full of holes , but getting edwards was excellent emergency work , better than what was produced under similar circumstances in boston and chicago he also got armon gilliam to replace terry mills he got johnny newman for rumeal robinson , a stiff he got benjamin , who has come around some , for sam bowie , who headed straight for the lakers' injured list the nets are not going to win a championship this spring , but they do have a shot to win 3 of 5 in the first round they have a chance to stand up , finally , and be heard , all the way across the river we 'll never be the knicks , i understand that , said reed but when i joined the knicks , it was us and detroit , the two worst teams in the league i saw it all happen i saw each player come in teams do get better they start with something , in the playoffs at the nets' new offices late yesterday morning , a twostory building off route 17 , the switchboard was ringing like mad , fans calling in for word of tickets for next week the mood was festive , people poking around for knick news , about anthony mason and john starks the garden will always be a part of me , said reed , no 19 among the garden s retired jerseys it s still a special place to walk into

in his last book , richard nixon writes that the siege of sarajevo would not have lasted as long as it did had the victims been not muslims but predominantly christians or jews the book has not yet been published , but within two days of his death , the substance of that one comment was quoted in the press each time the journalistic surround was clear the man is right mr nixon s charge in beyond peace \( random house \) is important far more important are the questions it leaves hanging is this another holocaust \? are those who moved too slowly to save the muslims or their state , or opposed military intervention particularly jews among them as guilty as those who turned away from the slaughter of the jews by nazis \? these questions have been hovering in the minds and writings of some americans who successfully demanded us military intervention certainly some of us who opposed it , including myself , think often of them i know chroniclers of the holocaust who want to help the muslims but believe that the holocaust comparison distorts history and morality sadly , some are unwilling to speak up for fear of being thought insensitive or arrogant but the questions , raised directly or by innuendo , or subconsciously , should be answered whatever his intent , mr nixon was hardly disingenuous he knew that the world rarely pays attention to victims of civil war or atrocity , whatever their faith as he wrote , christians were being killed by muslims in the sudan and armenia muslims by the hundreds of thousands were murdered not by hindu or christian or jew but by their own muslim governments in syria , afghanistan , iraq and iran haitians are murdered by their police , and africans left tribal enemies rotting in streets neither the us nor the un sent armies to help the jews when the arab states fell upon newborn israel i respect mr nixon s fortitude after disgrace , some of his foreign affairs concepts and his ability to draw and profit from henry kissinger s intellectual and negotiating power but mr nixon himself was the great promoter of communist china , the government that has been trying to annihilate the existence and memory of buddhist tibet through invasion , occupation , mass murder , torture , imprisonment , deportation and eviction by chinese colonizers it was unbecoming of him to sermonize on neglected victims still , whatever may be going on elsewhere cannot be an excuse if bosnia is the holocaust again the serbs have behaved so badly that it sickens the heart to insist on the differences but it must be done , for without them there would be no decent course but for the west to go fully to war , ground troops and all in bosnia , the muslims declared a new nation they knew this was likely to bring war with those fellow bosnian slavs who were catholic or orthodox and who feared living under muslim sway the war is not theologybased but generations of religious differences did produce neighbors who had separate visions of the world , god , themselves and their future as in northern ireland , for instance into this civilethnicreligious war came military intervention for the bosnian serbs by serbia , and western political intervention for the muslims without which the new state could not have survived for their viciousness and broken ceasefires the serbs are paying in international respect , and are forfeiting consideration of their case but peace cannot be made without them , as they are parties to the war however unforgivably brutal , the war in bosnia is for control of government and territory in germany , the jews did not want to live apart , had no arms , declared no independence , asked for no land all the poor fools wanted was to live among germans , and breathe the germans did not make war against a jewish army or regime , or demands , for there were none they simply wanted to exterminate every jew , because he did breathe the holocaust was not a civil , ethnic or religious conflict but a methodical effort to annihilate every jew in every land peace was never possible because there were no sides there were just the gas chambers and those put to suffocation so , need it still really be said \? the holocaust was not a war of any kind it was a holocaust , you see
very soon now the fiction writers will be going out of business the strangeness of reality is so much more potent than the strangeness of the imagination , at least in new york politics the latest piece of evidence is the alliance announced recently between gov mario cuomo and david garth , who in past campaigns has worked against mr cuomo what do they see in each other \? several thoughts occur governor cuomo prides himself on wearing no person s or party s leash not even the democratic national convention can get him to run for something he does not desire mr garth on the other hand is famous for establishing psychological dominance over his candidates he made ed koch eat less he made rudy giuliani snarl less one wonders what his regimen for mr cuomo will be maybe he wants to achieve the political consultant s equivalent of climbing mount everest and make mr cuomo say less the two men do have a good deal in common each has achieved considerable success while clinging , sometimes bitterly , to an outsider selfimage neither likes to be differed with therefore journalism often disappoints them aside from the characterological similarities , their approaches seem very different mr cuomo has been loyal to one party , mr garth has switched back and forth mr cuomo started out with the politics of caring some garth candidates have preached the politics of embattlement mr cuomo s views have often been theologybased mr garth s tactics are sometimes angerbased perhaps it is best not to analyze this match too closely it is at the least a fortuitous diversion in a year when the governor s race itself looks none too bubbly if nothing else , the dispatches from the cuomo staff meetings could be riveting and there is money to be made in the office pools on how many days the partnership will last
around 5 pm in most american cities , the traffic generally flows one way workingclass people head home to the suburbs , where life is presumably safer , parking is abundant and diversions are plentiful which is fine , except for the disconcerting notion that without people , cities decay stores and restaurants close civic projects die empty streets loom dark and dangerous thanks to 15 years of urban revitalization , baltimore has not jeopardized the vast redevelopment that has seeded its downtown landscape with shopping pavilions , museums , a national aquarium , a light rail system , new hotels , scores of restaurants , refurbished housing and a baseball stadium a 160 million science research and educational center is under construction but somewhere along the way , downtown baltimore lost touch with baltimoreans redevelopment had made the city a tourist destination for others , but not necessarily a magnet for the locals beyond their initial curiosity to prevent this trend from getting worse , a civic group of public and private interests called the downtown partnership of baltimore is embarking on a largescale marketing effort , buoyed by an advertising campaign beginning next month that has enlisted nearly every major media outlet in the city in the name of civic pride and spirit , the three television network affiliates , the two independent channels , the largest radio stations , baltimore s dominant daily newspapers and several weeklies have agreed to provide free time and space to advertise the city for the city to the city jim dale , the chairman and chief executive of w b doner company , the advertising agency coordinating the campaign on a pro bono basis , said the free exposure could be worth 500 , 000 or more by agreement with the electronic outlets , for every spot paid for , the station will donate the same amount of time for another the baltimore sun , the city s principal newspaper , has agreed to provide news listings , two tabloid pullout sections and about 60 , 000 worth of advertising at a reduced rate they have done so much to rejuvenate the city , said mark distler , general sales manager for the nbc affiliate , wmartv the idea to promote the city , to get people to come down , was a nobrainer the advertising campaign is being built around a program host who will appear in a talk show format at places around town to extol their virtues the host , mark sarien , a 26yearold men s clothing salesman , won the job this week through an open audition that attracted hundreds of wouldbe commercial stars he has no experience as a television personality , but polish was not so much a requirement as enthusiasm and civicmindedness unabashed boosterism is central to the campaign if it all sounds a little hokey , maybe it is but an advertising campaign selling a city to the people who live there can be an effective tool against the kind of urban rot that undermines municipal efforts at a time that the federal government has left states and cities substantially on their own against violence , drug abuse and other civic ills other cities , including buffalo , philadelphia and indianapolis , have initiated similar programs , but have not received the kind of media support baltimore has generated new york city has 26 business improvement district organizations , with individual budgets and promotional approaches but none , said gretchen dykstra of the times square district , with a current campaign of 77 , 000 , has gotten free exposure to help the cause the notion of doing something like this is not particularly new , richard bradley , president of the international downtown association in washington , said , referring to baltimore s efforts what is significant is the level at which they have gotten support mr bradley said baltimore had stayed ahead of the curve among cities promoting themselves , largely because it had enough attractions to withstand questions of truth in advertising some cities , he said , advertise too much , people investigate and then go home disappointed , seldom to return several years ago , we were hearing increasing concerns from businesses about the downtown area , said laurie schwartz , president of the downtown partnership in baltimore our first step was to focus on safety that resulted in the city s hiring of 60 security personnel for the downtown area , paid for through a property tax surcharge , and it led to the second step , developing the promotional campaign with advertising support addressing those first concerns polished the city , ms schwartz said now it s time to sell the product photo mark sarien , right , auditioning to be the host of the downtown baltimore show , while bill mccuddy , the mc , acted as a guest the show will get free advertising spots to help promote the redeveloped downtown \( downtown partnership of baltimore , inc \)

to the editor the new york times hosts offtherecord sessions lunches , teas , coffees with public officials all the time new york times men and women regularly attend offtherecord briefings at such organizations as the council on foreign relations members of your washington bureau frequently go to dinner parties that are off the record so it seems hypocritical for the times to criticize journalists who agreed to offtherecord rules at the recent renaissance weekend in hilton head , sc \( do n't call it journalism , editorial , jan 4 \) i , for one , had no ethical problems attending few journalists would such sessions are rich with story ideas , fresh contacts , new perspectives and a greater understanding of a host of issues the times implies that the weekend was attended solely by a bunch of journalists and the president of the united states that is not the case the majority of participants at the weekend sessions were academics , scientists , business leaders , jurists , entertainers , homemakers and students the event works well because people feel free to speak candidly and to think aloud , without later discovering that some halfformed idea was newsworthy unless a news organization has a compulsion to record every word of every governmental official \( and i know of none that do \) , attending such a gathering as the renaissance weekend is hardly to be considered degrading or compromising joe treen senior editor , people new york , jan 6 , 1994
although advertised as a debate over the large proposition that the death penalty is a good thing , tonight s firing line setto concentrates instead on the narrower question of whether it is a fair thing as currently applied that is the accomplishment of bryan a stevenson and stephen b bright , members of the antideathpenalty team , who spend much of their offcamera time fighting capital punishment in the southern states that account for 90 percent of america s executions in georgia , mr stevenson says , if the defendant is black and the victim is white , you are 22 times more likely to get the death penalty mr bright speaks of legal lynchings they are abetted for these two hours by ira glasser , executive director of the american civil liberties union and a cardcarrying member of the firing line touring company , who asserts that the main determinants of death sentences are the race of the victim and the class of the perpetrator \( a dispute over the desirability of remedying that situation is now among the issues holding up the longpromised crime bill \) supporters of the death penalty william f buckley jr , master of firing line walter berns , author of for capital punishment crime and the morality of the death penalty \( university press of america \) , and edward i koch , once mayor of new york city , now general knowitall remove their jackets , perhaps to express their ordinaryjoe leanings , perhaps because the heat is on the fourth member of their team , susan v boleyn , a georgia assistant district attorney who has sent her share of malefactors to their deaths , keeps her jacket buttoned but would need a bulletproof vest to save her from statistics indicating that blacks are routinely kept off juries in her state s criminal courts this cadre holds that too few people are being executed these days and is particularly exasperated over an appeals process that keeps convicted murderers alive for years after sentencing mr berns says the solution to the evident racial disparity regarding victims is to execute more of the blacks who kill blacks he makes a plea for the benefits of retribution and even has a kind word to say for floggings since the standard deterrence argument is , by general consent , downplayed as inconclusive , the bernsbuckleykoch firm resorts to a higher authority mr buckley declares that the death penalty is the supreme sanction that validates the concern that we hold for human life mr koch announces , there are certain crimes that are so heinous , so egregious , so violent that your soul calls out for punishment of death leon botstein , the fourth member of the antiexecution team and the president of bard college , where the twohour debate was held , seems prepared to do battle on that elevated if misty plane when he declares that death by the hand of another is never justified , thereby setting himself apart from his allies , who seem only to want more whites on death row he does not , however , claim the backing of the bible or the soul all participants have their favorite anecdotes about miscarriages of justice innocent people being convicted , guilty people getting off lightly but the argument keeps coming back to the facts of life and death in what mr bright calls the deathbelt states of the south although the interchanges are spirited , after an hour or so repetition sets in the encounter might have benefited from a provocateur like george bernard shaw , who opposed every kind of punishment except the death penalty shaw advised putting up with people s vices until they give more trouble than they are worth , at which point we should , with many apologies and expressions of sympathy and some generosity in complying with their last wishes , place them in the lethal chamber and get rid of them no one on either side tonight dares be so flippant the best firing line offers by way of surprises is mr berns s hint that if life sentences without parole were guaranteed , he might not demand the death penalty , and mr glasser s hint that if trials could be made fairer , he might no longer oppose it for now , the longlived argument is in no danger of being put to rest firing line resolved the death penalty is a good thing pbs , tonight at 9 \( channels 13 and 49 in new york \) produced and directed by warren steibel muriel oxenberg murphy and george kahookele , associate producers firing line is a warren steibel production in association with south carolina etv from years past 'a streetcar named desire , ' three minutes racier elia kazan s on the waterfront was recently reissued in a 40thanniversary edition , and on wednesday , warner is to release a restored version of mr kazan s streetcar named desire , with three minutes of material cut by censors from the original film in 1951 here are some other kazan films on tape none are rated viva zapata !

hold on oh , my god , i 've found just one so far , said michael casserly , executive director of the council of great city schools mr casserly was scanning the list of the nation s 47 largest school districts , counting how many big city superintendents had been in their jobs more than three years this is sad , he said , one , one i see two two out of 47 ! there are many ways to measure the distressing state of large urban school districts , and one of the most visible is the extraordinary , accelerating turnover among the educators chosen to run them social problems worsen , government financing lags , and someone has to take the blame the superintendent is an unbelievable lightning rod for all matter of problems in the city , mr casserly said 'new york s stupidity' asked about the latest upheaval in the new york city school system , mr casserly laughed , though he did not sound happy i'm laughing at new york city s own stupidity in the way it treats its schools and children for in new york , where all the urban problems are played out on a grander scale , the nation s largest and most unwieldy publicschool system had nine superintendents in its first 70 years , and 12 in the past 24 years new york s first six superintendents served , on average , 10 years each its seven most recent chancellors , 14 months it does not seem to matter if they are homegrown or brought in from afar and portrayed as education heroes who will save the system of the last six , three came out of the new york city ranks , and three were hired from other large cities , including mr cortines , from san francisco the average urban superintendent now lasts two years , as against five for the rest of the country s school districts regardless of the merits of particular chancellors , their turnover itself is frightening , for it makes educational continuity nearly impossible when told friday about mr cortines s threat to resign , frank j macchiarola , who was chancellor from 1978 to 1983 , sounded genuinely disturbed this is not a good thing , he said he added , the job does not offer the kind of support that is necessary to get the job done schools' problems worsen mr macchiarola s fiveyear tenure was the longest in recent years , and he was rare , in that he left on his own , to general praise now , a decade later , he says , the schools' problems are much worse , making the chancellor s job that much harder i had a policy that kept weapons out of schools , he said if a student had weapons , he was suspended we dealt with it i was at city hall the other day , and a guard said to a school group , 'if you have knives , put them over on the side' half the kids went to the side and took out knives the teacher , too the teacher ! what s going on \? mr casserly said new york s archaic financing system for schools makes its problems even worse than in most cities the system is one of the few in the country that does not control its own finances instead , the mayor and city council control much of the school budget of the 15 , 000 school districts in the country , only a handful are not financially independent , said mr casserly along with new york , those include philadelphia , baltimore , boston , memphis and buffalo when budgets get tight , new york s schools are in competition with other social services for scarce dollars , he said power struggles between city hall and the superintendents are not new , of course , dating almost to the start of the unified school system in 1898 the second school superintendent , dr william l ettinger , was forced out of office in 1924 after a dispute with the mayor , john f hylan 'patronage has no place' a review of the situation at the time disclosed that dr ettinger had opposed the installation of furnace grates in city schools after it had been recommended by friends of the mayor and backed by tammany hall , the new york times reported in his 1945 obituary dr ettinger s stand was that political patronage had no place in the school system but in the last two decades , the cycle of disputes has sped up markedly , as the school system has been decentralized with the establishment of 32 separate school boards under one chancellor , and as the middle class has moved to the suburbs and poorer students have put more demands on the school system mayor rudolph w giuliani has attacked mr cortines as an outsider who does not know new york , suggesting he was not prepared for the enormity of the job and after the board of education voted out joseph c fernandez , the former dade county , fla , superintendent , last year , the search committee recommended candidates who were products of the new york city system at public meetings throughout the five boroughs , speakers repeatedly expressed a preference for someone who knew new york s problems firsthand , said mr macchiarola , a member of the committee this too , was not a new criticism in 1963 calvin e gross of pittsburgh became new york s first superintendent from outside the system two years later he was forced to resign amid complaints that he had never mastered new york s huge system the first chancellor in the newly decentralized system , harvey b scribner , the former vermont commissioner of education , was forced out after he failed to enlist the teachers , the bureaucracy and the schools for change new yorkers do no better and yet , of new york s three most recent homegrown chancellors bernard mecklowitz , nathan quinones and anthony j alvarado none lasted more than three years all left after bitter political disputes , though mr alvarado was also linked to a scandal involving his personal finances and mr quinones had a dispute with mayor edward i koch over the same schoolbudget director that mayor giuliani now wants dismissed , leonard hellenbrand mr casserly said that part of the reason for the turnover was political instead of providing bigcity school systems with the resources to tackle their problems , political leaders ask superintendents for miracles and then humiliate or dismiss them when none occur in the 17 years mr casserly has been with great city schools , the average tenure of a bigcity superintendent has been cut in half asked if he thought the trend would continue to worsen , he said , it ca n't get any worse photo chronology a job that got toughter through the years how long each chancellor \( or superintendent , before 1970 , when the schools were decentralized \) , served his position prior to taking the job , and reason for leaving

moscow , april 4 vladimir v zhirinovsky , the ultranationalist whose party stunned the world in december with its strength in russia s parliamentary elections , put on a show last weekend that gave some inkling of what he might do if he ever came to power the fifth congress of his liberal democratic party of russia , held in a meeting hall on moscow s outskirts , began with a lineup on stage of zhirinovsky s falcons , 18 young men in blue uniforms and black boots , some wearing dark glasses , all with side arms strapped to their waists then there was the introduction of guests , including a german neofascist , a delegation sent by president saddam hussein of iraq and a russian general recently freed from prison for his role in the uprising against president boris n yeltsin in october but the crowning moment came when the 343 delegates , with not a single dissenting voice , not even a whimper of debate , raised their pink party cards in unison and voted to make mr zhirinovsky their dictator , with full powers to control all party affairs , from finances to appointments , until april 2 , 2004 with the same vote , the delegates also agreed not to bother meeting again until 1997 one year after mr zhirinovsky , by his most conservative estimate , will have become president of russia , heading a oneparty government the leader and the party are one and the same , mr zhirinovsky said in his opening speech this regime is in its final agony and when a sick man is lying on the operating table , you need a single doctor , not a team of consultants he also took his first swipe , indirectly , at mr yeltsin , describing the 63yearold president as ailing and in need of early retirement there is no letup from the bombastic mr zhirinovsky , whose party turned russian politics upside down four months ago by winning a quarter of the votes in the parliamentary elections though his outburts have elicited guffaws or outrage here and abroad , they have also had an unmistakable effect on russian and international politics the yeltsin government has absorbed the zhirinovsky factor , notably in its foreign policy , which now puts considerable , and repeated , emphasis on the need to assert russia s greatpower status and on the interests of the 25 million ethnic russians living outside the country what is less clear is his success at building a solid base for future electoral campaigns his party did poorly in recent local elections , and polls continue to show that a majority of voters do not regard mr zhirinovsky as a serious contender for the presidency in a survey of 1 , 500 people by the russian center for public opinion and market research at the end of march , 63 percent said they did not trust mr zhirinovsky at all it was some kind of a splash , said gennadi e burbulis , a political strategist closely allied to the yeltsin camp , referring to the decemeber results three months were enough to realize that it is not going to bring any benefits to the country the boasts are big , the barbs farflung whatever his prospects , mr zhirinovksy s statements have become more outrageous , his boasting more grandiose and his targets more wide ranging yet the message is essentially unchanged he continues to preach russia s imperial imperative , milking national nostalgia for a greatpower status that evaporated with the collapse of the soviet union he has become a master at exploiting the wounded pride of russians who feel that the last decade has left them poorer , weaker and more humiliated than they ever were before zhirinovsky the last hope of a cheated and humiliated people read one of the handpainted signs on a wall at the house of tourists , where delegates this weekend said they saw nothing wrong with his move to assume dictatorial powers our party without zhirinovsky would not be a party , said anatoly bachich , 35 , a ship s engineer from kamchatka , russia s easternmost peninsula only a strong leader can save the situation in the country today if before mr zhirinovsky laid the blame for the country s sorry conditon at the door of the ruling democrats as russians refer to mr yeltsin and his team of postcommunist reformers he has now taken to attacking the west , the united states in particular , as the witting agents of russia s decline on saturday , he accused the western powers of launching their third attack against russia in this century it was all the same to them who ruled russia , czars or communists , he said their goal was to destroy russia but unlike the battering of the two world wars , he said , the country this time was being undermined by a peaceful invasion of pretty slogans about democracy and human rights and worse the americans are clever , he said they know it is better to come here with chewing gum , stockings and mcdonald s these lines got big applause from the delegates , who one hour later were to greet the strong antiamerican message from the iraqi delegation with equal enthusiasm still , themes fall in fertile soil
ever conscious that sex sells and trendiness titillates , magazines do not usually go out of their way to put aging men on their covers but this month , it was a race for the face of the man new york magazine called the sexiest \( 70yearold \) man alive he is none other than paul newman , whose new movie came out yesterday , on christmas day \( actually , mr newman will turn 70 next month \) he appeared on the covers of the dec 12 issue of new york , the dec 19 issue of newsweek and the december issue of gq entertainment weekly reluctantly dropped plans to run a jan 6 newman cover because everyone else seemed to have run him already the reason we put him on the cover was because our culture people came back from seeing nobody s fool and said this is an absolutely terrific movie , he is going to be nominated for an oscar and he is a great american icon , maynard parker , editor of newsweek , said did mr parker mind that mr newman had been on the cover of new york the week before \? i thought long and hard about it and i thought that the only people who would see both magazines were the hothouse new york media community , he said and that is so small a number that i did n't think it was a good enough reason to deprive the rest of our readers arthur cooper , editor in chief of gq , had planned jack nicholson for gq s december cover then , at the last minute , nicholson s new movie , the crossing guard , was postponed until spring , leaving mr cooper coverless he jumped at the opportunity to get mr newman , not caring that the two other magazines already had him but does paul newman sell \? kurt andersen , editor of new york , said that the final results were not in yet but that it appeared that 50 percent of the dec 12 newsstand copies were sold an unusually high percentage for any magazine average weekly sales for new york are in the low 40 percent , he said postscript despite his enormous appeal , paul newman actually ended up in second place this month , as far as coverselling oldsters go pope john paul ii , 74 , walked away with the honors having appeared on the dec 11 cover of the new york times magazine \( with a circulation of 17 million \) and on the dec 26 cover of the man of the year issue of time magazine \( 42 million circulation \) , the pope reached far more readers than mr newman did all in all , it was a great month for septuagenarians and nearseptuagenarians news weeklies double up time and newsweek each broke a longstanding practice this year and came out with their first double yearend issues a third news weekly , us news world report , has been running yearend double issues since 1976 the cover date on time is dec 26 , 1994 jan 2 , 1995 newsweek wisely has no date on its cover since virtually everybody knows cover dates do n't mean much both time and newsweek actually appear on newsstands the week before their dates many weekly magazines , including entertainment weekly and the new yorker , run yearend double issues , enabling them to save production costs and give the staff a week off generally speaking , advertisers love any kind of special issue and magazines can sell more ad pages in a double issue than in two issues combined since the double issues of time and newsweek came out before christmas , they were particularly attractive to advertisers seeking to snag lastminute shoppers time was also able to capitalize on its double issue because it carried its man of the year profile buzz widens its net what would make a local magazine with a circulation of not quite 75 , 000 think it might be able to lure enough readers across the country to justify national distribution \? fouryearold buzz calls itself the talk of los angeles \( maybe a slight exaggeration , given the size of its circulation , but never mind \) being a true chauvinist , buzz believes that the city of angels and articles about its culture , life style and mindset have enough of an aura to warrant being a national magazine response to directmail tests supports this belief , susan gates , the publisher , said as a result , buzz plans to increase its circulation to 125 , 000 and step up its subscription efforts and newsstand presence in new york and other big cities ms gates added that the small circulation posed no problem in attracting advertisers from the very start , she said , our strategy has been to offer an extremely targeted , topdemographic readership to upscale national advertisers advertisers like these certainly find much of the nonprint media too broad for their message and interestingly , some of them even feel that the traditionally 'upscale' magazines offer a broader reach than they need buzz , whose subscribers have a median household income of 74 , 700 higher than that for new york or vanity fair runs ads by bulgari , louis vuitton , bmw and giorgio armani buzz is also starting buzz books , a publishing venture with st martin s press it plans to publish six to eight fiction and nonfiction titles a year , focusing on the culture of southern california , beginning next year drawing
washington , july 14 with four days left before they were to present a plan to overhaul the welfare system , president clinton s aides faced a painful question they were about to propose the strictest work requirements in welfare history , but were they really ready to cut off every penny to mothers who did not comply \? at a daylong meeting on saturday , feb 26 , andrew m cuomo , an assistant secretary of housing and urban development , warned that the very poor led chaotic lives and that failures would be frequent ending , rather than decreasing , payments would leave women and children on the streets then what do we do \? he asked watch them wither and die \? but others stressed the need for dramatic change in a system that is almost universally reviled they argued that only a nowork , nopay plan would offer the dignity of a real paycheck and they said that only a bold break with the past would satisfy the president s famous pledge not to reduce but to end welfare as we know it gene sperling , a white house economics aide , summed up the group s decision this , he said , has to be one of the things that defines us the debate illustrates the political forces that mr clinton s welfare pledge has set into motion , and the stakes for 143 million of the poorest americans , most of them women and children in three years , the promise to end welfare as we know it has grown from a snippet of campaign rhetoric , crafted by a volunteer one saturday night , into a driving force in social policy that journey entered a new stage this week as congress began debate on the 431page bill that president clinton unveiled last month , with all sides promising sweeping change the story of how the administration arrived at that bill , pieced together from scores of interviews and internal documents , shows how politics and personalities intersected with academic theories and the realities of grinding poverty along the way , the idea at the heart of mr clinton s plan , a twoyear limit on benefits , underwent a telling change the idea was originally part of a much broader plan that , through services and cash supplements , would have lifted virtually all single mothers from poverty but mr clinton s proposal , while ambitious , makes no such promise he hopes that the time limits , combined with billions of dollars in new training , work , childcare and taxcredit programs , will move recipients into private jobs but he also offered a caution let us be honest , he said none of this will be easy to accomplish throughout the process , mr clinton has struggled to keep pace with the expectations produced by his own , insistently bold rhetoric as a candidate , for example , he rejected a complete cutoff for the noncompliant , saying in a 1992 interview he did not want to punish the kids for the mistakes of their parents but as president he has embraced a set of escalating penalties that culminate in the denial of all cash to mothers who refuse to work as far as mr clinton has moved , the political climate may have moved even further it is his odd fate to propose the toughest work plan of any president , only to have most republican denounce the measure as timid fearful , perhaps , of ceding him the issue , some republicans now want to go further , beyond work requirements to completely abolishing aid to some mothers noting the stakes for indigent families , david t ellwood , one of the plan s main architects , recently took stock of the forces at play this , he said , is the scariest thing i 've ever done in my life the pledge a concrete call for time limits the pledge took shape in october 1991 , after a phone call to the pollsters bruce reed , the volunteer drafting the first major policy speech of mr clinton s campaign , ran the welfare section past the political advisers , who agreed that the issue would sell with voters the welfare system was in genuine crisis after remaining stable for two decades , the welfare rolls had grown by 25 percent in the recent recession , and the percentage of children born to single mothers was at a record high studies showed that as many as threefourths of all black children would spend a year on welfare before reaching adulthood at the same time , the system offered less and less to those it was meant to support states had let cash benefits erode so severely that some welfare families , no longer able to pay rent , were finding themselves in homeless shelters while president george bush had scarcely mentioned welfare , mr clinton had a record to run on he had run experimental programs in arkansas for a decade , and played a prominent role in convincing congress to pass a 1988 law that requires some recipients to seek training in his announcement speech a month earlier , mr clinton had offered a vague promise to move people off welfare and onto work rolls , but his advisers now wanted something catchier they said we should have concrete calls to make sure that people paid attention , mr reed said and i suggested that we could call for 'an end to permanent welfare '
cobleskill , ny for 40 years , the volunteers of the women s auxiliary of the schoharie county memorial hospital ran the hospital coffee shop they divided themselves into 30 chapters named for gemstones sapphire for the methodist church women , crystal for teachers , diamond for the wives of doctors and lawyers together , they kept the restaurant open six days a week , ran bake sales and antique shows in their spare time and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the town s 70bed pride and joy i made an awful lot of egg salad sandwiches in my day , said vesta hauser , a sapphire and at one point the auxiliary s president but neither love nor hard work could preserve the independence of schoharie memorial in this village of about 5 , 000 people 35 miles west of albany bankrupt and with most of its patients gone , schoharie like many other struggling hospitals in cities and villages across new york , new jersey and connecticut faced the choice last spring of closing down or seeking protection in a merger with a stronger institution these mergers are intended to capture every medical insurance dollar , from infant inoculations to openheart surgery , within a single , efficient system in july , schoharie memorial joined the wave and became bassett hospital of schoharie county in the merger , the hospital s total beds were cut in half , to 35 , and its intensive care unit was eliminated now , the little hospital has become one link in a growing chain of 14 medical clinics , 2 small hospitals and 1 flagship medical center that has been assembled over the past decade by bassett healthcare of cooperstown , ny for mrs hauser and many others here , a pareddown hospital is better than none at all some people still worry about losing their autonomy to bassett , she said , but as long as we still have a hospital , i do n't think people care how it is organized schoharie memorial s experience is being repeated throughout the region as hospitals abandon decades of independence and join networks like bassett they are responding to changes in the health care industry that have put more emphasis on shorter hospital stays , more outpatient treatment and ruthless restraints on insurer payments the new medical empire builders working the small towns are n't talking egg salad sandwiches , they 're talking modern warfare we have to protect our perimeter , theodore brinkman , a board member at bassett of schoharie , said of the hospital s efforts to install rural practitioners loyal to bassett in surrounding towns dr william f streck , president of bassett healthcare , talks of capturing the patient , and the doctors who work at these hospitals speak of getting the patient draw and it is not just bassett the new lingo is 'locking in covered lives , ' said john remillard , president of a o fox memorial hospital , which is 35 miles from here in oneonta , and a bassett competitor with its own burgeoning network of outpatient feeder clinics yet for all the battlefield jargon , these hospitals involved are nonprofit operations competing not for investor dividends but for survival in an era of declining hospital use and shuttered hospitals new york state has lost 30 hospitals outright in the last decade many have been converted to nursing homes , and a dozen more have merged into protective alliances , according to the healthcare association of new york state , which until last january was called the hospital association of new york state as hospital membership declined and medical care became less centralized both elements driving the networking trend the association changed its name to reflect the growing roles of nursing homes , homecare operations , hospices and health networks in westchester and putnam counties , meanwhile , seven hospitals , including lawrence , south memorial and butterfielddobbs ferry have unified to become excelcare systems in the utica area in central upstate new york , st luke s , st elizabeth s and faxton hospital have joined to become community health care management ten hospitals in nassau and queens have become preferred health network , and in ulster county , kingston , benedictine and ellenville community hospitals have unified their corporate structure and medical staffs new jersey has seen more hospital mergers in the last 12 months than in the previous 12 years , said gary carter , president of the new jersey hospitals association mr carter said he expected new jersey to lose 30 of it 112 hospitals before the shakeout is complete people just do n't spend as much time in hospitals as they used to , mr carter said procedures that used to require a 10day hospital stay now take five , and operations like cataract surgery that required several days' stay we do on an outpatient basis the joke in california is that pretty soon we 'll have drivethrough delivery service the scramble to dominate can become ruthless schoharie memorial was tipped over the edge into bankruptcy and into the arms of the bassett chain when doctors at the local bassettowned outpatient clinic suddenly stopped sending patients to the struggling independent hospital , mr brinkman , the board member , said he said that the feeling in town was that bassett was softening up the struggling hospital for the kill dr streck of bassett explained it differently , saying the bassett clinic s medical staff was depleted by resignations and there was no game plan to hurt the small independent hospital
when richard m nixon was elected president in 1968 , there was general pleasure on wall street according to the prevailing wisdom of the time , his election marked a return to traditional economic policies and good news for the stock market it was , as it happens , another case of wall street crystal balls showing only what the seers were wishing for mr nixon , whose funeral is today , wound up being the first president since herbert hoover , and only the third president of the 20th century , to have the dow jones industrial average decline over his term of office while many of the remembrances of mr nixon have focused on the surprise of an anticommunist warrior opening relations with china , there has been less emphasis on his most surprising economic initiative , perhaps because it proved much less successful but it is equally true that only mr nixon could have imposed wage and price controls , as he did in 1971 , when the inflation rate was above 4 percent a year then deemed unconscionably high that decision was immensely popular on wall street , and the dow leaped 38 percent the first trading day after the announcement the equivalent of a 140point move at today s dow level but it was a serious mistake on a longerterm basis , especially when combined with an accommodating federal reserve monetary policy as the 1972 election approached instead of dealing with monetary causes of inflation , or with the profligate use of energy that was making the country vulnerable to an oil price shock , the government set up a bureaucracy that ended up ruling on such vital issues as whether a new hampshire county fair violated the law when it raised admission prices by 25 cents \( the ruling was that it did \) mr nixon himself noted this in his memoirs the aug 15 , 1971 , decision to impose them , mr nixon wrote of the price controls , was politically necessary and immensely popular in the short run but in the long run i believe it was wrong the piper must be paid , and there was an unquestionably high price for tampering with the orthodox economic mechanisms but none of that was clear at first it was a week after mr nixon was reelected in 1972 that the dow first closed over 1 , 000 , and in early 1973 the dow hit a peak of 1 , 05170 , a high mark that was destined to last for a decade it was the upward spiraling of oil prices , which followed the arab oil boycott prompted by the 1973 arabisraeli war , that caused the recession and the worst bear market of the last half century it was during that bear market that mr nixon resigned the dow , at 93554 when he was inaugurated for his first term , had fallen to 78489 by the time he quit a few months later , it was to bottom at 57760 , a decline of 45 percent from the peak reached less than two years earlier presidents like to take credit for bull markets during their administrations , while distancing themselves from bear markets , but , as was noted by robert farrell , the chief market analyst for merrill lynch during and after the nixon administration , in truth they often have very little to do with what happens to the markets in their administrations mr nixon was elected near the end of a 20year bull market , which had taken stock prices from undervalued to greatly overvalued and brought on great speculative excesses , mr farrell noted the bear market that followed might have been less severe had mr nixon done a better job on inflation , or had investors been less depressed by the specter of a collapsing presidency , but it would have occurred in any case there is a tradition of closing the stock market for presidential funerals , but this one is different in one way every president who died after 1930 , save one , prompted the new york stock exchange to take a full day off but herbert hoover s death in 1964 , like that of william howard taft in 1930 , led only to the exchange closing early rather than taking a full day of mourning the taft , hoover and nixon administrations were the only ones since the dow jones industrial average was invented in 1897 that resulted in a dow drop thus mr nixon becomes the first bear market president to be honored by a full exchange holiday graph the dow s election results shows the compound annual rate of change in the dow jones industrial average , by president

a film that recalls perhaps the deadliest day in advertising is renewing the debate over the blurring of the line between fact and fiction when actual events are dramatized for entertainment purposes the dispute centers on white mile , a movie about a rafting trip that claimed the lives of five marketing and agency executives it was made for the hbo cable television network and will have its initial showing at 8 pm , eastern and pacific times , tomorrow , then be repeated six times through june 11 a preview of the wilderness adventure cum courtroom drama , a sort of deliverance meets the verdict , showed it to be a morality play that explores , earnestly though melodramatically , issues like personal responsibility versus personal ambition and whether executives pay a price for seeking to win at any cost advertisements for white mile hyperbolically describe it as based on the true story of how the pressure to succeed turned a company trip into tragedy headlines over a photograph of the cast , which includes alan alda , peter gallagher and robert loggia , ask will not taking this trip cost them their jobs \? will taking it cost them their lives \? those who recall the actual accident on which the film is based are wincing at those words on aug 1 , 1987 , 5 of 11 men on a whitewater rafting trip organized by the chicago office of ddb needham worldwide died the title comes from the site of the mishap , a rugged , rockstrewn stretch of the chilko river in the british columbia wilderness the dead were robert goldstein , vice president of advertising for the procter gamble company richard t o 'reilly , national director of the partnership for a drugfree america two senior vice presidents of ddb needham chicago , and a retired executive of that agency the survivors included michael miles , then the president and chief executive of kraft inc and now the chairman and chief executive of kraft s parent , the philip morris companies barry holt , a spokesman for philip morris in new york , said that mr miles is not willing to comment on the film but two other survivors were more forthcoming the characters were not the people i was on the trip with , said joseph f morrison , who was then an executive vice president with mattel inc and is now president of the morrison entertainment group in manhattan beach , calif mr morrison , in a telephone interview , took particular exception to suggestions in white mile that the participants , tossed into the rapids when their inflatable raft hit a rock , were pressured into the excursion there was absolutely no coercion whatsoever , he said mr morrison also challenged the character of the agency president , portrayed by mr alda in a star turn that combines elements of richard nixon , michael douglas as gordon gekko in wall street and david clennon , the scheming adman miles drentell in the series thirtysomething mr alda s character , named dan cutler , is a paradigm of macho posturing who slyly orchestrates a dangerous malebonding ritual intended , in part , to keep a client from placing his account , with billings of 20 million , in review in real life , the agency president was named al wolfe , then president of the united states division of ddb needham worldwide and a member of the agency board and executive committee he retired a year after the accident none of the motives they attributed to al wolfe were those of the al wolfe i know , mr morrison said , and i 've known him for years mr wolfe , in a separate interview , said the movie is an absolute farce no one was manipulated no one was misled it puts me in a totally false light , he added it s a fabrication of character with everyone who was involved mr morrison also scorned the elements of white mile that excoriated the 1980 s it was not about the 80 s , he said it was not about morality maybe , he added , it was about wearing safety helmets that , however , is a lesson more likely to be imparted by a 30second public service announcement , not a 97minute film with a budget of almost 7 million there s a 'cautionary tale' aspect to this movie that excites me , said dick berg , an executive producer of white mile who has also produced factbased films about raoul wallenberg and the vietnam war it has become a cliche that men and women will kill to advance themselves careerwise , he added this says that under conditions of excessive pressure , people will even kill themselves while the film does have its genesis in a real event , mr berg said , 'white mile' is a work of fiction for instance , the character played by mr gallagher , an executive who survives the accident , is a protagonist contrived out of whole cloth what excited us was not the specificity of the individuals involved , he added , but the rare opportunity to do a movie that is as visual as this that has something on its mind bob cooper , senior vice president with hbo pictures in los angeles , which produced white mile , said , you make choices and you live with those choices rather than make a number of sanitized movies that do n't touch on anything , he added , we 've decided to look at stories that have a real , true basis , but are not like amy fisher or rape stories by their nature , such dramas , like barbarians at the gate , and the band played on citizen cohn and white mile , raise problems you try to be accurate , mr cooper said , but you always have to take some license
philip marlowe might have spared john sculley a few lawsuits and one big headache just some basic sleuthing should have turned up the problems that mr sculley says were concealed by spectrum information technologies when he took the job as its chairman last fall and that led him to quit two weeks ago monday morning quarterbacks are still wondering how such a seasoned businessman could have neglected the basic due diligence homework but what happened to mr sculley could happen to any executive as more managers leave big corporations , small companies are stepping up recruiting and anyone could be taken in , whether by trickery , the ups and downs of young companies or plain old entrepreneurial optimism how can a job candidate know \? for some , extra legwork on their part or by industry or investment experts can help others , with more at stake , might hire private business investigators when craig a conway , 39 , left his job as senior vice president of sales and marketing at the oracle corporation to find a chief executive position , he thought he knew how to evaluate offers after a technology company recruited him , he reviewed the industry , interviewed people at the company , met with the board , then looked over the financial statements he took the job last may within one day , i learned the company was out of cash , could n't make payroll and was basically a breath away from bankruptcy , he said none of that had been disclosed in interviewing the company has avoided bankruptcy , but he quit after seven days mr conway then took a different approach he talked to customers and competitors and went over the financial statements in detail last november , he became the chief executive of tgv inc , a software company there were no surprises , he said sorting out the numbers of a new venture is the crucial first step , said andrew j sherman , a lawyer for silver , freedman taft in washington , which specializes in growing companies , and candidates should look at the figures as if they were investors candidates for the highest jobs can ask to see the numbers of a young company just say , 'i hope you do n't mind , but i'm not a financial guy i 'd like my financial guy to look at these numbers , ' said martin h bauman , president of martin h bauman associates , a firm in new york that places executives in venture capital businesses even publicly held companies can harbor real problems vincent parco , chief investigator of intercontinental investigation in new york , helped an executive being courted by crazy eddie , the discount electronics chain the retailer was already known to have problems and the executive had heard other rumors that made him nervous mr parco turned up information on the dealings of the company , which has since collapsed mr parco said his client avoided a lot of heartache by not going to that company technology poses special problems people who are n't sophisticated about small companies can fall in love with the ideas , said burt alimansky , managing director of alimansky capital group , an investment banking company in new york i 've seen investors , managers and venture capitalists get all charged up about their vision of what a product can be and lose total sight of the downside risk that may be what happened to mr sculley while he was not available for comment , his lawyers reportedly concentrated on verifying spectrum s patents now mr sculley is suing spectrum s president , peter caserta , saying an investigation by the securities and exchange commission and aggressive accounting were concealed spectrum is suing mr sculley , saying he knew all along a check of the people at a company is also important when steven b silk , 40 , a harvard business school graduate with credentials from general foods and lea perrins , was recruited in 1988 to be ceo of a small , hospitalbased liquiddiet program , he believed he would run the company in reality , they did n't have any desire to relinquish autonomy , he said in 1990 , mr silk jumped at an offer to be president and chief executive of the estee corporation in parsippany , nj , a maker of foods for diabetics today , mr silk says , he would have investigated the board members at the diet program much more carefully in the beginning , everybody s talking optimistically , and we 're all going to make 3 , 5 , 10 million each , he said it s so important to divorce yourself from all that optimism who needs a private investigator \? it s probably smart for almost any employee at a professional level to investigate a company before signing up , said ernest brod , executive managing director of kroll associates , a new york business investigation firm whether that means hiring an investigator depends on the stakes for someone like sculley , throwing 10 , 000 into an investigation would have been nothing , said charles calhoun , whose calhoun associates in westport , conn , specializes in forensic accounting fraud detection and prevention hiring a private investigator requires some shopping mr parco s investigations cost 1 , 000 to 10 , 000 at kroll , the estimate is 5 , 000 to 15 , 000 to find an investigator , start with a lawyer , said sue grafton , author of the mystery series featuring kinsey millhone , private eye lawyers wo n't use someone more than once if they 're not good witnesses or if , in fact , they 're shoddy workers , she said executives should not feel paranoid about snooping on a prospective employer there is a danger of getting suckered by people at a company who will say what they think the candidate wants to hear we 'd like to believe that there s money to be made , that our judgment and experience is valued , ms grafton said , and when someone comes along and promises us profit and prestige , it s always tempting to take that at face value drawing
washington , april 30 the sierra club , one of the nation s most prominent environmental organizations , is being torn by dissension over legislation that would protect millions of acres of montana s untouched back country but would leave millions of acres more open to logging and other development the club s leaders have guardedly endorsed the proposal , but a significant number of members have criticized the action , accusing the leadership of going too far to compromise in response , the leadership calls the dissidents idealists we have all been having a lot of disagreement over the question , will the real sierra club please stand up \? said margaret hays young , the conservation chairwoman of the club s new york city branch and the wildlife and wilderness chairwoman of its atlantic chapter she is among those who oppose the montana bill on the ground that it would allow logging in pristine , roadless forests but sherm janke , chairman of the club s montana chapter , whose executive committee voted by a narrow margin to support the national leadership , said that to ask that question makes us look like fools mr janke went on we ca n't police ourselves and we ca n't keep our act together , and we look very poorly , at least in the eyes of congress and that is a really high price to pay for this fundamentalism facing a dilemma the dispute exemplifies the kind of dilemma faced by environmental groups during the clinton administration as the avowedly proenvironment administration gropes for new environmental policies founded on consensus , the halfmillionmember sierra club and its allies are having trouble deciding how much to demand of government the sierra club has always been remarkable among large advocacy groups for running itself as a participatory democracy with strong local roots that has also made it among the least likely of environmental groups to accept political compromise for example , it was among those that stubbornly opposed the administration s successful drive to put in place the north american free trade agreement , which many other environmental groups supported the sierra club s committee on public lands did engage in intensive lobbying that resulted in changes to the montana bill before deciding last month that while the bill was imperfect , it was better than none at all scornful dissidents then publicly accused the club s national leaders of putting politics before principle the club s management responded by prohibiting local sierra club leaders from advertising their opposition to the bill , an edict they have flouted , and by warning them to stop using the club s internal electronic mail system to stir up opposition to the bill among the club s most active members some want stronger stand but now , the dissidents in the club say the organization is not taking a strong enough stand against logging and other development in the northern rockies and elsewhere aside from opposing the montana wilderness bill , which has been approved by committees in the house and is awaiting house action , they also recently tried to pass a ballot resolution calling for a total ban on logging on public lands this debate , as well , turned into a nasty split among factions arguing over the club s procedures as well as its policies the dispute over the montana wilderness might not have drawn much public attention had the dissidents not escalated it by posting their objections electronically over the internet computer network , which many environmentalists use to communicate and conduct research other environmental organizations , less well known than the sierra club , have also split over the legislation for example , the greater yellowstone coalition and the montana wilderness association support the bill , but the native forest council and the alliance for the wild rockies reject it some land protected the national forests of montana contain about six million acres without roads the bill would protect more than two million acres , but would leave the rest available for logging , including about a million acres where logging plans have already been prepared by the united states forest service melanie griffin , a sierra club lobbyist in washington , said that if nothing was done to protect the land , developers would continue to encroach on it she cited permit applications by two energy companies to drill for oil and gas near glacier national park , in an area known as badgertwo medicine that the legislation would protect ms griffin and other sierra club staff members said that in approving the legislation , which is sponsored by representative pat williams , a montana democrat , house committees had deleted provisions that were opposed by the sierra club because they would have reduced conservation groups' rights to appeal logging decisions our view is that it is inadequate , but worth passing , said carl pope , the club s executive director 'multiple abuse' but many of the club s local leaders in montana continue to vigorously oppose it as far as i am concerned , the intent of the bill is to release these lands to multiple use , or multiple abuse , as we call it , complained brooks martin , the chairman of the club s headwaters group , one of five groups that make up the montana chapter the sierra club used to oppose bad legislation , not just acquiesce , he said i think that was a good policy then and is a good one now the bill s opponents want to hold out for a broader wilderness bill affecting five states in the northern rocky mountains the sierra club , adopting a twotrack strategy , supports that legislation as well as the montana bill politicians say the broader rockies bill has little chance of passing soon in a decade or so , you might get it done , said representative bruce f vento , the minnesota democrat who heads the house natural resources committee s subcommittee on forests and public lands asked what advice he would give environmentalists who oppose the montana bill , mr vento answered , get real dissent , via computer after the club s leadership endorsed the bill in march , 12 prominent members used the club s computerized mail system to widely distribute a long message castigating the club s leadership the message cited the sierra club s formal policy , adopted by the board last november , of opposing all logging in remaining oldgrowth forests or roadless areas all sierra club entities have a duty and responsibility to aggressively oppose the montana logging bill , which is the antithesis of sierra club forest policy and is an affront to the purposes for which john muir founded the sierra club , said the memorandum , which was signed by david brower , a former executive director brooks martin and woody beardsley , who head the two most active local montana branches of the club , and by several other club leaders , including laura hoehn , a newly elected member of the board ms hoehn said the board might reconsider the montana matter when it meets on may 6 and 7 the decision making entities within the club are not necessarily representing the full spectrum of opinion on the issues , said ms hoehn , a montanan who ran as a dark horse , and who opposes the wilderness bill i hope people will feel more in touch with the leadership if they feel they are being heard
in an innovative managerial arrangement , the american symphony orchestra has taken the chamber orchestra concordia under its wing concordia , founded 10 years ago by marin alsop to explore american music , particularly concert music with jazz influences , will retain its own board of trustees , keep its own books and pursue its own artistic goals but the american symphony orchestra will oversee the presentation of its concerts , as well as its marketing and fund raising what we 're trying to do , explained eugene carr , the executive director of the american symphony , is to create a new way to manage the arts by combining resources it seem ridiculous that if you have a dozen organizations , each producing a small number of events every year , you also have a dozen executive directors , a dozen office leases , a dozen marketing departments none of the organizations can really afford to engage as much staff as it needs concordia presents only four concerts a year the american symphony orchestra presents six programs but is also in residence at the bard music festival , has a chamber series and tours combining the two organizations allows for what mr carr called an economy of scale concordia will pay the american symphony a fee for its management services for the next three years , but the arrangement should represent a saving of 40 percent in administrative costs for the orchestra what the american symphony gets out of the relationship , in addition to the management fee , is a slightly expanded staff , which will work for both orchestras collaborative projects are also under discussion everybody is looking for ways to cut overhead these days , mr carr said we think the way to do that is to work more efficiently the american symphony and concordia are two different kinds of ensembles but producing concerts , marketing , dealing with boards and raising money are similar from one organization to the next by streamlining all these support functions , we are able to show foundations that more of the grant money they give us actually goes toward artistic programs , not toward light bulbs and rent americans in bucharest contemporary american music has not had much of a presence in romanian concert halls , but the composer tobias picker and the conductors sergiu comissiona and cristian mandeal , with sponsorship from the united states embassy and delta airlines , plan to remedy that with a weeklong festival starting on sunday at the atheneum in bucharest music by few dozen american composers , representing virtually every contemporary style , will be performed in the festival , which will include three concerts by mr mandeal s orchestra , the george enescu philharmonic , and two concerts of chamber and vocal works among the composers whose works are scheduled are john adams , leonard bernstein , samuel barber , elliott carter , david diamond , conlon nancarrow , aaron copland , michael daugherty , ned rorem , jacob druckman , george gershwin , joan tower , william schuman , paul schoenfield and mr picker works by warren davidson and regina keane will have their world premieres romania has a great musical tradition , mr picker said , but they 've hardly heard any american music , and with the exception of copland and bernstein , they do n't even know the names of american composers mr picker , who is leaving for bucharest on sept 4 to oversee the final preparations , is taking the pianist ursula oppens and the violinist robert mcduffie , both wellknown interpreters of american works mr picker began thinking about presenting american music in bucharest two years ago he had been the composer in residence at the houston symphony , where mr comissiona was the director he proposed the idea of a festival to mr comissiona , who is romanian mr comissiona made the connection with mr mandeal and his ensemble when i was composer in residence in houston , mr picker said , i spent my time bringing american music to americans and even then , i thought that the next logical step would be to export our music , to bring it to countries that have a western musical tradition , but for whom our music would be completely new the concerts are to be recorded by the romanian composers union , and there is talk of a highlights cd , although mr picker was not sure whether it would be released in the united

the speech was delivered in indianapolis without a lot of flamboyant rhetoric it spoke the truth , unadorned , without crude appeals to prejudice it was courageous , intelligent and important hugh p price , the new president of the national urban league , said it was time for a new and more realistic approach to the problems plaguing africanamericans he warned we must not let ourselves , and especially our children , fall into the paranoid trap of thinking that racism accounts for all that plagues us the global realignment of work and wealth is , if anything , the bigger culprit in the overheated , oppressive , fingerpointing atmosphere in which much of our racial discourse is conducted , mr price s speech was a welcome breeze he was direct and unapologetic in his opposition to racism of any kind and to the fantasy of black separatism belief in racial inclusion goes to the marrow of my bones , he said i fully understand the instinct to separate when we are incessantly under economic siege , when we 're still discriminated against some 40 years after the brown decision , and when , thanks to those recurring images on evening newscasts of black youngsters being hauled off to jail , even our honor students are trailed like common thieves when they enter stores even so , it s suicidal economically to become so bitter that we isolate ourselves from others mr price s speech , the keynote address to the urban league s national convention , was the latest acknowledgment that the role of traditional civil rights organizations has changed like the naacp , the primary focus of the urban league is on finding remedies to the desperate situation facing poor blacks in america s inner cities but the naacp has alienated many of its traditional supporters by embracing louis farrakhan and others whose messages have been divisive at best , and at worst blatantly racist and antisemitic mr price was clear on the direction the urban league would take under his leadership he said many whites of good will have accompanied us on our long journey for racial , social and economic justice none has matched the jewish community as longdistance runners in the civil rights movement just as we denounce misleading media stereotypes of africanamericans , it is morally repugnant as well to impugn an entire people , especially longstanding allies , like jews , because of the unconscionable behavior of some of them the essence of mr price s speech was his recognition that the catastrophic circumstances enveloping so many africanamericans are in large part the result of changed economic conditions that are having a devastating effect on many whites as well blacks , with the least in the way of resources , are being hammered worst but no ethnic group has been spared long gone are the days when the local manufacturing plant was the gateway to the middle class the new world of employment is one that is steadily buffeted by technological innovation , radical corporate downsizing and the wholesale transfer of lowskilled jobs to lowwage workers overseas said mr price this ruthlessly competitive world waits for no nation , no ethnic group and no individual no substantial improvement in the condition of africanamericans in general and innercity residents in particular can be achieved without a heroic effort to cope with these complex economic forces that will require sophisticated leadership , unrelenting hard work , intellectual rigor and a firm commitment to reality the belief that all evil is the result of the white man is worse than not helpful , it s monumentally destructive hugh price is one of many africanamericans throughout the country who have long since rolled up their sleeves and gone to work in a serious way on what has become a hideous array of social and economic problems they have the talent and the will to succeed but not nearly enough support needless to say , they do n't get the same attention as jewbaiters and celebrities in handcuffs but they are the true leaders they are the ones who will make things better for future generations
i am afraid the recent article on tax financing of parochial schools dwelt on details of school tuitions and attendance and ignored the broader dangers of forcing citizens to support parochial schools against their wills and religious convictions many deeply religious americans , catholics included , are greatly disturbed by the push to obtain public tax funds for new jersey parochial schools it is wrong to demand tax financing for parochial schools when there is now tax exemption for the same schools involuntary tax financing for parochial schools that are contrary to the religion of millions of other americans will polarize the community along religious lines it will endanger the tolerance and religious peace we have enjoyed in america for over 200 years religion is taught in the churches and sunday schools , in absolute freedom that is what they are for the public school system , which has helped make america the greatest nation on earth , bar none , will be destroyed in time the public simply cannot support multiple highquality school systems the average citizen just ca n't pay his regular taxes and support his church and support someone else s church , against his will let s be very clear and honest about it this radical plan means stupendous new taxes if the idea is such a panacea , and people are so supposedly for it , put it on a statewide ballot if the people vote yes , fine if they vote no , forget it and this is a lay , nonteacher citizen talking john tomasin west new york

washington , march 20 heeding complaints from several major medical schools and teaching hospitals that their precarious financial futures would become even worse under the proposed health care overhaul , president clinton agreed last week to support revisions that would provide more money for them in a meeting on monday in boston , mr clinton also pleased representatives from academic health centers by promising a slower pace of change doctors who were present said they were impressed with his understanding of the predicament they face that they are already losing patients to other institutions that can offer lower prices because they do not have the extra costs of teaching and research and that those losses threaten the future of medical education more federal money would allow them to cut their rates and compete for business , they said first signs of support politics was clearly an element , too seeking expert witnesses who can help persuade the public that his plan would mean better health care for the nation , the president urged the doctors to voice their support no deal has been struck in fact , few doctors or administrators in the academic world , except those who met with mr clinton , are aware of the president s position and the backing it has in crucial senate committees but mr clinton got the first installment on the support he sought when the meeting ended and dr mitchell rabkin , head of boston s beth israel hospital and the group s designated spokesman , emerged to say , the consensus is the president s bill is a winner since mr clinton s health plan was first proposed last september , the academic institutions had complained that provisions intended to correct academic medicine s difficulties were inadequate they also said his goal of producing more primary care physicians and fewer specialists was too rigid and could cause them to lose their outofstate patients the medical leaders have two principal spokesmen in the senate , and mr clinton has met with both and made his shift clear in boston he met not only with the doctors but also with senator edward m kennedy , the massachusetts democrat who heads the senate labor and human resources committee in washington on thursday , he met with senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york , the chairman of the senate finance committee their panels are handling health legislation in the senate the chairmen said in interviews that their committees , regardless of whatever else was in their health care bills , would write legislation to protect the future of medical research , medical schools and teaching hospitals we are in the great age of discovery in medical science , and it is taking place here in the united states mr moynihan said that s a responsibility to humankind , not just our own citizens , and we 'll do it there is no precise dollar commitment yet but dr philip r lee , assistant secretary for health in the department of health and human services , said he expected the administration to support more than the 98 billion a year mr clinton first offered for academic institutions the big unresolved issues would be how much money , he said without predicting what that amount would finally be , he cited arguments presented by dr michael johns , dean of the medical school at johns hopkins university in baltimore , who has said that another 9 billion a year would be needed to keep the academic centers on a level playing field costs of expertise in simple terms , the problem faced by the academic centers is that teaching new doctors and conducting research is an expensive and inefficient way to run a hospital , forcing the institutions to charge high rates as pressure has grown nationally to hold down medical costs , insurance companies have placed limits on what they will pay , driving patients away from the academic centers leaders of academic centers argue that the federal government should recognize their importance to the nation both as training grounds for doctors and as the institutions best able to deal with the rarest and most difficult medical conditions dr lee also said that many academic health care leaders were worried that under the clinton bill , and in increasingly costconscious private health insurance , patients from faraway states would not be reimbursed for using their more expensive institutions he said the administration believed that the language in its bill had dealt with that concern , but was prepared to modify it to satisfy the leaders of the academic centers none of us want to reduce the referral of patients to the places where they can get the best possible care , he said beyond the financial issues , one major issue raised in the boston meeting and elsewhere in recent months was the provision in mr clinton s plan that would require medical schools to shift their emphasis from training specialists toward teaching primary care the bill directs them to be training 55 percent of their students in primary care by 1998 if this is a mechanism that will work , is the timing proper \? dr rabkin said would it be better to slow down a little \? an open offer and dr daniel c tosteson , dean of the harvard medical school , said to set a national goal to work in a direction of more primary care doctors makes good sense to set rigid target numbers for every single institution , i think , would be a mistake dr lee said president clinton said that the 1998 deadline could be delayed and told him and senator kennedy , work it out after last week s meeting , dr lee said , the president has said he wants these issues resolved quickly he added that the president indicated greater flexibility in terms of what we have in the bill and basically said that if senator kennedy works it out , he will support it another doctor who was not at the meeting , dr paul marks , head of memorialsloan kettering cancer center in new york city and a strong early voice of complaint , said saturday certainly i feel very encouraged by the understanding that is clear from senators moynihan and kennedy and the president there is no question you would find all of us very supportive of universal health care and health insurance reform we want to make sure that occurs in a context that does n't destroy the instruments of care one hospital chief at the boston meeting , dr richard nesson , head of the brigham and women s hospital , said that while not everyone there was committed to every minute detail in the bill , the spirit of the meeting was a very positive one it is relatively clear , he added , that two of the major concerns that we have , coverage for everyone and concerns for research and education support , are covered better in the president s bill , and in many other instances not even considered photo concern is growing in academic medicine that president clinton s health plan could hamper teaching hospitals and medical schools on friday , members of the medical student association demonstrated at the capitol , with the washington monument in the background \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
the photocopied form letter came in the mail a few weeks ago the salutation to sid and evelyn , written with a strong , flowing hand , made even more amazing what followed please be advised that because of my advanced age of 95 1 2 years , i am discontinuing the practice of medicine on july 28 , 1994 i shall not be able to attend you professionally after that date the letter was from harry blum , md , my ear nose and throat specialist for seven decades , he has been my universal medical coverage , a fixture in my family s life and a constant for my wife and me for my periodic bouts with sinus problems or evelyn s troubling ear infection , dr blum has been our medical superman , always there when needed , with forthright diagnoses and direct solutions like some faded sepiatoned snapshot crumbling at the edges , one of my earliest recollections involved him it must have occurred about 65 years ago , when i was 3 years old i recall sitting on our oilclothcovered kitchen table in williamsburg , brooklyn i had a painful earache and dr blum came to treat me he wore a black derby hat and a black coat with a brown fur shawl collar his wavy hair and little mustache matched the jet black bag that he carried but i could remember nothing else about that murky flashback recently , i sat and visited with dr blum he filled in the blanks on that house call the reason you ca n't remember , he said , laughing , is because i put you out for a few minutes so i could drain the infection i always carried an anesthetic with me in those days before we had antibiotics or even sulfa drugs for the past 30 years , dr blum has worked and lived in a 90yearold white clapboard house on 19th street , in the heart of flatbush but my old memories take me back to his elegant brownstone office on st mark s avenue in crown heights there he won his reputation as brooklyn s tonsil doctor i used to perform 1 , 800 tonsillectomies a year , as well as plastic surgery , sinus surgery and other procedures , he recalled it was there in crown heights that he removed my tonsils , in 1934 , and did the same operation on my son 30 years later he treated my brother and sisters and their children , my parents and their parents , as well in 1948 , i fell seriously ill my temperature was 104 degrees and my infected sinuses swelled my head out of proportion a local physician urged immediate surgery but my father summoned his old pal harry blum , who arrived in the middle of the night like the united states cavalry , with portable lights , medications and other paraphernalia he would n't leave until he was assured that i was on the way to recovery his remembers my family vividly i met your father in 1921 when i joined the cosmopolitan lodge of the odd fellows , dr blum said i had just become a physician after graduating from nyu medical school i became your family doctor in 1923 when i opened my first office according to my oldest sister , when my father s mother fell gravely ill in 1929 , our grandmother insisted that dr blum treat her although he was not affiliated with the hospital where she was confined , he came to see her regularly as a visitor to comfort her in her final days i commiserated with my two sisters just last week about dr blum s decision we could n't remember much of anything before harry blum and any after seems strangely empty it s doubtful that our children or our grandchildren will ever experience cradletothegrave medical care from one doctor no doubt they will get adequate clinical attention and loads of tests but none of us will ever get that continuity of professional concern again the onceblackhaired harry blum is now virtually bald his mustache is a wispy gray vestige of its ebony past , but his face is remarkably wrinklefree he is small in stature , with a slight paunch as one of the few signs of his age he remains wiry and quick , bounding up to answer the door or to fetch old photos of his days as a deepsea tuna fisherman or as a hunter of moose and bear in northern canada he even retrieved a wrinkled blue ribbon he won for the 7 , 000 prize mink he raised on a 25acre farm his office walls today are covered with diplomas and certificates testifying to his medical and surgical skills and to his achievements over the years i noticed that the citation from the medical society of the state of new york honoring his 50th anniversary as a physician was dated feb 16 , 1971 but in stark contrast , the walls of his home are adorned with beautiful oil paintings mostly portraits , a few landscapes all of them harry blum originals sixtyfive years ago i decided i wanted to learn how to paint , he said a paristrained artist gave me lessons i was so excited i could n't sleep at night all i could think about was my painting it has been my passion ever since i have already converted a room in my connecticut house into a studio so that i can paint full time he has his exciting future all mapped out i'm not really planning to retire , he said i'm just planning to change my profession i want to go into the fine arts very seriously as i shook his hand to say goodbye , he confessed that he was pleased that this article might get into the new york times that could be helpful to me when i want to get shown in the new york galleries , he said eagerly but i'm not ready yet , he confided i think i 'll need about two more years of work before i'm ready to exhibit in manhattan
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , sept 25 the bosnian serbs reopened the gas supply to sarajevo today after an 11day cutoff , but they insured that the airport remained closed by threatening to shoot at incoming united nations flights the airport , which runs between bosnian serb and bosnian government positions , is essential to the arrival of food aid to the city and to the united nations peacekeeping operation a spokesman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees said current food supplies were sufficient for another two weeks the agreement to reopen a critical gas valve closed by the serbs in the suburb of ilidza west of the city was reached at a meeting of senior bosnian serb and bosnian government officials an outline accord was also reached on repairing sabotaged electricity pylons , but no electricity was expected to reach sarajevo for at least two more days because electricity is needed to pump water into homes , the 300 , 000 people of sarajevo remained without running water for the 11th consecutive day the main traffic in the city now consists of people pushing wheelbarrows , shopping carts , baby carriages and other makeshift contraptions loaded with water taken from pipes near the miljacka river the accord , brokered by united nations officials , involves a tradeoff that will restore electricity to areas of bosnia controlled by the serbs in exchange for their concessions on sarajevo hasan muratovic , the bosnian minister without portfolio , said electricity pylons in the serbianheld towns of visegrad and zvornik would be repaired this week , bringing power to wide areas of serbianheld eastern bosnia this , he added , would also allow the small eastern muslim enclave of srebrenica to obtain electricity the bosnian serb suspension of gas and electricity supplies to sarajevo has underlined the fact that they still hold the bosnian capital at their mercy radovan karadzic , the leader of the bosnian serbs , has made clear to united nations officials that his own economic and logistical difficulties stemming from a recent serbian embargo will be shared by the people of sarajevo this renewed squeeze on sarajevo continued today with the emergence of an apparent serbian plan to balance concessions on utilities with an attempt to stop , or at least strictly limit , united nations flights into the airport a spokesman for the united nations protection force , maj herve gourmelon , said a telephone call from a bosnian serb military officer was received early today , warning that any aircraft would be fired at as a result , no aircraft arrived today and none are to fly monday a resumption of the united nations relief effort , involving the arrival of several flights a day carrying food , is not expected before wednesday photo lacking electricity in her home , a sarajevo woman washed laundry in the miljacka river on sunday \( associated press \)
the enduring debate over the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes has taken a new turn recently as a number of doctors have begun asking whether it actually works critics point out that no welldesigned study has ever shown any medical benefit from smoked marijuana and even though people may tell poignant stories of how they or their friends or acquaintances found relief by smoking it , the reports are nothing more than anecdotes , the sort of evidence that is normally rejected by medical authorities still , they can be compelling the first time richard brookhiser had chemotherapy last summer for testicular cancer , the nausea and vomiting he felt coming on were averted by the latest wonder drug , zofran , manufactured by glaxo holdings but , he said , when he had his second course of chemotherapy , in spite of the zofran he felt the nausea just over the horizon and approaching so , when he went into the hospital for the third time , he brought along some marijuana overcoming nausea mr brookhiser , a 39yearold editor of the national review and columnist for the national observer , said he used it in the hospital , new york university medical center , and for the first few days after he left , whenever waves of nausea came over him then he would steer clear of the drug for three weeks , until his next treatment now that he is finished with his chemotherapy , mr brookhiser says , he has no desire whatever for marijuana i will absolutely never smoke marijuana again , he said the thought of smoking it is loathsome to me now i associate it with the nausea now , he said , i'm the perfect citizen of a drugfree america a psychologist in new york , who asked not to be identified because she did not want to be known to have done something illegal , told a similar story she said that despite zofran , chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer left her profoundly nauseated , very ill , so much so that i was n't an ordinary human being she added , i was in a different universe she said friends got her marijuana , and it was tremendously effective it was a moment of relief , she said i could be returned to myself from hell therapy or threat \? the old questions about marijuana are surfacing once again , as advocates of legalizing marijuana see glimmers of hope in president clinton s administration after being nominated as surgeon general but before she was confirmed , dr joycelyn elders said she believed that marijuana ought to be legal for medical use dr john morgan , a professor of pharmacology at the city college of new york , said he was persuaded by the anecdotes he hears that marijuana was probably effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting of chemotherapy and nausea and terrible wasting in people with aids in the modern age , we 've come to rely on high tech , doubleblind controlled trials , dr morgan said , but , he said , people do find medications other than the official ones i think marijuana is one others vehemently disagree dr william bennett , an expert on high blood pressure and kidney disease at oregon health sciences university in portland , who is not the former federal drug official , opposes what he calls the medicalization of the marijuana issue dr bennett said he and his wife joined the antidrug movement after their son died suddenly , with cocaine in his blood he strongly opposes legalizing marijuana marijuana has never been shown safe and effective for anything not one single study , dr bennett said its active ingredient , delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol , is prescribed in pill form to prevent nausea and vomiting , but dr bennett said it was only slightly better than a dummy pill , and surprassed by modern drugs but patients say smoked marijuana works far better than the pill does they can control the dose by inhaling only as often as they need relief , and the drug gets from their lungs into their blood and brain immediately dr bennett , however , said that it must be shown to be safe and effective he added that society would not be doing cancer patients or people with aids any favors by legalizing a drug without any evidence of its effectiveness , especially when the drug contains toxins and carcinogens and funguses and when the dose varies markedly from batch to batch desperation and social policy i have compassion , believe me , dr bennett said but desperation is not a basis for social policy cancer specialists , according to a survey conducted four years ago , lean toward the opinion that smoked marijuana is slightly better than the pills in the survey , conducted by dr mark a r kleiman , a drug policy specialist at harvard university s kennedy school of government , and a student , richard e doblin , nearly half the doctors reported recommending marijuana to a patient dr kleiman said he was stunned by that response and now regretted that he had not asked more detailed followup questions for example , it would be helpful to know when these doctors made the recommendations , because antinausea drugs have markedly improved in recent years zofran , for one , has been available for only about a year and a half some doctors say they are motivated by compassion and would not discourage marijuana use , however skimpy the evidence that it works before dr harmon eyre became chief medical officer for the american cancer society he spent 20 years treating cancer patients the society does not take a position on marijuana , dr eyre said , but he said that his personal opinion was that doctors want what s best for their patients if a patient is helped only by marijuana , he said , most doctors will not intervene i think most oncologists in one way or another have dealt with a patient in which this has come up , dr eyre said i think their recommendation is to try it if none of the other things work there is n't an oncologist who wants to see a patient vomit and stop potentially lifecurative chemotherapy because of that lack of strong evidence but dr eyre said , the bottom line is that the evidence to support marijuana as being superior to any other agent is very minimal to none the scientific data , he added , are very very fragmented and poor so , dr kleiman asks , why not get some data \? he said he thought there were three reasons no one had done a scientific study of smoked marijuana first , he said , it s marijuana , and this has gotten caught up in the war on drugs second , dr kleiman said , marijuana cannot be patented , making it less attractive to drug companies randomized clinical trials cost money , he said who s going to put it up \? finally , he said , even if you do all the trials , many people believe that no herbals could be approved by the fda there is no way of controlling the dose of active ingredients and no way of knowing all the other ingredients in plant matter nonetheless , dr donald abrams , an aids researcher at the university of california in san francisco , plans to conduct a study of whether marijuana is better than the marijuana pill to help aids patients gain weight but for chemotherapyinduced nausea , dr kleiman said , it is about time that someone found out , once and for all , how effective smoked marijuana is he suggests that the national cancer institute sponsor a study comparing smoked marijuana to pills with its active ingredient we could get an answer in six months , he said dr kleiman said he understood those who did not want marijuana available people are afraid of giving the wrong message , he said but he added it is inconceivable to me that enough would be prescribed to make a measurable dent in the 4 , 000metricton illegal market as a drug policy researcher , it s my opinion that this does n't matter at all except as a symbolic measure photo richard brookhiser used marijuana when he underwent chemotherapy as a cancer patient \( william e sauro the new york times \)
four years after an elusive gunman who called himself zodiac claimed to have carried out four shootings that were never solved , the new york city police department yesterday started a new investigation in response to a letter taking responsibility for five more attacks senior police officials said they were taking seriously the latest claims , which were made in a letter sent to the new york post and passed on to investigators one reason , they said , was that the letter writer had suggested special knowledge of the shootings by providing details of cases that had not received wide publicity but the chief of detectives , joseph r borrelli , said it was by no means clear that the author of the latest letter was the same person who wrote the letters , bearing astrological signs , to the police and to news organizations in 1990 claiming responsibility for the four earlier shootings i think that to say that it s the same individual or to eliminate it as not being the same individual would be premature , chief borrelli said at a news conference at police headquarters there are some obviously inconsistent things and there are some obvious things that might be construed as consistent lines of investigation the police said they were reviewing all the crimes mentioned in the latest letter , interviewing old witnesses again and searching for new ones initially , the police said , the crimes had not seemed related now , they are asking whether each attack might be connected to the letter writer , whether another gunman is responsible for the second string of shootings , and whether the letter is nothing more than a morbid hoax all but one of the shootings in 1990 and those referred to in the latest letter , three of which resulted in deaths , took place within a few miles of the others , in a border area of brooklyn and queens near highland park commanders of both the 75th precinct in brooklyn and the 104th precinct in queens have sent additional patrols into the area , police officials said the latest letter , like the earlier ones , was scrawled in ball point discursive letters and began , this is the zodiac but several elements have raised doubts that the latest claims are related to the original zodiac case , including conflicting descriptions given by the victims of their attackers the police said that they while the letter writer claims to have shot five people , they have reports matching only four of the incidents in another discrepancy , the police say , the letter writer claims to have shot one of his victims twice and then stabbed her the police say a woman was killed in highland park on aug 10 , 1992 , as the letter writer says , but that she was stabbed dozens of times and that no evidence of gunshot wounds was found by the medical examiner the letter writer enhanced his credibility , in the eyes of the police , by giving the ages and genders of the five victims , the location of their wounds , the caliber of weapon used , a 22 in four instances and a 380 in a fifth , and the time and place of the shootings , authorities said the writer was accurate in four of the five cases as far as they can tell , the police say , the shooting of a man in highland park on june 11 described by the writer never happened one distinction between the series of shootings in 1990 and the latest ones , which occurred in 1992 and 1993 , is in the type of weapon that was used in the first shootings , the police believe the weapon was possibly homemade and fired either a 380 or 9millimeter bullet none of the cases involved a 22caliber gun in one of the earlier cases , a victim said his assailant had been a black man the last of the victims in that series , who was shot as he slept in central park , said he had previously been approached by a black man who asked his birth date descriptions of attackers chief borrelli said that one of the men who survived in the latest series said he was shot by a black man wearing a ski mask , his hair dangling in the long , distinctive tangles known as dreadlocks a woman who was shot on oct 2 , 1992 , as she sat on a bench in highland park said her attacker was a lightcomplexioned hispanic man one big difference in the letters themselves is that the latest one contains no astrological signs or references to the birth dates and astrological signs of the victims , as did the earlier ones the latest letter is also decorated with drawings of what appear to be nautical signal flags , which never appeared on the earlier letters john miller , the deputy police commissioner for public information , said the department had enlisted the help of the naval investigative service , a branch of the united states navy , to determine whether the drawings were of signal flags and , if so , what message they might carry chief borrelli said he had brought together veterans of the original zodiac case to work as a team with other detectives they 're going to work all weekend , he said , and by the middle of next week i expect them to report back to me with some kind of conclusion
boston , june 29 a drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colons , a study has found ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms when steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe case , doctors almost always have to remove the patient s colon the study showed that the transplant drug , cyclosporine , was effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugs , the last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease the study , led by dr simon lichtiger and conducted at mount sinai school of medicine in new york and the university of chicago , is being published on thursday in the new england journal of medicine the researchers tested 20 patients eleven were randomly assigned to get cyclosporine injections the rest received placebo shots nine of the 11 reported substantial relief of their symptoms within a week , while none in the comparison group got better the researchers had planned to enroll 42 patients but cut the study short because they felt that , given their findings , it would be unethical to continue with the placebos five who were originally in the comparison group were later given cyclosporine , and all responded to the treatment cyclosporine is widely used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs it works by suppressing white blood cells that are part of the body s defenses against disease the drug does have side effects , however , among them possible damage to the kidneys
washington , july 30 congress concluded its first round of welfare skirmishing this week , ending four days of hearings in which members rained insults on each other , their witnesses and president clinton s proposal to overhaul the system as expected , republicans accused mr clinton of offering a soft measure that did too little to demand work or discourage outofwedlock birth but more surprising were the harsh attacks from representative robert t matsui of california , an influential democrat whose wife , doris , is a senior white house official responsibile for building support for the president s programs leading the liberal opposition to the bill , mr matsui accused administration officials of using hot rhetoric to score political points at the expense of poor children mr clinton s welfare plan has been central to his claim of being a new democrat , and it represents a test of his ability to forge centrist coalitions he wants to expand training programs for welfare recipients but require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program taken at face value , the week s hearings , before a house ways and means subcommittee , suggests that mr clinton faces an uphill battle democrats insulted republicans , both insulted witnesses , and witnesses responded with professions of outrage all sides maintained that they had the best interests of children in mind there is no consensus at all on this stuff , mr matsui said posturing vs disagreement but the subcommittee may be more divided than the congress at large , and it remains difficult to distinguish deep disagreements from electionyear posturing mr clinton s plan has gotten a respectful reception from centrist democrats and a republican alternative shares the basic outline of a twoyear limit , followed by a work program the republicans would phase in the work requirements faster , with fewer exemptions , and finance their plan with deep cuts in programs for legal immigrants we 're arguing over the stuff at the margins , said avis lavelle , a spokeswoman for the department of health and human services now these are important things at the margins , and , as we can see from the hearings , they produce great emotions but i think there is more in common than these hearings would suggest while that is a plausible assessment , few participants are predicting that a bill will pass before congress adjourns this fall republicans appear reluctant to hand mr clinton an electionyear victory , and the president wants to avoid a fight that could detract from his effort to pass a health care bill the bickering began on tuesday when mr matsui conducted a harsh examination of david t ellwood , an assistant secretary of health and human services and one of the main architects of the clinton plan supporting data is lacking mr matsui asked mr ellwood , a former harvard professor , to specify the scientific research that suggests that a twoyear limit would help recipients mr ellwood offered none mr matsui also attacked mr ellwood for referring to welfare as a checkwriting system , saying the phrase insulted poor women and children i do n't think that david ellwood would have gone before a group of senior citizens and said that social security is a big checkwriting machine , the congressman said but it s easy to attack welfare recipients that way mr matsui continued the attacks on friday , saying that mr ellwood had insulted recipients by questioning their motives for seeking aid by contrast , he said , some people might question mr ellwood s motives by suggesting he is pushing welfare this year to enhance his resume mr matsui added , we would never suggest that mr ellwood declined on friday to comment he just feels sort of beat up right now , and he s not going to get into it , ms lavelle said on wednesday , the democrats stopped fighting among themselves and started fighting with republicans representative harold e ford , the tennessee democrat who heads the subcommittee on human resources , was arguing that the welfare program is inexpensive , with the federal share costing less than 20 billion a year political motive is seen representative rick santorum , a pennsylvania republican running for the senate , called the figure misleading he said that when other aid programs like medicaid and food stamps were added , the costs soared to more than 200 billion a year mr ford exploded , saying , you 're not going to use this as a senatorial platform on welfare and the poor mr santorum said mr ford also mispronounced his name , calling him santorium or sanitorium he said mr ford later apologized and asked that the remarks be stricken from the hearing record mr clinton s bill drew more criticism on friday , this time from representative kweisi mfume , the maryland democrat who heads the black caucus the bill s provisions for job creation are woefully inadequate , mr mfume said , and the time limit could punish recipients who need assistance through no fault of their own conservative is ridiculed the sharpest disagreements came in a questioning of charles murray , a conservative researcher who argues that welfare promotes outofwedlock births mr murray advocates the abolition of the welfare system , saying it would immediately cut in half the number of outofwedlock births the democrats were eager to discredit mr murray , who has become increasingly influential in the past year representative sander levin , democrat of michigan , ridiculed mr murray s recent statement that men had as much responsibility toward outofwedlock births as a piece of chocolate cake has in determining whether a woman gains weight mr murray said he was simply criticizing laws that denied men a say in decisions about adoption and abortion he accused mr levin of offering an outrageous misrepresentation of what i have said representative michael j kopetski , democrat of oregon , then joined in the fray , criticizing mr murray s use of the phrase , illegitimate child i believe every child is legitimate in the eyes of god , mr kopetski said mr kopetski argued that a nation without welfare would begin to look like bombay , with starving children stalking the streets mr murray repeated his view that government programs had only made things worse what is happening today to children in the united states is scandalous , mr murray said
the lives of four men , two american and two haitian , came together briefly in portauprince , but long enough to show the world the truths about haiti , its military rulers and the one special nightmare of those who live under tyranny none of the four intended to reveal those truths , or even speak them the americans , former president carter and gen colin powell , were doing the opposite they were so intent on agreement with the haitian generals that they spoke a terrible falsehood they called these generals men of honor those words were a slap in the face to president clinton , who had called the generals murderers , and they mocked the goals of us forces gathered offshore to oust them but what sticks in the gullet of history is that the words are a blasphemous insult to the thousands of haitians shot or butchered by the army , the police and the killer squads that kept the generals in power men of honor it is like saying that about german ss officers or the soviet generals who served the kgb the only difference is in the number of executions and mutilations what does it tell us about mr carter or general powell \? what is their definition of honor that it encompasses men who commanded killers and torturers \? naturally , lieut gen raoul cedras took these compliments and the invitation to hang around in office for another month as the perfect moment to show haitians that he intended to be a power long after the month was up and he did it , as usual with police clubs until then , many americans may not have fully grasped what had been going on in haiti , every day of the generals' rule then the second haitian set up a little pile of coconuts for sale in the street people of the city gathered , to cheer arriving american troops the cedras police arrived , to give them the cedras lesson the only difference this time was that the american press was there on tv , you could hear the thunks on skulls the next day , the coconut man was on the front pages of the world s newspapers , sprawled dead in the gutter , killed just for being there president clinton has made serious mistakes about haiti he did not prepare the american public for the invasion by spelling out the reasons , early and often at the very end , he turned over the crisis to a mission he could not control the negotiating team permitted the generals to do what the clinton administration had said would not happen not only the extra month but the freedom to decide whether they will remain in haiti or leave general cedras cleared that up fast he said he will remain the purpose of his life will be to return to power president clinton was not elected to turn over his negotiating power in time of crisis to men who not only were outside his political control but also were so obviously contemptuous of him and his aims so it is his direct responsibility to make sure that the thugs of the honorable generals are disarmed or kept in barracks and it is his responsibility to force the generals to use their month s grace to begin getting out of office , instead of to prepare for their next grab at power because of the startling giveaways of the negotiators , the president is getting a lot of criticism from americans who supported invasion but this cannot be taken ever from the president it is only because of his decision to apply military power that americans and the rest of the world can no longer deny knowledge of the haitian reality we know , because we have now seen ourselves , that haitians could not gather together in the streets without facing beatings or death we know that neither the presence of the american press nor of american armed forces persuaded or shamed the police into sparing a single skull without the intervention ordered by mr clinton , haiti would have continued , for decades longer , a country where terror was the instrument of rule , where the forces of law existed to commit crime , where police could kill a coconut man , stand over his corpse as long as they pleased , and then just walk away with the us intervention , haitians have a chance to escape the particular dread that everlastingly grips people who have known only dictatorships how fearful is the past that awaits us
philadelphia , april 6 pennsylvania politicians see jobs , waterfront development and tax revenue spinning in the little windows of slot machines on riverboat casinos waiting to take their place along the state s waterways using research provided by the gambling industry , these public officials say that pennsylvania s gamblers lose 1 billion a year in atlantic city , about 60 miles southeast of here , and that it would be better if this money were lost closer to home tourists who come to philadelphia to see the liberty bell , they add , might also liberate some cash on riverboats plying the delaware river but fiscal experts and social scientists say the gambling industry could end up costing the state money , generate crime and , in particular , sully philadelphia s image as the cradle of american democracy action in legislature the state legislature is considering a measure to permit gambling on pennsylvania s navigable rivers and lakes , subject to state and county referendums , within two years many elected officials in the cities of erie , pittsburgh and philadelphia and in the suburban philadelphia counties of bucks and delaware support the proposal anticipating legislative approval of the bill early next year , casino owners have either bought outright , or bought options for , seven pieces of property along the delaware river here as well as sites in pittsburgh owners of waterfront properties say two dozen to three dozen gaming companies are shopping for sites around the state , creating a real estate boom along major rivers riverboat gambling has already been legalized in illinois , indiana , iowa , louisiana , mississippi and missouri and legislatures in many other states , including new york , are considering the option pennsylvania already has a state lottery and allows betting on horse races but approval of riverboat casinos is far from certain , since gov robert p casey , a democrat , has vowed to veto any casino bill that he receives before his term ends next january in addition , the bill faces strong bipartisan opposition in the state senate , said senator robert c jubelirer , the president pro tempore of the republicanled body still , arthur m goldberg , chairman and chief executive of the bally manufacturing company , expressed confidence in approval of the casinos , saying , it s just a matter of time indeed , industry consultants say bally has already agreed to pay about 60 million for 31 acres on philadelphia s waterfront south of penn s landing and has bought a site in pittsburgh as well , with plans to invest 125 million in each city words of caution mayor edward g rendell of philadelphia is a leading advocate of riverboat gambling if you can tell me about any economic development enterprise that will employ 6 , 000 to 8 , 000 philadelphians , give the city 300 million for the right to develop the waterfront and produce 25 million in tax revenues each year , please bring them in to see me this afternoon , mr rendell said in an interview but fiscal experts say 25 million is not that much in a city with a 23 billion budget they caution that any windfall might be gobbled up on new city services along the waterfront and in dealing with predictable increases in crime , compulsive gambling s corrosive effect on families , traffic congestion and local business failures they note that atlantic city lost many retail establishments after casinos came in for example , 97 of the city s 243 restaurants closed in 197787 , the restaurant industry says , because of competition from casinos , which subsidize food and drinks to promote gambling the idea that casinos are the answer for a state or city with serious economic development problems is a mirage , said steven d gold , director of the center for the study of the states at the rockefeller institute in albany fastgrowing industry gambling is one of the nation s fastestgrowing industries in 1993 , industry figures show , there were 93 million visits to casinos , and industry analysts say the american market is only a third developed more and more states are trying to tap into an industry that takes in more than 30 billion a year indeed , politicians around the country say that states that do not legalize casino gambling risk being left behind with all the problems and none of the profits if casinos are built in adjacent states assemblyman wayne r bryant of new jersey set the competitive tone for the midatlantic states recently when he introduced legislation calling for a state referendum on riverboat gambling on the new jersey side of the hudson and delaware rivers if pennsylvania or new york approved riverboat gambling this proposed referendum is a warning shot to philadelphia and new york city that new jersey will aggressively protect the atlantic city casinos against outside competition , mr bryant , a camden democrat , said last month at a news conference effect on atlantic city interestingly , it is the very companies that own casinos in atlantic city that are among those acquiring waterfront property in philadelphia and pittsburgh mr goldberg of bally said that riverboat gambling in pennsylvania would spur interest in atlantic city s gambling palaces , which include two bally casinos but another atlantic city casino owner , donald j trump , said in a interview that he was buying property in philadelphia and pittsburgh primarily to capture the business of pennsylvanians who would stop going to atlantic city if gaming were available closer to home if the legislature does not legalize casino gambling , mr trump said , he will probably build condominiums and retail stores on his 22 acres near downtown philadelphia that would probably be better for philadelphia anyway , said mr trump , who owns three casinos in atlantic city gambling would make a relatively small amount of money for philadelphia and would increase crime and problems that are n't existent now
indianapolis i wish i could just fastforward the knickspacers series to the part where it starts getting good at this point , that is game 4 or 5 when the series ends , presumably with a knicks victory that sounds harsh , but it s not intended as a dig at indiana or as a smart aleck rooting for the home team it s just the stated preference of a roving soul , eager to see pushes come to shoves indiana has enjoyed a superb season and an outstanding run through the playoffs larry brown has done an excellent job of revitalizing the pacers , instilling a sense of confidence and enthusiasm that has carried indiana to the eastern conference finals but new york is playing at a completely different level of ball , a level the pacers have n't begun to fathom yet and probably wo n't until reggie miller decides that he 'd rather cultivate a reputation for winning championships than taunting opposing fans in reality , new york is too deep , too focused and too hungry to suffer an upset from here on out , it s all business and i'm eager to get to the business of a classic championship series new york from the east , houston from the west i was thinking about a knicksrockets series wednesday night at the summit in houston this was game 2 of the western conference finals and hakeem olajuwon was dismantling utah s interior defense for the second consecutive game dream wound up with 41 points nothing utah did worked not the doubleteam , not the tripleteam they tried to make hakeem uncomfortable but never found his level of discomfort there was a breathtaking threeminute stretch during the fourth quarter when olajuwon and karl malone , utah s premier power forward , took over , thundering back and forth at each other , mixing finesse with power as utah s defenders bounced off olajuwon , i found myself wondering how the knicks , with their hardearned phd s in team defense , would attack him ca n't we fastforward this series \? i realize that conjecture of this nature is premature the knicks have two difficult games to play here against the pacers and boisterous fans bent on shortcircuiting a new york sweep out west , houston held a 21 lead over utah despite losing last night in salt lake city but in addition to the jazz , houston also has to overcome the lingering image of a team that chokes that self destructs and wilts on the eve of success this is n't just a rockets' monkey , but a monkey that sits on the back of each of houston s pro franchises officials have even taken to calling houston clutch city in an obvious attempt to counteract the notion that houston is actually choke city but this is what makes the knicksrockets series so compelling both teams are carrying the sort of emotional baggage that only survivors own , and appreciate houston has never won a national basketball association championship , new york has n't won one in more than two decades now they 're both close enough to taste it in a sevengame knicksrockets championship series , patrick ewing and olajuwon would renew a relationship that began in 1984 as collegians in the national championship game , in which ewing s georgetown team defeated olajuwon s houston team if the series materializes , it will mark the first time in years that two superstar centers will actually be the focal point of attention in a championship series for the last eight years , crunch time in the playoffs has been dominated by michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird or isiah thomas small forwards and guards a generation of basketball fans raised on guards and small forwards missed an era of centers bill russell , wilt chamberlain , abduljabbar in his prime , wes unseld , zelmo beaty , nate thurmond for many contemporary fans , pivot play is defined by a shaquille o'neal dunk as a pro , olajuwon has devoured ewing last december , when houston made its lone appearance in new york , olajuwon had 37 points and 13 rebounds , compared with 12 and 8 for ewing , as the rockets won , 9485 but that was an nba lifetime ago and these are the playoffs olajuwon will not be playing against ewing but against a team that has galvanized itself into a defensive rock , the likes of which houston has not seen during the playoffs but the rock has not faced an opponent like olajuwon , either , a player who defies whatever manner of defense is presented it s possible that none of this will come to pass , that indiana will pick itself off the deck and utah will prevail out west but i do n't think so i 've peeked over the mountaintop , and have scaled the summit i 've seen hakeem

reconciliation road a family odyssey of war and honor by john douglas marshall illustrated 296 pp syracuse syracuse university press the estimable s l a marshall , who died in 1977 , was a renowned military historian and the author of men against fire , an important study of world war ii combat his reputation as a researcher and warrior , however , was prominently assailed by several critics in 1989 in reconciliation road his grandson , a seattle journalist , sets out to determine the truth , producing a modest and searching memoir of selfdiscovery when he was a child in the 1950 s in the suburbs of detroit , john douglas marshall quietly built a significant part of his identity on the fact that he was the grandson of a famous man , a military journalist and historian who worked for the detroit news and was the author of a shelf full of books on world war ii and the korean war reputedly the youngest lieutenant in the army during world war i , slam marshall had been a leading combat analyst in the 1940 s he had been with ernest hemingway during the liberation of paris , and later he was a brigadier general in the army reserve marshall had survived combat and plane crashes , he knew prominent political and military figures , he appeared frequently on television all during his youth , john marshall was assured he was going to be just like his famous grandfather as if there were no choice , the grandson tended toward the writing life , and also at first toward the military perspective s l a marshall s whole career represented as a college english major and student journalist at the university of virginia , john marshall joined the reserve officer training corps and prepared himself for an army hitch but this was the 1960 s , and the conflict in vietnam had none of the clarity of the war against germany and japan by the time of mr marshall s graduation and his commission as a second lieutenant in 1969 , he had become a pacifist before being shipped to the war zone , he was granted conscientious objector status and honorably discharged soon after , his fiercely hawkish grandfather by now the author of a number of books on vietnam combat and a man who had the confidence of military leaders like gen william westmoreland angrily disowned him they never saw each other again , and when the elder marshall died , as john marshall recounts , he stayed away from his grandfather s funeral , his grieving put on hold his relations with other family members remained uneasy for years as is abundantly plain in reconciliation road , part of the grandson s life was held in check for years some crucial part having to do with his identity as a member of a family gone sour during the 60 s , as a husband and as a father in 1989 , mr marshall , who works for the seattle postintelligencer , decided to use his journalist s tools to get to the bottom of the controversy about his grandfather , despite a lingering ambivalence he planned , he writes , to employ careful , balanced research , interviews and a reporter s concern for fairness despite the elder marshall s elaborate accomplishments , meeting critics' charges was a headon uphill battle the most troubling accusations were to be found in a 1989 article in american heritage magazine by frederick smoler the article suggested that marshall had lied about his own combat experience and service rank in world war i , and that he had not conducted the postcombat mass interviews with infantrymen during world war ii that formed the basis for his 1947 book , men against fire that work , which influenced both military scholarship and infantry training , said that never more than 25 percent of american infantrymen in battle during world war ii \( and usually only about 15 percent \) fired their weapons mr smoler called the theory a peculiar hoax in attempting to maintain a reporter s dispassion in the face of such a personal matter , mr marshall set too high a goal for himself his automobile odyssey would be more than 10 , 000 miles long from seattle to texas , georgia , the carolinas , virginia , washington and new york , from the east all the way to the pacific northwest and , as he consulted s l a marshall s private papers and public governmental documents , and interviewed friends , associates , historians and critics \( both mild and harsh \) , his questions were frequently posed as his grandfather s vociferous advocate interviews , recounted here at length , doggedly led his sources , which included general westmoreland , mike wallace and lucian k truscott 3d , among others , over contested factual terrain that sometimes seemed more important to interviewer than interviewee but with each passing day , mr marshall drew closer to a more comprehensive appreciation of his grandfather than had been possible when he was alive the author found that while there was little doubt that his grandfather had never shied from stepping into a war zone , whether as a young man in france or as an older researcher in the south pacific , europe , korea and vietnam , he had in fact fabricated critical parts of his own service record moreover , while it was true that his grandfather had many times conducted his pioneering postcombat group interviews , his controversial assertion in men against fire about the percentage of soldiers who actually fired their weapons in combat was apparently not backed by hard research the most that the author can show is that his grandfather had tried to quantify what should have remained conjecture , and had claimed more supportive data than would ever be yielded to subsequent researchers by the end of his quest , mr marshall was able to acknowledge his grandfather s basic humanity his gifts as well as his flaws and come to terms with the hardened , bellicose , ideological old warrior that s l a marshall had apparently become by the 60 s , when his vietnamera wrath devastated the relationships in his own family this is an earnest memoir though it is awkwardly written in the present tense and lacks a transformative personal vision , it is often moving , aiming unerringly for political and personal reconciliation in the stillunsettled aftermath of the war in vietnam
washington , jan 10 brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes pleaded with attorney general janet reno today to make an exception to a longstanding justice department policy and quickly bring federal civil rights charges against two men for the killing of a rabbinical student more than two years ago during the unrest in crown heights mr hynes s appeal , delivered in ms reno s office here , was the latest turn in the complex maneuvering over who should handle the politically difficult crown heights case mr hynes said today that his office , which in 1992 unsuccessfully prosecuted a suspect , lemrick nelson jr , for the killing of yankel rosenbaum , a young hasidic scholar , is proceeding with a new grand jury investigation , and that he expected the indictment of a new suspect no immediate decision but local officials fear this new case would be weak because it is based on witnesses who have changed their testimony and is being brought by a prosecutor who originally sought to convict someone else moreover , no further state charges can be brought against the first suspect , and mr hynes , along with other new york politicians , have been urging ms reno to take over the case so that both mr nelson and the new suspect , could be tried on federal charges but ms reno has rebuffed these appeals on the ground that all state proceedings should be exhausted before any federal case could be brought mr hynes today sought to encourage ms reno into setting aside the department s normal policy of waiting for local proceedings to end by offering to lend brooklyn prosecutors to the federal prosecuting team looking into the 1991 slaying of mr rosenbaum after meeting for a half hour with ms reno and her top aides in her fifthfloor conference room here , mr hynes said the attorney general did not indicate whether she might move ahead quickly , if at all , with a federal case and carl l stern , ms reno s chief spokesman , said she would decide within 10 days whether to take up mr hynes s offer to deputize brooklyn prosecutors grand jury hearing evidence mr hynes said in an interview after the meeting that he had urged ms reno to bring a case against two people lemrick nelson jr , who has already been acquitted of state charges that he murdered mr rosenbaum , and another person that he did not identify other officials have identified the second potential defendant as ernesto edwards a brooklyn grand jury that convened last week is currently hearing new evidence in the case , proceeding into mr rosenbaum s death mr hynes said that he was seeking a departure from the department s procedure because it could be many months before the conclusion of any new state case , and by then it would be exceedingly difficult to make any new cases a prosecution never gets better by being stale , mr hynes said this tragedy occurred in august of 1991 if any other case is brought , now we 're talking about a possible federal case by the fall of '94 move to dispel criticism the meeting today was convened in part to dispel the widespread criticism over the handling of the crown heights investigation and growing pressure for federal action mayor rudolph w giuliani on sunday complained bitterly about the justice department s handling of the case , saying he had urged ms reno over and over again to impanel a grand jury his remarks made clear that he was not about to drop an issue that proved valuable during last fall s mayoral campaign in recent weeks , brooklyn prosecutors have insisted that the federal government should step into the case more aggressively senior justice department officials , meanwhile , have insisted that ms reno would not make a decision about whether to bring a federal lawsuit until after the state had finished with all its cases the tango between mr hynes and ms reno reflects a variety of competing political and legal realities about the crown heights investigation a state review of the crown heights disturbances and aftermath concluded that , among other problems , prosecutors from the brooklyn district attorney s office had mishandled the case mr hynes s constituency includes jewish groups that have lobbied hard for someone to be brought to justice for the death of mr rosenbaum , and he is clearly hoping that a federal case would succeed where his office has failed mr hynes may run for the post of state attorney general , but he indicated today that such a consideration had not influenced his efforts to get the federal government to take over the case whether i run for attorney general or not , mr hynes told a group of jewish leaders in brooklyn after he returned from washington , i ca n't stop being the brooklyn district attorney justice department officials have long insisted that a civil rights case would be difficult the federal civil rights law generally used in similar circumstances requires a showing of malfeasance by state or local officials , and none was apparent in the death of mr rosenbaum federal officials said ms reno was surprised by the suggestion of a joint federalstate case and they said such a move could present a new set of legal difficulties in particular , since mr nelson was already acquitted of charges brought by state prosecutors , justice department officials anticipated that his lawyers would argue that it would violate the doublejeopardy clause of the constitution for the same state prosecutors to be working for the federal government
people who pay new york state taxes and were lucky enough to get refunds this year are finding a little something extra in their envelopes from the state department of finance and taxation inside is an orangeandwhite letter signed by ralph nader , the consumer advocate , with this message new yorkers are paying some of the highest electric and phone bills in the united states , but now you can do something about it ! the letter goes on to provide information about how to join an advocacy group called the citizens utility board , which represents consumers before the public service commission whenever telephone or power companies ask for an increase in rates the price of membership a contribution of 10 , 15 or even 20 officials and employees of at least one major utility , the nynex corporation , say the state should not be mailing out information about a board to fight utility rate requests , and they have organized a campaign to fight it and that has led officials of the consumer board to question whether nynex is using rate payers' money to try to undermine the consumer group before it can get off the ground 20 , 000 members required the information about how to join the citizens utility board , which is also included in some letters from the department of motor vehicles , is being sent out as a result of a 1991 action by gov mario m cuomo to set up a group to give consumers a voice in rate negotiations robert ceisler , executive director of the board , said that its bylaws , which had to be approved by the public service commission , say the board cannot represent utility customers before the commission until it has 20 , 000 members , to insure that it is speaking for a representative group of new york rate payers the public service commission has given the board five years to recruit members if fewer than 20 , 000 people join by december 1998 , the group must disperse and membership dues will be returned six million messages the first inserts were mailed in refund checks beginning in february , mr ceisler said by the end of december more than six million messages will have reached people from the tax and motor vehicle departments mr ceisler said that more than 13 , 000 people have joined and that more than 100 , 000 in membership dues have been collected mr nader , the consumer advocate , originally proposed setting up groups to give consumers a voice in rate disputes about 20 years ago , and a handful of states set them up blair horner , legislative director of the new york public interest research group , said that in 1982 , as utility rates soared in new york , mr cuomo first set out to create a utility board specifically modeled on groups in illinois and wisconsin , where information about the boards was included in utility bills a voice for the people i think his motivation to fight for the board was a genuine concern that people have a voice in their government , mr horner said but the legislature and the courts rebuffed the governor s initial efforts to set up a board and let people know about it through information in utility bills in 1991 the governor signed an executive order creating a citizens utility board and giving it the right to send out information in mail from state agencies this resulted in the mailings in the tax refunds and the protests from the nynex employees 'i need your help' after hearing from the workers , a nynex vice president , barbara patton , sent all 38 , 000 employees of the company a letter that said it is my opinion that the attack should not go unanswered i need your help to get a message to mario cuomo a sample outrage letter accompanied the letter from ms patton utilize all of it or none of it , but please write the governor , ms patton urged about 800 nynex employees mailed letters to governor cuomo s office in response to ms patton s letter , said mark marchand , director of public relations for nynex we do n't disagree with the existence of the board , mr marchand said we do n't disagree with the creation of any group we do disagree with what they have said to our customers 'outrageous and paranoid' mr ceisler , executive director of the utility board , said he was unhappy about what nynex was doing we want the psc to investigate whether nynex is billing customers for the costs of this outrageous and paranoid letterwriting campaign , he said they are trying everything they could to kill us before we get our 20 , 000 of the 4 , 167 , 000 inserts mailed in refund checks , about 16 people wrote letters inquiring about the inserts , said paul rickard , a spokesman for the department of taxation and finance most people just wrote or called because the inserts were something new and different , mr rickard said photo the back flap of a business reply envelope alerted new yorktaxpayers who got refunds to a message about a consumeradvocacy group
augusta , ga , april 4 some whimsical golfers have observed that the hardest drive in golf might be the one up magnolia lane , approaching the old manor clubhouse at augusta national golf club for the masters i start choking as soon as i turn up the lane , is how gary player puts it once inside golf s pearly gates , though , players are faced with an array of shots that can be as inscrutable as augusta is beautiful everywhere on the manicured grounds are shots that are frightening , puzzling , perplexing and unforgiving the first tee shot of the week at no 1 the second shot at the fifth hole the second at the 13th the tee shot at the 18th any putt from above the hole all are worthy of note and all received votes as the toughest masters shot in an informal player poll leading up to the tournament nicklaus is n't immune but of all the 72 or so shots facing the field of 88 golfers each day in the masters , which begins thursday , none are more demanding than the tee shot at the shortest hole on the course , the 12th , 155 yards of hell called , ironically , golden bell this shot has ruined more masters than fire ants have picnics , and there is n't a golfer who has not been stung by it just try to get jack nicklaus to pick another shot besides the tee shot at 12 , jack , what s the hardest and he interrupts the tee shot at 12 that s it twelve , more than anything else the tee shot at no 2 can be tough , because you want to make birdie there and if you do n't hit it to the right spot you ca n't maybe the second shot at 11 or the tee shot at 13 but , of the ones that have given me trouble , 12 more than any other nicklaus , a sixtime masters champion , has probably played the 12th hole better than anyone who has competed at augusta his stroke average there was 30 up to the age of 40 that included a 6 he made in 1964 after shanking an 8iron right in front of the tournament founder , bob jones since then , his highest score there was a 7 , which he recorded while near the lead two years ago after depositing two balls in the water i was wondering if i 'd be there all day , he said at the time what can be so difficult about a 155yard , par3 hole \? in musical terms , if the vast par3 16th hole at cypress point is tchaikovsky s 1812 overture , then the 12th at augusta is beethoven s sixth , the pastoral symphony at least on the surface , that is underneath is the steel fist in the velvet glove trouble short and long for openers , the target is small the green , which slopes back to front , appears even thinner than it is there is trouble short and there is trouble long virtually every ball that hits the bank , with the mystical exception of fred couples s shot that stayed up two years ago , winds up in rae s creek twin bunkers behind the green appear docile enough , but many players have hit their first shot into one of them , then hit their next shot back across the green into the creek and wound up having to go back to the drop zone , from where some have repeated the process hubert green did that in 1977 nick faldo did a variation of it in 1991 player once putted off the green and into the water on successive days of course , the most cataclysmic of all of no 12 s disasters belonged to tom weiskopf , who hit five balls into the water and carded a 13 on the hole in 1980 the mysterious winds that bounce and swirl down in amen corner add to the confusion ben hogan used to say that he would n't take the club back until he felt a puff of wind on his cheek there are myriad theories some players watch the dogwood tree to the right of the 13th tee supposedly , if it s moving , the wind is blowing on the 12th green try factoring that in when you 're one stroke out of the masters lead on sunday , and you could wind up like dan forsman last year a 7 to forget forsman trailed the eventual winner , bernhard langer , by one stroke when he took back his 7 iron and launched a shot he thought was on the green it never made it then his wedge shot from the drop zone spun back into the water he made a 7 and said he felt as though he had just painted a mustache on the mona lisa next year i'm going to lay up short of the water , is how forsman tried to joke about the hole that cost him a shot at his first major championship there are n't many jokes about no 12 it is the hardest hole on the golf course and i ca n't think of any funny way to put it , said tom watson it can get you , even if you think you 're playing it smart ask payne stewart during the final round in 1985 , he was in contention to win and hit an 8iron toward the middle of the green it flew just slightly , winding up in the back right bunker stewart s bunker shot ran right by the hole , into the creek from the drop zone , he spun another ball into the water overcompensating , he hit his next shot into the same bunker where it all began he finally got that on the green and twoputted for a 9 how can there be a tougher shot than that \? stewart asked plaintively some other votes greg norman thinks the second shot at no 13 from a hanging , downhill , hooking lie 195 yards out to a sliver of green might be tougher hale irwin and a few other players vote for the second shot at no 5 , where the elevated , undulating green requires a longiron approach and where three putts can be commonplace if the iron shot is n't on the correct side of the hump in the green fuzzy zoeller thinks it s the second shot at no 7 , where the smallest green on the course is surrounded by a sea of bunkers all those are secondary choices that unnerving tee shot at the 12th is the nearunanimous selection forsman knows why early this week , when he arrived at the 12th tee for his practice round , he was greeted by sympathetic applause is n't there something you do n't like about this hole \? his playing partner , mark calcavecchia , asked him yeah , forsman said , pointing to the back right pin position where that pin is well , calcavecchia said , it 'll be a lot easier this time and it was it always is on tuesday , wednesday , thursday , friday and even saturday but come sunday , the shortest tee shot becomes the hardest tee shot that s the way it has always been and always will be , so long as there is an amen corner and a masters
to the editor for a man who usually chooses his words so carefully , william safire is off the wall in describing hillary rodham clinton s commodity trading as bribery in its most modern form \( column , may 30 \) he offers no evidence and there is none of what he calls blatantly preferential treatment , trades made in their behalf with little or perhaps no clinton input or records strangely missing mrs clinton has made her own copies of her brokers' trading records public , and after she learned that the chicago mercantile exchange had its records , she sought out and disclosed them the exchange records essentially confirm and complement her copies of the brokers' records , although there are some gaps in each but as leo melamed , former head of the exchange , has explained , such gaps are not unusual , and nothing in the records suggests she violated any rule or that any of her trades were allocated to her by the brokerage firm to guarantee a profit mrs clinton made her own trading decisions , her money was at risk , she paid full commissions , and she made both profitable and unprofitable trades during the time she was in the market the account was in her name , and she was liable to the brokerage house for any losses she sustained , whatever the amount of margin required by her broker mr safire characterizes this not as bribery in its legal sense but as a subtle new bribery so subtle that he cannot articulate a plausible basis to call it bribery at all he relies on the merriamwebster third unabridged dictionary for a definition of bribery as a price , reward or gift bestowed or promised with a view to pervert the judgment or corrupt the conduct of a public official , but even this requires a who , a quid and a quo , none of which he supplies if he has tyson foods in mind because its outside counsel jim blair was a clinton friend and mrs clinton s trading adviser in 1978 , he fails to explain why tyson opposed bill clinton in his 1980 election campaign he also fails to explain why mr blair , with his supposed knack for allocating guaranteed profits to anyone he wanted , lost a bundle of his own by trading cattle futures in the months after mrs clinton left the market bribery is a serious and invidious charge it should not be made on the basis of mere hypothesis concerning a person or persons unknown , possibly acting through third parties that sounds most unlike the bill safire i know lloyd n cutler counsel to the president washington , june 2 , 1994
female genital mutilation \( circumcision \) , which has been condemned by international health reports as damaging to both physical and psychological health , is commonly inflicted at an early age an independent expert in the field estimates that 98 percent of somali females have undergone the operation it is common for procurers to advance the parents of young thai women a substantial sum against their future earnings the women are then obligated to work in a brothel for a fixed period of time in order to work off the loan according to an indian government study violence against women including wife murder \( dowry deaths \) has increased over the past decade in the typical dowry dispute , a groom s family will harass a woman they believe has not provided a sufficient dowry occasionally , this harassment ends in the woman s death tales from another , more brutal time \? not at all the examples above are from a state department report on 193 countries issued this month , and they make clear something that many people , and americans especially , may have forgotten the 21st century is only a few years away , but there are still places on this earth where it is a misfortune simply to have been born female this is the first time the state department has focused on women in its annual human rights report , and none too soon no one racial , religious or ethnic group has known discrimination as consistently as women have throughout recorded history forced sterilizations and abortions in china , rape as weapon in bosnia , maids beaten in saudi arabia the state department shines a welcome light on matters that have been too long in the dark one reason for the report s new focus is to step up the pressure on many countries to improve women s lives there is another way to turn up the heat as well although women in industrialized countries still have far to go on issues like equal pay and equal political representation , few suffer the brutalities experienced by their thirdworld sisters while continuing their legitimate struggles at home , they can also join the battle for women elsewhere , many of whom cannot even speak for themselves
mexico city , april 7 as the government presses its investigation into a possible conspiracy in the assassination of the heavily favored presidential candidate of the governing party , the man who investigators say has confessed to the murder has insisted that four other men charged with complicity are innocent in testimony on wednesday , the suspected assassin , mario aburto martinez , said he did not know the men whom prosecutors say spoke with him at a campaign rally on march 23 in the border city of tijuana and then helped him push through a clutch of bodyguards to reach the candidate , luis donaldo colosio i want to declare that those whom they are accusing are innocent , mr aburto , a 23yearold factory worker , was quoted today by his lawyer as having testified little damage to case seen legal experts said that mr aburto s assertion that he acted alone might not significantly hurt the prosecution s case but with official accounts of the shooting still raising many more questions than they answer , his testimony seemed to feed widespread skepticism that the government will ever bring to justice those responsible for mr colosio s death officials say investigators are operating from the belief that mr aburto s chaoticlooking rush through the crowd , captured on a videotape of the rally by agents of the federal attorney general s office , was in fact part of a coordinated operation by at least six men at least four of them , including two former police officers now in custody and another still being questioned , were hired by the local branch of the governing party to help with crowd control at the rally a fifth man charged with aiding mr aburto is the party official and former state police commander who recruited them none of the suspects seem to have any clear motives of their own for killing mr colosio , however , and officials say they were probably hired by others three officials familiar with the investigation said it had yet to turn up any clear evidence pointing to who might be behind the murder despite the claim of a 16yearold girl courted by mr aburto , officials say they have found no proof that he had ties either to the southern state of chiapas or the mostly mayan indian peasants who rebelled there three months ago nor have they been able to identify a group that mr aburto said he belonged to but refused to identify a united states official said fbi agents had questioned friends and relatives of mr aburto in southern california and pursued reports that he might have ties to street gangs or other groups there , but without any evident success policeman linked to suspect in an interview in the san pedro section of los angeles , however , mr aburto s father , ruben , said his son had told him of having been befriended by one of the former police officers now jailed as his accomplice , vicente mayoral valenzuela without offering any proof , some mexican officials have begun to suggest privately that drug traffickers could have killed mr colosio to destabilize the country the attorney general s office has also churned out a pile of recent reports on its efforts to stop the flow of illegal drugs across the border to the united states officials said agents working under the special prosecutor in the case , miguel montes garcia , were following up the arrests announced on monday by questioning scores of people , including governing party officials in baja california state who organized mr colosio s rally but the officials said that despite mr montes s assertion on monday that two thenunidentified men seen on the videotape had also aided mr aburto in the killing , one who promptly turned himself in to the authorities , salvador hernandez tomasini , still had not been arrested this afternoon

white plains , dec 17 david alven was the first to speak up on the morning that he and several other haggard jurors asked judge joseph goldstein to join them in the jury room their complaint was simple enough the grueling fourmonth civil trial was beginning to take its toll i saw my doctor on friday , mr alven , 58 , a stockbroker , explained to the judge and i 've been under treatment for years and years for high blood pressure he did a double take and said 'my god , what s going on here \? this is the highest it s been in years are you under stress \? ' soon the other jurors were chiming in al calabrese , a selfemployed business consultant , complained to the judge that he was losing money ola nosseir worried that her job as an account manager for a telecommunications company was in jeopardy and guelda sherman , a cellist , lamented that her professional and social life would be in disarray during the upcoming holidays the next day , judge goldstein declared a mistrial and sent the jurors home the outcome of the case earlier this month which involved a libel lawsuit filed against new rochelle hospital by a former employee might seem a bit extreme but the plaintiff s lawyer argued that the jurors were so upset that they would not be able to deliberate fairly and made a motion for a mistrial that the judge ultimately granted in a very dramatic way , the case which after four months was not even close to being sent to the jury illustrates the daytoday hardships that citizens face when they are called on to play their role in a democratic judicial system as mr calabrese , the jury s 68yearold foreman , put it the jury system weighs very heavily on jurors each one of us were hurting to some degree because of our service indeed , the plight of jurors has become so dire in new york state that a panel created by the state s two top judges chief judge judith s kaye and the chief administrative judge , e leo milonas recently proposed changes like abolishing mandatory sequestering and increasing juror stipends many other states have concluded that their jury systems do not work and have considered measures like limiting the number of challenges that lawyers can use to dismiss a prospective juror but legal experts say no such reform could have prevented the unusual crisis here many feel the jurors here sacrificed well beyond their civic obligation in a case that seemed to reel out of control indeed , the jurors on several occasions asked the judge to speed up the trial anybody who takes four months to try a libel case should have a jury revolt , said colleen mcmahon , who headed the committee that recommended changes in new york s jury system it s ridiculous ms mcmahon also said that the jurors should have been told ahead of time that the trial was going to drag on as long as it did you ca n't impose a sixmonth trial on people without warning them , she said none of the jurors had been given any such warning when the trial began during the first week of august , according to people involved with the case the jurors were in the courtroom from about 9 am to 5 pm each weekday in fact , mr calabrese , the jury foreman , said he asked to be excused shortly after the jury was chosen because he was worried that the trial might go longer than a few weeks but judge goldstein convinced him to stay by appealing to his sense of civic duty they have to tell the new jurors how long they expect the trial to be next time , insisted mr calabrese , who had to schedule three minor surgical procedures around it there is no shortage of finger pointing lawyers for the woman suing the hospital argue that the trial was delayed because the defense spent far too much time crossexamining the plaintiff s witnesses and continually challenged evidence as it was presented the woman , barbara kraus , filed the lawsuit in 1988 after members of the hospital s medical board voted that they had no confidence in her ability as a nursing supervior ms kraus , who was subsequently fired , claims she was libeled when the vote was published in a hospital newsletter this woman has been dangling for years , complained her lawyer , anthony j pirrotti , who said he plans to pursue the suit what does this say about the law and its ability to adequately respond \? meantime , henry miller , a lawyer for the hospital , laid responsibility entirely on the plaintiff s lawyers , whom he described as repetitious and unfocused in their presentation to emphasize his point , he noted that the plaintiff s lawyers had not even finished presenting their case at the time the mistrial was declared i was as stunned as anyone at the slowness of this trial , said mr miller , who likened the jurors to martyrs we did n't even get a chance to present our case he also objected to the decision to throw out the case can you imagine the expense and inconvenience \? he said we felt we had a chance of being vindicated and wanted to go through with it to hear the jurors tell it , their patience began wearing thin after the trial dragged on and on with repetitive testimony the most striking example was the fact that it took a total of 24 days for two witnesses to complete their testimony , mr calabrese said on at least three occasions , he added , the jurors asked judge goldstein to hurry the trial along because it was beginning to put a tremendous strain on them consider the case of mr alven , the stockbroker who complained to the judge that his blood pressure was rising he tried to keep up with his job responsibilities by getting to his office as early as 6 30 am , a few hours before the trial started there were also times that he spent his lunch break working at the office but he eventually fell so far behind that his best client threatened to take his business to another stockbroker ms nosseir , the corporate account manager , had similar problems in her case , things got so bad at work that her colleagues had to help out by visiting clients on her behalf and she would often have to stay up until 1 am completing office work at home it was upheaval , ms nosseir said the showdown came on the morning of dec 5 when the jurors met with judge goldstein to express their growing anxiety i just have to , for the sake of my career , be excused no later than the first of january , mr alven pleaded with the judge and i think that s pushing it , to be honest with you he added i think we are really at a critical stage now i know i am i am close to breaking financially and other ways other jurors agreed and even offered to devote longer hours to the trial to bring it to a quick end patience is running thin with my employer , edward hayde , another juror , complained to the judge i just had a performance evaluation in which the results were less than i expected reference was made to this protracted trial the outburst might not have amounted to anything had there not been a strange occurrence several days earlier mr miller , the hospital s lawyer , received an anonymous phone call from a man who said that the lawyers should move the trial along because the jurors had already reached a verdict mr pirrotti , the plaintiff s lawyer , said he had no choice but to ask for a mistrial in light of the strange events something was going on , he said i'm staring at trouble at that point as for the jurors , many expressed disappointment that they sacrificed part of their lives for no good reason i was absolutely shocked that there was a mistrial , ms nosseir said i still feel very weird about it i feel very guilty my conscience is eating away at me i started something i did n't finish
setting off a dispute between industry giants , the international business machines corporation yesterday took the highly unusual step of suspending sales of all its personal computers using the intel corporation s most powerful chip because of a flaw in the device although the problem with intel s chip , known as the pentium , has been widely publicized for more than a month , ibm said it had decided to halt shipments at the height of the busiest season for personal computer sales after determining that the risk of error may be significantly higher for common calculations than intel has indicated intel has contended that the flaw , in the part of the chip that performs mathematical division calculations , is so trivial that an average person may encounter a problem only once in 27 , 000 years of normal use but researchers at ibm said yesterday that they had concluded the flaw could arise as frequently as once every 24 days for an average user some three million to four million computers using the pentium have been sold since the chip was introduced in may 1993 , and more than two million of those machines are susceptible to the calculation error , ibm said but intel accused ibm , once one of its biggest allies but now potentially a big competitor , of overstating the pentium s problems intel s stock plunged yesterday morning after ibm s announcement , before trading in the shares was halted the stock recovered somewhat when trading resumed a few hours later , after intel issued its rebuttal , but still ended the day down 2375 , at 60375 page d8 ibm said it would work with intel and with its customers to correct the problem , either by replacing the flawed chips with improved versions that will become available in several months or by releasing a software program that disables the faulty portion of the chip in the meantime , intel will continue to distribute the flawed chips but some analysts said yesterday that ibm might have mixed motives in criticizing the pentium they noted that ibm was developing its own chip to rival intel s and some said that because three of ibm s rivals gateway 2000 , dell computer and packard bell have each sold far more pentium machines than ibm , the company might be attempting to spoil sales in a part of the personal computer market in which it is trailing only about 5 percent of personal computers sold by ibm contain the pentium chip ibm has more to gain than to lose by raising questions about the quality of the pentium chip , said ted waitt , chief executive of gateway 2000 , a directmail computer supplier that is largest seller of pentiumbased machines mr waitt said that so far none of his customers had reported trouble with machines because of the chip s flaw , but that gateway would replace the chip if a user had problems whatever its motivation , by issuing its report ibm has called into question the accuracy of mathematical calculations performed on millions of the most powerful personal computers used by businesses and consumers including computers made by ibm itself analysts said the report could hurt sales of all personal computers based on intel s flagship chip , at least until the technical issue was resolved at the very least , ibm s move is a public relations nightmare for intel and is certain to further sour relations between intel and ibm , two of the biggest companies in the personal computer industry intel s fortunes rose after ibm chose it to provide the chips for the original ibm pc in 1981 and ibm is the largest customer for intel , the leading maker of the computer brain chips known as microprocessors but ibm has indicated that it will base its future computer designs on its own microprocessor , called the power pc , and thus is poised to become intel s rival many large organizations , including banks , financial brokerage firms , insurance companies and government agencies , have already installed thousands of pentiumbased computers , which are also mainstays in the scientific and engineering communities and so , ibm said , a computational mistake as often as every 24 days for an individual computer user could have a serious impact on large organizations for a customer with 500 pentiumbased pc s , this could result in as many as 20 mistakes a day , ibm s research report said william r pulleyblank , director of mathematical sciences at ibm s watson research center at yorktown heights , ny , said a simulation of the types of calculations that would be done in common spreadsheet operations revealed a risk analysis that was vastly different from intel s mr pulleyblank also noted a growing stream of error reports posted by users of the global internet computer network but john r thompson , an intel spokesman , said yesterday that despite all the attention the chip s flaw had received in recent weeks , only one pentium user , a professor of mathematics , had demonstrated an empirical error in the chip
san francisco the san francisco 49ers are edgy they are tense some players describe it as good tension there s some good tension here and it s nice to feel that , said offensive tackle steve wallace that s a lot more than we had going into the monday night game and the christmas day game the monday night game was a seasonending 3734 overtime loss here to the nonplayoff philadelphia eagles the christmas day game was a 107 loss here to the houston oilers two straight 49ers losses to end the season at home in candlestick park two of six total losses this season by the 49ers of the eight remaining playoff teams , only the green bay packers , who came in with a 97 record , have more losses good tension for the giants game , that s what the 49ers say they clash this afternoon with the giants here at candlestick for a trip to the nfc championship game , but really , this good tension is a solid heap of doubt the 49ers know they are not the dominant team of the 1980 s that used to enter these affairs with supreme confidence and an effective calm there are chinks in their armor now some fans are expecting them to beat the giants by at least a touchdown , but you get the feeling this team thinks the game will be much closer than that they are worried about their defense it finished ranked 16th over all and dead last in average yards per carry allowed \( 45 \) in their four biggest losses , it allowed 51 yards per carry none of the starting defensive linemen has ever seen action in a playoff game they are concerned over rodney hampton and the giants' bruising offensive line they are wondering whether jerry rice will shake free of the giants' defensive spell on him they wonder how steve young will seize the moment young has all of these wonderful numbers including three straight league passing titles but he has not won a super bowl game young knows he is under scrutiny to me , it s a great opportunity to not only validate but put an exclamation point on what we 've been doing all season , young said all i want to do is win the super bowl it has been a heck of a year for the 49ers it began in the off season with the joe montana circus was he going \? would he stay \? was he the starter \? montana finally left , following stars such as roger craig and ronnie lott and charles haley pierce holt jumped to atlanta new faces emerged on the defense , and it undeniably slipped the offense hummed along , topping the league , but , like everyone else s , it hit snags , too everything began with montana , said fullback marc logan at one time , it was like montana was a ghost around here , a legendary ghost whose shoes would be hard to fill actually , they could n't be filled we finally had to get to the point where we said 'ok , montana is not here and he wo n't be here but we 've got one of the best , if not the best , quarterbacks in the league let s go forward' i do n't think that really happened until early into the season the losses came at cleveland \( 2313 \) , at new orleans \( 1613 \) , at dallas \( 2617 \) , at atlanta \( 2724 \) and home against philadelphia and houston the dallas loss was excruciating for the 49ers dallas had whipped them in the nfc championship game last season , and the 49ers looked at the rematch as a chance to reaffirm their standing as top dog the only thing it reaffirmed was that they were still second fiddle to the cowboys then two straight losses to end the regular season sowed more seeds of doubt sure , especially in the philadelphia loss , stars including young were rested in the second half you have a certain amount of information and you go with it and make a decision , the 49ers' coach , george seifert , said about resting players before the playoffs there s nothing we can do about it now you just hope it was the right thing the 49ers know they have the ability to handle the giants they have more speed on offense and a more mobile quarterback they want to score and score again and push the points in the game into the high 20 s or even 30 s but because of hampton and because of their defense , the 49ers know that the style and the tempo of the game are up for grabs how many teams have you seen play the game in one style for 16 games and then accomplish a complete reversal \? that s what the 49ers seek , a run defense and overall defense that are dominant and an offense that maximizes its glowing potential the two mixed as one it is a tough feat when you have not done so consistently that is why there is tension here whether it was good or bad is decided only upon the game s finish
fort lauderdale , fla , march 13 nick price , playing nearly perfect golf , came from three strokes behind today to win the honda classic and forcefully state his case for consideration as the world s best golfer in a display that was as close to an airtight round of golf as anyone has played in a final round since david graham hit every fairway and every green in the final round of the united states open at merion in 1981 , price , 37 , hit all 18 greens and missed only one fairway he shot 66 for a total of 276 , eight under par , and beat craig parry , who shot 67 , by one stroke all i tried to do was not make any mistakes , said price , who only made one , threeputting the 15th hole i got off to a good start and never looked back i just kept hitting the ball in the fairway and on the green threatened a bit it was a frighteningly precise display by price , who has won 12 tournaments since his breakthrough victory at the pga championship 18 months ago he began the day with birdies on the first two holes , took the lead with a birdie at the sixth hole and never relinquished it he was threatened three times first , john daly bombed his way into contention , with birdies on three of the first nine holes , moving within a shot of the lead when he got to four under par at the eighth hole but daly , making his first tournament appearance since being suspended four months ago , scored 10 consecutive pars from there and finished tied for fourth at 280 i focused on every shot and played my heart out , daly said if i was wearing a hat right now i 'd take it off to myself i'm real proud brushing away disaster the overnight leader , brandel chamblee , looking for his first victory , picked himself up after a disastrous start early in the round , he lost four strokes in the first five holes and pulled within a stroke of price with three birdies in a sevenhole stretch but chamblee dropped another shot at the 15th hole and ultimately shot 71 to finish alone in third , two shots back then came parry , the australian who has 11 victories abroad but none in the united states he played the first 14 holes in three under par , and when price threeputted the 15th , he found himself only a stroke behind i looked at the scoreboard and thought i 'd have a chance , parry said nick was playing awfully well , but things can happen on those finishing holes things can and did happen first it was price , staring at a 25foot birdie putt as it worked its way downhill at the 17th hole and disappeared into the cup as price leaped into the air that gave him a twostroke margin and seemed to close out the tournament i do n't think i 've ever been so excited to hole a putt , price said i do n't know how high i jumped i was a bit worried i might split my pants the birdie put price at eight under par he figured he could play the 18th safely in regulation , and he did but right behind him was parry , who was not done yet his 5iron shot into the 214yard hole came up short , but he then stunned the huge crowd surrounding the green by chipping in for birdie from 60 feet to pull within a stroke with one hole left now it was down to this parry and price both live in orlando , fla , and travel together on the tour price , in fact , gave parry a ride to the tournament in the new jetstar airplane he bought from greg norman this was parry s best chance to ground his highflying buddy he drove down the middle , laid up with a 2iron to the right side of the fairway and found himself in between clubs , 120 yards from the pin with price watching from the scorer s tent , parry tried to take a little bit off the 9iron shot and wound up pushing it some 20 yards right and long a birdie from there was nearly impossibile i suppose if you took 15 balls there you might have a chance to hole one of them , parry said he had only one chance and it never threatened the hole price , the 1993 pga tour player of the year , was the winner in only his second start of the year in the united states a winner of few words price collected 198 , 000 for the victory last year , he won 27 million around the world in a symbolic footnote to price s incredible 18month run , he passed jack nicklaus on the career money list with earnings of 5 , 427 , 207 it s really hard to put into words how well things have fallen into place for me , price said today was another case i did all the things i had to do i went out there and won the tournament to come from behind to win is very rewarding and , judging by the level of play price displayed this week , this is only the beginning of a reprise photo nick price with his crystal trophy after his onestroke victory in the honda classic yesterday in fort lauderdale , fla \( associated press \)
two giant national advertisers are taking widely disparate approaches on homosexuality and advertising that underscore how this contentious issue continues to divide marketers on one hand , kraft general foods is asking that none of its commercials appear during an episode of the abc sitcom roseanne , scheduled to be broadcast next tuesday night the episode , already the subject of much publicity , centers on a kiss the eponymous star , roseanne arnold , receives from the actress mariel hemingway , who portrays a lesbian no kgf commercials can run in the episode , read an internal memorandum sent inadvertently yesterday to reporters by a kraft general foods agency , grey advertising inc in new york the reason , according to the memorandum , was because it deals with homosexuality on the other hand , the american express company has become one of the biggest mainstream marketers to run advertising in magazines aimed at gay consumers even tailoring some generalmarket advertisements to those publications american express and its agency , ogilvy mather worldwide in new york , have created special versions of ads for cheques for two , traveler s checks that can be used by a couple together or separately rather than featuring the signatures of husbands and wives , as the regular ads do , the special ads , in out and 10 percent magazines , display the signatures of two men and two women the sharply varied approaches of the two marketers is emblematic of a rambunctious debate roiling corporate america some marketers are attracted by data showing high education levels and relative affluence among gay customers , making them demographically desirable to pursue even at a risk of offending consumers who disdain homosexuality yet the vast majority of marketers have continued decadesold policies of shunning any involvement or association with homosexuals because of the pervasive societal stigma surrounding homosexuality and concerns that they might be subjected to consumer boycotts it is a fact of life we have to face and deal with , sandra lucot , the publisher of 10 percent in new york , said it all comes down to education , she added we need to be like the wizard of oz and give them the courage to jump into the market among those now aiming sales pitches at gay men and lesbians are apple computer , calvin klein , grand metropolitan , sony and time warner even the miller brewing company and philip morris usa , corporate siblings of kraft general foods , buy ads for beer and cigarettes in publications aimed at the gay market michael goff , editor and president of out in new york , contrasted the approaches of kraft general foods and american express , noting that television is something very different from a gay magazine , which is being read by a selfselected group of people still , he chastised marketers like kraft general foods , which , he said , were blocked by their fear from dealing with america as it is the grey memorandum represents a typical admonition from massmarket packagedgoods advertisers like kraft general foods , which tend to be more traditional in their marketing strategies it also urged that spots not appear during a repeat episode of roseanne last night , dealing with masturbation , and a repeat episode of law and order tonight on nbc , dealing with racism it s a very routine procedure , patrick farrell , a kraft general foods spokesman in northfield , ill , said the company was not scheduled to buy national commercial time during the three programs , he said , adding that the memorandum was intended to avoid running the company s spots in local station breaks the memorandum s contents became known because grey , which handles spot , or local , television buying for kraft general foods , mistakenly faxed it to reporters rather than to its intended recipients , local television stations and advertising representative sales firms across the country everybody is concerned about the content of the shows where their commercials play , said larry hoffner , executive vice president for sales at nbc in new york there 'll always be something in some episodes that will offend some advertisers even so , there are some advertisers not quite as sensitive to some issues as others , he added and sometimes an advertiser coming out of a show might say , see if you could put me in next week' roseanne has already suffered its share of advertiser walkouts steve battaglio , a spokesman for abc in new york , said it is too early to determine the advertising situation for the lesbian kiss episode but whenever we 've had advertiser concern lead to a pullout , he added , we 've always found an advertiser available to step in and buy at a good price american express expressed no qualms about its gaythemed ads , which it plans to run through the fall the most notable change from the regular campaign is that the sample traveler s checks are signed by robert stevenson and matt howell in out , and by amy mulligan and nancy russo in 10 percent we felt that would help communicate the central benefit of the product , cherie winkler , manager of north america advertising for traveler s checks in new york , said it s part of an effort to make sure we 're reaching all of our potential users ms winkler played down the possibility of american express being boycotted by consumers angered by the gaythemed ads i really do n't think so , she said we are certainly not the only company doing this true , but do n't expect kraft general foods to join american express any time soon

when america has been looking for a laughingstock in the 1990 s , there have been few better candidates than marion barry , the former mayor of washington the videotape of his humiliating fbi bust at the vista hotel four years ago is now as indelible as most washington monuments and , to those who enjoy melodramatic morality tales , vastly more entertaining but the easy jokes have always left me a little uncomfortable while mr barry s behavior was reprehensible in the final , disastrous years of his 12year rule of the nation s capital , was n't his downfall more depressing than comic \? i grew up in prehomerule washington and remember the barry of more than a quartercentury ago , who spoke up eloquently for the rights of a mostly black city that was ruled like a plantation by racist congressmen perhaps this is why the new latenight gags and the widespread tuttutting about mr barry s shocking , incredible , terrifying you pick the adjective comeback last week also give me pause the moralizing seems a bit pat as the received wisdom has it , mr barry suckered the city s monolithic black underclass into registering and voting for him by making demagogic hay of his professed recovery from crack addiction , alcoholism and womanizing the two other black candidates , both vying for the responsible middle class , were doomed might there be another perspective , less in thrall to racial cliches and battle lines , that does n't portray mr barry as a machiavellian rogue and many of his voters as an easily deluded mob \? trying to find such a fresh take , i spoke to the least chronicled and stereotyped , but most closeted , of all barry primary voters his few white supporters in the city s only remaining solidly white enclave , ward 3 , my old neighborhood given that mr barry got only 601 votes out of 17 , 451 cast in ward 3 , one of which was my father s , i was able to interview 2 percent of this anomalous group most said they voted for mr barry only after being convinced that his recovery was for real all cited his political cunning and unsung intellectual and budgetary acuity , noting the educational history that left him just short of a doctorate none defended the swan dive of his previous reign he s a disgrace to our city , but he s probably the smartest guy around , said lewis mulitz , 68 , who is the ceo of a small steel company according to john plunket , a 38yearold businessman in realestate finance barry unhobbled by the use of drugs is a very capable guy his fault was giving into weaknesses of the flesh he was a crackhead and drank brandy all the time , and he does n't anymore the most unlikely of the barry voters i found was emily vetter , 44 , president of the city s hotel association , a trade group whose livelihood is tied to washington s \( not to mention the vista hotel s \) good name she feels mr barry has aggressive ideas to rein in crime and the city budget , but is treated hypocritically let s talk about betty ford , ms vetter said her problem was no secret and she recovered and helped a lot of people barry let down this entire city , but you have to see what people do with the rest of their lives he does not want to be remembered as that man in the vista hotel room he has a lot to prove my republican husband , who is totally apolitical , went to the barry headquarters and got a sign and put it in our front lawn his attitude is , get over it he s the best man for the job of the barry voters i queried , only one attacked the media for caricaturing the candidate my father he was enraged that nbc ran the fbi video while polls were still open and objects that mr barry , who did time for a misdemeanor , is more often referred to as a criminal than is oliver north , who escaped a felony conviction on a technicality dad , now 73 , is a businessman whose f street store never recovered after being looted in the 1968 riots he ended up working for the barry administration to help redevelop downtown this year he agonized until the last minute over his vote and may agonize again between now and november my father and i do n't always see eye to eye about politics , but in a racially apocalyptic city with dwindling options , openmindedness like his is one of the few alternatives left to all the cynical , deadend jokes
saddle brook , nj , june 10 federal and new jersey guncontrol laws are intended to control purchases of handguns by those who have been committed to mental institutions or received any kind of psychiatric treatment but the law s provisions are not ironclad loopholes and vaguely worded restrictions in both laws have come to light in the aftermath of the shooting of four guests at a hotel pool here by a 46yearold man who the authorities say has been treated for paranoid schizophrenia for the last 10 years new jersey s guncontrol laws , among the strictest in the nation , prohibit the mentally ill from buying , selling , using or carrying firearms any resident wanting to buy a handgun has to file an application with the local police department it requires the reporting of any kind of institutionalization and psychiatric care , whether in a hospital , a mentalhealth center or a psychiatrist s private office applicants are also required to waive the privilege of patientpsychiatrist confidentiality and allow police authorities to review their mentalhealth files based on the review , the authorities can reject the application no check for newcomers but legal owners of handguns moving into new jersey mentally ill or not face none of this careful scrutiny once they arrive in new jersey , they are not even required to register their handguns with the authorities , according to a state police firearms investigator , detective sgt john sherrard if their job requires them to carry a loaded handgun , they must get a permit that requires a mental health check but new residents , regardless of their mental health history , who come with a handgun bought legally in another state can keep the weapon legally at home without obtaining a permit or any kind of background check , sergeant sherrard said in short , this is how the suspect in the saddle brook shootings , henry levy , came to new jersey from arizona with a 9millimeter ruger semiautomatic model p89 pistol and , the authorities said , calmly sprayed bullets from it at four men sitting at a round , white table , playing cards , at the edge of a swimming pool at the howard johnsonplaza hotel john j fahy , the bergen county prosecutor , said mr levy mistakenly thought the four men had been harassing his 12yearold daughter at the pool we have no indication she was bothered or hassled by these people , mr fahy said from february to late may , mr levy his wife , susan , their 17yearold son and their daughter lived in phoenix for the previous 10 years , the family lived in ridgewood , nj over that time , mr fahy said , mr levy left his job as an insurance salesman because of mental disability , was treated for psychiatric problems for two weeks in bergen pines county hospital and was under the care of a psychiatrist he took two drugs for his ailment , prozac , an antidepressant , and trilafon , an antipsychotic , mr fahy said mr fahy said today that his staff was still trying learn whether mr levy had been faithfully taking the medications in recent days before moving to arizona , mr levy went to the ridgewood police last year and got an application to buy a handgun , ridgewood s chief , louis j mader , said today but mr levy never returned to the station with the application filled out , chief mader said no inquiries were made about why , he said based on information from mrs levy , mr fahy said the family went to phoenix to begin a new life he said he had no information about why mr levy bought the handgun arizona has liberal laws on buying and possessing firearms the state s only requirement for handgun buyers is to have a valid driver s license or some other form of photographic identification verifying arizona residency , said sgt michael torres , a spokesman for the phoenix police arizona s gun law requires none of new jersey s provisions for reporting on mentalhealth history the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms is now trying to learn when and where mr levy bought the gun federal officials said they expected to complete the tracing by monday the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms requires that an application be filled out for overthecounter sales of firearms in all states the form s question on mentalhealth history is far less detailed than new jersey s and is vaguer it requires an applicant to state whether he has ever been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution the phrasing implies that a judge must make a declaration of mentally defective and that any institutionalization be involuntary the question does not appear to require any answer from an applicant who is willingly undergoing psychiatric care in late may , mr fahy said , the levys tired of arizona because they missed family and friends and returned to new jersey they were staying at the hotel here while house hunting officials at both the hotel and the adjacent pool and exercise club said today that mr levy had done little to attract attention before thursday s shooting a witness , philip callahan of clifton , nj , said today that mr levy had paced the pool area for about 90

johannesburg , may 3 soon enough the doubts will niggle at the new south africa what unity \? someone will ask of the socalled government of national unity , which attempts to harness the wild ambitions of rival politicians to common purpose graphs will appear demonstrating that social justice and economic growth are irreconcilable the rainbow memory of voting day will dissolve in the realization that most voters , once they got inside the booth , voted along racial lines the killing may resume but this week south africans have been buoyed above selfdoubt by the evidence of their own resilience the same nation that a year ago watched rioters in the streets after the killing of a black liberation hero , chris hani , watched mr hani s widow twist the cork from a bottle of champagne monday night and pour for nelson mandela , who toasted his former enemies live on national television i'm at a loss for words , other than 'miraculous , ' to describe how this country in spite of everything has pulled itself together and got on with it , said athol fugard , the playwright mr fugard tuned in last night to the two main actors in this national drama , listening for a single meanspirited note and hearing none from either president f w de klerk , conceding power , or mr mandela , accepting power i'm not exaggerating , but i was close to tears , sitting in my apartment and listening on the radio , the writer said hearing these two men , one in a sense the loser and the other in a sense the victor , and both of them passionate in their vision of a south africa that embraced everybody south africa has endured a cannonade of crises that would have left another country crippled and despairing homeland coups , a gun battle in the business district , fratricidal political violence , a state of emergency , an expose of police atrocities , car bombs and that is just in the last six weeks casting hindsight further back , across the massacres and withering drought and 20 years of steady economic decline and the cruelties of apartheid itself , what reason was there to suspect that south africa would not only muddle this far on its feet , but also emerge from white rule with an elegance of spirit \? one possible explanation for the feat is that apartheid itself gave south africans , those who benefited from the system and those who opposed it , a useful ability to live with the unthinkable and adapt to the imperfect validating a flawed vote the election , for example , was a clumsy improvisation , so riddled with irregularities that the electoral commission threw away the rulebook in order to validate the outcome this , a columnist observed today , might have been the tinder of civil war in any other nation holding a first election' ' but here , perhaps because the overall winner was never in doubt and most parties are assured a seat in the new government anyway , or perhaps because the fiasco seemed like so much else of south african life , no one seized on the failings as an excuse to walk out the campaign itself was haunted by the brinkmanship of afrikaner and zulu nationalists and marred by violent intolerance , racebaiting and redbaiting yet it ended with the prospect of a coalition government including most of the main rivals , and with a rhetorical exchange of power stirring in its highmindedness mr fugard speculates that the explanation may be in the histories of african and afrikaner , who unlike most oppressed and oppressors share a sense of what freedom is about from their separate experiences of having fought against colonialism \( the afrikaners resisted british rule \) sampie terreblanche , an economic historian at the university of stellenbosch , said the real explanation for south africa s endurance of so much misery is that the rulers had an impoverished black majority to bear it for them who bore the real burden \? the worst knocks the poverty , criminality in the townships , the violence were shifted to the poorest of the black population , he said , a luxury the country can no longer get away with bafana khumalo , a critic at the weekly mail newspaper , said the country puts up with so much out of fatigue and an innate pragmatism blacks , he said , are too tired for revenge , and realize it wo n't restore slain relatives and bulldozed houses anyway the reason there has n't been much of a call for nuremberg trials , i suppose , is that nobody really wants to go through all that again , he said mr khumalo , who prides himself on a hip cynicism that stands up well to national euphoria , has found his attitude hard to hold in the last week no thrill in voting first he told friends he would not vote at all because he hated standing in line then he happened upon a polling place with no line , so he voted , but insisted he felt no thrill of democratic sentiment on sunday he switched on the television and heard the returns from the western cape , the one province where mr de klerk s national party was winning all i saw was this tally showing the anc getting pulverized by the national party , he said i did n't understand , and the tv did n't explain i said , 'oh god , here we go again' it really freaked me out i spent the day glued to the tv until i saw the anc getting somewhere only then was it safe to go back to being cynical photo members of the african national congress student league holding a rally in downtown johannesburg yesterday to celebrate the congress s election victory and to commemorate the students who died over the years in the fight against apartheid \( ozier muhammad the new york times \) \( pg a8 \)
early in the hyacinth macaw , mac wellman s entertainingly immoderate portrait of america adrift \( at primary stages \) , a sinister stranger announces what could be the play s credo what s real has no name none whatever there s certainly no reason to doubt that the assertion holds true in mr wellman s anomic universe but that does n't stop the play s characters from trying their hardest to describe the undescribable words spew out of them in an untrammeled flow of logorrhea plain words , fancy words , spaceage words , victorian words and words that defy the dictionary they pile up in towering , flamboyant catalogues , only to topple into chasms of inanity know what tantalum means \? or an infinite ergo of ergots \? or an entrechat of enthymemes \? not to worry mr wellman s characters do n't necessarily know either this playwright uses words the way harold pinter uses pauses to create an undefinable , omnipresent sense of menace and in the world of the hyacinth macaw , things are really falling apart fast the nuclear family is undergoing nuclear fission memory lies individual identity is uncertain , and the moon , we are told , is very , very sick set in the town of gradual which has a gym , a school , a mall , all the normal things , as one character puts it the play reintroduces susannah , the oracular teenager from a murder of crows , mr wellman s 1992 play here , susannah \( francie swift \) has an entirely new family \( no mention is made of her previous one \) and seems to have abandoned her penchant for apocalyptic weather forecasts so is susannah s new family her real one \? does it matter \? the play begins with the arrival of a creepy man in black named mr william hard \( yusef bulos \) who tells her , in a voice that might come from a crypt , that she s an orphan , a rootless , yankedup thing whether or not this is true , she 'll soon become one mr hard , acting on orders from an authority beyond rebuke in mimbreland , the land of evening , has come to replace susannah s father , ray \( steve mellor \) , who turns out to be a pneumatic redundancy following a course of induction that resembles shock therapy , ray disappears into mimbreland dora \( melissa smith \) , susannah s dryly pragmatic mother , is seduced into eloping with mad wu \( bob kirsh \) , a homeless man who wears white tails over an aviator suit and susannah is left alone with mr hard to assist in a ritualistic burial that will mean now we all , each and everyone , are orphans that s pretty much what plot there is in the hyacinth macaw , which has been directed with exceptional polish by marcus stern most of the evening is devoted to feverish , selfimploding monologues that mix cornbelt cliches , silly ontological meditations and epigramlaced purple passages that strangely suggest ronald firbank \( the world is complex , says mad wu it contains little things like tantalum and the large intestine \) as usual , mr wellman lards his text with subversive distortions of homespun american mythology emersonian selfreliance , calvinist industriousness , anglosaxon xenophobia and puritanical sexual guilt are all turned inside out in laundry lists of phrases that seem to have been culled from a toxic dump of language ray , in a farewell speech to his family , speaks of condoms , cigars , saltpeter and cryptic notes inscribed on paper towels in the cafeterias of junior colleges at shenango i know , i know it sounds excruciating an anthology of tropes about the decaying of the american dream that have been floating around off broadway for at least several decades mr wellman is indeed working ground that has been thoroughly tilled by edward albee and sam shepard , among others and earlier this season , richard greenspan s son of an engineer tackled the theme of america as a nation of orphans with very queasy results mr wellman , however , transcends staleness through sheer linguistic energy he may use language to show its devaluation , but he is also insanely in love with it much of his dialogue seems annoyingly pretentious out of context , and , thematically , the play does n't warrant endless reflection but in the performance , the work has an invigorating cumulative effect the actors in the hyacinth macaw bear a heavy burden in sustaining the momentum of mr wellman s wordfests one slip in delivery can make the entire play go slack fortunately , there s scarcely a false note here , with each actor wisely resisting the temptation to go for easy , quotationmark irony the lovely ms swift projects aliceinwonderland ingenuousness without ever descending to cuteness mr mellor , a veteran of wellman plays with a gift for wicked body language , turns ray s epic monologues into witty st vitus dances mr bulos s deadpan , mephistophelean manner is exactly right for a man from mimbreland and ms smith is so persuasive as the weary dora , who does n't believe her hoary truisms but forces them out anyway , that one forgets how tired of the shorthand of a donna reed costume to evoke american motherhood has become the production has been beautifully mounted kyle chepulis s scenic design with its butteryellow walls , white picket fence , cookiecutter sun and cancerouslooking moon neatly suggests an artificial , provisional environment , while his use of luridly colored lights hints at the frightening abysses behind it the richard foremanesque use of microphones is , for once , just right , thanks to the sound designer john huntington and david van tieghem s haunting , otherworldly music superbly matches both the dread and the wistfulness of the script in his dracula , which was recently produced at the soho rep , mr wellman created a stylish , canny elegy for the end of the 19th century the hyacinth macaw finds him equally at ease in another century drawing anxiously to a close in one monologue , ray talks about a finer , better world , with tighter tolerance , glossier paint , and more in the way of enhanced structural impeccability that s obviously not mr wellman s world the one he portrays is disjunctive , ambiguous , excessive so is his play and that s perfectly all right the hyacinth macaw by mac wellman directed by marcus stern sets and lighting by kyle chepulis costumes by robin j orloff sound by john huntington music by david van tieghem production stage manager , kristen harris dramaturg , marc robinson presented by primary stages company , casey childs , artistic director at primary stages , 354 west 45th street , clinton susannah francie swift mr william hard yusef bulos dora melissa smith ray steve mellor mad wu bob kirsh
aaron halberstam , the 15yearold student who was the most seriously injured victim of yesterday s shooting on the brooklyn bridge , was known throughout the lubavitch hasidic community for his exceptionally close relationship to the family of rabbi menachem m schneerson , the group s grand rabbi friends of the halberstam family and lubavitch officials said yesterday that the shooting , which left mr halberstam in grave condition with an inoperable brain injury at st vincent s hospital and medical center , was an especially heavy blow for rabbi schneerson because he had personally tutored the boy in the hebrew alphabet eight or nine years ago it was a very rare privilege , said baruch thaler , a friend and fellow student of mr halberstam at the oholei torah yeshiva , where all four victims attended school i do n't know of any other boys who have done that rabbi joseph spielman , chairman of the crown heights jewish community council , said aaron s father , hesed halberstam , was the butler and personal manager of the grand rabbi s household for many years until rabbi schneerson s wife , chaya , died in 1988 as close as a grandson he was a very loyal person who worked closely with the rebbe , and the rebbe always looked after the father and the family , rabbi spielman said mrs schneerson was particularly close to aaron halberstam , and was known to treat him as the grandson she never had , friends said they described him as a quiet boy who excelled in sports and was known as a peacemaker when there were riots in crown heights we wanted to fight back and aaron said 'relax , ' said another schoolmate , leiby heller , 17 the halberstams are members of a wellknown rabbinical dynasty that began 140 years ago the bobover rabbi , who led a hasidic sect in borough park , is rabbi schlomo halberstam , part of the youth s extended family , and several prominent lubavitch leaders , including rabbi shea hecht and rabbi joseph j hecht , are his mother s cousins the victim s prominence only increased the feelings of rage and anguish in the lubavitch community it would have been enough of a tragedy even if he had n't been so close to the rebbe , said michael abramson , a neighbor of the halberstams but knowing how much this must affect the rebbe only makes it worse although police officials said they had no evidence that the shooting was premeditated or religious in nature , many lubavitchers said the shooting had to have been the work of arab terrorists seeking revenge for last week s attack on a mosque in hebron rabbi shmuel butman , director of the lubavitch youth organization , called the shooting unquestionably an act of terrorism he saw jews in the van , and to a terrorist , all jews are the same , rabbi butman said he may or may not have been an arab , but he was clearly a terrorist committing an act of nationalism against the jewish people but other lubavitchers were more circumspect rabbi yehudah krinsky , the official spokesman for the lubavitch movement , repeatedly refused at a news conference yesterday afternoon to characterize the attack as either antisemitic or terrorist none of the hasidim mingling outside the lubavitch headquarters voiced any thoughts of retaliation our way is not to retaliate , rabbi butman said our way is to go to the synagogue and pray for the lives of these students and for the guardian of israel to watch over us shortly after 1 pm , in fact , a lubavitch computer printed out the hebrew names of the three most seriously injured victims and the names of their mothers the list was posted in the center of the group s huge synagogue so that members could accurately include the full names of the victims in their prayers nachum sossonkin , an 18yearold student who suffered serious head injuries during the shooting , also was admitted to st vincent s hospital he was born near the golan heights in israel and came to the united states three years ago to study , said an uncle , zalman posner his father , abraham sossonkin , was a veteran of two israeli wars , and the young man had worked for several years at a construction job in israel to get the money to pay for his trip to brooklyn , mr posner said levi wilhelm , also 18 , was in stable condition after undergoing surgery to remove a bullet from his abdomen , brooklyn hospital officials said classmates said he was born in crown heights into a family of seven children and worked summers at a jewish camp in toronto yaakov schapiro , 17 , was injured in the hand and grazed in the head by glass shards from a bullet during the shooting he was treated at st vincent s hospital and released
east rutherford , nj , oct 7 if there had been any doubts about rodney hampton playing against the vikings at giants stadium on monday night , there are none now rodney s ready , coach dan reeves said after the giants' practice today if he gets hurt now , it s my fault because we 're going out tomorrow in just helmets hampton has missed the past two games with a bruised back and kidney , injuries he suffered against arizona on sept 11 the giants' running game has suffered since hampton has been out in a 2722 loss at new orleans on sunday , giant backs gained 50 yards , with david meggett accounting for 40 the news at camp earlier this week had been optimistic , however , when hampton s status was raised from questionable i would say he s a go , reeves said of his no 1 ballcarrier i do n't think that s a category , but we wo n't list him one person happy to see hampton return is quarterback dave brown , who was forced to throw 35 passes against the saints it will make a big difference , brown said not to take anything away from dave who has done a great job filling in but to have the depth of rodney hammering away for the 4yard gains will give us a change of pace and put pressure on the defense i think the key is going to be to establish our running game early to slow them down then we can work our passing game hampton will be back , but another running back , the rookie keith elias , will not keith is out this week , reeves said he has a badly sprained ankle and should be ready to go next week here comes warren moon last year , the giants allowed 8 pass plays that gained over 30 yards this season , the defense has already surrendered four , and warren moon is coming to town they move the ball , defensive lineman keith hamilton said of the vikings warren moon spreads the ball around to his receivers , and they have a hard running back in terry allen they present a challenge but i think we can contain them and come up with a victory the giant defense has been burned the past two weeks by short drops and timing patterns moon is known to take a longer drop we 're definitely going to have to put some rush on him , hamilton said if he wants to throw those 3 and 5yard drops , he can do that , but if he drops to 7 to try and get that ball downfield , somebody s got to be in his face and that s what we intend to do to him coming up short the giants were 0 for 8 on thirddown situations with 6 yards or less to go against new orleans they have been working on shortyardage situations all week last week was obviously bad , dave brown said we addressed it this week hopefully , we will get a better return on it one of those thirddown failures allowed the saints to take the lead for good , when brown threw an interception for a touchdown at the end of the first half one of the things that i stated all during the preseason was that when i make mistakes , i forget about it and go forward , the young quarterback said i understand what happened i understand that it is a critical mistake and i do n't want to have it happen again but i am not going to dwell on it i am not going to go to the locker room at halftime and hang my head and say , 'i missed that' it s over we went out in the second half and started throwing the ball around the field the key to the whole situation is that i learned from it re policy on celebration when dave brown was asked the team s new policy on celebrating , he replied no spiking unless you score 6 points that is the key to this team
stormtossed art it was the day that sallie potterton went from fear to fantasy when the storm of march 1993 hit fire island it changed many people s lives for ms potterton , who is an artist and has lived yearround in ocean beach since 1970 , the storm caused the greatest anxiety and , perhaps , the greatest inspiration i was really scared for my life , she said the power of the storm was so intense that i could feel the waves pounding the sand in my house and her house was five houses back from the ocean deciding not to leave , she and her housemate , mike taylor , rode out the night of fury and at dawn were relieved to find their house standing but flooding was all around them there was debris floating everywhere , ms potterton said that first morning was horrifying by the second morning her artistic instincts had taken over from her homeowner s i found the most amazing things that had been washed up by the storm , she said all these whalebones , things that had n't come up for ages it was such a furious storm it was like a blender the northeaster that took so much from fire island dozens of houses and entire beachfronts gave ms potterton a new career she decided to take the storm s discards and make objets d'art out of them from the bones of 18thcentury whales and the pieces of 20thcentury pool and patio furniture she created sculptures and collages a few months before the storm she had torn the rotator cuff of her right shoulder , her painting arm , and she did not know whether she would paint again but creating the sculptures used different muscles the storm gave her back her artistry she spent a year working on her salvage art an old washboard became a face with rusty nails forming the eyebrows she used parts of kitchen cabinets , appliances and children s toys a barbie doll s head turned into a witch after its blond hair became a nest of frizz because of the ocean s turbulence using bold colors , ms potterton s work resembles african or southwestern art it was recently on display at the ocean beach historical society , an appropriate venue , as most of the materials came from a historical ocean beach happening look at all this stuff found at the beach ! lynn kellert of seaview said to her daughter lexi at the exhibition can you figure out what they are \? a part of an old heater was part of a work of art selling for 650 somebody s salad fork became a tuft of hair you have to keep looking and looking , another visitor , nancy meyer , said you see more and more parts like the roots intertwined in a sculpture i did n't know what they were , ms potterton said i took them out of the water , cut them and then found out it was poison ivy i got it all over my face if i had seen these things at the beach i would never have seen what you saw in them , mrs kellert said it takes an artist s eye ms potterton tried to share hers she picked up a scratched spoon look at how it s raked by the ocean , she said i would have thought it got that way from a garbage disposal , mrs kellert said crowds for concerts harry olsen may be the lone long islander who saw the jimmy buffet concert in montauk and the new york philharmonic concert in east islip and does n't have saddle sores from sitting in traffic jams but , then , harry olsen is a state park police sergeant for two weekends he has been assigned to concert duty , overseeing the traffic trying to flow in , and eventually out , of the island s two biggest outdoor concerts if you think construction delays are tedious , try entering heckscher state park in east islip with 20 , 000 other people it took me an hour and half to go one mile , said laura savini , who attended the philharmonic concert on aug 6 the concert and fireworks display , sponsored by the islip arts council , was free , which meant more than a capacity crowd we had to turn people away , sergeant olsen said that caused a lot of people to call the officers a lot of names and the court says we have to take more than the regular person the problem with both annual concerts is that for each there is just one road in and out the montauk event , which 15 , 000 attended , was on old montauk highway the heckscher concert was at the end of the southern state parkway the sergeant said the heckscher traffic was so bad and so dangerous for all the walkins who walked out in the dark that he is going to recommend that they do away with the concert i ca n't believe none of the pedestrians were hurt , he said you 've got all these people walking with their chairs and strollers on the parkway , and it s pitch dark , and all the drivers are trying to get out add to that , he said , the fact that 500 people who were turned away parked their cars on the parkway and set up lawn chairs on the road to watch the fireworks the park manager , mike venuti , acknowledged that there was a problem and said he would recommend doing away with the fireworks , but not the orchestra and ms savini \? she said both were great her dilemma was after the concert when i finally got to park , she said , i just rushed from my car to the concert , because it had already started when it was over it was pitch black , and i realized i had no idea where my car was i did n't even know in which direction to look she waited until 12 30 am , when someone drove her around the park to look for her car it was easy to find , she said it was the only one there elvis and labor benefits for those looking for bargains two businesses have announced free goods for a rather select group to honor the memory of elvis , the milleridge inn in jericho is sponsoring a free luncheon the meal , complete with a candlelight vigil , will be on aug 22 , the anniversary of no , not the king s death but the date he was supposed to appear at the nassau veterans coliseum in uniondale he died six days before two scheduled concerts there to attend the luncheon , people have to show a ticket to the concert of the 30 , 000 tickets sold , only 10 percent were returned the rest were supposedly kept as collectors' items the first 100 people to verify that they have tickets , at \( 212 \) 8438066 , will have lunch with five elvis impersonators they will also dine on a menu fit for the king , peanutbutterfriedbanana sandwiches and chickenfried steak sounds like something people might crave if they were pregnant speaking of labor ikea in hicksville has an unusual promotion for labor day if you go into labor on labor day you will receive a free crib , a spokeswoman for ikea said it s for the first 100 people who go into labor it can be on labor day or the day after but you have to bring in proof that you went into labor pained expressions will not do if you are a pregnant elvis fan , this could be your summer photos sallie potterton , an artist who has lived in ocean beach since 1970 , converted the flotsam and jetsam from last year s northeaster into objets d'art ms potterton s african queen , made of objects found on the beach \( maxine hicks for the new york times \)
rochester , jan 1 bob cooper vividly remembers how pictures flew off the wall when six sticks of shrapnelenshrouded dynamite exploded on tuesday afternoon two doors away in his apartment complex , how debris was scattered into the courtyard and how plaster dust hung thick in the air when he and a neighbor shouldered through the ruined door at no 55 snug harbor court what mr cooper is beginning to glimpse only now are the largely unknown lives of the people who had lived behind those walls at no 55 , pamela lazore lanza and richard urban ms lanza , 32 , and mr urban , 42 , were among the five people mostly members of her family killed on tuesday by a series of powerful package bombs what has emerged since then is a partial portrait of the family , full of fracture lines and old wounds as any family is but also moving in eccentric and reclusive circles far from the traditional suburban pursuits its members inhabited a world , unknown to their neighbors , of ufo research and psychics , and experiences not always physical in nature , as a friend put it and they were freighted , apparently , with an internal feud of montague and capulet proportions the rest of us all know each other they tended to keep to themselves , said mr cooper , an electrical engineer and gregarious amateur chef who said he likes to share new dishes around the complex none of us got to know them very well six bombs in two hours the six bombs one of which failed to go off were delivered within two hours of one another to a circle of ms lanza s family members , most of whom are of mohawk decent with ties to the nearby st regis reservation within six hours , the police had arrested two nonindian men , earl figley , 56 , and michael t stevens , 53 , the boyfriend of ms lanza s sister , brenda lazore chevere investigators said late this week that they still had no definitive picture of what had precipitated the attacks , but presumed that mr stevens had acted out of some obsessive resentment or vendetta toward his girlfriend s family for excluding or slighting him while a full explanation of the attacks is lacking , there is no shortage of evidence that in this complex , interwoven circle of lives , its members clearly marched to their own beat three of the five victims ms lanza her mother , eleanor lazore fowler , and mrs fowler s husband , robert were described as core members of a local ufo study group called the ultimate frontier organization , which believes that extraterrestrial contact is intertwined with spirituality , including american indian mysticism daryl hardes , a member of the group , is writing a book on the theory , and said that a major part of it would include the lazore family s experiences such as seeing a diskshaped object hovering over their house when pamela was a child , and robert fowler s memory of seeing a deer s face transformed into that of an alien but mr hardes said that brenda lazore chevere and mr stevens would have nothing to do with the ufo group , and that he never even met them ms chevere , who is 31 , lives at the end of a remote private road in the town of victor , about 30 miles from rochester , and would not open the door when a reporter and photographer drove up this week no comment go away , she said , speaking from behind the closed door of the redwoodsided house in the middle of a snowcovered clearing most other family members have been just as silent , and some , acquaintances say , have gone into hiding , fearing further violence one man , however , related to the family through marriage , said that mr stevens , an exconvict who served two years in state prison on fraud charges , had divided and frightened the lazorefowler family for years he told me a couple of times , 'i 'll kill you and not lose a minute s sleep over it , ' said the man , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity he s just mad recipients were suspicious investigators have also noted that in two of the bomb deliveries the recipients were instantly suspicious of the packages , which were marked fragile , with a return address from a pennsylvania ironworks company in one case , ms lanza s halfsister , lucille , and her husband , scott , partly opened the package , then stopped and called the police , who were warned in the same call that they should check on lucille s mother , mrs fowler , who they feared might have received a package , too another relative , william lazore of hogansburg , would only poke at his parcel with a rake it exploded , severely injuring his leg obviously there had to be some fear or concern based on a prior family history , said howard r relin , the monroe county district attorney , which includes the rochester area it s certainly highly unusual that two people targeted to be killed would suspect a package at this time of year in victor , residents described mr figley , a former science teacher who the authorities say bought the dynamite used in the bombs , as a harmlesslooking man and a dependent hangeron to the family injured in a car accident in the late 1960 s that cost him an eye and , he said , part of his brain , mr figley was remembered by one former acquaintance mainly for the fact that he cooked a whole chicken , every night , in the laundry room microwave oven at the lafayette motel in canandaigua , where he lived in recent weeks before the bombings
norman , okla , nov 24 gary gibbs sits at his university of oklahoma desk and talks about sacrificing himself so that others may live i 've been shot at and i 've spilled a lot of blood along the way , gibbs said today , three days after he resigned as coach , effective at the end of the season and others here have been shot at , and they 've spilled some blood and you look up and say , 'who s in the most critical condition \? ' well , obviously i was in the most critical condition so maybe what i did by resigning will give others who have been shot at a chance to regain their health gibbs s six seasons on the job were certainly less controversial than the 13year reign of his predecessor , barry switzer but while switzer s players sometimes ended up as the subject of police reports , his teams won three national titles to gibbs s none his sooners are 64 entering friday s regularseason finale here against no 1 nebraska \( 110 \) gibbs is 44212 at oklahoma , a 671 winning percentage the sore point with oklahoma boosters , besides the absence of national titles , is that he was just 2141 against nebraska , texas and colorado there are plenty of extenuating circumstances , gibbs said today , noting the threeyear national collegiate athletic association probation endured by oklahoma in his early years and the aura of lawlessness around the sooner football program normally when you replace a legend , someone like barry who had accomplished so much , you take over a program that s in very good shape , said gibbs , 42 in our case , we took over a program with extremely high expectations but which was basically a hellhole he added we were on the verge of receiving the death penalty , so we had to make sure we did everything exactly by ncaa rules which is the right way to do things anyway because he was restricted to 17 scholarships a year in his first two years , gibbs and athletic director donnie duncan thought the 1992 team could be left without veteran leadership it turned out that way , three years of improved records followed by a 542 season things got ugly for gibbs and his team this season after a 3720 loss to kansas state , the wildcats' first victory at memorial stadium in 24 years , the sooners faced a barrage of insults and flying debris en route to the locker room even after a 1711 victory over texas tech , which is going to the cotton bowl , gibbs said negative questions from the news media permeated the postgame air our players were wondering , 'what s the deal here \? ' he said there s no appreciation we have to defend ourselves even when we win meanwhile , nebraska has had 33 winning seasons in a row , 26 straight ninevictory seasons and 219 consecutive weeks in the associated press top 25 the huskers find themselves possibly just two victories away from tom osborne s first national title in his 22 seasons as head coach nebraska versus oklahoma used to mean a berth in the orange bowl , along with a national title shot not since 1986 has oklahoma held up its end of that scenario this game is no gimme for osborne he has a 913 record in the series , including 46 in games in norman however , he enters friday s game on a threegame winning streak gibbs recalls osborne talking vaguely of retirement , saying in 1987 , maybe i'm not the right guy , after oklahoma had beaten nebraska for the fourth straight time now gibbs is out and osborne is near his personal zenith for gibbs , knowing that the sooners will have their full allotment of 85 scholarships next year for the first time since 1988 and knowing that 19 of 22 starters will be returning , leaving now means somebody else will get the credit next year for the foundation he has built extra points nebraska quarterback tommie frazier will suit up against oklahoma after being sidelined since sept 24 because of blood clots in his right leg it is unlikely he will play , but if circumstances arise that he is needed , he would be available in an emergency situation , coach tom osborne said on thursday

mexico city , march 23 luis donaldo colosio murrieta , the candidate who was considered likely to extend the governing party s 65year control of mexico s presidency , was assassinated early this evening as he walked through a crowd of supporters in a poor neighborhood in the border city of tijuana mr colosio , 44 , was reportedly shot twice with a 38 caliber pistol , a presumably fatal wound in the head and another in the chest or stomach eyewitnesses said mr colosio , his forehead covered with blood , was carried by campaign workers across a footbridge and taken in a campaign car to tijuana general hospital , about two miles away over rough ground he died about three hours later , said liebano saenz , spokesman for the colosio campaign mr saenz said a bullet passed through mr colosio s head , causing great damage assailant reported in custody the office of attorney general diego valades said it had taken into custody an alleged assailant , identified by the police as mario aburto martinez , 23 the police said mr aburto told them he was a pacifist originally from the city of zamora , in the pacific coast state of michoacan the police said he told them that he has written books about pacificism and that he has four brothers living in the united states he is an industrial mechanic who works in a shop in tijuana there was no word on whether mr aburto was associated with the indian uprising in the southern state of chiapas that has complicated mexican politics since it began on jan 1 another person detained by the authorities was identified as vicente mayoral valenzuela , 59years old , but it was not clear whether he was being held as a witness or as an accomplice mr colosio s wife , diana laura riojas reyes de colosio , was not with him during the shooting but accompanied him at the hospital seemed sure to win as candidate of the longgoverning institutional revolutionary party , known as pri by its spanish initials , mr colosio was considered almost certain to win the august 21 elections the pri and its predecesor parties have not lost a presidential election in 65 years his nomination last november when he was selected by his friend and mentor , president carlos salinas de gortari was considered almost equal to a coronation but recent events , including the armed indian uprising in chiapas , have sideswiped the smoothrunning operations of the pri the uncertainty grew so great that there was concern , considered unthinkable last november , that mr colosio and the pri might not be able to win the august election cleanly television news reports showed mr colosio , his head covered with blood , falling to the ground and being surrounded by the crowd of supporters he was taken unconscious to the hospital , where he was operated on 'act of infamy , ' salinas says before mr colosio s death was announced , president salinas broke off a meeting with the canadian prime minister , jean chretien , to denounce the attack as an act of infamy for me , personally , this is a very painful blow against a dearlyloved mexican , mr salinas said he said he had instructed his attorney general to go to tijuana to investigate , and was meeting late wednesday night with his cabinet in mexico city mexican society was shocked by this outburst of violence , after having been shaken during the last few months by the violent uprising in chiapas , the extreme volatility in the stock market , the kidnapping last week of one of the country s richest and most powerful businessmen and dozens of uprisings in every part of the country the attack on mr colosio took place shortly after 5 pm tijuana time \( 8 pm eastern time \) as the candidate was leaving a campaign stop before 3 , 000 people in the poor lomas taurinas district wearing an opennecked white shirt , he had just finished a speech in which he promised to provide better community service and was walking through the crowd when he was shot the death of mr colosio throws the campaign into chaos there was no immediate word from pri leaders about who would replace mr colosio as a candidate but because of restrictions in the constitution , many of the most important members of the party could be prohibited from running alternative candidates among the possible replacements is a former mexico city mayor , manuel camacho solis , who resigned as foreign minister on jan 10 to become the government s chief negotiator with indian rebels in chiapas on tuesday mr camacho ended speculation that he would make an independent run for president by announcing that he would not another possibility is a former cabinet member , ernesto zedillo ponce de leon he resigned as secretary of public education in november and became mr colosio s campaign manager the campaign of 1994 has been marred by tensions and uncertainty the uprising by 2 , 000 armed indian rebels in chiapas abruptly interrupted what had been expected to be mr colosio s easy walk to the presidency the pri campaign was eclipsed by chiapas , and by the headlinegrabbing achievement of mr camacho as the government s peace negotiator within a few weeks of the uprising , mexico city newspaper columnists were writing plots in which mr colosio could become mysteriously ill and would have to be replaced as a candidate by mr camacho the uncertainty continued until mr camacho announced he would not run legislators decry shooting a joint statement from legislators of all political parties , released before mr colosio s death , said , democracy has just received a brutal attempt by those who would use violence to destabilize the country and create an atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion among all mexicans in chiapas this evening just after the shooting , mr camacho told reporters at a news conference that he joins with the indignation of the whole country , and called the violence against mr colosio an attempt against the peace and dignity of the country the main opposition party candidate , cuauhtemoc cardenas , said in the southern state of tlaxcala that the shooting is lamentable homero aridjis , a novelist and civic leader in mexico city , said , even though we do n't know the motives of the pistoleros who committed the attack , and we do n't know if they acted alone or were part of a conspiracy , one thing we do know colosio is the first political victim of the climate of violence and instability that mexico has lived in since the first of january before he was selected by mr salinas to run , mr colosio served as head of mexico s social development ministry and he directed the huge antipoverty program called solidarity he has served as president of pri and as a senator eyewitnesses and television news footage do not show that the colosio campaign had taken any special security precautions when mr colosio was shot , he was surrounded by plainclothes body guards and campaign aides despite the political turmoil of the last few months , none of the presidential candidates has changed campaign styles they customarily wade into crowds without any obvious security , shaking hands and allowing people to come right up to them the last attempt on the life of a presidential candidate is believed to have taken place in 1928 , against emilio portes gil , who succeeded assassinated presidentelect alvaro obregon photos luis donaldo

ledyard , conn , may 18 a customer of the foxwoods casino slipped , fell and gashed his head recently , leaving a scar near his eyebrow at the mirage , or caesars , or circus circus , that could have been bad news for the casino , with lawyers seeking large damages for the victim s pain and suffering but the forum for the foxwoods case was tribal court , created by the sovereign indian nation of the mashantucket pequot tribe and operated under rules that severely restrict how much an accident victim can collect in this instance , even tribal officials admit that the man got next to nothing because the rules link compensation to the cost of treatment , and his was cheap the case is now under appeal before an appellate panel , which like the tribal court is composed of judges hired by the tribe in much the same way as it built its gambling empire in this landscape of cows and cornfields , the pequot tribe is now enacting and enforcing its own laws on a scale that tribal officials say has never before been tried because no tribe before the pequots has had the financial clout to do so many tribes around the country have exercised legal authority on their reservations , but now , perhaps for the first time , large numbers of nonindians will find themselves subject to indian judicial processes among those people are 8 , 350 foxwoods employees most of them not indians , and none of them covered by federal or state labor laws and the roughly 140 , 000 people who visit the casino each week the pequots are the owners of the nation s largest and most successful indianowned business , and with tens of millions of dollars a month in gambling profits , they are building their own court system , their own police force and their own jail in addition to an indian judge from the passamaquoddy tribe in maine , they have appointed four local lawyers as judges in the lower court and they have hired two retired judges including a retired senior judge from the federal bench , robert c zampano to hear appeals , plus three prosecutors an 18member police force cruises the reservation in new ford explorers the tribe s lawyers stalk state and federal courts a case now before the state appellate court , for example , is testing whether the pequots or the state have first rights to prosecute an indian who committed a crime on the reservation in another case , the pequots have challenged a company s right to sue the tribe in state court over a commercial contract dispute the point of all this , tribal officials say , is not the law for its own sake , but rather what the ability to make and enforce laws implies authority , independence and sovereignty many tribes have the powers being exercised here , the pequots say , but most are just too poor to make it stick tribes have always asserted their sovereign status and their ability to govern themselves , said henry j sockbeson , a lawyer for the tribe you 're limited , however , by your financial ability to exercise sovereignty what s happening for the pequots , mr sockbeson said , is that monetary muscle is finally coinciding with the powers and rights that have long existed for indians mainly as theory if we want a police force , we just go out and buy one , he said that s true sovereignty , and that s something that not many tribes have had an opportunity to really exercise nationally the story has echoes in many corners of indian country , from the seminoles of florida to the oneidas in upstate new york , who voted this month to establish their own judiciary system but in connecticut , in particular , the stakes are enormous foxwoods draws about 140 , 000 gamblers in a typical week , and the roughly 310member tribe is now one of the biggest private employers in the state , earning profits that are projected to reach 600 million this year economic muscle those staggering numbers , and the tribe s use of its economic muscle in land purchases and more recently on the legal front , have troubled many state officials , who invariably preface their remarks by praising the tribe and the general notion of american indian economic empowerment , before quietly wringing their hands over the potential of an unfettered extralegal supercorporation rising in their midst on the other hand , there is hardly anything the officials could do if they wanted , beyond honing the skills of diplomacy as they would in dealing with any foreign power the state really has very little leverage , said the connecticut attorney general , richard blumenthal , who approved a compact this week for a second casino to be opened near here , in montville , by the mohegan tribe the bottom line , mr blumenthal said , is that employees of the tribe and casino patrons should know that an indian reservation is essentially sovereign soil with its own rules the legal rights of someone on the reservation , a nonindian , are drastically different , he said for one thing , there are no jury trials in the pequots' tribal court , which has authority over all civil disputes , accidents and injuries occurring on the reservation and employees can pretty much forget about a union the system of labor statutes enacted by the sevenmember tribal council gives workers plush benefits , including free prescriptions at the tribal pharmacy and all the free food they can eat at work , but no rights whatsoever to organize for collective bargaining
the mention made mr epstein cringe , he recalled last week here was another aspiring writer with some egregious novel but when he read the beginnings of the novel in translation , he said , he found it riveting absolution has just been published by pantheon , a division of random house , with a first printing of 10 , 000 , a respectable number for a literary novel from abroad the book is about an embittered icelandic expatriate who has been harboring a guilty secret for decades it has n't been widely reviewed , but the new york times book review said it was unexpectedly enjoyable , and entertainment weekly gave it an a mr olafsson , in a telephone interview on monday , sounded disconcertingly normal , not like the humorless overachiever you might expect he made it clear that the meanspirited protagonist of absolution was not an autobiographical creation he can be a very unpleasant human being and my goal was to make him so untrustworthy that you could n't believe anything he said , mr olafsson said but i also wanted to make him complex enough that you would sympathize with him , despite his shortcomings mr olafsson has also finished a play called four of hearts , which he said was about four old guys playing bridge and which is to be produced in iceland soon he plans to finish a short novel by the fall and then he intends to embark on his next long novel , set in the years after world war ii it s no wonder his wife likes to joke that his favorite friday night consists of a good meal , a bottle of wine and the chance to fall asleep 10 minutes into a rented movie mr olafsson said he was n't sure if he liked his first two books a shortstory collection and a novel , both extraordinarily successful in iceland well enough to want to publish them in the united states but if he does , he could translate them himself he speaks six languages quite unnecessarily , he said , i have a very difficult time sitting around doing nothing not the usual way to deal although william h gates is much , much richer than every publisher in new york \( and indeed , than almost everybody in the world \) , he shares an important trait with publishing executives he s used to doing things his way and so as mr gates , the chairman of microsoft corporation , tries to strike a book deal , the negotiations have turned into a fascinating clash of cultures from opposite ends of the informationdisseminating industry mr gates s book is to be about the future of the information revolution it s a book that most of the major houses in new york who can afford to pay multimilliondollar advances are keenly interested in , particularly because they themselves want to know what that future is as one executive put it , i would kill for that book it s unlikely to come to that , but mr gates certainly is n't following the normal bookauction blueprint he has n't met any publishers himself he has no literary agent , and so the negotiations are being conducted by a team from microsoft , including jonathan lazarus , the friendly but hardbargaining vice president for strategic relations , who is in new york with two colleagues this week and many of mr gates s terms , outlined in a recent letter to publishers , are unusual even in an industry accustomed to dealing with highrolling nonwriters like margaret thatcher , h norman schwartzkopf and oprah winfrey among other things , microsoft said , it wants an advance of 25 million , a guaranteed first printing of 500 , 000 copies and the option to hold on to trade paperback rights and world rights in nonenglishspeaking countries microsoft also wants the publisher to set aside 125 , 000 for marketing some publishers think that all this is fine , that mr gates is such a potential gold mine that whatever he wants , he should get i'm not put off at all , one executive said but others even ones who said they wanted to publish mr gates said they were being made to feel as though they were pawns , not publishers you pay a huge advance , said another executive , and you 're going to try to make it as successful as possible , obviously unsettling in a different way is mr gates s intention to donate all his proceeds to charity publishers are n't used to that kind of attitude , which means , among other things , that none can win the deal by simply outbidding everyone else our goal is not money and we 're not focusing on the advance , mr lazarus said in a interview both bill and i think that s kind of a crazy way to do things , when you get some crazy advance we 're looking for who we think will do the best job for the book and sell the most books a number of companies , including random house , simon schuster , bantam doubleday dell and warner books , have been in touch with microsoft , with varying results at little , brown , fredrica friedman , the executive editor , said her company had decided to pass , largely because mr gates s current position might make it hard for him to be candid about his business for that price , she said , you have to sell a lot of books it s impossible to calculate how many books a publisher would have to sell to make back the advance , but few best sellers sell anywhere near 500 , 000 copies ms friedman also pointed out that hyperion had just signed up a book by mitch kapor , the founder of the lotus development corporation , that might compete with mr gates s microsoft officials unused to publishing personalities , and probably a bit bemused by how quickly gossip about confidential deals rushes around town here , said they were likely to select a publisher by the end of the week this process is absolutely fascinating , mr lazarus said new digest subsidiary the reader s digest association announced yesterday that it would combine several disparate departments and imprints into a new , wholly owned subsidiary to be called reader s digest young families , which would create and market children s books and entertainment products the idea behind the change , said tara m phethean , a spokeswoman for reader s digest , would be to expand the business around the world by giving the new division its own directmail marketing staff , the most effective sales tool the company uses the company also sells the books in bookstores young families takes in a number of young adults' imprints , including reader s digest kids joshua morris wilton house , and wishing well in the fall of 1994 , ms phethean said , the group plans to publish about 40 book titles altogether endnotes the penguin group , which includes penguin uk and penguin usa , released 1993 yearend figures yesterday showing that sales and operating profits good indicators of the strength of business increased by 10 percent and 23

los angeles , july 21 o j simpson has never been easy to categorize in his public and private lives , he crossed the color line to become what marketers call race neutral now , as a murder defendant , he is creating confusion and divisions among blacks here over his role and symbolism from joe hicks of the southern christian leadership conference , who insists that race plays no part in the case , to dennis schatzman of the los angeles sentinel , a blackrun newspaper , who says the case is all about race , it is hard to find complete agreement it s a rorschach on race and gender , said kimberly crenshaw , a professor of constitutional law at the university of california at los angeles whatever your issue is , you can look at this case and you can see it in the early stages of the investigation of the killings of mr simpson s former wife , nicole brown simpson , and her friend , ronald l goldman , race was a sleeper issue , ms crenshaw said , mostly unrecognized among the rapid developments but the issue has emerged in recent weeks as the defense team has become more aggressive in its efforts to influence public opinion here poll shows divisions on tuesday , the field poll , a leading california opinion research agency , reported that while 62 percent of whites believed that mr simpson was very likely or somewhat likely guilty , only 38 percent of blacks agreed with them the survey of 847 californians was conducted by telephone from july 12 to july 17 it has a margin of error of plus or minus 35 percentage points fiftyeight of the respondents were black the margin of error for blacks on the question regarding mr simpson s guilt is plus or minus 13 percentage points newsweek and the new yorker have reported that members of mr simpson s defense team had asserted that a police detective on the case , mark fuhrman , had racist tendencies and could have planted evidence against mr simpson today , the lead lawyer for mr simpson , robert l shapiro , said , race is not an issue in this case , and i will not bring it up , and anyone who speculated on that is just speculating on their own , and the speculation is incorrect legal experts said they believed that the defense made the assertion to try to influence potential jurors with material that might not be admissible in court but experts in jury selection said careful pretrial questioning should weed out biased jurors , whether black or white joellan dimitrius , a jury consultant , said the extraordinary pretrial publicity , rather than the issue of race , would be the biggest challenge in selecting an unbiased jury some commentators have called the defense tactics irresponsible in a city where the issue of racial bias in the criminal justice system remains an open wound after the rodney g king beating and the riots related to it 'a black man under attack' the mere spectacle of a prominent black man charged with murder was enough to touch off cries of racial bias among some blacks here this is not a murder case , it s a civil rights case , exclaimed one agitated caller to a radio show but mr simpson was not a member of the club for politically active blacks , said dr alvin poussaint , a professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school , and did not at first win their strong support it s the same way a lot of blacks supported clarence thomas even though they were opposed to his views , dr poussaint said ultimately they supported him because he was a black man under attack the more vigorously mr simpson has been pursued by the criminal justice system , the blacker he has become , mr schatzman said a man who , in the minds of many , was either colorless or white has now been placed in a position of having to defend himself against a charge that he murdered a beautiful white woman and a white man , he said everything is magnified , and black people , irrespective of the fact that he never set foot in south central , can identify with him now mr hicks scoffed at that view , saying that mr simpson s wealth , not his color , was the crucial factor some people have said mr simpson may have more in common with the menendez brothers two rich white men from beverly hills , calif , accused of killing their parents than with most black defendants many can identify that a poor , black innercity resident will verbally come to the defense of a rich black celebrity accused of a crime , simply on racial grounds , makes little sense , mr hicks said but it may reflect the facts of life in america he added , but for people to say o j simpson ca n't get a fair trial because he is black or persecuted or treated unfairly by the police let s get a grip on it ! mr simpson s case resonates differently for many middleclass black men , said cynthia mcclainhill , an investment banker she said mr simpson held a special place for them as a trailblazer in fields like advertising and sportscasting that had been mostly closed to blacks there were so few examples in that generation that he still means an awful lot , she said spotlight on abuse the simpson case poses a different set of difficulties for many black women , said connie rice , western regional counsel for the legal defense and educational fund of the naacp sexual harassment gained the spotlight with accusations against clarence thomas , she said date rape became the focus with michael tyson now , because of mr simpson , attention is on spousal abuse the question is , why is the poster child for each of these issues a black man \? she said you end up really hortonizing these issues , and it does a disservice to the legitimate issues in terms of gender equity ms rice said another issue , interracial marriage , also affects reactions to the case interracial relations always dredge up the deepest of our taboos , she said although the subject has not been a focus in most discussions of the simpson marriage , she urged that prospective jurors be carefully interviewed to uncover hidden biases for some , an overload almost any of the wide range of opinions on the case could be heard the other day at the magic shears barber shop in south central los angeles some men expressed suspicion that sooner or later any successful black man would be pulled down and there was resentment among some women at a black man who had married a white woman but jewell allen , a barber , and others had already had their fill of the debate we 're tired of it , ms allen said jeffrey dahmer who ate all those people , the lady who cut off her husband s thingamajig , none of them got this much coverage
i need help , folks , said president clinton during his final , desperate burst of campaigning he did not get it the result was a historic shift of power to the republicans , in washington and in statehouses throughout the nation the consequences of the weak democratic showing were particularly painful in new york state it lost a governor of great stature , mario cuomo , in favor of an untested newcomer , george pataki mr pataki s promise of a sweeping tax cut poses a clear threat to new york city its mayor , rudolph giuliani , responded heroically to this threat with his endorsement of mr cuomo the first test for mr pataki will be to show that he is not vindictive toward the city or the mayor , and that he is independent of his political sponsor , senator alfonse d'amato the task for mr clinton is more formidable with republicans winning control of both the senate and the house , he must now articulate a legislative program that stands some chance of success despite a far weaker hand there were a few bright spots oliver north s defeat in virginia among them but over all this was a powerful body blow to bill clinton and a repudiation of his party s conduct in congress mr clinton is not wholly to blame his advisers fear that the losing democrats will fault him for their individual misfortunes and that the survivors will decide they owe him nothing but the reasons for the democratic debacle go beyond the president and predate his tenure when mr clinton came to town the democrats controlled both houses of congress , and the congressional leadership could not deliver on the agenda defined by him and endorsed by their convention and their congressional candidates this failure of governance must be laid at the feet of the retiring senate majority leader , george mitchell the embattled speaker , thomas foley , and a leadership team that placed loyalty to them above cooperation with the white house or public demands for congressional and campaign finance reform add this nonperformance to the familiar witches' brew of public discontent the sour national attitude toward politics generally and the rebellion against incumbents in particular and it is easy to see why the democrats got whacked there is at least one other major cause a nagging , nationwide sense of economic discomfort on its face this is puzzling the economy has improved , inflation is low and the deficit is under better control than it was during the 12 reaganbush years but to millions of people this is vague and theoretical stuff they do not feel better in their pocketbooks meanwhile , the party that promised welfare reform produced none the party that made a huge bet on healthcare reform used a secret laboratory to create a frankenstein s monster that defied legislative redesign the fact that there was a crime bill , a north american free trade agreement and some smaller trophies did not , in the end , count for much with the public in a cbs news new york times poll a couple of weeks ago , only 30 percent said that government should do more to solve national problems while 63 percent said government was doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals that is one big problem for a president who still sees himself as an activist his other big problem is all those feisty republicans who will be parachuting into washington come january these republicans do not much believe in government and they are not likely to be helpful many of them ran and won on newt gingrich s seductive but simplistic contract with america some of them ran on demagogic symbols the death penalty , immigrantbashing whatever they ran on , all of them ran against bill clinton this is not a happy prospect for a man who campaigned in 1992 on one theme change but as senator phil gramm suggested , the new force in congress cannot expect to sell twoparty gridlock as the solution to the oneparty version that the voters rejected so powerfully yesterday now the burden is on republicans , senator gramm observed can we give them a coherent program \?
west point , ny , sept 10 army coach bob sutton s indecision over which of two good quarterbacks to use as a starter was settled , albeit unpleasantly , early in the game today and the cadets went on to crush holy cross , 493 sutton s plan was to alternate rick roper , the starter the last two years , with another senior , mike makovec , who was the firststring quarterback until sidelined with a chronic knee injury in the second game of the 1992 season under the plan , each quarterback was to work two consecutive series against holy cross , with roper as the starter but roper never got beyond the first series , going down with a seasonending knee injury when he slipped on the artificial turf at michie stadium on the sixth play of the game the diagnosis was a torn interior cruciate ligament of the left knee a blow to cadets that injury was a severe blow to the cadets since roper had been extremely durable , missing only one game , with an ankle sprain , in the last two years and emerging as army s best passer since the wishbone was installed in 1984 but army did not miss roper this afternoon as makovec performed well , throwing for one touchdown , running 13 yards for another and completing 3 of his 6 passes for 29 yards as the home team defeated holy cross i'm tremendously disappointed for rick because he s done such a great job for us , said sutton , starting his fourth year as the army head coach but i'm proud of mike , who played a very solid game army s margin of victory over holy cross was its most onesided ever in a series that dates from 1914 and encompasses 23 games and it demonstrated anew army s superiority over patriot league teams , which it has now beaten in 15 consecutive games , most of them lopsided victories overpowering offense with only four defensive starters back from last year , none of them on the line , holy cross could not cope with army s running offense , which led all division 1a teams last year and which racked up 382 yards on the ground today meanwhile , the relatively inexperienced cadet defense , with only four returning starters but none up front , held holy cross \( 01 \) to 79 yards rushing the visitors were far more effective in the air , with three different quarterbacks , andy fitzpatrick , rob callahan and chad vaughn , gaining 167 yards passing on 17 of 33 passes , 3 of which were intercepted army , which never punted in the game , scored on three of its first five possessions to take a 213 halftime lead and the cadets threatened on the other two possessions , driving to the holy cross 40 twice before makovec was , first , intercepted and then misfired on a fourthand5 situation army s 157pound split end , dondra jolly , who also runs back punts and kickoffs , scored the first touchdown with 1 24 left in the opening quarter on a dandy reverse right that flummoxed the crusader defense then , 8 48 into the second period , senior left halfback kevin vaughn , army s fastest runner , sprinted 60 yards for a touchdown after anthony pignio had kicked a 24yard field goal for holy cross with 18 seconds left in the half , makovec rolled right and found junior fullback akili king , the cadets' best runner , in the end zone from three yards out the army wishbone offense , as happens so often against foes with little depth , overwhelmed holy cross in the second half when vaughn and jolly scored their second touchdowns jolly s , the last of the game , came when he recovered a blocked punt at the holy cross 23 and raced in untouched with 3 30 left in he game by then , sutton , not about to risk makovec and his fragile left knee , on which he has undergone surgery twice in the last two years , was using his thirdstring quarterback , sophomore ronnie mcada our defense played very aggressively , sutton said , and we benefited from good field position most of the way photo army trainers tend to quarterback rick roper , who tore a ligament in his left knee on the game s sixth play \( associated press \)
the garbage smelled its usual smell and buzzed with flies just as it always does but when it began to whimper yesterday morning , cesar deleon took notice that s when the garbage ritual at the apartment building in the bronx turned into a lifesaving adventure for mr deleon and changed his title at least for a day from super to hero mr deleon , the superintendent at the building , at 1630 undercliff avenue in morris heights , was carrying the big black bags of garbage from the building s basement to the street when he heard the tiny cry tearing open the bag , he found a newborn , still bloody from birth , inside a brown plastic shopping bag and wrapped in two towels a black sock had been stuffed in the baby s mouth , mr deleon said the baby , a boy , apparently had been dropped down the garbage chute of the sixstory building , the police said with the baby turning purple , mr deleon took him to his basement apartment , put him near a heater and massaged him and called the police i found a baby in a compactor , mr deleon said he told them the baby was brought to the lincoln medical center and declared healthy julia rivera , a hospital spokeswoman , said doctors estimated that the baby , which weighs 8 pounds , 3 ounces , was born just two hours before he was found she said the baby s temperature was below normal when he was admitted shortly after 8 am , but that he was stabilized he s a very healthy baby , she said no scratches , no injuries , no nothing she said the baby would be released in a few days to child protective services of all the turns of chance in the baby s young life none was quite as lucky as mr deleon s decision to bag the morning s garbage by hand rather than use the hydraulic compactor mr deleon , 44 , who has been the superintendent at the building for six months , said he had picked the cans and bottles out of the trash as required by the city s recycling law before bagging it for the garbage collectors he said he usually uses the compactor to squeeze down and bag the remaining garbage , but since he was already into the garbage up to his elbows he decided to load the bags manually while carrying the bags outside , he heard the muffled cry he did his job the right way , said anthony striano , the maintenance manager for tryax realty management , which owns the building he took the cans and bottles out there s always a hero , said carlos rosas , a neighbor of mr deleon , who yesterday was standing around the red compactor with a crowd of flies and people mr deleon , who came to this country from the dominican republic 19 years ago , said he has done factory and construction work and was a superintendent at another building before moving to undercliff avenue yesterday afternoon , mr deleon was still shaken by his discovery but said he was feeling better now that the baby s all right he said when he first found the baby he was so flustered he was barely able to speak but by the afternoon the hero was thinking more about the villain , who detective louis llanes said has not been identified mr deleon , who has two children of his own , just shook his head , wondering what could make someone discard a baby said mr rosas to hear something like this happened is unspeakable residents of the building said it was difficult to imagine one of their neighbors might have thrown away a baby i know everybody , and i know what s going on , said ericka evans , who has lived in the building for 10 years i do n't even know anybody who was pregnant another resident , mary duffy , stood in the lobby after hearing the news saying over and over , i do n't believe it ms evans was philosophical i keep telling people , she said , human beings are unpredictable photo cesar deleon indicates the size of the baby he found in a plastic garbage bag he was carrying from an apartment building in the bronx \( jose r lopez the new york times \) map of the bronx showing location of where the baby was found
hempstead , li , dec 12 despite the howling of fans and the crackling noises over the callin airwaves beseeching the jets to do something anything the club will ride out the season with no coaching or frontoffice changes if the jets are poised to make any significant alterations after this disappointing season , their president , steve gutman , declined to say so today the jets stand at 68 after three straight losses with the san diego chargers looming on sunday the slide beginning when the jets were 22 seconds away from tying the dolphins for the division lead and yet , the jets remain alive , at least mathematically , for the playoffs as he usually does during hard times , gutman played down the possibility of changes or even talk of changes until the season is over he did say that the jets have not spoken to jimmy johnson , the former cowboy coach , who would also demand being his own general manager johnson , now a television analyst for the fox network , theatrically has said he will announce next sunday , on the network , whether he will return to coaching he earns about 400 , 000 in television and is probably worth five times that on the sidelines the jets' football operations are overseen by general manager dick steinberg , who is ending his fifth season the club has failed to post a winning record in any of them and has made the playoffs just once in that period earlier in their campaign , the jets had a 20 start under their rookie coach , pete carroll , elevated by steinberg after he dismissed bruce coslet , whom he hired in 1990 asked about steinberg s tenure , gutman said we have a team which , over the last five years , has from time to time performed extremely well and has a foundation that implies a very bright future in some areas and a future in some areas that needs some adjustment he s done a good job steinberg was one of the league s most soughtafter executives and was highly recommended to the owner , leon hess , when hess hired him with the jets having one game remaining in 1989 that was one year when the jets did n't wait until the end to make a major change it was the first time in 15 years the team put one man in charge of the football operations steinberg remains highly valued in the league the giants' general manager , george young , today said steinberg is one of the top five personnel guys in the league , wellrespected and has been for years steinberg himself said he believes the club does n't need major , longterm repair work the decision on retaining anyone ultimately is made by hess , the benevolent owner fewer than three weeks ago he described himself as more optimistic than i 've been in years now , he is said to be disappointed and glum over what has happened to the team hess , though , allowed joe walton to coach the jets for seven seasons , longer than any coach has without winning an american conference division title asked about the way the season is winding up , gutman replied it s been a frustrating , disappointing season the record is less than we had hoped for yet , the jets seldom were picked in any poll to finish above 500 this season but once they jumped out to their surprising start defeating the highly regarded bills and broncos then expectations changed but they were to be dashed , once again so gutman was confronted with a litany of questions today at the club s training complex in the wake of last saturday s desultory performance against the lions asked about johnson , whose cowboys captured the last two super bowls , gutman said we have a couple of more games to play we 're going to sit down and recognize things that have been done and add up things for the future if mr johnson is a part of that process and is available to talk at that time and has any interest in the jets and we have any interest in him that will be determined then none of the handwringing would have come about if the jets' offense had n't collapsed so suddenly from an efficient , if not spectacular , operation , it has produced only two touchdowns in the last nine quarters the point man , of course , is quarterback boomer esiason he saw five of his passes dropped against the lions , and he tried to run a ground game that sputtered so many things can go wrong on an offense , said the backup quarterback , jack trudeau it does n't take much if the jets' hierarchy believes that bad luck , or a new offense that still needs time to mesh , can readily be turned around , then there may be no changes at the top as for carroll , he is looking at sunday , as opposed to the off season thus , esiason remains at quarterback and all the starters stay where they are we 're not experimenting this week , carroll said extra points earlier this season , during a slump , pete carroll did what he called finetuning , using secondstringers a little he plans to do the same against the chargers there will be subtle adjustments , he said that will include occasional use of lou benfatti to rush the passer and orlando parker to catch passes , both of them rookies the annual toys for tots charity drive will be sunday new or used toys , unwrapped , can be deposited at giants stadium

yielding reluctantly to a sweetened takeover offer from the american home products corporation , the american cyanamid company yesterday became the latest drug company to be swallowed up in the consolidation sweeping the health care industry the 97 billion merger would create one of the world s largest drug companies , giving american home products a line of new products to sell to health maintenance organizations and other big managed health care customers companies with a broad range of products have a better chance of winning highvolume managed care contracts , under which individual consumers pay lower drug prices and with drug prices falling , american home products viewed an acquisition as the easiest road to revenue growth yesterday s deal was the latest in a multibilliondollar consolidation in health care , spurred by the health debate in washington hospitals , drug manufacturers and health insurers have been realigning and combining to face widespread changes already under way in the nation s medical system a spokesman for american home products , which is based in madison , nj , said there were no immediate plans for job cuts but securities analysts said dismissals would inevitably follow , as the merged company cut costs by eliminating overlaps in sales , research and the headquarters staff noting , for example , that both companies have research laboratories outside princeton , nj , john r stafford , chairman of american home products , said , there is bound to be some duplication in research he added , in a telephone interview , we may be able to be more efficient and still get the same results albert j costello , chairman and chief executive of american cyanamid , was not available for comment yesterday mr stafford said there had been no agreement about a future role for mr costello in the merged company the agreement came after two weeks of tough carrotandstick tactics by american home products , which drove up the price of american cyanamid stock more than 60 percent since aug 1 american home products began by offering american cyanamid shareholders 95 a share in cash on aug 3 it raised the bid to 100 a share on monday , and set a 24hour deadline for acceptance , and finally agreed yesterday to pay 101 a share although analysts described the american home products offers as hostile , mr stafford said friendly discussions began last friday night he then met with mr costello on sunday evening to see if we could work something out that they thought was good for their shareholders , mr stafford said the contact was cordial , he said but american home products' next move was the 24hour deadline the american cyanamid board was scheduled to meet on tuesday otherwise , american home products said it would go ahead with its hostile 95ashare offer to shareholders , which analysts said set the stage for shareholders' lawsuits against american cyanamid we wanted to be sure that they understood what our position was , mr stafford said analysts said american cyanamid was evidently unable to find other bidders to match the offer on the new york stock exchange yesterday , shares of american cyanamid rose 2125 , to 96125 , and shares of american home products rose 375 cents , to 5925 stockholders have until sept 14 to accept the offer by selling their shares to american home products pasta and contraceptives subject to approval by federal antitrust regulators , american cyanamid , based in wayne nj , would be merged with a subsidiary of american home products , whose bestknown drugs include advil and anacin for headaches , the estrogen drug premarin , and norplant contraceptives it also makes infant formula and prepared foods including chef boyardee pasta and gulden s mustard american cyanamid makes several vaccines and sells centrum vitamins and fibercon laxatives about onethird of its 428 billion in sales in 1993 were in agricultural chemicals like weed and pestkillers after the merger , the companies would have 126 billion in sales , of which about 93 billion would be in drugs and other health care products analysts said american home products would probably sell the chemical unit for 4 billion , to reduce the 9 billion it plans to borrow to help finance the deal with a mountain of new debt , american home products would be in danger of losing its topranked triplea credit rating , according to david lugg , a corporate finance director at standard poor s , the rating agency both s p and moody s have placed american home products' debt on a watch list for possible downgrading but mr stafford insisted yesterday that there were no plans to sell the chemical unit we are not even evaluating selling , he said 'a world player' instead , mr stafford said american home products planned to seek candidates for new drugs in a huge library of compounds developed by american cyanamid , which used to be an industrial chemical company he said the merger would make american home products a world player in vaccines and strengthen its role in cancer drugs and antibiotics as well as lowpriced generic drugs and those sold without prescriptions most analysts praised the deal , with some reservations arvind desai at mehta isaly worldwide drug research , said it was a good development that would spur friendly mergers among other drug companies hemant k shah , an independent analyst in warren , nj , said he doubted that the merger would provide the advantage with managed care buyers that american home products was seeking either you own the managed care company , like merck or smithkline beecham or eli lilly , or you have innovative drugs , which this merger is not going to produce , he said neil b sweig at ladenburg , thalmann company , said the offering price was fair and generous he said antitrust regulators would look closely at overlaps in vaccines , prescription drugs and animal health products , but none of the overlaps appears to be a dealkiller ronald nordmann at paine webber securities , said american home products was buying time it allows them to have significant growth over the next two or three years through cost savings and synergies he added , they can probably squeeze out about 300 million a year from cyanamid s medical operations and sell the agricultural chemical business for as much as 4 billion but , mr nordmann said , the merger does not answer the question of how they bolster their relatively weak combined research effort graph how the merger partners compare tracks total sales , pretax operating earnings and net income for american home products corporation and cyanamid from 1990 through the first half of 1994 \( sources company reports \) \( pg d6 \)
responding to mounting protests by neighborhood groups in new york city over the placement of socialservice programs , the new york state office of mental health has decided to allow greater community say in the development of large residences for the mentally ill the new policy requires for the first time that city and state lawmakers be notified within five days when a nonprofit agency signs a contract for a site in their districts , and requires a 75day period for public comment state officials and representatives from the nonprofit agency must also attend any public meetings to discuss a project , and the office of mental health must explain why it chose to accept or reject the site residents do not have the power to block a proposed site under the new policy , but state officials are required to consider all objections raised by the community while the borough president , mayor and local community board were notified in the past , word often did not get out to residents who lived near a proposed site and when it did , the feelings of the community did not necessarily figure in the office of mental health s decision on whether to license a new housing program we are putting in black and white , in regulation , that community input is important in this process , said steven sanders , the chairman of the state assembly s mental health committee before , the community knew it was on the outside throwing pebbles at the windows of government , trying to get someone s attention , he said now they are empowered it does n't mean that the outcome will always be agreeable but they have an actual role to play quiet policy change the change in policy , made quietly earlier this month , grew out of months of discussions between the office of mental health and mr sanders , a democrat whose district runs along the east side of manhattan between 45th and delancey streets the new policy drew praise from a coalition of neighborhood groups that was formed last year to press for changes in the placement of residences and clinical programs for the mentally ill , aids patients , alcoholics , drug addicts and former prisoners it s a step in the right direction , certainly , said gerard schriffen , acting cochairman of the group , the manhattan neighborhood council but the change has angered some advocates for the mentally ill , as well as leaders of nonprofit agencies that manage housing programs they argue that it will make the creation of residences even more difficult than at present and could even violate federal fair housing laws because it holds people with mental disabilities to a different standard in finding housing for them keeping people out there is plenty of community input now , but unfortunately it s not thoughtful input but an attempt to keep people with mental disabilities out of the neighborhood , said katina zachmanoglou , director of the alliance for the mentally ill advocacy project in new york city , a nonprofit group it parallels the fight that blacks underwent for integration richard salyer , president of volunteers of americagreater new york , a large nonprofit agency that manages emergency and permanent housing for homeless people , including those with mental illnesses , said the new policy could delay the acquisition of properties you may have facilities where the seller is not going to wait around for a 75day period , particularly knowing that the process itself may lead to disapproval , he said for the last 15 years , under the socalled padavan law , there has been an elaborate mechanism in new york state for sounding out communities on group homes those with fewer than 15 beds for the mentally ill and retarded named after state senator frank padavan , a republican from queens , the law allows group homes to bypass local zoning laws as long as they meet state codes but it also allows for community challenges if , during an administrative proceeding , residents can prove that the area is saturated with such homes or identify a better home site elsewhere , the state will scrap its plans for the proposed site in new york city , however , it is usually too costly to develop suchsmall residences , which dot the suburbs , and so the padavan law has not applied i 've always thought there was a great irony that here we have a law that affects programs that have only a slight impact , mr sanders said but for the programs such as 72bed facilities that have an enormous impact , there s no process the new policy does not go as far as the padavan statute in that there is no process for residents to stop a home from being licensed rather , it invites general comment from the public that the office of mental health must take into account it does n't provide the community with a veto , but a voice , mr sanders said but mr sanders called the issue of saturation frequently raised by residents on the upper west side and lower east side relevant to site selection because it is already a precedent for smaller facilities under the padavan law state mentalhealth officials said the new policy would be as important in correcting public perception as official practice
joliet , ill , tuesday , may 10 john wayne gacy , convicted 14 years ago of the sexrelated killings of 33 young men and boys , was put to death by lethal injection early today as the nation s worst serial killer on record the execution , which took place in the old stateville penitentiary here , followed lastminute appeals filed by mr gacy s lawyers , asserting that their 52yearold client was mentally incompetent , that he was out of town at the time of 16 of the slayings and that illinois' method of execution was unconstitutional but none of the state or federal judges appealed to on monday , including justice john paul stevens of the united states supreme court , would stay mr gacy s execution howard a peters , a corrections official , said mr gacy was pronounced dead at 12 58 pm , nearly an hour after the injection of three lethal chemicals had been scheduled to begin the process was delayed because gelling prevented the chemicals from flowing through a delivery tube , mr peters said the prisoner gave a final statement proclaiming his innocence , mr peters said demonstrations pro and con mr gacy inspired a range of emotions and passions since the first of his victims was discovered beneath his chicago house and yesterday it was all the more so opponents of capital punishment gathered in chicago to urge that mr gacy s life be spared , as others , like the guardian angels anticrime group , gathered in chicago to demand that his execution be carried out although the authorities said mr gacy had at one time confessed , he later insisted he was innocent , even going so far as to state his case in a recording that the public could hear via a 900 telephone number but the authorities said the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming mr gacy , an ordinaryseeming

as a masterpiece machine , the new york city ballet s diamond project fell predictably short as a huge workshop for 12 emerging or established choreographers to conduct their education in public , it was right on the mark like the 1992 diamond project , also conceived by peter martins , the city ballet s artistic director , the latest event was intended to encourage new choreography in the classical idiom the premieres , spread out over two weeks , were created for the showcase , which is named after a prime donor , the aaron diamond foundation it is debatable whether any such artificial stimulus can lead to genuine creativity the danger is that choreographers on assignment will produce work that looks as if it were made on assignment on the other hand , an opportunity to collaborate with dancers of city ballet s caliber can provide an impetus to stretch creative talent the diamond premieres , given from may 18 through june 3 , were more complex and sophisticated than those of two years ago yet some of the pieces presented in 1992 had a freshness that the new , more ambitious ones lacked whatever the result , the fact is that ballet choreography is consistently , and sometimes unfairly , held to a standard rarely found in other areas of the arts a century blessed with george balanchine , antony tudor , frederick ashton and jerome robbins has obliged their successors to work in the lasting shadows of the giants unlike film makers and most playwrights , ballet choreographers see their works constantly compared with repertory masterpieces on the same program but when independent film makers , for instance , submit their work to film festivals , few people expect a masterpiece these works are greeted as experiments think of the diamond project as the equivalent of a film festival , and mr martins s idea of holding a biennial showcase is more than justified the aim is not to establish a hitparade repertory but to develop talent and charge admission in the process moreover , the project s insistence on concentrating on the classical vocabulary is well founded it is common to hear that the best choreographers now associated with ballet companies are those with a moderndance background yet all too often these choreographers mock the classical vocabulary rather than acknowledge it as a given in the end , their works serve as novelties , not as repertory staples for ballet troupes what moderndance choreographers excel at is modern dance their gift is for exploring new movement , rather than accepting the premises of a 400yearold idiom , which they frequently seek to subvert at the same time , it is not true , as is widely said , that there is a dearth of classical choreographers what is true is that such ballet choreographers cannot match the level of genius to which the field has become accustomed nonetheless , the diamond project confidently proclaims that the classical idiom is still worth exploiting it swears allegiance , in effect , to balanchine s proposition that classical ballet steps can be combined in an infinite number of ways the typical balanchine ballet is plotless and neoclassical in style and uses music in place of a narrative image as its springboard none of this is as simple as it looks i am reminded of balanchine s candid appraisal of how easily such works could fail it is very boring what i do , he said you have to know how to make it interesting what he meant was that you had to be balanchine to succeed at choreography in which technique is both form and content classroom steps are not interesting in themselves they must be reinvented and recombined to create a work of art balanchine s legacy is still revolutionary he taught the public to see ballet in a new way choreography became nonillusionist , representing nothing outside itself for younger choreographers , this kind of ballet is difficult they cannot hide behind theatrical trappings or a story line although they are challenged , they are also exposed the balanchine ballet was the implicit model in the diamond project the emphasis was on steps and structures , a selfimposed formula from which some of the 12 choreographers were visibly straining to escape one result was a ballet like lynne taylorcorbett s chiaroscuro , which teased the audience with strong dramatic imagery that was never explored in depth ulysses dove was more schematic in his red angels , but he too knew how to assemble highly theatrical ingredients these included mark stanley s redhot lighting , holly hynes s red leotards for a quartet of dancers and a dazzling score for electric violin by max einhorn , maxwell s dream although the energy was explosive , the phrases were rarely linked in the end , classical choreography is essentially about linkage the work of a genuine ballet choreographer is measured by how the steps are put together some , like john alleyne , deliberately work in spurts of movement enveloped in palchabel organ music , his ballet the new blondes showed dancers in trendy isolation of one another regrettably , it was something less than the sum of its parts

new york city police officers often make false arrests , tamper with evidence and commit perjury on the witness stand , according to a draft report of the mayoral commission investigating police corruption the practice by officers either legitimately interested in clearing the streets of criminals or simply eager to inflate statistics has at times been condoned by superiors , the report says and it is prevalent enough in the department that it has its own nickname testilying perjury is perhaps the most widespread form of police wrongdoing facing today s criminal justice system , the draft report says the report did not attempt to estimate what proportion of the department had engaged in such practices , but based its judgment on the commission s twoyear investigation and interviews with scores of officers the finding , coming on the heels of recent corruption scandals involving drug dealing and brutality , will further threaten public confidence in the integrity of the police department , says the report , which also describes a level of misconduct and abuse that goes well beyond what the commission had made public in an interim finding last december in its new findings , the mollen commission report also says that the number of corruption cases buried by the police department s internal affairs division was more than three times as great as first suspected in addition , the report says , in at least two instances representatives of the police union tipped off targets of investigations and in its discussion of false testimony by officers , the report says that the commission was told of officers up to the rank of captain being actively complicit in and even encouraging warrantless searches and subsequent perjury this is corruption more harmful to relations between police and the public than anything the department and the city have experienced before , the document says milton mollen , the former deputy mayor who was appointed to head the commission , said that the draft report was undergoing substantial revisions and that the final report will be very different mr mollen refused to say what the revisions concerned , and he declined to answer questions about the substantive conclusions arrived at in the draft report , a copy of which was shown to the new york times by a lawenforcement official police commissioner william j bratton said he would not comment on any aspect of the draft report and would reserve judgment until the final version is officially released the final report is scheduled to be released by the end of may an official with the commission said that although the report was being revised , the substantive findings would not change the report suggests that for all of the recent graphic cases of brutality and stealing by groups of officers in a handful of precincts throughout the city , the repeated instances of perjury and false arrests were just as disturbing it cites numerous instances of police officers tampering with evidence to justify arrests , falsifying reports and then lying under oath when questioned by prosecutors and it says the police department s own corruption categories do not even include a category for perjury or falsification of records one commanding officer encouraged such illegal searches and arrest charges as a means of bolstering his unit s performance record , the report says robert m morgenthau , the district attorney for manhattan , said he thought the scope of the perjury problem might be exaggerated in the report but he said that he had prosecuted a handful of perjury cases against police officers recently , and that one major drug conviction had been dismissed after it was discovered that the police had lied concerning the reason for the initial arrest a range of recommendations charles j hynes , the district attorney for brooklyn , said that police officers often tried to get around the problem of needing probable cause before making an arrest by what he called the dropsy syndrome falsely testifying that a suspect tossed a package containing white powder to the ground as he was approached the draft report also includes a staff memorandum listing a range of potential recommendations for restructuring the police department and revamping how it monitors itself a senior police department official , as well as the head of the patrolmen s benevolent association , said yesterday that they would embrace many of the nearly 50 recommendations under discussion by the commission , including increasing the minimum age for recruits and bolstering the program of random drug testing already in place but mr mollen said none of the recommendations had been adopted by the commission he said several of them , including the idea of abolishing the police academy and the proposal of systematic polygraph testing in corruption investigations , were absolutely wild and not under consideration neither the draft version of the report nor the internal memorandum includes information about perhaps the most central issue facing the commission the idea of an independent monitor for overseeing the department s handling of corruption investigations
foxboro , mass , nov 20 this was bill parcells s type of game he must have been pinching himself to keep from exploding into a smile watching new england running back marion butts plow into the san diego defensive front like a bulldozer and seeing linebacker chris slade do a darn good impression of a young lawrence taylor one week after quarterback drew bledsoe set national football league records in passes \( 70 \) and completions \( 45 \) to rally new england from a 200 deficit to a 2620 victory against minnesota , the patriots were in control this afternoon in a 2317 victory over the san diego chargers about the only anxious moment for the patriots came near the end of the game , when chargers quarterback stan humphries threw a 2yard touchdown pass to receiver tony martin with 1 minute 1 second to play to make the score 2317 patriots fullback kevin turner recovered the chargers' onsides kick at the san diego 42 to calm things down and secure the victory for new england here are the numbers that probably pleased parcells the most matt bahr kicked three field goals \( 39 , 38 , and 23 yards \) butts had 28 carries for 88 yards and 1 touchdown slade had 35 sacks , and bledsoe completed 21 of 36 attempts for 224 yards , 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions the coach could have done without bledsoe s 2 interceptions and the 80yard kickoff return touchdown by chargers receiver andre coleman but , hey , why quibble \? i thought we played our best game of the year , said a placid parcells we were a little less than perfect in a couple of areas , but over all i thought our offense and defense played well we had one special teams lapse new england improved to 56 and is feeling confident about its playoff chances the patriots are just two games behind the dolphins in the afc east san diego dropped to 83 , but did n't lose any ground in the conference because cleveland also lost but after getting off to a 60 start , san diego has now lost three of the last five games and looks vulnerable for the second consecutive week , the chargers' running game was stuffed running back natrone means was held to 59 yards on 15 carries last week against kansas city he had 55 yards rushing , but the chargers were able to overcome that when humphries threw two touchdown passes to rally for a 1413 victory we 're not a very good team when we have to step up and throw the ball , said san diego right tackle stan brock i'm not taking anything away from stan , but our offense is built around the running game the patriots knew that so , they plugged all the rushing lanes with bodies safeties and linebackers and forced means to the outside where the pursuit caught up to him their offense is n't designed to open things up for humphries to pass , said patriots right cornerback maurice hurst , who had two interceptions they tried to run it inside and get something going so they could go with the play action but the play action does n't work if the running game does n't work there s no threat meanwhile , the patriots , who entered the game dead last in the nfl in rushing with an average of 752 yards a game , surprised the chargers by keeping the ball on the ground chargers strong safety darren carrington was asked whether san diego s defense should have been more prepared for the run knowing they would be facing butts , a former teammate whose forte was slamming into the line we probably should have , carrington said but we prepared for them based on what they 've been doing in the past and they have n't been running the ball plus , the chargers got no help from the game officials , who missed several calls in the game none was more blatant or crucial than a roughingthepasser call against junior seau in the third quarter with the patriots holding a 103 lead seau rushed bledsoe , leaped in the air and swiped around with his right arm , missing bledsoe completely bledsoe s pass was intercepted by chargers linebacker dennis gilbert instead of getting the turnover , seau was hit with a 15yard penalty for roughing the passer because referee gordon mccarter as he said after the game construed seau s open roundhouse swing to be a blow to bledsoe s head television replays showed that bledsoe ducked under seau s arm i did n't even touch the quarterback , seau said it was a big turnaround but you have to live with the call it was a bad call but what can you do \? with consecutive victories over division leaders , the patriots are feeling good about themselves for a change i think the statement we 've made is that people will have to respect us , because we 're a team capable of beating anyone , bledsoe said photo chargers' stan humphries being sacked by partiots' chris slade \( 53 \) as mike jones follows the play \( associated press \)
a twoyear congressional study of the explosive growth in financial derivatives that was released yesterday calls for sweeping new regulation of the companies that create these often complex financial products and the companies that use them the general accounting office said the banks , brokerage firms and insurance companies that deal in derivatives should be subject to uniform rules on how to manage the risk of their trading positions , how much capital to keep to cushion against losses , and how to disclose data about their derivatives activity currently , banks are subject to strict supervision , but other derivatives dealers are more lightly regulated , if at all while the recommendations effectively seek to force all market participants to follow what are generally regarded as the best industry practices , derivatives dealers were quick to call the recommendations unwarranted derivatives are contracts with values that are based on , or derived from , underlying financial markets the owner of a stock option , for example , can make profits or lose money as a stock price rises or falls , without owning any shares of the stock some derivatives , like options , are used by investors to speculate or to hedge positions in stocks , bonds and commodities others , like swaps , are used by corporations to reduce their risks from the fluctuations of interest rates and currencies the gao , which is the investigative arm of congress , said more regulation was needed because the use of derivatives might increase the risk of a financial crisis on the other hand , the report said , derivatives could also reduce the risk of such a crisis representative edward j markey , the massachusetts democrat who is the chairman of the house subcommittee that requested the report , endorsed its recommendations it is a tour de force , blistering , scalding indictment of the deficiencies in the current regulatory safeguards , he said they identified a regulatory black hole when it comes to derivatives mr markey said he endorsed all the recommendations and he expected to introduce a bill to enact them this year in his subcommittee on telecommunications and finance , which oversees brokerage firms the house banking committee is working on a separate bill to strengthen regulation of derivatives activities by banks congressional aides say that none of the bills are likely to pass this year the clinton administration has not decided whether derivatives activities of brokerage firms and insurance companies should be subject to increased regulation , but it opposes new legislation regarding banks i do n't know of any new authority that bank regulators feel they need , frank newman , the under secretary of the treasury for domestic finance , said over all , he played down any danger of derivatives to the nation s financial system it s a risk that needs to be looked at , he said but i do n't think anyone , including the gao , is portraying this as some imminent , likely danger banks and brokerage firms were uniform in denouncing the report derivatives are an essential component of modern financial activity and a critically important risk management tool for corporations , financial institutions , and governments around the world , said six banking and brokerage trade associations in a rare joint statement if implemented , the gao recommendations would increase the cost and reduce the availability of these essential transactions , the associations said the gao did not propose restricting any derivative products or limiting their use instead , the 200page report raised concerns that derivatives activity is concentrated at a handful of banks , brokerage firms and insurance companies and that derivatives may increase the linkages between various markets as a result , the report said , some regulators and market participants felt that if one major dealer failed or withdrew from the market , it could cause problems for other dealers and in other markets other regulators , the study noted , argue that derivatives actually reduce the risk of such cascading problems no empirical evidence was available for determining the actual effects of these characteristics because no crisis caused by derivatives has occurred , the report said still , the report concluded that the potential for such a crisis was sufficient to require greater government involvement dealers assail recommendations derivatives dealers were especially critical of the report , saying its data did not back up the assertions they do n't have material in the report that justifies their recommendations , said mark brickell , an executive of j p morgan and vice chairman of the international swaps and derivatives association the report does present data to show that all but one of the largest united states banks have greater credit risk from loans than from derivatives and though the report warns that derivatives' principal risks to the system result from the relatively small number of dealers , the gao s own survey shows that just 11 percent of the credit exposure of american derivatives dealers are with other domestic dealers most banks would face more losses if another financial firm failed from foreign currency trading or from loans than from derivatives trades , mr brickell said why does a dealer in derivatives deserve those burdens when a dealer in foreign exchange is not faced with them \? he asked james l bothwell , the director of financial institution and markets issues for the gao , argued that the study found many weaknesses in risk management and that those problems justified the report s concerns we have no empirical basis to say the risk is likely , but the risk certainly is there it could happen , he said seeks routine disclosure the gao s principal recommendation is that derivatives dealers at brokerage firms and insurance companies be subject to the same sort of strict regular examinations and rules for disclosure , internal controls and capital as federally insured banks other recommendations included updating accounting standards to reflect derivative exposure better fostering uniform international regulations , and forcing corporations that use complex derivatives to have adequate controls and disclosures more broadly , the gao said congress should consider more sweeping reform of financial regulation because it has not kept pace with the blurring of lines between industries banking , securities , futures and insurance are no longer separate and distinct industries that can be well regulated by the existing patchwork quilt of federal and state agencies , the report said
wantagh , li , oct 19 dave allan wants to build a bridge he has the men , the machines and the money a 67 million state contract to reconstruct the island creek bridge , a 117footlong structure on the wantagh state parkway north of jones beach the problem is , he cannot get the construction materials no company on long island , he says , will sell him the tons of asphalt and concrete he needs it is not that his credit is bad or that there is not enough concrete to go around simply put , mr allan says , long island s construction unions have banded together to deny his nonunionized company , chesterfield associates , access to building materials and so even though he has a state contract that would save taxpayers money , that would complete the job on an expedited basis and pay his workers as much as union workers , mr allan s project is on the verge of shutting down tim kourounis , the state department of transportation s onsite engineer , says he has never seen anything like it on a project of this scope in 32 years with the department never , he said , standing on a dirt road about 300 feet from the halfdemolished bridge and there s only so much that can be done before he s forced to stop everything is going to have to stop when mr allan s trucks have shown up at the long island asphalt and concrete plants with which he has contracts , unionized workers have been refusing to fill the orders , mr allan said last month , he had four trucks ready to be loaded with asphalt from silos at a plant in melville , mr allan said , when workers operating the silos refused to pull the switches the confrontation lasted several hours until the police arrived and asked him to move his trucks he and other company officials say that rebuilding the bridge a vital link during the summer for drivers heading to one of the nation s most popular public beaches is already three to four weeks behind schedule , just two months into the project the company , founded in 1968 , had bid 1 million less for the job than the next lowest bidder now company officials could face penalties of up to 20 , 000 a day for missing completion dates to officials at chesterfield , a westhampton beachbased concern with 75 employees that is working on the biggest contract in its history and paying workers on this job unionscale wages , although the company saves money because there are no union work rules the action against the company seems nothing less than industrial sabotage it is , officials say , an effort by the unions to bring them to their knees i think they feel that as time goes by and the pressure is great enough , we 'll sign , mr allan said chesterfield is trying to prove the unions are engaging in what is known as a secondary boycott , an unfair labor practice under the federal tafthartley act gil simmers , chesterfield s secretary treasurer , said the company has appeared before the national labor relations board , seeking an injunction against the unions a spokeswoman for the board s regional office in brooklyn did not return calls to the unions , however , the confrontation is merely an expression of the solidarity among workers seeking to protect their rights to construction jobs in tough financial times this is union work , said dennis bonello , a member of the laborers' union who has been walking a picket line set up on the parkway about a mile north of the bridge we pay the taxes out here we want the work out here caught in the middle are the motorists who use the wantagh parkway , which has been reduced from three lanes to one in each direction over the bridge state parks officials say it is too early for panic the project is scheduled to be completed on may 15 but if the standoff persists , the road could be a traffic nightmare next summer so far , state transportation officials have declined mr allan s requests to help him out of his difficulty , or to address his suggestion that the department buy the asphalt and concrete for him , and deduct the costs from his contract it s really a labor dispute , rather than a dot dispute , said barbara wayne , a department spokeswoman but we want to get the project finished , obviously mr allan , whose company specializes in marine construction and has been doing work for the new york state department of transportation since 1987 , says that over the years the unions have repeatedly lobbied him to sign agreements to hire union labor , but that he has always resisted , in part because he says his employees do not want a union he believes that the pressure is being brought to bear now because of the large price tag of the bridge project , and because he owns the largest nonunion firm in the construction business on long island he says he also remains nonunion because of the flexibility it gives him to deploy workers to do a variety of different tasks on a union job site , the workers' functions are spelled out which he said requires contractors to hire additional workers for example , workers on mr allan s projects could be asked to drive a dump truck and then run a jackhammer , jobs that on a union site are controlled by two separate unions union officials say , however , that such divisions of labor are necessary because of safety concerns and the special training required of many tasks on the construction site
washington , jan 27 the secondhighest official at the justice department , philip b heymann , announced his resignation today , an abrupt departure that added to the long list of personnel problems that have plagued the clinton administration at a news conference , both attorney general janet reno and mr heymann , the deputy attorney general , blamed a lack of chemistry between them for his resignation but neither official would discuss specific frictions that led to the announcement , which sent another shock through a justice department that has never settled into a rhythm after a succession of difficulties in filling top positions ms reno herself was the third candidate announced by president clinton , and the top civil rights post is still vacant grumbling among officials ms reno said today that she did not tell the white house of mr heymann s departure until she alerted bernard w nussbaum , the white house counsel , on wednesday evening this left some administration officials grumbling about what they considered a highhanded approach that gave the white house almost no time to prepare for the announcement mr heymann said he and ms reno had decided he should go , concluding after long discussions that they were incompatible we do n't have any great policy differences , he said there is no precipitating case or event the fact of the matter is our chemistry is n't good we do n't work as well together as we should , and that s the conclusion we 've both come to but within the justice department , career lawyers expressed skepticism that the deputy attorney general had quit or was dismissed without any specific disagreements with the attorney general the agency has lurched through several embarrassing episodes , most recently when ms reno reversed herself at the request of the white house and named an independent prosecutor to look into the clintons' real estate dealings in arkansas one official said the break between ms reno and her top aide had resulted from an accumulation of small frictions , many of them dealing with ms reno s perception , sometimes expressed bluntly at meetings with other senior aides , that mr heymann moved too slowly and could not handle all the issues she delegated to him the official said mr heymann had begun to realize he was the wrong man for the job he did n't think he was failing , the official said he felt he was failing her ms reno said today that she had already begun a search for mr heymann s successor so far , aides said , there are no frontrunners for the job some lawyers inside and outside the justice department said the white house might try to use the appointment to rein in the attorney general , who has sometimes left the impression that she favors a more lenient approach to law enforcement than mr clinton among the potential successors , whose names were circulating in legal circles today were charles f c ruff , a former united states attorney in washington who ms reno s aides said was her original choice for the job but who was not nominated because of problems with taxes for a household worker others also mentioned were drew s days 3d , the solicitor general , and ronald k noble , an assistant secretary at the treasury department one recent disagreement between ms reno and her deputy , a department official said , arose when the attorney general was displeased when mr heymann was slow in preparing a recommendation on whether mr clinton should pardon jonathan j pollard , an american jew convicted of spying for israel in 1987 mr clinton has said he will seriously review the case , which has prompted some american jewish groups and the israeli government to seek leniency for mr pollard , although prosecutors as well as military and intelligence officials oppose it ms reno said today that the justice department still had not sent its views on the matter to the white house a colleague of mr heymann said any delays were caused by the white house difficult moments mr heymann was in the middle of some of the justice department s more difficult moments , although ms reno said none of these was a factor in his leaving he supervised the analysis of how the department performed during the april 1993 tear gas assault on the branch davidian compound near waco , tex some lawyers at the department regarded the report as a very gentle appraisal of the performance by ms reno and the federal bureau of investigation in july , after the suicide of vincent w foster jr , the deputy white house counsel , mr heymann accepted ground rules imposed by mr nussbaum that kept law enforcement authorities from gaining access to mr foster s office files mr nussbaum has said the procedure was proper , but some prosecutors said the highly unusual arrangement had allowed mr clinton s lawyer to decide what would be turned over to investigators academic approach the avuncular , polite and smiling mr heymann , who is 61 , brought in a staff of admiring young lawyers whom he had taught at harvard law school , often engaging them in discussions of thorny legal issues in informal lunches in the department s cafeteria but the deputy s job is one of the toughest political posts at the justice department , which is still managed on a daytoday basis by the deputy and handful assistant attorneys general even though the size of the agency has quintupled since 1980 mr heymann s decision to leave is yet another personnel problem for the clinton administration it follows an embarrassing moment just a week ago , when bobby ray inman unexpectedly withdrew his nomination for defense secretary still other officials have been pressed to step down from office the no 2 official at the state department , clifton r wharton , was forced out in an effort to end criticism of mr clinton s foreign policy team , and les aspin was forced to resign last month as defense secretary after a year of tumultuous battles over issues like the role of homosexuals in the military and american deaths in somalia appointments in the justice department have troubled mr clinton since he took office his first two choices for attorney general , zoe baird and judge kimba m wood , failed because of problems with their household help after ms reno was named , finding a candidate to head the civil rights division came to be one of the administration s most visible personnel problems mr clinton first candidate , lani guinier , a law professor at the university of pennsylvania , was forced out of the running when criticism of her writings by republican lawmakers led mr clinton to say her views were out of sync with his officials then said they had settled on john payton , the corporation counsel for the district of columbia , but his name was withdrawn in the face of opposition from the congressional black caucus today , mr heymann said he first raised the possibility of leaving with ms reno early this month and said he discussed with her again monday he plans to remain until a successor is selected , but said he would not sit around as a lame duck photo philip b heymann
joseph s coatsworth is vice president for governmental relations at the connecticut hospital association , a position that puts him in the midst of the debate over statelevel health care reform , which is expected to be one of the major topics before the general assembly this year mr coatsworth , a native of connecticut , graduated from the university of wisconsin at madison with a degree in history and english he is scheduled to complete his work toward an mba at the university of hartford this year he worked for hartford national bank and served five terms in the general assembly before joining the association in 1979 the association has released its own proposal for health care changes in the state , prepared by lewinvhi inc , a national consulting firm at his office in wallingford recently , mr coatsworth discussed the association s health care proposals and other topics that will affect hospitals in coming months following are excerpts from that discussion q what have the hospitals proposed for health care reform \? a our major presumption is that the clinton health care plan guarantees access and coverage for all people if you know all people are covered , how can you structure a system that will meet cost limits and provide sensible levels of health care \? we can form a network of providers for a capitated rate by that we mean , if there are a halfmillion people in a congressional district , you give us 3 , 000 per person and we create a network of providers who will administer medical care to those people who need it q where do the funds come from \? a it s the employer mandate , where all employers are obligated to pay the cost of health insurance for their employees but there are no community ratings , no saying 'we 're going to insure this group but not that group' there would be an agency set up by state government to contract with these networks of providers for the services the networks would get a set sum of money , and if they ca n't do it they go out of business the genius of this plan is the incentive to the provider community to avoid costly care if you have a lot of hospitalizations you would use up that money real quick so you would develop programs to go out in the community and find people who have health problems that are going to get worse , like teenage pregnancy if no one finds them now , when they arrive at the hospital it could be 200 , 000 you want to make sure they get early prenatal care so they do n't become a colossal expense to the system q hospitals have been under attack for years for raising prices too much what guarantee do we have that that wo n't happen in this plan \? a because you wo n't pay them any more than a set amount , which would be set by an state agency q have capitation models worked anywhere \? a capitation is kind of a new concept , although some health maintenance organizations have used it , and it s part of plans in europe and ontario where it s worked that i'm aware of are individual hospitals where they contract with a major client to provide services at a set rate so it has had limited experience q could connecticut implement health care reform if the clinton plan is n't adopted \? a none of this happens unless the clinton plan passes but the state legislature wants to get some things in place , and this is what we 're offering them as an alternative implicit in this is that rate regulation by the state hospital commission disappears , because no one will be paying a rate anyway there would be the capitated rate , and that s that but certainly connecticut could not proceed without a national plan in place you ca n't tell employers in connecticut to pay for health insurance or rhode island will be telling employers to bring their businesses over there , where you can do it cheaper q is accessibility really an issue in connecticut \? a access is an issue in many , many parts of the country , so connecticut is not representative , because we have very few uninsured , 8 percent tops you go to texas and it s 24 percent some parts of california it s much higher than that this is a highincome , highemployment area also in connecticut if you come to an emergency room we 're not going to send you someplace else , which can happen in other parts of the country q what s going to happen to demand for services if you suddenly increase accessibility \? a the element of cost in a state with the highest income in the nation is bound to rise dramatically there have been studies that have shown the link between health care expenses and income people who make over 75 , 000 a year , a lot of them think it s time to see a psychiatrist if you make 15 , 000 a year you do n't even think about it and if you put a psychiatrist on every street corner in connecticut they would probably have enough business as long as someone else is paying the bill q would cooperation between the 34 general hospitals in the state violate antitrust laws \? a that s the subject of another bill the cochairmen of the public health committee asked us to draft a bill that would exempt hospitals from the antitrust provisions of the federal and state governments to get this done you would have to apply for the exemption say both hospitals in stamford want to share or eliminate some services they would have to apply to a state agency , which would have to determine whether there is some public good accomplished by that q there s been a running battle over costs between connecticut s hospitals , the business community and insurers wo n't the association s proposal increase the tension \?
los angeles , oct 13 the first 31 juror questionnaires to be released in the o j simpson murder trial offer an intriguing , though not entirely convincing , whisper of the vox populi and there was plenty of time to study them today as jury selection halted abruptly when the assistant prosecutor in the case , william w hodgman , took ill with a stomach ailment though more than half of the initial 94 potential jurors called to court are either black or hispanic , few of the first 31 awaiting interviews said in their questionnaires that racial discrimination in los angeles was serious they stood stalwartly by the presumption of innocence they said they had an open mind about most things , including dna testing they said they did not use knives for anything but cooking or boning fish and they said they did not oppose racial intermarriage indeed , some were all for it my brother married an hispanic gal and i'm chasing a chinese one , one juror wrote another responded i could n't care less our country is plenty mixed up , and we just have to live with it their heroes included ronald reagan , dolly parton and elizabeth dole , of whom a 31yearold white woman from pasadena wrote , she is focused , committed , and puts up with bob judge lance a ito has said he wants no hermits but if there were few blank slates about the simpson case in the jury pool or anywhere else , the selfportraits in the questionnaires contained almost no chalk marks a 43yearold black woman from southcentral los angeles said she had never discussed the case with family and friends others said they did so rarely asked her impression of nicole brown simpson , another black woman wrote none a 38yearold hispanic man dismissed the police s freeway pursuit of mr simpson as just another chase not everyone was mealymouthed or monosyllabic juror no 578 , a 68yearold white woman from northwestern los angeles , called mrs simpson beautiful , affluent and shallow , her call to 911 scary , and a 1989 incident of domestic violence involving the simpsons appalling she also opposed racial intermarriage marriage is tough enough when both partners are the same color , the woman wrote a 68yearold black man was as opinionated he labeled the 911 call a trick and , asked what he thought of it , replied who care \? is domestic violence sometimes justified \? hell yes , he responded initial reactions to mr simpson s travails ranged from amazement to nonchalance i would think if he wanted his exwife killed he would have someone else do it , a 27yearold san gabriel woman wrote a 60year old black man from the west side of los angeles declared , living in la , this type of news is not surprising to me anymore was mr simpson less likely to commit murder because he was a football star \? i thought he played basketball \( and anyone is capable of anything \) , one candidate replied most of the jury candidates had seen the freeway chase , if only because it interrupted their soap operas \( a 39yearold hispanic woman from whittier \) or a knicks basketball game \( a 21yearold black woman from west los angeles \) some quibbled with the word chase , since the cars were crawling both lead lawyers in the case got positive reviews of robert l shapiro for the defense , juror no 352 stated , dresses nice , balding in back of head a 27yearold woman from san gabriel added competent a little showboating going on there juror no 123 , a 57yearold white woman from santa monica , said the prosecutor , marcia clark , seems to have chip on her shoulder but doing a good job experts now estimate that the trial could last as long as six months judge ito has yet to rule on whether the jury will be sequestered for that time , which the prosecution has requested but the questionnaires confirmed what many had felt these jury candidates want to serve on the jury , no matter what the indignities that could make spotting latent prejudices even more daunting , though joellan dimitrius , the defense s jury consultant , said today that the initial pool of 84 candidates might well yield the 12 jurors and 8 alternates necessary for the past two weeks , opposing lawyers and jury consultants have minutely studied the questionnaires donald vincent , the prosecution s jury consultant , said , the one thing that is really different here is the number that want to serve i have never seen anything like this before people were more guarded than they usually are they worked very hard to be perceived as nonjudgmental , noncommittal the questionnaires also indicated an unusual degree of sympathy for the defendant , who is someone many prospective jurors felt they had long known and liked many referred to him as o j or mr simpson judge ito may rule tomorrow on a defense attempt to block evidence seized from mr simpson s ford bronco because the car was broken into while in the police s custody he will also hear defense motions to investigate disclosures to the press for that hearing , mr simpson s lawyers have subpoenaed willie l williams , chief of the los angeles police department , and david j gascon , until recently the head police spokesman subpoenas also went out to a reporter , tracie savage , and carole black , an executive from knbctv , which judge ito said mistakenly reported that dna testing detected mrs simpson s blood on mr simpson s socks the judge today directed prosecutors to turn over those socks to the defense once its own testing was completed judge ito , who has communicated his distaste for the press to the jury pool , and periodically shows off stacks of letters from people opposing televised coverage of the case , today banned word processors from the cramped quarters where the multitude of reporters barred from the courtroom must listen to , but cannot see , jury selection the ostensible reason one machine contained a hidden tape recorder a court spokeswoman , jerrianne hayslett , warned sternly that security may be tightened further it may get to the point where we have to take apart pens to look for hidden microphones , she said
in the lake of the woods by tim o'brien 306 pp boston seymour lawrence houghton mifflin company 2195 what stories can do , i guess , is make things present that s how tim o'brien put it in the things they carried , which was published in 1990 and which is one of the finest books , fact or fiction , written about the vietnam war i do n't remember ever hearing a novelist make a more modest claim for the power of stories , at least not a novelist of mr o'brien s stature the statement itself stories make things present is unassuming , and it is offered to the reader diffidently , as if the writer were about to deny the possibility of saying anything useful at all about stories perhaps it suggests the discomfort of a storyteller who has , for the moment , slipped outside his story , except that outside his story is where tim o'brien has nearly always been , taking refuge as he says in his striking new novel , in the lake of the woods in the fine line between biology and spirit , between some literal , if unknowable , truth and the truth whose only evidence is the story that contains it these are important matters in mr o'brien s previous works in the 1978 novel going after cacciato , the reader comes to worry about the difference between a story that is merely implausible a platoon of soldiers following a man on foot from vietnam to paris and a story that is unbelievable precisely because it is true , a story of the vietnam war itself , a war that seemed to contain every likelihood of improbability in the things they carried , the storyteller s indeterminacy has grown the narrator of those stories distinguishes between storytruth and happeningtruth , and he plays one against the other for mr o'brien , as for many other vietnam veterans , the happeningtruth is a terrible thing it is too powerful to look at , though you are forced to witness it and yet , in mr o'brien s case , it has dwindled over time into what he calls faceless responsibility and faceless grief , which storytruth has the power to help him accept and alleviate in his new novel , he turns these matters of truth , time and responsibility inward , letting them weigh on an individual character in a manner he has never done before this is a story about a man named john wade and his wife , kathleen , who disappears one day from the cottage they are renting at the lake of the woods in northern minnesota , an enormous reach of water and wilderness that divides the united states and canada wade is a minnesota politician , and he has just lost a primary election for his party s nomination to the united states senate he lost big because his opponent uncovered the fact that wade was present at a massacre in the vietnamese village of thuan yen , which is the local name for a place better known to history as my lai , where on march 16 , 1968 , between 200 and 500 civilians were butchered by a company of american soldiers commanded by lieut william calley wade s presence there was a secret wade had kept from his wife , from his campaign manager and , in a sense , from himself at thuan yen , wade had been responsible for the deaths of one old man and an american soldier but in this novel , it is never clear whether culpability can be parceled out like that , whether it belongs to the deed or the doer or merely to what the narrator calls the poisonous sunlight of vietnam in the end , wade also disappears on that northern lake , gone in search of his wife , leaving behind only a sympathetic narrator , an author who tries to reconstruct the tale after it has already come to its mysterious close there are three kinds of story in in the lake of the woods the first is a conventional , remote thirdperson account of plain facts , the events that can be reconstructed without conjecture , more or less the second kind of story appears in several chapters called evidence collections of quotations , excerpts from interviews and readings that bear on the wade case the third kind of story appears in chapters called hypothesis it tries to suggest what might have happened to kathleen wade in the days after she disappeared but with these stories , mr o'brien is also building a character , john wade , whose inner architecture is more emblematic than personal wade is the son of an alcoholic father who hanged himself in the family garage as a child , wade consoled himself isolated himself with magic in vietnam he came to be called sorcerer , and one of his last acts before returning stateside was to make himself vanish from the company rolls to become a politician was an act of atonement for him , but it was also the practice of magic by other means mr o'brien quotes dostoyevsky man is bound to lie about himself the lie john wade constructed , as man and boy , was intended to avert the loss of love at the center of wade s character is a problem of vision when he was young , he practiced magic tricks in front of a mirror , perfecting illusions when his father died , wade discovered that he could escape from his rage by slipping behind a mirror in his head , making himself invisible and that was precisely what he did on that climactic day in vietnam , when he found himself lying in a muddy trench while all around him , in some tooexplicable exorcism of smallarms fire , an entire village was put to death mr o'brien has always insisted on the spectral quality of the things that happened in vietnam , not to deny their reality , but to suggest that seeing was never adequate proof you could look and look and look , staring down a trail where a platoon member had just that moment been killed by a mine , and yet seeing would register no reality , at least none that could be accounted for emotionally in that instant
for nearly 10 months , the bodies of six chinese men who drowned as they tried to swim ashore from the illfated golden venture have lain unidentified first in refrigerated vaults at the new york city medical examiner s office and now in a collective grave in new jersey but what has been a mystery to government authorities for the last 10 months has been known all along to other passengers of the golden venture , which was smuggling a cargo of illegal immigrants from china many said they had simply never been asked to identify their compatriots in a series of interviews both in and out of prison over the last week , nearly 20 passengers from the golden venture have provided tentative identifications of the six in the hope that their bodies can be returned to their families in china they recalled that one of those now believed dead was a young man who served as the ship s doctor , and another had driven a tractor back home and liked to play chess we 've all felt , how could the american government allow them to be buried like this \? said one man now being held in the lehigh county prison in allentown , pa it has been very hard for us to bear someone should take them home in all , 10 of the golden venture s passengers died four have since been identified but the medical examiner s office and the united states immigration and naturalization service said their efforts to identify the other six had been stymied by language problems and the fear relatives have of approaching authorities in addition , both agencies say finding the relatives of the dead has only been one of many priorities in the golden venture case our primary responsibility is the criminal investigation and part of that is identifying the dead , said demetrios georgakopoulos , assistant district director for investigation in the immigration and naturalization service s new york office we are pursuing a criminal investigation , and where there is overlap , we pursue that letters from relatives but passengers who survived the golden venture ordeal say that through letters from relatives and friends , along with their own informal tally of their ranks , they are reasonably certain that they have identified the six who died last june 6 when they jumped into the frigid , pounding surf off the coast of queens the golden venture , a rusting tramp steamer that ran aground on a sandbar , was carrying nearly 300 illegal chinese immigrants hoping to make their way to america they say the six dead , all from fujian province , are chen xinghan , zheng shiming and lin guoshui , all from changle chen dajie , of langqi , wang xin , of tingjiang , and huang cangping , of lianjiang of these men , we have heard nothing , said one passenger , who like all the others spoke on the condition of anonymity , some on the advice of their lawyers and others because of a fear that being identified might somehow get them in trouble they are the ones that we all believe are dead part of the problem in officially identifying the victims was the result of one of the first attempts by a family to identify a relative when two chinese immigrants went to the new york city medical examiner s office , they were detained by the immigration and naturalization service and brought into the agency s office for questioning although both were legal residents of the united states , neither was carrying their immigration documents and they were taken away in handcuffs officials of the immigration and naturalization service said their questioning of the two was routine they were in the midst of an important investigation and the two men might have had some valuable information but the news of their treatment rapidly spread through the chineseamerican community 'do n't want to be deported' some of these people are illegal immigrants , said william chiu , whose organization , the american fujian association of commerce and industry , tried to help with the identification process they do n't want to be deported back to china it was only when the american fujian association , a chinatown business organization , obtained several telephone numbers that were found written on the band of the underpants of one victim that another identification was made mr chiu said he only dialed a few of the numbers before he reached a chinese family whose cousin had left fujian province and had not been heard from in over two years the next day , he accompanied the family to the medical examiner s office , where they identified their relative , chen fenyou but after august , the investigation languished mr chiu , who has pursued the identifications on his own , said his organization had faxed information to chinese newspapers in fujian but still has heard nothing part of the problem has been that the medical examiner s office does not have the authority to release information about the victims , like photographs that could help relatives identify a victim the medical examiner s office has saved dental records , body xrays , blood and tissue samples from the bodies but none of the information is useful unless they have a name to search for medical records in china or something to compare it to , such as a blood sample from a relative primary responsibility ellen borakove , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner s office , said the office believed that primary responsibility for finding the identities of the six bodies belongs to the ins
boston , june 29 a drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colons , a study has found ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms when steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe case , doctors almost always have to remove the patient s colon the study showed that the transplant drug , cyclosporine , was effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugs , the last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease the study , led by dr simon lichtiger and conducted at mount sinai school of medicine in new york and the university of chicago , is being published on thursday in the new england journal of medicine the researchers tested 20 patients eleven were randomly assigned to get cyclosporine injections the rest received placebo shots nine of the 11 reported substantial relief of their symptoms within a week , while none in the comparison group got better the researchers had planned to enroll 42 patients but cut the study short because they felt that , given their findings , it would be unethical to continue with the placebos five who were originally in the comparison group were later given cyclosporine , and all responded to the treatment cyclosporine is widely used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs it works by suppressing white blood cells that are part of the body s defenses against disease the drug does have side effects , however , among them possible damage to the kidneys

landover , md , jan 12 john thompson , the noted georgetown coach seldom at a loss for words on any subject , remained silent tonight regarding a threatened basketball boycott by the black coaches association since the possibility of a protest action by black coaches and players arose this week , thompson has said he would have no comment , and he stuck to that tonight do n't ask , he said but his team left a little message the hoyas trounced st john s , 6049 , to even their big east record at 22 and build their overall mark to 83 georgetown was the team chosen to be the best in the big east in preseason forecasts , but had lost its previous conference game to connecticut by 12 points st john s helped make victory come easily the redmen started poorly against the pressing and trapping hoyas and improvement was minimal wild passes , other turnovers and abysmal shooting cost them dearly as their record sank to 13 in the big east and 75 over all we have to try to break the slide and there are no easy games left , coach brian mahoney said the next opponent is connecticut , the conference leader at 40 , in madison square garden on saturday night st john s point total of 49 was its lowest of the season by far , its next lowest coming in an ominous opening loss to towson state , 6665 , at alumni hall on nov 18 there were any number of other negatives the redmen shot only 39 percent from the floor and missed 11 of 24 free throws charles minlend , the redmen s leading scorer in the previous two games , was 0 for 5 in fieldgoal attempts and had only 4 points forward james scott led the st john s scorers with 16 and shawnelle scott had 12 while missing 6 of 8 free throws mahoney credited georgetown their pressing and trapping made us rush the tempo , he said and that caused turnovers st john s had 17 , georgetown 15 in a sloppy game last year we could handle the pressure better , shawnelle scott said it s tougher this year mahoney made a lineup switch , replacing fred lyson with carl beckett at guard among the starting five , to no apparent gain beckett scored only 2 points , and lyson , who had none , sat for all but the last two and onehalf minutes his missed 3point shot near the end was his only scoring attempt st john s , always trailing , fell behind early , but came back to cut the deficit to 1513 , the closest the redmen were to be to the hoyas following a 134 run , georgetown led by 3421 at the intermission and soon after went ahead by 16 st john s cut that lead back to 6 points , 4640 , with 10 minutes left but had no further challenge georgetown did not shoot much better than st john s , hitting only 40 percent , but the hoyas sank more foul shots , 17 of 25 , and never were in a panic this is a young team , with joey brown the only senior starting guard george butler was the leading scorer with 16 points brown , who must be the hardestworking point guard in the big east , had 10 assists , and the big man , othella harrington , had 13 points rebounds the attendance at the usair arena , formerly the capital center , was 7 , 823 on a rainy evening , meaning about 12 , 000 empty seats when st john s and georgetown , then the defending national champion , met here nine years ago , the place was packed by a crowd of 19 , 035 the hoyas' audience has diminished year by year and the largest crowd this season numbered 11 , 888 coach brian mahoney of st john s said he had no point of view about the threatened boycott and had not disucussed the matter with his players he said , like all coaches i'm disappointed in not having the scholarships back his reference was the failure of the recent ncaa convention to vote restoration of one scholarship per team , an action that would have raised the number to 14
the staten island secession movement a fiveyear quest that began as a quixotic dream but somehow survived referendums , court tests , political deals and the scorn of doomsayers moved toward a climax in the state legislature yesterday with the unveiling of a bill to make the borough an independent city the bill s prospects were not highly rated , even by its chief sponsor , state senator john j marchi , the father of the movement and chairman of a commission that has laid plans for a city of staten island , complete with mayor , council , comptroller , courts , schools and other trappings of a modern municipality the republicancontrolled senate is expected to support the bill , but not the democraticdominated assembly , mainly because half its members come from the city and are loath to see it divided gov mario m cuomo has maintained a studied neutrality , and senator marchi conceded yesterday that a vote on the measure was at least a year off 'this is very serious' but the senator and other secessionists , buoyed by overwhelming support among staten islanders in a crucial charter referendum last november and the survival of a movement many political observers regarded as a joke when it began , predicted intense negotiations in the legislature it s not part of a game , senator marchi declared at a news conference in the state capitol in albany after introducing his measure in the senate this is very serious this is the business of democracy the bill , which would transform the city s smallest borough , with 375 , 000 people , into the state s secondlargest city and about the 40th in the nation , presents legislators and the governor with choices none relish to dismember a city consolidated in 1898 , or to rescind the right of selfdetermination they granted in 1989 by approving legislation that let the secession process begin the charter provisions incorporated into the bill introduced yesterday call for a city led by an elected mayor , a 15member city council and a comptroller as chief financial officer the officials would be elected in november 1995 and take office on jan 1 , 1996 it also calls for a ninemember board of education elected by cumulative voting , in which each voter would have nine ballots and could cast them for any number of candidates or all for one candidate the system , which strengthens minority candidates , was championed by lani guinier , whose nomination to head the justice department s civilrights division was withdrawn by president clinton last year amid criticism of her writings the bill also would set up courts , but retain sitting judges in criminal and civil courts , superior courts and family and surrogate courts it would shift the college of staten island from the city university to the state university of new york and would retain the rights of all civilservice employees victories in the courts when the idea of allowing staten island residents to vote on secession was raised at that time , legislative leaders expected the plan to die quietly but largely for political reasons , the senate , the assembly and the governor failed to kill it , and in a 1990 vote the residents opted to secede new york city challenged the process in court , saying the secession vote , without the city s consent , violated the home rule provision of the state constitution the state s highest court rejected the city s claim , ruling that the referendum creating a staten island charter commission was merely advisory but it left open whether secession by staten island was constitutional in the next three years , the 13member charter commission named by the governor mapped a plan for a new city last nov 2 , in a second referendum , staten island residents voted 2 to 1 to approve the charter secession raises many political and economic issues staten island voters gave mayor rudolph w giuliani his narrow electionvictory margin last fall and he would not like to lose the borough staten island gets nearly 200 million more in services from the city than it gives the city in revenues , according to a city study , and secession opponents say that independence would mean huge tax increases and service reductions staten island could charge the city to use the landfill at fresh kills , but might have to pay to use the city s water supply beyond such questions , the borough remains linked to the city in intricate ways , from bus and ferry lines to bridges and less tangible ties , including senses of identity and historical continuity
the troublesome offspring of cardinal guzman by louis de bernieres 363 pp new york william morrow company 25 in this third novel by the british writer louis de bernieres , set , like the previous two , in and around a spectacular latin american town called cocha debajo de los gatos , we are never certain what s about to happen , nor are we too sure about what s just gone on as in its predecessors \( the war of don emmanuel s nether parts and senor vivo and the coca lord \) , the improbable characters populating the troublesome offspring of cardinal guzman interact in ways that are never predictable and are often truly weird for those visiting for the first time , this imaginary city , which does not even appear upon the maps of an equally imaginary south american country , takes getting used to at any moment a defrocked priest , father garcia , might casually levitate to preach his unique version of the holy word \( the truth is that almost none of the bible is true \) , the false priest don salvador might pass off a particularly lascivious passage from the roman poet catullus as a pious latin benediction , or a spanish count , thawed out by a dash of indian magic after being frozen while on an expedition of conquest in 1533 , may wander by in a bemused stupor whatever is going on from one moment to the next , it s sure to keep us off stride all this takes place in a nation ruled by a cadre of serious oddballs , with a president whose major interest is a personal crusade for occult knowledge and pushbutton virility such pursuits take him and his wife to exotic places like los angeles , where they perform kinky sex and do lots of shopping the country is left to fend for itself in real life such power vacuums are often filled by the military , but here the military is led by a committed democrat who refuses to unleash it unless proper orders come down the chain of command an admirable stance , were there only a chain of command unfortunately , there is cardinal guzman deeply offended by the idea that the church has any special mission to the poor , he feels the destitute should shut up and await their reward in heaven anything else smacks of heresy , and the cardinal is driven by inner demons his troublesome children to stamp that out so a crusade is launched under the leadership of monsignor rechin anguilar , whose faith calls on him to save many a soul by extracting from it a confession of orthodoxy and killing it before it had time to change its mind , an avenging army starts dispatching citizens to a better life , whether they want one or not over time cardinal guzman mellows , becoming more interested in the laws of nature as god made them than in church doctrine , and takes off with his mistress but sadly , in his newfound humanism which comes about when his demons are surgically removed he is unaware of the poisons he has loosed even the shade of st thomas aquinas , shocked to earth by the perversion of his teaching , cannot check an guilar and his hordes this bodes ill for cochadebajo de los gatos , whose citizens believe most of all in salvation through good times and fornication what we have here is the ageold fight between good and evil which is which \? taking more than a page from gabriel garcia marquez \( who has obviously taught him a great deal \) , mr de bernieres , who has lived and worked in colombia , comes down hard on the side of good times and fornication along with the buffoonery and the wildly comic inventions , he tells us that there is simply no institution we can trust the message of this wondrous novel is leave us alone and we 'll manage not only that , we 'll probably have a lot of fun along the way
to the editor some of the facts in your may 23 article on new york city s legal aid for the poor , the assigned counsel plan , are accurate however , your overall slant is misleading although you devote much space to a lawyer who slept during a trial , you devote none to the very many lawyers who ably represent their clients , securing acquittals , dismissals and other positive results while you focus on two lawyers who last year billed the plan for more than 100 , 000 , you barely mention the substantial majority of lawyers who , at 25 an hour for outofcourt time , and 40 an hour for incourt time , received less than 10 , 000 for the year from the plan you devote a box to a lawyer who was convicted and disbarred for defrauding the plan , but no space to lawyers who are motivated by a desire to assist the indigent or to fulfill the bar s obligation to provide competent representation to the poor you mention the city s efforts to improve monitoring through computer scanning , that a lawyer s background is investigated before the lawyer is permitted to participate in the program and that administrators have begun a recertification process , yet that information is buried at the end of your article finally , even the headline description of a program with no monitor is misleading no plea is taken , dismissal secured , trial had or payment made without the full participation of a judge the lawyers who participate in the plan must be honest and able if a lawyer defrauds the plan by overbilling , the lawyer should be prosecuted and punished incompetent lawyers should be barred from continued participation in the plan computer scanning and recertification are designed to accomplish these goals similarly , standards for providing free counsel should be reassessed and enforced so that only those who are truly indigent get lawyers at public expense and , of course , the abysmally low fees should be increased an article reporting that courts , administrators and lawyers are striving to improve a plan that , despite its flaws , almost invariably provides capable representation to indigent defendants might have found fewer readers than the article you published , but would have reflected reality better austin v campriello president , new york criminal bar association new york , may 25 , 1994
the writer primo levi wondered whether , should he survive auschwitz , he would know how to describe what had happened , because daily language is for the description of daily experience , but here it is another world , here one would need a language 'of this other world' and what is that language for the visual artist \? there have been realist sculptures and abstract ones memorializing the holocaust realist sculptures of the dead and dying have often seemed woefully inadequate , yet survivors point out that they and their families were n't tortured and murdered in the abstract nathan rapoport , the sculptor of the warsaw ghetto monument , once asked , could i have made a rock with a hole in it and said 'voila ! the heroism of the jewish people' \? obviously not , he reasoned where is the line between recollection and exploitation \? \( behind some of the enormous interest in the new holocaust memorial museum in washington and schindler s list is surely sensationalism \) does preserving piles of hair or eyeglasses , for example , help people remember the jews as those jews would want to be remembered or as the nazis would remember them \? the very idea of a monument to the victims of the nazis can seem odd , considering the nazis' identification with monuments and monumentality maybe henry moore was right when he lamented , after none of the entries was chosen in a 1958 competition for a memorial at auschwitzbirkenau , that only a new michelangelo or a new rodin could conceive a memorial able to overcome all the philosophical obstacles in its way alas , there is no new michelangelo but literally thousands of holocaust memorials have been created , anyway , and many more , from berlin to boston , are planned some are as ambitious as yad vashem in israel or the anne frank house in amsterdam , many as simple and homespun as the gravestones in lithuania that managed to survive decades of soviet efforts to eradicate all but official monuments to the communist heroes of what stalin called the great patriotic war an exhibition opening on sunday at the jewish museum in manhattan , the art of memory holocaust memorials in history , is the first to survey this vast and complicated field though not all that big in size , and even though it must make do , to a considerable degree , with documentary photographs and architectural models in place of real memorials , the show is a big event that should n't be missed this is not , as you might expect , because it recapitulates the facts of the holocaust the show is n't so much about the holocaust as it is about the problems of representing the holocaust visually it deals more with how to remember than what to remember and its message is ultimately a general one about the interconnectedness of politics , memory and art the show s point is that memory is never shaped in a vacuum depending on where these memorials are constructed and by whom , these sites recall the past according to a variety of national myths , ideals and political needs , writes the exhibition s organizer , james e young , a professor at the university of massachusetts at amherst , and the author of the texture of memory holocaust memorials and meaning professor young has brought together a wide range of examples to support the thesis there are photographs of the sculptor wiktor tolkin s huge and forbidding monument looming over the maidanek death camp in poland , and of the vast field of granite shards recalling the 850 , 000 jews killed at treblinka there are plaster casts of the warsaw ghetto monument a videotape showing jerusalem on the annual holocaust remembrance day , when , for two extraordinary minutes , all of israel comes to a halt there are postcards from a holocaust memorial in miami depicting a giant green hand rising from the ground , tourist brochures from the camp at dachau \( no visitor should miss the view from the dachau palace toward the distant foothills of the alps \) , and even a commemorative ashtray from israel one section deals with several of the most compelling projects , by contemporary artists and architects in 1988 , the artist hans haacke draped an old town monument in graz , the capital of the austrian province of styria , with fabric emblazoned with the nazi insignia and the inscription , and you were victorious after all , just as the nazis had done to the same monument 50 years earlier when celebrating the anschluss , with the difference that mr haacke added lists of those killed in styria by the nazis beneath the inscription his work had an even more incendiary effect than he intended a neonazi tried to burn it down another project , by the artists jochen and esther gerz , consisted of a 40foot leadcoated column , erected in 1986 in harburg , germany passersby were invited to inscribe their names , or whatever they wished , on it some drew swastikas the column was gradually lowered into the ground as it was covered with graffiti , and was finally buried in 1993 a kind of antimonument , the monument against fascism , as the gerzes called it , became a fingerprint of german thinking about the holocaust , memorializing the thoughts of harburg s citizens both the gerzes and mr haacke , in their different ways , grappled with the particular challenge of erecting a holocaust memorial in germany or austria , where the nazis' goal had been to eradicate not only jews but even the memory of jews memorials there must cope with guilt and selfdenial in israel , on the other hand , memorials exalt heroism and selfaffirmation the memory of the holocaust has been shaped by the ideals of the state nationhood and the holocaust are linked thus , a statue of mordechai anielewicz , the leader of the warsaw ghetto uprising , depicted as if he were david , has become as much a symbol of the fight for israeli independence as it is a holocaust memorial the planting of trees in the martyrs' forest near jerusalem recalls the dead and also celebrates the cultivation of a new state yad vashem commemorates the end of life and the end of life in exile in the united states , there is yet another kind of holocaust memory , no less connected to this country s identity it involves america as mythic liberator , as safe haven from oppression , a message conveyed by the proximity of the holocaust memorial museum to the washington monument and jefferson memorial the holocaust memorial museum is about jews but it is also about america nathan rapoport s warsaw ghetto monument may be the best example of how memory is shaped by historical circumstance polish communists at first embraced the monument as a tribute to the soviet union s triumph over nazism , diminishing the role of jews eventually the anticommunist labor movement , solidarity , adopted it as a symbol delegates from the palestine liberation organization even laid a wreath at it in 1988 dedicated to those who perished in the ghetto uprising from those who perished in the palestinian uprising forgetting the extermination is part of the extermination itself , wrote the french philosopher jean baudrillard in the end , a holocaust memorial has less to do with an issue like abstraction versus realism than with the question , is it a sufficient bulwark against forgetting \? as the number of survivors dwindles , the need to recall only seems to grow the debate over the meanings of the works represented in this important exhibition is the truest holocaust memorial the art of memory holocaust memorials in history opens on sunday at the jewish museum , 1109 fifth avenue , at 92d street , and remains on view through july 31 it then travels to berlin and munich photos a photograph at the jewish museum of wiktor tolkin s monument at the

kibumba , zaire , july 27 there is no day in the life of a refugee camp story there is only another day of death elevenyearold uwizeyimana sat on a bit of high ground she held an umbrella in her right hand , tilted to provide shade for the little girl she held in her arms the child appeared to be sleeping this child is just now dead , uwizeyimana said as a tear streaked the dirt on her cheek uwizeyimana s brother , innocent munyarugamba , came up i have just taken my wife to the hospital , he said , referring to the tents where medical workers were treating patients with cholera and dysentery it was then that he found his daughter twizerimana dead in uwizeyimana s arms she was going to be baptized next month , he said as he wrapped her in a blue blanket and prepared to take her to the side of the road , where several hundred corpses were piled , waiting to be picked up on the 30mile stretch of road between goma and katale kibumba is about half way there were more than 2 , 000 bodies today , many of them on the asphalt itself i had only two children , mr munyarugamba said his other daughter , 5 years old , disappeared two weeks ago when the family , which had been on the run for a month , passed into zaire mr munyarugamba sat on the ground with all his possessions one shallow green plastic bucket , the kind used for washing clothes by hand , one green plastic pail , badly cracked , and one straw mat not long ago , 32yearold mr munyarugamba was rich by rwandan standards i had coffee , he said i had potatoes i had cows , so i could get milk for my children so i can say that i was rich his average coffee yield was about 400 kilos \( about 880 pounds \) a season , he said because of the fighting , in midjune mr munyarugamba and his family fled the hills where he had his farm , near gitarama in eastern rwanda while on the run he sold his only remaining cow to get money for food he reached the zairian border with one calf , but then it was stolen no money , no food now he has no money , no means to buy what little food there is in the local markets i have not eaten for three days , he said i have been drinking only boiled water for the past 10 days relief agencies have been distributing water to the refugees but the distribution point is half a mile away i am too weak i cannot walk there , said mr munyarugamba , a small , frail man who seemed not to have the strength to carry even an empty plastic jerrycan as he went to the medical tents in hopes of getting water with an estimated population of more than 400 , 000 , this is the largest refugee camp in the world , in a place so harsh that the relief agencies want the refugees to move forests are being denuded , and the smoke from 100 , 000 camp fires turns dusk to night quickly this is my house i built it myself , said 51yearold alexis sinabajije , standing in front of a thatched leanto squeezed into a shallow depression with countless other similar shelters in his village in southwestern rwanda , mr sinabajije s family lived in a mudwall house , 21 feet by 24 feet , with a corrugated roof a good life in rwanda like most of the refugees , indeed like most rwandans , mr sinabajije was a farmer he had about five acres of land he grew sorghum , beans , cassava and sweet potatoes and he also had coffee trees he would get about 400 kilos of coffee each season he made enough money to buy things he could not grow clothes , soap , salt , hoes he also bought a radio and two bicycles , which he managed to bring with him this was quite enough for me , he said now , the food he brought with him is gone so is most of his money the refugees who did bring rwandan money can get zairian money from the money changers on the road at an exchange rate that leaves the refugees with even less then they can buy a few potatoes or even meat at the markets that have sprung up on the road , right next to the bodies twice since arriving here a week ago mr sinabajije and his family have received food from the international relief agencies two pounds of rice per person each time and two pounds of beans for every four people water is their greatest need and it is far away i sent one of my sons to get water , mr sinabajije said he went on one of the bicycles he left at 7 o'clock last night after we ate he has not come back yet it was noon all day long , there is a steady column along both sides of the road , people going to and coming from the water source with sixgallon yellow jerrycans and all assortment of other containers balanced on their heads long walk for water not everyone can make the trek to this source of clean water , which the refugees say is 32 kilometers \( about 20 miles \) away , near a volcano this is the kind of water we are drinking , said a woman who was nursing a child as she displayed a pail full of brackish water when you are not strong enough , this is what you get i cannot walk 32 kilometers mr sinabajije said the water his son was getting would have to be used very carefully we cannot use it to wash our clothes or to wash our bodies it would be used for drinking and cooking , he said i will cook today , said mr sinabajije s daughter clementine , a 10yearold with bright eyes and a shy smile clementine said she had been in the first year of primary school in her village she said none of her school friends were here but she

east rutherford , nj , nov 6 it has been a long time since the buffalo bills have found themselves in this position so long , in fact , that none of them can tell you precisely when the last time was i ca n't remember , it s been so long , said jim kelly i ca n't remember right now , echoed bruce smith it s not that our backs are against the wall , thurman thomas said they 're behind the wall right now the fourtime defending american football conference champions are at 54 , their worst record at this point in the season since 1987 , when they were 45 the bills are two games behind miami in the american football conference east the bills were swept today by a divisional opponent for the first time since 1987 they have the same record as the jets , who were the sweepers and who would therefore win out in any playoff tie breakers between the two the bills are in trouble deep trouble but their quarterback is hardly ready to concede anything yeah , we lost , kelly said after the jets had swept their first season series from their upstate tormentors in eight seasons i'm sure threequarters of the united states likes to hear that but i tell you what , no 12 is not going to give up i guarantee that but just one week after everybody was saying the bills are back after a 4410 drubbing of joe montana and the kansas city chiefs , buffalo s fouryear stranglehold on the afc is shaky at best these next four games will determine whether we will be at home for christmas or in the playoffs , thomas said , putting it bluntly come up and ask me how we are in four weeks but the bills did not play all that badly here today it was n't an emotional letdown from last week , thomas said we always play these guys hard if the score had been 220 , maybe you could say that but it was n't said bills coach marv levy we were as high this week as we were last week against kansas city we just have to go back to work and not let it discourage us to the point where we do n't show up for work in future games but the bills sound tired it starts to wear you out , thomas said about being the kings of the hill for so long every game we play is the other team s super bowl they know if they beat the buffalo bills , they have a very good chance of going to the playoffs or of knocking the bills out of the playoffs that has n't happened since 1987 smith s third season and kelly s second with the bills thomas can be forgiven if he does not remember how it feels he was still attending oklahoma state at the time if i 've ever seen a sense of urgency , it s right now , kelly said it s frustrating i 've always been on winning teams i hate to lose we have to find a way smith said it gets harder each and every year everybody s in the hunt for us we 're like a fox and a bunch of dogs and people on horseback are chasing us it s the same year after year after year with one notable difference , however yeah , our backs are against the wall , said smith but kelly wanted to have the last word i'm not packing my bags yet , he said gardner accused of assault amherst , ny , nov 6 \( ap \) buffalo bills running back carwell gardner has been charged with assault after hitting his fiancee during a fight in his car , the police said gardner , 27 , was arrested early saturday morning and charged with thirddegree assault he appeared in amherst town court and was released without bail pending another appearance later this month the police said gardner and judy lowry were driving through amherst at about 11 30 pm on friday when they got into an argument and he hit her lowry , 33 , received eight stitches for a cut over her left eye , which the police said was probably caused by gardner s ring
detroit , nov 4 despite the recession in japan , auto parts manufacturers there are improving their already superior quality and productivity faster than their competitors in north america , according to a study of 71 component plants in nine countries auto sales are booming in the united states , automatically conferring productivity gains on manufacturers here as they use more of their plant capacity as a result , the survey s results imply that domestic manufacturers may not be competitive when the market turns down the components delivered to assembly plants contribute the most to a car s cost 75 percent , according to this survey which is why auto makers worldwide have been urging their suppliers to become more efficient the data suggest that the gap is widening between the us and japan and other countries in productivity and quality and that complacency is a real risk for the us , said carleton f kilmer , managing partner for the worldwide industrial products practice of andersen consulting andersen conducted the survey , which was released thursday , with cambridge university and the cardiff business school of the university of wales while the japanese parts makers surveyed increased their productivity by almost 38 percent from 1992 to 1994 , the american companies made gains only in the mid20 s , said donald p wingard , managing partner for andersen s americas automotive practice on average , the plants in japan were 18 percent more productive than ones in the united states , and 35 percent more productive than ones in europe the surveyed plants , which manufactured brakes , seats and exhaust systems , were not identified all belonged to socalled firsttier suppliers , that is , suppliers that send their parts directly to assembly plants , rather than to other suppliers in the survey , the 13 best plants had a 2to1 edge over their competitors in productivity and inventory control , and up to a 170to1 advantage in quality of these 13 best plants , five were in japan , three in france and three in the united states , one of which was owned by a japanese company two were in spain the other countries surveyed britain , germany and italy had none japaneseowned plants outside japan did not generally rate as well in the survey the japanese suppliers did not do as well when they were outside their own corporate culture and span of control , mr wingard said indeed , the survey found that much of the weakness of the parts suppliers in the united states actually lay with their own suppliers , the socalled second tier those secondtier suppliers sent defective parts to firsttier plants at almost seven times the rate in japan as a result , the firsttier suppliers must either fix the parts , wasting time , or reject them , wasting material if each poorly performing plant could reduce the material coming in by 10 percent , it could save more than 5 million , the survey said the results suggest that in japan , japanese auto makers and firsttier suppliers work more closely with the second and even thirdtier suppliers to insure lower costs and higher quality
the habit of rivers reflections on trout streams and fly fishing by ted leeson 178 pages lyons burford 2295 at a time when the earth s fish population is growing dangerously depleted , you begin to wonder about hooking trout on feathered lures even in centerfold photos of trophy catches about to be unsnared from barbless hooks and returned to their nokill habitats , the fish have begun to assume a beleaguered look you toy with the thought of not buying a license this year but in his restorative collection of essays , the habit of rivers reflections on trout streams and fly fishing , ted leeson reminds you how much more there is to fly fishing than the mere taking of fish the craft of angling is the catching of fish , he admits in his introduction but the art of angling is a receptiveness to connections , the art of letting one thing lead to another until , if only locally and momentarily , you realize some small completeness he concludes , by no coincidence , this is the art of writing essays , as it is , i think , the art of living , for among these three occupations there seems to me no essential difference in degree or kind the wonder of these dozen pieces is that they offer a lesson in the art of living or , more exactly , in the art of getting outside of yourself , which is essential to sane living what prompted mr leeson to write them was his move over a decade ago from virginia to oregon , to teach english at oregon state university there he discovered that unlike back east or in the midwest , where he grew up , the fishing never ended month after month , i 'd learn of another river , another run of fish , another season just reaching its peak he also discovered that in oregon the whole geography of fishing is different you do n't go north in the hot weather , you head for the mountains and beyond so in his writing you get a sense of extraordinary place in the geographical abridgements we so often trade in , oregon is condensed to a lush , misty tract of douglas fir and cedar , shrouding the pacific coast but in the original unexpurgated edition , there is a portion of the state \( a very large portion \) that lies to the east of the cascade mountains most of it is arid territory , and much of that is desert not the sandandsaguaro of sonora , but harsh and brittle expanses of sage , rabbitbrush , cheatgrass and juniper tenuously anchored in 20 million acres of windblown volcanic dust that settles in a gritty film on your teeth astonishingly enough , he finds his favorite trout water here , the deschutes river , a desert trout stream , the ultimate oxymoron yet the habit of rivers is much more than geography it invites the reader to see beyond the mantle of nature the occupation of discovering a river begins with preoccupation , some focal point that deflects awareness away from the subject and so sensitizes the periphery for me , fly fishing offers just this type of lens anything will do as long as it suspends the mind s propensity to replicate itself in whatever it dwells on , and leaves clear the edges of acumen to be impinged upon , sidelong and incidentally , by what is really there mr leeson even imagines the river from a fish s point of view what we see as only water , the trout must see as a vibrantly textured world current and obstruction sculpt the river into strata of force , fantastic canyons and rugged crags , deep washes and cliffs of turbulence , and the trout shapes its existence around them as closely as an anasazi none of which is to say that this is n't finally a book about catching fish in it , nature is never far from fishing as he writes , a fly rod curves with the trajectory of a june twilight hope is not only the thing with feathers , as emily dickinson wrote it is the feathered hook on the end of the line in the whole lumbering , clanking warehouse of an onstream angler , the fly is the starting point , the single piece of gear we carry from which the entire sport can be reconstructed mr leeson also writes some slightly encouraging words about the condition of fish shortlived , quickly maturing species , like most fish , aquatic insects and vegetation , have short reproductive cycles and tend to be prolific propagators when some external threat overfishing , erosion , drawdown or pollution is eliminated , life rushes back to refill the river this is not intended as a justification for more fishing mr leeson has better reasons in his essay on learning to look tangentially at a river , he goes on to attack the habit of anthropomorphizing nature , or calling the catching of a fish a 'contest , ' a 'battle , ' 'a matching of wits , ' 'a competition , ' some 'game' we play with the trout he adds , fish , i think we can reasonably assume , do not enjoy being caught nevertheless , mr leeson fishes on a purely biological level , we must kill to survive , he writes on a psychic one , we kill to survive as well he concludes i fish as often as i can , invariably with great pleasure , and frankly i do n't often give these things much thought but when i do , they are the reason fishing makes sense , what makes fishing a serious business fishing is not apart from life , nor like life , and is no more a 'metaphor' for life than a pregnant woman is it is the thing itself and with the habit of rivers he opens his readers' eyes to the thing itself photo ted leeson \( jim schollmeyer lyons burford \)
jerusalem , sept 5 the killing of an israeli soldier in the gaza strip overnight reinforced for israelis today that neither their government nor the new palestinian authority has been able to stop recurring attacks by armed palestinians opposed to peace talks after the latest incident , a driveby shooting that left one soldier dead and two others wounded , prime minister yitzhak rabin cautioned that violence and the failure of palestinian leaders to stop it could endanger future negotiations on extending palestinian selfrule in the occupied territories the group called islamic holy war took responsibility for the shooting in gaza , senior palestinian officials deplored the shooting and promised to chase the culprits and punish them the police in gaza said they had arrested a man who had been wounded in an exchange of gunfire during the ambush , but they did not say if charges would be brought against him previous warnings in the four months of palestinian selfrule in gaza and the west bank town of jericho , mr rabin has issued similar warnings about the peril to peace talks by the same token , yasir arafat and other leaders of the palestinian authority have affirmed more than once their commitment to rein in islamic militants yet for all the tough talk , there has been no end to shootings and knifings inside israel and in the territories , including gaza , where israeli soldiers remain at the borders and around jewish settlements despite their withdrawal from arab towns and refugee camps hours before the gaza shooting on sunday , two jews on their way to the western wall were stabbed in the back and moderately wounded as they entered the walled old city of jerusalem three nights earlier , two men said to belong to the militant group hamas were blown up in the west bank , apparently as they were trying to plant a car bomb a few days before that , hamas claimed responsibility for the fatal slashing of two israeli workers at a construction site in ramle , near tel aviv echoes of other violent acts reverberated in jerusalem today when israel announced that its security forces had arrested eight hamas members suspected in connection with attacks that killed three israeli civilians in the west bank in may and july among those picked up was a brother of jibril rajub , the palestinian authority s security chief in jericho frustration over violence from the start , israeli leaders have warned that selfrule agreements reached with mr arafat s palestine liberation organization did not mean that true peace had arrived nonetheless , their frustration over recurring violence has poked through the surface more insistently of late , propelled in part by opposition accusations that the rabin government has put israeli lives in danger with its plo deal perhaps not surprisingly , some israeli officials lay the blame squarely at mr arafat s feet they say they know who carried out the ramle killings but have gotten nowhere in their demands that the palestinian police in gaza hand over the suspects in midaugust , amid some fanfare , palestinian security forces arrested 20 islamic radicals after two roadside ambushes that killed one israeli and wounded six others more quietly , the militants were quickly released none were believed to have actually pulled the trigger , leading to charges from some israelis that it was all a publicrelations move and complaints from hamas leaders that they had been made scapegoats in an arafat attempt to appease israel maj gen uri saguy , the israeli army s intelligence chief , said in an interview published today in the newspaper haaretz there are things that arafat has done , and there are many things that he has done for appearances , but everything he has done is not sufficient only when he feels a political sword on his neck , or when an israeli demands that he acts , does he take any measures mr arafat s defenders say he must walk a political tightrope between asserting his authority and not coming down too hard on hamas , a potent and popular force in gaza if so , israel s leaders have their own balancing act , between demands for a gettough policy and a perceived need , whatever the risks , to maintain a flow of arab workers into israel so that the gazan economy does not implode conspicuously , israel has not sealed off the territories after the latest killings , an action routinely taken in the past its police have rounded up hundreds of palestinian laborers who entered israel illegally , but the borders are open for the roughly 30 , 000 gazans with legitimate work permits nor are palestinian radicals israel s only worry a young army officer and at least three other israelis were reported today to have been arrested on suspicion of organizing an armed group to attack palestinians information was scarce because a judge prohibited the publication of details but the officer , a resident of the west bank settlement of qiryat arba , was reportedly suspected of selling army weapons to antiarab extremists with roots in the banned kach and kahane chai movements
marla rivera s right hand guides the big , tilted wheel her left clutches a wad of transfers outside the city bus moving five miles an hour , the cabs she detests slice around her like ravenous piranhas horns squawk on the toocrowded street and she 'll be very lucky if this day does n't include someone berating her because she tells them they 're a coin or two short of the 125 fare but marla rivera is smiling sweetly i'm happy to have a good job , she says and hard work never killed anyone , i do n't think and so it goes for the drivers of the city s 3 , 000 buses together they carry 490 million people annually over 104 million miles each driver makes between two and five trips a day , depending on length and traffic indeed , the premise of the current hit movie , speed that a city bus must go 50 miles an hour or blow up is preposterous to these grizzled veterans of speedlessness not in new york , miss rivera said with a belly laugh the hardest part of this job is sitting in traffic miss rivera has been shepherding 40footlong , 11ton buses through the city s treacherous streets for six years her current assignment the m31 route from 92d street and york avenue to 57th street and west to 11th avenue she is one of 400 drivers who work out of the transit authority depot at 126th street and second avenue , one of 19 the agency runs women , who have been driving buses since 1973 , still number only 745 of 7 , 912 miss rivera , 30 years old , approaches her chosen work with an equanimity that jackie gleason s legendary busdriving character ralph \( to the moon , alice ! \) kramden never did part of the reason may be that bus driving is far from the hardest thing in her life separated from her husband , she spends much of her time away from work caring for her only child , 8yearold raymond , who has cerebral palsy he is an intelligent boy , she says proudly , who can get around in a walker when miss rivera was asked to join the transit authority in 1988 \( based on a test she had taken several years earlier \) , she remembered her father s words your driver s license will be the most important paper you ever have and snapped up the offer she makes 40 , 000 a year for about 42 hours work a week , plus benefits that include a pension the noise and hassle of her route are a postscript to the wellorganized early part of her days last thursday , for instance , she rose at her usual time of 3 30 am raymond was still asleep when she kissed him goodbye she waited for the baby sitter to come to their onebedroom apartment in the parkchester section of the bronx the baby sitter would take raymond to his school at blythedale children s hospital miss rivera then drove her 1985 plymouth to the 126th street depot , as usual arriving a halfhour early for her 5 26 am start the earlybird routine gives her a chance to converse and joke with some of the other 400 drivers , of whom 50 are women this is important , because the waves of people who will surround her later in the day will say little , unless they have reason to complain bus driving is oddly lonely , miss rivera has found it is something she has learned to like because it gives her time to think miss rivera then drives the empty bus down to york avenue and 92d street , where the m31 and several other routes originate the authority has a makeshift lounge in the corner building for bus drivers coffee is available , but miss rivera declines indeed , she eats no breakfast or lunch , waiting until after her eighthour shift to have a sandwich or salad this day , a few passengers get on at the route s first stop the numbers who board snowball with each stop south on york avenue these are serious people going to work they are selfcontained , wrapped in newspapers and daydreams many will get off on the m31 s crosstown jag at 57th street at 11th avenue , the bus turns south and checks in with a dispatcher at 54th street it then crosses town on 57th street , turning north on york avenue the entire round trip back to 92d street takes about 50 minutes going north , there tend to be fewer office workers and more people going to upper east side hospitals , as well as nannies with children every day s a new and exciting experience , chirped a regular passenger he was referring to the construction on york avenue , which miss rivera traverses like a slalom skier , even as she complains yeah , it s an obstacle course , she said in her first year as a driver , miss rivera had a couple of minor accidents but there have been none in more than four years she has had one memorable crisis , though two years ago , a man collapsed as he stepped onto the bus , suffering a heart attack two doctors on board and a policeman summoned from the street ordered miss rivera to drive to bellevue hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance with police cars in front and behind , each with a blaring siren , she proceeded to the hospital despite their efforts , though , the passenger died her biggest problem is cab drivers who she says would ram one another , not to mention a bus , for a fare a minor irritation is people asking which way the bus is going on a clearly marked oneway street a pet peeve is the lack of recognition bus drivers received for driving through last winter s snows how do people think the sanitation workers got to their plows \? she asked other occupational hazards are gridlock resulting from a presidential visit , foreigners who demand directions they ca n't understand and passengers who hold the back door open , making the bus temporarily immobile female drivers , she believes , get more abuse than men from passengers but there are warm moments miss rivera says that if she coughs , passengers race to offer her a cough drop most days by 1 30 pm , she will have finished five runs and be back at the 126th street depot she drives her own car home from the depot , an activity she does not enjoy shortly afterward , she usually takes time for a brief nap , or maybe a brisk workout at her health club , before picking up raymond sometimes she goes grocery shopping first , something that is much harder to do with the wheelchair we do the best we can , but people do n't seem to appreciate us , said marla rivera they do n't realize what it takes to get that bus there photo i'm happy to have a good job , says marla rivera , a bus driver and hard work never killed anyone , i do n't think \( jose r lopez the new york times \) map of central park showing the m31 bus route chart close up of marla rivera how one woman took the big wheel occupation bus driver route m31 york avenue from 92d street to 57th street age 30 family son , raymond , age 8 how she got the job took many tests for governmentagency jobs while still in high school initially was offered a cashier s job with the transit authority but turned it down to care for her son , who has cerebral palsy in 1988 , the ta offered her a chance to become a bus driver she received eight weeks of onthejob training before being assigned a route what motivates her her love for her son i'm a proud mother he s a doll he s proud of her too raymond likes to tell everbody the mommy drives a big bus , she said he s very proud of that fact recreation she likes to work out at her health club
berlin , aug 13 you knew you were n't in new jersey anymore when , after the giants would score a touchdown , the german fans at olympic stadium would jam to frank sinatra s new york , new york at giants stadium , a song by ol' blue eyes would n't exactly have people rocking the stands here , you 'd think michael jackson was blaring through the loudspeakers welcome to american football gone global this berlin version of the american bowl featured the giants and the san diego chargers in a pretty exciting game for exhibition football as the giants won , 2820 , before 57 , 329 on a cool and breezy night in one of the most historic stadiums in the world it was the giants' first exhibition victory in three games as the chargers fell to 03 as football savvy as the germans have become , they might not have picked up some of the subplots that are going on within the team the first was the brilliant play of quarterback dave brown who , funny as it seems , might be the best player on the giants team right now the other was the defense , which is still having a difficult time grasping the new 43 alignment as linemen , linebackers and even mike nolan , the defensive coordinator , are readily admitting there are problems that need to be corrected soon overcomes shaky start brown , who won the starting job this week , looked as if he has had it for years at times he resembled the 15year veteran he replaced , calm and poised in the pocket , his teammates seemingly following every command to the letter brown played the entire first half and one series in the second , going 15 of 21 for 187 yards and 1 touchdown he overcame some poor throws early , two of which were almost intercepted he even did something phil simms could never do the last few years of his career show some good speed while running brown sprinted for a 9yard touchdown off a key block by wide receiver mike sherrard brown played as if he had something to prove and he did coach dan reeves made the choice of brown over kent graham \( who also played pretty well , going 8 of 9 for 93 yards and 1 touchdown , a 5yarder to omar douglas in the final minutes of the game \) and brown does n't want to let the coach think he made the wrong decision all day long i was probably a little nervous , said brown , who had 30 yards on 6 carries i wanted to prove that dan made the right decision his secondquarter run had tied the score at 77 , and after eric bieniemy scored for san diego on a 4yard run , brown s 2yard dart to hback aaron pierce tied it at 1414 with one second left in the first half most of the starters would later give way to the backups but all brown needed was a half to make his point i'm the guy now , and it s time to move forward and put this whole quarterback thing behind us what may be a concern offensively is the running game , or lack thereof running back rodney hampton must have a good season or there will be a tremendous amount of pressure on brown hampton had just 4 yards on 7 carries he then gave way to david meggett , who led all ballcarriers in rushing 39 yards on 9 carries that s good , but meggett is n't going to be the guy carrying the ball a lot that s hampton s job defensive problems a big part of why the running game has n't clicked yet is the fact that the team has spent most of the time on the passing game we 're ok , said hampton we 've got two more weeks no time to panic besides , the giants were playing against pro bowl linebacker junior seau , who led all tacklers with eight where there are big problems is on the defensive side of the ball the cornerstone , linebacker michael brooks , is having difficulty making the adjustment to a fourman front last season , the team used three defensive linemen and brooks was one of two inside linebackers in a fourlinebacker scheme but this problem is not brooks s alone several of the defensive linemen said they , too , were having problems adjusting to the new defense we 're still in the training camp mode , said lineman erik howard we still have to get comfortable with it the blocking schemes are different than in the 34 it s going to take some getting used to built around brooks brooks is required to have more reads almost twice as many and he is having difficulty absorbing all of the schemes this is a big concern to nolan , since just about everything is built around brooks basically brooks , who nolan said has become frustrated , feels that he ca n't be himself and has to do more readandreact type of playing from nolan s perspective , he is not asking brooks to slow down but to take on more responsibilities during an interview on friday , nolan also expressed unhappiness with some of the other linebackers , and though he would n't give names it is believed he is referring to some of the younger players and none of the starters nolan , who is one of the bright young minds in the game , thought the defense did make some progress in grasping the new system that was probably because everything was kept very basic \( the linemen did very few stunts \) san diego had 309 total yards , which is n't a whole lot , but the giants gave up some big plays , one of which was a 35yard pass from stan humphries to receiver shawn jefferson \( he made a great onehanded catch \) of the top eight giants tacklers , only two brooks \( three tackles \) and lineman chris maumalanga \( three \) were among the front seven we 'll get better , nolan said , but it better happen quick because the real season is close extra points running back keith elias , from princeton , will probably make the giants he had 9 carries for 35 yards and a touchdown against the chargers , a 6yard run in the third quarter that gave the giants the lead for good wide receiver mike sherrard had a great game , making 5 catches for 77 yards safety john booty has had an outstanding preseason and saturday was no different as he had one interception and led the team in tackles with four

the wine list has been beautifully orchestrated to go with the food , and few restaurants can match montrachet when it comes to wine service if you ask for a suggestion from the list you will receive not only good advice but also the information that the '83 is preferable to the '85 because botrytis , the noble rot that gives sauternes its complexity , was almost absent in 1985 this is offered matter of factly , without an ounce of pretension and while the list is filled with great wines , when you ask the sommelier , daniel johnnes , for advice , he instantly reels off a list of delicious and inexpensive bottles , discussing them as lovingly as if they were grand crus let me just bring you a taste , he is likely to say , materializing at your table with an open bottle and a glass few people are eager to end such a soothing experience , and leaving montrachet is never easy when dessert is offered , it almost always seems like a good idea the fact that the sweets are so simple makes them even more appealing tiny bunches of champagne grapes \( which are not used to make champagne \) come draped in billows of champagne sabayon , looking like something bacchus would have been happy to eat warm caramelized figs are paired with a cool , tangy ice cream made of fromage blanc and sprinkled with ground pistachios creme brulee is rich , plain and good each is a very pleasant way to end a meal , but none of these desserts dance around asking for attention if everything about montrachet is so wonderful , why does n't it have four stars \?

piscataway , nj , sept 3 everything functioned , including the football team , as rutgers opened its new 26 million stadium today in a twilight game against kent state a crowd of 33 , 279 , the largest for a home game here in 125 years of football , turned out to test the gaudy new facility and to check out the latest edition of the scarlet knights against an opponent from ohio and the midamerican conference that had won only 5 games of its last 55 and none last season , rutgers scored three touchdowns in the second period and went on to win , 286 the debut of the stadium turned out to be far more compelling than an uneven game that dragged in the second half doug graber , the rutgers coach , said of the stadium debut it was spectacular i thought we had a great crowd and great enthusiasm and i'm happy we broke the record big test next week a more significant test will come next saturday when west virginia , the defending big east champion , plays the scarlet knights rutgers was picked to finish sixth in the big east in a preseason news media poll the home team started slowly , but then came the big plays that the new kent coach , jim corrigall , so feared there were just some breakdowns , he said bruce presley and terrell willis , rutgers' two tailbacks who are described as thunder and lightning in university promotions , combined for 164 rushing yards , 78 for presley in 14 carries and 86 for willis in 19 rich yurkiewicz , the kent linebacker who is the team s top defensive player , said , they were getting eight , nine yards a pop on their runs and they have two tough backs one is quick , he runs around you , and the other runs over you , he said of willis and presley kent s answer was a 5foot8inch , 177pound redshirt freshman tailback , astron whatley , who carried 31 times for 106 yards , running mostly inside from the iformation scored late in game but the golden flash could not score until only 3 minutes 25 seconds remained after a rutgers punt had been blocked , mark challenger then passed 11 yards to lance hansen for the touchdown ray lucas , rutgers s starting quarterback , had his usual bumpy ride , in trouble trying to salvage plays the kent defense contained he completed 9 of 16 pass attempts for 155 yards with 2 interceptions , and he scored one touchdown lucas , a thirdyear quarterback from harrison , nj , got the scarlet knights going on their fourth series , completing passes of 28 and 18 yards to tight end marco battaglia and flanker reggie funderbunk on an 80yard drive it ended with lucas scoring on an 8yard end run lucas next completed a 60yard touchdown pass to wide receiver steven harper then cornerback curtis tribbitt returned an interception of a kent pass 28 yards for a third touchdown eddie duborg , the new kicker , booted three conversions and the scarlet had scored 21 points in 4 minutes 3 secondsa 13yard run by presley in the fourth quarter accounted for the fourth touchdown the site for the new stadium is the same and so is the name , rutgers stadium but any resemblance to the old stadium is almost nonexistent the new stadium has nearly twice as many seats as the old , 41 , 500 to 22 , 000 , and is far more imposing , with its twin 5 , 000seat upper decks on each side of the grass field into this structure , which took 15 months to build , went 22 , 050 tons of steel , five miles of pipe , 130 , 000 square feet of sod and about 26 million if the proportions seemed different to old grads , there was a reason the playing field was moved 25 feet to the west , bringing it closer to the stands photo rutgers' laquan harris finding plenty of running room yesterday \( clifford hauser for the new york times \)
inside the eightscreen multiplex , the jolly jingles are about to begin as the lights darken and the last popcorntoting stragglers find their seats and as the packed audience waits impatiently for the latest megamovie out of hollywood to explode from the screen , outside on the sidewalk , you resign yourself to the fact that , once again , you ca n't get in this show and the next show are both sold out clearly , something is wrong here just about every cinema in town is overflowing , not just the multiplexes but film forum , too , filled with masters of planning eager for airconditioning and escape what to do \? there are less stressful and more adventurous ways to see movies during the summer you may not always be able to see a new movie , but you may find an old movie you have never seen and be able to see it in refreshingly different circumstances over dinner , for instance on a lawn in an obscure corner of chinatown over drinks in a bar even in someone s living room here are some places to begin the journey into adventurous moviegoing one place to catch something different on a saturday night is dixon place , on the bowery at houston street in soho this weekend it s showing shelf life , the latest film by paul bartel , who directed the cult classic eating raoul the film , which originated as a performance piece , is about a family that spends three decades in a nuclear shelter as unusual as the film are the surroundings dixon place is a performance space , but it is also a living room fortunately , the living room is well stocked with sofas and chairs for perhaps two dozen people there is no popcorn machine , but ellie covan , the executive director , in her amusing introduction to the movie , invokes the spirit of performance by asking the audience to imagine that there is and that they can smell it coffee , tea , cider , chips and salsa are available the bastion of the cinematic avantgarde is the forbiddingly named anthology film archives , housed in a dour , marqueeless brick building in the east village that has the stark , unbreakable look of a high school it also has one of the most adventurous film programs in new york city if you are in the mood to see a twoandahalfhour silent movie from japan made in 1992 or the latest boxoffice smash from iceland , or if you simply want to catch up on underground cinema , this is the place to do it there are two theaters and a reference library with extensive material on independent film and video where else but at the museum of modern art can you watch a movie in midtown manhattan and then sit outside in the shade of a maple tree , surrounded by the sculptures of lachaise , picasso and matisse \?

the two connected buildings perched off litchfield s town green are certainly the most bizarre , and amusing , architectural coupling in the state , if not in the country the first building , at 9 north street , is the old litchfield county jail , erected in 1812 the other , at 13 north street and dating to 1816 , is the first national bank of litchfield they were constructed as separate entities but early in this century the bank building and the jail building became connected and thus they have remained , the oddest of couples , coexisting side by side in what has been a feeling of not only tolerance but also sometimes downright affection prisoners have come in sometimes to cash checks here , said walter l hunt , a veteran of 24 years at the bank and now its executive vice president it s a very pretty building , i do n't think anyone thinks of it as a jail , said jerome j whalen , the bank s vice president , of his nextdoor neighbor indeed , many prisoners have not regarded it as such for generations , the reputation of the jail was that of a country club of penal institutions where the living was positively easy the jail is part of the lore of litchfield , replete with great stories of prisoners coming and going almost as they pleased , with volunteer firefighters serving sentences for minor offenses answering the town fire bell with dispatch , with prisoners shimmying up and down sheets on shopping forays , mostly for cigarettes and booze one of the finer stories , said jennifer jacobs , curator of the litchfield historical society , is about a prisoner getting caught trying to get back into the jail the end of the venerable brick structure as a jail was not very pleasant , however traditionally , the county jail had only housed inmates convicted of minor crimes but over the past several years , as a state institution , the old building had been opened up to criminals with violent records and loaded to its 120prisoner capacity , resulting in a jail break in which a guard was stabbed and a new york man taken hostage the events shattered the quaint image of the old building and resulted in its conversion , in 1992 , into a drug treatment center for 30 men serving prison sentences then in 1993 gov lowell p weicker jr ordered the building shut down as a costsaving measure presumably , that was a death sentence for the old jail it has not worked out that way now the jail is starting a new life , and perhaps the most enlightened one of its long and strange history it even has a new and very unjaillike name , mcauliffe manor , and a new look curtains adorn its upper front windows the rooms inside its front door , where the warden and the guards once hung out , are now painted in warm colors instead of mustard brown and now a sound that seems alien to heavy metal doors and cellblocks is often heard it is laughter since june the old jail has been a rehabilitation center for women who would otherwise be serving out the last part of their sentences at niantic correctional institute in niantic , the state s women s prison , or at the western substance abuse treatment unit in newtown it is the only drug rehabilitation center solely for women prisoners in the state , operated on a state contract by naugatuck valley help inc , a waterburybased social service agency that specializes in drug abuse and mental health treatment programs the purpose of mcauliffe manor , says its director , roberta murtagh , is to break the pattern of women going to prison , receiving no real help there in changing their life styles , getting out and returning once again it s a real cycle , she said some of the women here have been arrested 10 or 12 times we give them the choice of staying in niantic and doing nothing or coming here to work with counselors to find out how they got where they were and how they can change some of them have histories that are just devastating and most realize they have hit bottom there s a lot of trauma , a lot of pain , in exposing your life and i really admire those who come here when the center first opened , it had three women clients \( as they are called , instead of inmates or prisoners \) and a staff of more than a dozen , including five counselors and a clinical psychologist , to greet them by midseptember , it had 16 clients 7 white , 6 hispanic , 3 black , ranging in age from 21 to 49 it is expected to reach its capacity of 30 clients shortly , said mrs murtagh , a 35yearold mother of two who once was a chimney sweep , complete with high hat , before deciding to go into social work she is a pragmatic administrator who insists on codes of conduct for the woman at mcauliffe but is sensitive to the point that she has not yet ventured into the solitary confinement cell at the old jail the hole , as it is called , is part of the original cellblock at the jail , a dark enclosure with barely enough room for a prisoner to lie down eventually , mrs murtagh says she hopes to convert the old cellblock into a library and already the grim old cells are filling with books

leaping to the defense of local news programs is like diving into a shallow and polluted pool , but as nature teaches , nutrients are often found amid muck lately , maybe because of the weather , i have been warmed by a community spirit that keeps the hours from seeming too dark as afternoon turns into evening snow , sleet or frost , viewers at home and reporters sliding around out there are allied against the elements no , none of the laments you have read in this corner or elsewhere are about to be withdrawn the programs still trade in mayhem and mawkishness , in the five boroughs and beyond where freakery calls , local news has the reach of cnn travel budgets are busted for a bobbitt to add to the irritation , some reporters are evidently under orders to wax operatic about whatever they are covering , which can be stunningly routine , while basic details , like where and when , may elude them the anchordesk bonhomie is relentless , the chat dim the people who deliver the weather and sports news work so hard at being personalities that they sometimes get in the way of their quite simple stories the celebrity interviews are often outright network puffs but most of the weaknesses are human everybody on screen seems to be working so hard to please in their annoying ways , the local teams , as they like to call themselves , are as reassuring as the neighborhood busybody not likable , but indispensable who can be counted on to drop by with the day s gossip there is space to be occupied between oprah and roseanne , and the localnews shows are a lot better than an empty apartment familiarity breeds companionship when they serve up a crime story , the favorite fare , the locals are infallibly tuned to the prevailing unease although they constantly overdose on crime and no doubt arouse needless anxiety , the steady theme is viewers and reporters against the bad guys the shows are softhearted no halfhour segment goes by without a sobber or two or three about the hungry , the homeless , the sick , the old , the young people tell what it is like to live in neighborhoods where leaving your house after dark is like crossing a street in sarajevo if disaster strikes , as it seems to every day , the cameras are sure to be turned on the victims here the boiler conked out here the pipes froze if there s an earthquake in los angeles , you can depend on meeting new yorkers who were caught there it must be an upper for audiences beset by bigcity nuisances and worse to be reminded so regularly that they are not the unluckiest people around most viewers do n't have to live in the south bronx , and better ice in queens than fire in los angeles localnews directors are like oldtime tammany hall operatives , who actually served the masses on whom they battened today s new yorkers , lacking clubhouses , at least know these shows are on their side consumer reporters spring to the attack against swindlers if it snows , there are hints on how to drive and how to avoid heart attacks the latest good news about mammograms and prostates is guaranteed switch on at 5 or 6 pm and you can be sure of seeing the city suffering , and sometimes rejoicing , along with you and the ordinary folks on screen , especially the drivers who are trapped in the chronic traffic jams , are new yorkers at their best , enduring ulcercausing indignities with a shrug and a wisecrack it is a pleasure to identify with such people no , do n't look here for depth or wit , but it is easy to develop friendly feelings for one or another of the regulars , even a mild crush topping my easytotake list is carol jenkins , the 6 pm coanchor on channel 4 she manages to restrain her enthusiasm for the gorier stories imposed on her and at times even seems a touch embarrassed and she has a nice laugh but there are anchors and reporters for many tastes letters from the lovelorn must be common sure , the programs exploit and patronize , and much of the seeming sincerity is mere professionalism , but along with the gush and sloppy journalistic manners , they offer a semblance of solidarity at a time when so much is keeping new yorkers apart
washington , sept 17 minutes after telling the nation on thursday night that he had exhausted diplomacy in his standoff with haiti , president clinton went into his small study off the oval office and made a round of telephone calls to enlist emissaries for the highlevel mission that mr clinton today called the last best chance for peace that he did so surprised some top administration officials , most of whom learned only friday afternoon that mr clinton had decided to send jimmy carter to portauprince some of them expressed concern today that the mission which also includes senator sam nunn of georgia and retired gen colin l powell , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff could turn into the kind of negotiating session for which mr clinton had said the time was long past the white house previously rejected mr carter s request that he serve as an intermediary but aides to mr clinton said today that even as he addressed the nation on thursday night , he and his top advisers believed they had no political or moral option but to try one more time to bring an end to the crisis through talk , not war none of us wants to send us troops in harm s way if it can be avoided , william gray 3d , the special adviser on haiti , said today even as his emissaries were landing in the haitian capital , the president was taking pains to maintain an image of toughness he traveled from the white house to the pentagon , where he returned a salute from gen john m d shalikashvili , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , then headed into an underground chamber at the pentagon called the national military command center , for what the white house said was a briefing on the status of military preparations he also conferred by videoconference with admirals and generals aboard navy ships and at army bases his aides also noted that in a meeting this morning mr clinton proclaimed that he would be neither delayed or deterred and in his weekly radio address to the nation , he declared we still hope to end this journey peacefully but let me say one last time the cause is right , the mission is achievable and limited , and we will succeed the dictators must leave what most worried mr clinton and his top advisers , aides said today , was the prospect that a mission to haiti by mr carter would send the same mixed signals as the former president sent earlier this summer on a quasiofficial trip to north korea in which he made clear that he opposed the administration s policy since thursday night , when mr clinton told senator nunn and general powell that he would like them to join mr carter in a final mission , aides said that the president has taken extraordinary steps to keep the mission on a short rein mr carter , who had been accompanied to north korea only by his wife and a translator , was joined on the trip to haiti by top officials from the state department , the pentagon and the white house the team flew into portauprince today aboard a united states air force jet loaded with secure communications equipment to allow the emissaries to keep in touch with washington even on friday night , aides said , mr clinton placed telephone calls to mr carter , senator nunn and general powell one by one to review their instructions with them the president told them their job was to tell the three haitian leaders firmly that they must relinquish power , and to discuss the arrangements the united states might make for them to leave the country only if they were asked about it some officials worried aloud today that such talks have a way of gaining a momentum of their own , noting that mr carter , senator nunn and general powell have all questioned the wisdom of the invasion that mr clinton has said will soon be his only recourse but mr gray , when asked about that prospect during an interview on cable news network , replied the administration has said 'here is the boundaries of any discussions and negotiations if anyone goes outside of those boundaries , do n't expect us to be supportive of that' i do n't think president carter s going to do that by coincidence , mr clinton spoke tonight at a dinner in honor of the congressional black caucus , whose members were outspoken in criticizing the administration s policy toward haiti earlier this year more than any other factor , their complaints that the administration was being inhumane in turning back haitian refugees prompted the white house to change course last may by tightening sanctions , providing havens for the refugees and threatening to use force unless haiti s leaders stepped down now some members of the caucus , including representative maxine waters , the california democrat , have become his most ardent champions in the face of criticism that military action would be unwise another supporter of an invasion has been representative kweisi mfume , a maryland democrat who heads the caucus earlier this month he said it s no longer a question of whether or not it s inevitable it s a larger question of whether or not we find ourselves with reasons as to why we should not invade but that feeling is by no means universal even among the group many of its members , including representative ronald dellums , the california democrat who is now chairman of the house armed services committee , have long been wary of the use of force , and some have expressed reservations about the dangers that an americanled invasion might pose for haitian civilians , who are overwhelmingly black in his address , mr clinton called on the black caucus to say a

to the editor natasha mostert s plea for america , and presumably the rest of the world , to scrutinize the postelection actions of the african national congress , the likely winning party in that country s first democratic , allrace election , rings hollow \( trading places in south africa \? oped , april 19 \) her fear of unsavory tactics by an ancled government is shared by many , if not most , other afrikaners the same people who conceived , endorsed and unwaveringly maintained the abhorrent apartheid system for more than four decades it is indeed ironic that afrikaners , who for more than a generation told the world that the apartheid policies of the national party were none of our business , are now seeking help once they assume minority party status but the restraint on political excesses should not rest with foreign observers they are inside ms mostert s own country south africa has for the first time a new constitution and bill of rights \( in which ms mostert s national party participated in drafting \) , and an independent constitutional court to interpret and enforce those protections south africa will also be a country with many diverse political parties , including the continued existence of the national party , which will win seats in the national parliament and achieve majority control in some of the local and regional rural areas the primary responsibility for the vigilance ms mostert seeks over political excesses should rest with the minority political parties , particularly the democratic party and the national party , which can function as a restraining force on governmental abuses combined with the newly adopted legal protections and judicial processes , the national party is armed with ample opportunity to learn to protect itself ms mostert and other afrikaners now must learn how to act like a minority party maintaining the flame of freedom in the new south africa will require vigilance not by america , but by all south africans but one fact remains clear even in the dark and violent months that precede the election the vast majority of south africans of all colors overwhelmingly reject the national party politics of old and support a democratic style government although the nats of old fear minority status , south africa will confront its past by moving toward the future , perhaps not in a straight line and sometimes stumbling , but at its own pace and in a unique and historic way in the end , we will all be watching jeffrey ross williams adrienne oleck williams silver spring , md , april 19 , 1994

the setting is again the snug harbor cultural center on staten island , but the attraction , new island views ii , is a very different proposition from the sculpture reviewed here last week for one thing , the display , which hangs in the newhouse center for contemporary art , consists mostly of paintings and work from paper for another , the majority of the nine artists involved live and work on staten island alice yang , who normally works at the new museum in manhattan as an assistant curator , did the honors , achieving a show that is both conventional and eccentric thus , of mountains and molehills , a roomsized installation by milenka berengolc , addresses the wellworn subject of a woman s selfimage and , in ms yang s words , the way it has been defined by her physical attributes but the results suggest a tantrum in progress with clothes flung angrily about the floor , and there is an obsessive concern with breasts crudely made falsies are piled on a dresser , while photographs of the real thing painted with patterns edge the mirror there is even a newspaper headlining disingenousness on the part of implant manufacturers lurking in the chaos , however , are the fruits that james joyce called ripe smelonious melons , likening them to the female rump even without the help of the neologist , these fruity metaphors for the female form not only inject humor into the situation , but also hint that biology may after all equal destiny robin locke monda celebrates the erotic in paintings that are as chilly as ms berengolc s installation is impassioned her larger images are brightly colored amalgams of stylized figures and objects that , along with the disks and stripes , are laid on raw canvas or on areas painted black or white attractive though it is , the work seems closer to design than painting the coldness of peter malone s art is largely a matter of a photographic technique combined with occasional surrealist juxtapositions and elisions , like the fence that fades halfway across a gleaming stretch of grass nevertheless , these diptychs and triptychs pack quite a punch , especially the one featuring a flower like a camellia flanked by squares of green landscape under cloudy blue skies generally , the patient undergoing surgery will settle for a successful outcome but it seems that for mary campbell , the experience was an epiphany one that provided subject matter for her watercolors and prints a heart with truncated aorta stands center stage , and the artery illustrated is one of several that cannot be told from trees ms campbell is evidently interested in similarities between dissimilar organisms it pains me to say it , but her best efforts are the delicately textured thermal transfer prints generated by computers michael mckeown fills a gallery with troughs , wide and narrow some are carvings like the one in white marble , turned green on the inside by cupric nitrate others are made of steel minimal though they are , the structures all have romantically rough surfaces baiyou han is a recent immigrant who looks back to his native land , china , particularly as it was under the manchu dynasty , which was toppled early in the 20th century what mr han paints , however , are not documentaries but rather allegories one features an emperor squatting with his pipe , as he watches members of his cabinet standing on their heads another depicts an emperor who , believing himself to be the cleverest of them all , parades naked , except for turquoise sunglasses , under an orange parasol in other words , mr han s subject is the abuse of power , and he portrays it very well in images that are glittering mixtures of black , white and a range of strong colors jenny tango deals with power , too , but in black and white images on paper that combine photocopied photographs with a lot of writing hers is a feminist view , and she expresses it by satirizing 18thcentury jewish folk tales that , not surprisingly , epitomize the supremacy of man kenny cole contributes 16 large and somewhat inept watercolors that comment on major issues like that of pollution , as well as the vicissitudes of daily life then there are the color photographs taken on staten island by denise ranallo some are portraits of teenage girls , others are studies of their outstretched hands and , though none are remarkable as pictures , all give pleasure with their gentleness also on view are a great many photographs of new york landmarks selected by barbaralee diamonsteinspielvogel these exemplary black and white images , commissioned of young photographers by the new york landmarks preservation foundation , cover golden oldies from the plaza hotel and the puck building to the cyclone at coney island they also include less famous beauties like the fully rusticated public library building on west 115th street erected in 190708 by mckim , mead white and , in the bronx , the howard e and jessie jones house , a cottage worthy of gaudi all in all , the show , which closes on sept 18 , reflects well on the staten island scene the center is at 1000 richmond terrace hours are noon to 5 pm wednesday through sunday photos

tokyo , jan 21 in a stunning defeat for prime minister morihiro hosokawa , the upper house of parliament today voted down a political reform package that was at the center of his bid to end corruption in japan s political system the surprisingly large margin by which mr hosokawa lost , 130 to 118 , resulted largely from the defection of some socialists in his governing coalition who feared that the overhaul of the electoral system would eliminate many of their party s seats tonight leaders in all parties said the sixmonthold government was in chaos , and some speculated that it could collapse within weeks without accomplishing the one goal it was elected to achieve 'on the edge of the cliff' we are standing on the edge of the cliff , tsutomu hata , the foreign minister and deputy prime minister , said on japanese television he said he could not deny the possibility of a dissolution of parliament , leading to another round of elections in which mr hosokawa s coalition would battle for a stronger mandate the prime minister vowed to try to revive some form of the legislation before parliament goes out of session in a week , but his position has been greatly weakened apart from political reform , the defeat threatens to derail , at least temporarily , progress toward mr hosokawa s other goals deregulating the country , weakening the iron grip of the bureaucracy and beginning an era of political and economic openness that would benefit the japanese as well as their trading partners no consensus on economy with weeks or months of turmoil ahead , the eightparty coalition government seems unlikely to agree on how to jumpstart an economy mired in recession or on how to conclude a critical trade agreement with the united states if mr hosokawa remains in office and meets with president clinton in three weeks as planned , he seems certain to plead for more time on the trade accord news analysis , page 5 one bill in the political reform package rejected today would have banned corporate and individual contributions to individual politicians , a system that bred the bribery and influencepeddling scandals that brought down japan s longgoverning liberal democratic party in july it would also have instituted public financing another would have redrawn every electoral district and changed the system so that just one representative rather than five or six would serve each district though the socialist party leadership endorsed the four bills that made up the political reform program , some legislators saw it as their own political death warrant a number feared that if japan s cautious voters were choosing only one candidate per district , they would select a conservative in the end , 17 of the 73 socialists in the upper house defected and voted no , and 3 did not show up only 5 liberal democrats joined mr hosokawa s forces and voted yes three options , none attractive while confusion reigned tonight over how mr hosokawa would extract himself from his problems , he seems to face three main options , none of them very attractive the first is to take the bills back to the lower house , where the governing coalition is much stronger , and seek to override the upper house vote that requires a twothirds majority , though , and he stands almost no chance of winning even if the bills were approved , the coalition would still be in tatters , and a new one might have to be formed the second option is to form a committee of both houses that would race to come up with a compromise piece of political reform legislation before jan 29 , when the parliamentary session ends but any such plan would be greatly diluted and then would have to pass both houses by majority vote mr hosokawa might even be required to adopt wholesale a weak proposal made last year by the liberal democrats , which would in turn probably prompt more socialists to bolt there is a possibility that this strategy could succeed , said minoru mo rita , a prominent political commentator but it is not a high probability most liberal democrats privately advocate maintaining the status quo in which they thrived for decades the liberal democrats have been looking for a way to kill the political reform effort without appearing to oppose it now they have their chance the third option is for mr hosokawa to resign or dissolve parliament and call new elections in the hope of ridding the coalition of the socialists and replacing them with candidates advocating broad changes in the electoral and financing system but mr hosokawa made clear today that he desperately wanted to avoid a national vote with the japanese economy stuck in one of its worst downturns since the end of world war ii , partners in the government coalition fear that the public would see an election as an irresponsible move that would delay economic stimulus packages and tax cuts for months asked at a news conference tonight about dissolving parliament , mr hosokawa said , i am not considering such a course we have to do something to allay the public s fears about the economy , he added mr hosokawa s only real chance for survival is to prompt another rebellion within the opposition liberal democratic party , which like his coalition has been slowly unraveling
out with the old this spring , video stores are weeding their shelves with games becoming a hot commodity , space is needed , and at such chains as tower and west coast video slowmoving cassettes are becoming expendable the computers show when a title has died , said steven apple , a vice president of west coast video , the country s second largest chain , after blockbuster we saw hundreds that had stopped renting and were collecting dust , so we got rid of them west coast s rejects are sold to collectors and other dealers lackluster btitles usually fall by the wayside , mr apple said five years ago , these films were rented , he added , but now the demand is for major films and only highquality bmovies we aim for a middle ground between a vast selection and what is more in tune with what customers really want , mr apple said with space opened up , many west coast outlets have about 600 square feet of new areas devoted to renting , selling and trading video games oddly , perhaps , games have only recently become a priority in many video stores we had always dabbled in games , mr apple said , but two years ago , we decided to take them seriously as a way to go as opposed to the movierental business , which had flattened out west coast now stresses cartridge games , for which there are about 20 million players in use , and is proceeding cautiously with cdrom games played on personal computers but compact disks , mr apple said , are the way of the future manufactured more cheaply than cassettes and cartridges , they also do n't take up much shelf space in 5 to 10 years ,

berlin , oct 19 a tale of international intrigue and the possible murder of one of germany s most promising young politicians is gripping the country when the politician , uwe barschel , was found dead in a geneva hotel room seven years ago , the authorities quickly closed the case as a suicide but mr barschel s family , convinced that he was killed to keep him from revealing what he knew about an illicit trade in weapons , have doggedly pursued the case , aided by conspiracy theorists last week , swiss toxicologists said new tests on mr barschel s remains showed that he could not have committed suicide the newspaper bild quoted the official who oversees german secret services , bernd schmidbauer , as saying , barschel may have been murdered after all a former israeli intelligence agent , victor ostrovsky , has written a book asserting that israeli agents killed mr barschel because he knew too much about the arms trade between israel and iran , with german middlemen operating out of mr barschel s home state , schleswigholstein another theory , that mr barschel was murdered by west german agents , was the basis of a feature film released in germany this year none of the theories amounts to much more than speculation at this point but the case holds an unusual grip on the german imagination mr barschel was a widely known politician who was viewed by some as a future chancellor his bizarre death and subsequent revelations have kept interest in the case high a photo of mr barschel floating dead in his hotel bathtub , clad in suit and tie , has been printed countless times in the german press , often accompanying articles that raise new questions about the case the latest of those questions was raised this month when it was learned that the swiss authorities had sent germany the results of new tests said to show that when mr barschel ingested the drug cocktail that killed him , he was already unconscious their report suggested that mr barschel was somehow incapacitated and then fed poison in a way intended to make his death appear a suicide the tests , made on samples taken from mr barschel s body at the time of his death , had been requested by relatives german prosecutors said they would review the new evidence , but made no immediate move to reopen the case mr barschel had a meteoric career , becoming governor of schleswigholstein in 1982 at the age of 38 but his christian democratic union failed to win a majority in the 1987 election , and mr barschel faced a scandal over charges that he had used illegal campaign tactics he resigned soon afterward , giving his word of honor that he had done nothing wrong and vowing to prove his innocence a few days later , after a family vacation in the canary islands , he flew alone to geneva , where he died investigators hired by the barschel family have discovered that mr barschel made many trips to east germany , mostly alone there he met women who are presumed to have been secret police agents , and also met east german government officials he also traveled regularly to prague , and western security agents say there were periods when he disappeared for hours family members say mr barschel had covert contact with several important arms dealers , and that he worked closely with the west german secret service , the bnd he also reportedly had contacts with the east german secret service and the israeli service , the mossad
washington , march 30 the broker who the white house says was used by hillary rodham clinton to trade commodities futures has a record of regulatory and legal difficulties and was forced into bankruptcy after he was sued by customers and traders who said he had lost millions of their dollars the arkansas office run by the broker , robert l \( red \) bone , collapsed in october 1979 as the market in cattle futures fell sharply mrs clinton stopped trading in her account in july 1979 , and closed it shortly before the collapse over 10 months of trading , mrs clinton had made nearly 100 , 000 on an investment of 1 , 000 a senior aide to mrs clinton said on tuesday that she was unaware of mr bone s regulatory problems in that era none of them involved mrs clinton the white house says mrs clinton began trading in october 1978 in the springdale office managed by mr bone for refco , a commodities firm based in chicago but mr bone has said that he has no recollection of ever dealing with the clintons or trading on their behalf many customers and traders in the springdale office say they lost millions of dollars after the cattle futures market plummeted in october 1979 they asserted in the lawsuits in the 1980 s that mr bone and others at refco had conspired to stick them with losing trades as the market collapsed , giving the profitable trades to refco executives , brokers and other staff members according to regulatory records , mr bone was disciplined for trying to corner the egg futures market in the 1970 s he was barred in 1977 for one month from any trading and for 11 months from trading in his own account regulators assert that he then traded through another broker on december 13 , 1979 , he consented to a three year suspension from trading his financial problems from those days have only recently been resolved in january , he settled a dispute with the internal revenue service over almost 7 million in back taxes the government said he owed from 1978 to 1980 property records in arkansas show that in january the government lifted the last 2 million of a total of 698 million in tax liens from those years , but they do not show how much mr bone paid to settle the claims
when one thinks of cablevision systems , which with the itt corporation has acquired the properties of madison square garden for 105 billion , one cannot help but think of the triplecast , a disastrous 1992 summer olympics payperview joint venture with nbc cablevision ran the marketing and distribution of the venture , the heaven s gate of television , blithely promising 25 million buyers for the overpriced , untested service it attracted fewer than one tenth that number now cablevision and itt own the fabled arena , along with the knicks , the rangers and the msg network how they manage those assets will likely affect fans and viewers around the new york area sweeping local control the acquisition gives cablevision which would appear to be the operational partner sweeping control over sports in the local market it would not only own the knicks , but would still televise the mets , nets and devils on cablevision s sportschannel paycable outlet and the knicks , rangers and yankees on the msg network cablevision has no experience at running a team , although charles f dolan , the head of cablevision , tried unsuccessfully to buy the islanders from john pickett last year and cablevision has no experience at running a sports arena , aside from televising islanders games from nassau coliseum but cablevision does have experience in running a paysports channel , where sportschannel s main goal seems to be to wring profits mercilessly out of a property without much of a care for program quality you 've probably seen sportschannel compared with the msg network , it s television on a du mont , circa 1952 its production values bespeak a miserly approach there is no attempt to show real pride in what can be done with sports television fran healy s halls of fames series has a look that wayne s world would not envy compare anything sportschannel does in a studio with the msg network s work and you have two worlds of television msg s output is virtually indistinguishable from a broadcast network s on game work , you watch sportschannel s hockey and basketball games and everything seems dimly lit and while msg reaches for top talent like marv albert , john andariese , john davidson , sam rosen and tony kubek , sportschannel s mets' team of healy and rusty staub \( bringing down their partner , ralph kiner \) bear the crest of mediocrity that sportschannel hired the terrific mike emrick to call devils' games seems an aberration perhaps even more troubling than what would almost certainly be a diminution of the quality of the msg network is the nearmonopolistic power that cablevision and itt would have in the local television market my concern is you 'd have the two major sports channels owned by the same entity , which also happens to be a cable operator , said richard j kessel , executive director of the new york state consumer protection board i'm concerned when a cable operator is also a programmer at least in new york , with msg and sportschannel , we 've had two entities competing for business now they could be linked and it raises antitrust , competitive questions mr kessell said cablevisionitt could control all pricing , perhaps bump msg upward to a more expensive pay tier and crossprogram both channels so that what used to be only sportschannel fare would wind up on msg think , too , of what might happen when the expensive contracts of mr kubek , mr albert or mr davidson come due for renewal or maybe they 'll put some games on payperview , mr kessel said even if none of the above happens , it seems likely that some msg network jobs would be lost when sales , affiliate relations , marketing , promotion and public relations departments are merged one would hope that cablevision has enough of a sense of its shortcomings that it would let some of the best of what the superior msg network does to rub off on sportschannel paradoxically , the checks to be written to pay off the yankees' 486 million msg deal will now be written by cablevision , which lost the bidding to renew its old deal in 1988 possible effects on teams the effect on the knicks and rangers remains less clear because team ownership would be new to the cablevisionitt group garden management under paramount communications , which was acquired earlier this year by viacom , has lavished many needed resources on the two teams , getting the necessary players and paying for stars like mark messier of the rangers and team leaders like pat riley , the knicks coach the arrival of a new owner would make any existing management nervous would cablevisionitt look at the knicks' ruling threesome of dave checketts , ernie grunfeld and mr riley and leave it alone , or superimpose its own ideas of how to push the knicks up one more level to win the nba title \? what does cablevision want from a team a title or simply builtin programming \? although mr checketts , the knicks' president , met with the various garden suitors and was said to feel comfortable , he has to wonder whom he will report to will the new owners keep bob gutkowski , the president of the garden , or bring in someone else \? mr checketts worked comfortably with stanley jaffe , the former paramount president who was mr gutkowski s boss until viacom acquired paramount to date , mr checketts has not had the same kind of close working relationship with mr gutkowski as for the rangers , they have just survived an embarrassing upheaval that began when mr keenan bolted the team to sign with the st louis blues , leaving in its wake a trail of bitterness , and the exposure of a serious rift between mr gutkowski and neil smith , the team s president and general manager , over mr smith s and mr keenan s dreadful working relationship cablevisionitt s victory seems to conclude nearly a year of uncertainty over where the garden properties would go it s been a black cloud , one garden executive said that each team did as well as they did last season only provided a distraction people are saying , 'just get this over with and get on with it' of course , maybe it s not all over , if cablevisionitt decides to keep some , but not all of the properties perhaps the partners would sell the knicks to nike , which dropped out after earlier expressing a desire to buy the garden , and the rangers to some other company at the end of the day , the executive said , there s nothing we can do

mineola , li , march 18 reversing a court decision of 23 years ago , a judge in nassau county today found ricardo s caputo fit to stand trial in the first of four murders he says he committed in the 1970 s his lawyer immediately said he might contest the decision , but added that if the case goes to trial , mr caputo will plead not guilty by reason of insanity today s decision is based solely on mr caputo s mental condition now , and has nothing to do with his state of mind at the time of the killings or when he was originally arrested in 1971 at that time mr caputo was declared unfit to stand trial in the murder of natalie brown , 19 , of flower hill , li , after homicide detectives said he had been observed talking to his deceased victim in his jail cell the court then sent mr caputo to a state hospital for the criminally insane he escaped in 1974 he said he killed his second victim , a psychologist who had been treating him , that year , and later killed a third woman in san francisco and a fourth in mexico city after living as a fugitive for 17 years in california , the midwest , mexico and argentina , he surrendered to the new york state police last week , saying he felt remorse for his victims and their families and feared that the voices and demons that forced him to kill two decades ago could cause him to kill again mr caputo stood silent and motionless today , restrained by handcuffs and leg irons , as judge john dunne said that a courtordered psychiatric examination of mr caputo on thursday at the nassau county jail had recommended that he was fit to precede to trial judge dunne did not comment further on the details of the examination and cautioned both the defense and prosecution that none of the report should be made public under new york state law , a defendant must pass two tests to be ruled mentally competent to stand trial the judge must determine that the defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings , such as the indictment and the roles of the judge , defense lawyer , prosecutor and jury and the defendant must be able to assist in his or her defense by contrast , an insanity defense would require mr caputo s lawyer , michael kennedy , to prove that mr caputo could not appreciate the nature and consequences of his conduct or know that his conduct was wrong at the time he committed the murder lawyer to respond after today s ruling , mr kennedy said he needed time to study the psychiatric report to determine whether to seek further psychiatric tests and contest the judge s decision the judge adjourned the hearing until march 30 , when mr kennedy is to respond legal analysts said the defense may yet prove that mr caputo , who mr kennedy has said suffers from schizophrenia and multiplepersonality disorder , is unfit to stand trial it could come down to a battle of experts on the question of mental competency , said william hellerstein , a professor at the brooklyn law school the question is not what his mental state was 20 years ago , but what his mental state is now , mr hellerstein said it s not only a legal issue , it s a psychiatric issue in an interview outside the courtroom , mr kennedy said i think the reality of these proceedings is that mr caputo is not likely to ever to be free , to see the light of day the real question is , will he be confined behind bars in a prison hospital , or will he be confined in a cell \? judge dunne , taking note of the considerable television and newspaper coverage of mr caputo s surrender to detectives in mr kennedy s manhattan law offices last week and subsequent media coverage of the case , warned mr kennedy and the prosecution not to discuss confidential portions of the court s records , including the courtordered psychiatric examination before mr caputo turned himself in to the police 10 days ago , he spent two hours with a television correspondent and a network crew , confessing to the four murders and describing the voices that he said drove him to murder mr caputo has spoken to no reporters since his arrest , and mr kennedy has carefully controlled the flow of information about his client mr caputo s brother , alfredo , sat alone in the courtroom today as ricardo caputo , wearing the same blue jeans , blueandwhite striped shirt and leather jacket in which he was arrested , made his second court appearance this week before judge dunne alfredo caputo , who on wednesday issued a brief statement about his brother s life and struggle with mental illness , quickly left the courthouse this afternoon , referring all questions to mr kennedy ricardo caputo , who first immigrated to new york in 1970 , admits killing his fiancee , ms brown , in 1971 his psychologist , judith becker , 26 , of yonkers , in 1974 barbara ann taylor , 28 , with whom he lived in san francisco , in 1975 , and laura gomez , with whom he lived in mexico city , in 1977 mr kennedy said mr caputo had been diagnosed by psychiatrists in argentina as suffering from multiple personalities , one of which is psychotic and drove him to commit the four murders
johannesburg , aug 2 courting south africa last year , the advance scouts of western money brought an alluring message make peace and take the freemarket pledge , and a thousand projects will bloom but 10 months after nelson mandela formally invited foreign business to come back , and three months after the elections that secured this reborn capitalist the presidency , south africa has yet to see the surge of investment needed to fuel growth and jobs the country reached an almost miraculous political consensus , leading to the end of economic sanctions and the resultant isolation mr mandela has adopted a sober , growthoriented economic policy but investors have found a host of reasons to hold back the labor force is costly , unskilled and militant trade barriers and currency exchange controls have yet to fall there are doubts about the government s longterm commitment to capitalism , about whether mr mandela can contain the expectations of the impoverished majority as an investment opportunity , south africa is an oddball part third world , part first world , situated at the bottom of the globe , and attached to a continent that western investors tend to see , at best , as terra incognita , and , at worst , as doomed in just about every presentation , there s somebody who stands up and asks me , 'what about rwanda \? ' said charles h allison , executive director of new africa advisors , an american firm that has been trying to get pension funds to buy a stake in new south african businesses rwanda , that tiny country ruptured by ethnic hatred , is 1 , 500 miles to the north and is as economically relevant to south africa as bosnia is to boston but to many americans , it is all africa none of the big pension funds are involved in africa , mr allison said the trustees and consultants get off the plane in johannesburg , and they 're shocked that there s an airport , and you do n't have to run with lions chasing you mr allison , whose company is owned by africanamericans bent on opening that psychological frontier , believes the money will come , and so do many businesssavvy south africans they point to south africa s sophisticated business infrastructure and natural bounty they say the main problem is that big institutional money moves like sludge but so far , it is still an open question whether mr mandela will ever get the kind of investment he needs , the kind that produces exports , growth and jobs the foreign capital inflow so far has consisted mainly of bargainseekers buying shares in longestablished companies listed on the johannesburg stock exchange american and british investment houses set up funds to buy south african stocks and bonds , and at the turn of the year net purchases jumped to 1094 billion rand , or 2996 million at current exchange rates , more than double the 440 million rand , or 1205 million , in december , but since april more foreign money has flowed out than in , a trend that brokers attribute partly to a worldwide anxiety about stocks , but partly to cold feet about south africa with great fanfare , dozens of american companies , led by computer and software concerns and including such brandname giants as pepsico and sara lee , have opened offices here but most are either reacquiring subsidiaries that they sold during sanctions , or they are essentially storefronts for goods made elsewhere they represent little new investment and few new jobs the us companies have historically been there to market to south africa , said meg voorhes of the investor responsibility research center , a washingtonbased group that monitors trade with south africa they can serve the 40millionstrong market in south africa with goods produced elsewhere south africa is not seen as a major sourcing point for exporting globally with good reason , said robert a j irwin , chairman of asa ltd , an investment company that buys south african shares , mainly in gold mining mr irwin recently spent a week here making rounds of bankers , businessmen and officials , investigating other opportunities , and left a skeptic i cannot figure out what south africa offers to the outside investor in the way of an opportunity to create jobs , he said , citing as its most notable attraction abundant raw materials neither fish nor fowl south africa , he continued , is neither fish nor fowl it does not fit the profile of other emerging economies , but neither does it have the skills and industrial technology base to compete with developed countries south korea and taiwan , for example , built their muscular economies by exporting cheap clothing and working up to more sophisticated goods , a route that china is now taking but that route starts with cheap labor in south africa , the manufacturing work force is heavily unionized , costing employers almost 5 an hour in total remuneration , double the cost in mexico or brazil and eight times the cost in china productivity is comparatively low a recent outbreak of labor unrest has been an unnerving reminder to investors and to mr mandela that workers have not necessarily bought the new government s message of restraint grocery clerks , court employees and construction trades are on strike at the moment recently , strikers shut the country s largest casino resort , sun city on monday , 19 , 000 auto workers stopped work for a day , and they are threatening a longer strike workers on strike
jimmy key was the picture of precision for five innings yesterday , operating like a human pitching machine put a coin in the slot and watch pitches hum around the strike zone they looked tantalizing until the tigers flailed and produced out after out this pitching machine was pretty clever mike moore was also effective for the first five innings yesterday , stifling the yankees in his plodding manner moore was the sloppy , untucked shirt to key s freshly pressed suit , but he made the yankees look as futile as the tigers through five innings , neither had surrendered a hit and that was remarkable since only one double nohitter has ever been thrown in major league history but that hitless routine changed drastically in the top of the sixth , when detroit destroyed new york s pitching machine after key s dabbling with the strike zone became dangerous the tigers humbled key and scored four runs on travis fryman s bloop single and mickey tettleton s threerun homer into a tricky wind in surging to a 52 victory at yankee stadium the two hits that doomed key occurred after he had drifted behind in the count although moore also lost his nohitter and shutout in the sixth , he did not lose the game he trudged through seven innings , striking out none , walking four and halting the yanks on three hits and their lowest run total of the season as detroit won its first game and new york lost its first it was a frustrating afternoon for the yankees as moore , who as a mariner struck out 16 in a game at the stadium in 1988 , dominated without ever whipping a third strike past a hitter mostly , i'm just trying to keep us in the game , said moore i did that today so did key , until the sloppy sixth his descent was rapid and somewhat unexpected because he had not lost in the month of april since 1990 for key , the answer was a hanging curveball that tettleton rocked for a threerun homer there are things that you ca n't do with this team and one of them is letting up the threerun homer , said key , who was 90 with a 210 earned run average in his last 14 april starts i made a bad pitch and i paid for it the yankees paid for all their mistakes yesterday , like luis polonia s mad dashes on the bases that halted two rally attempts and their inability to exploit a pitcher who took a career 712 record and 534 era against them into the contest still , the yankees did not score off moore until pat kelly started the sixth with a double and scored on polonia s looper to short left to make it 41 the sixth inning fizzled because polonia gambled and lost as he tried for a double , a questionable move with wade boggs , don mattingly and danny tartabull due up of course , with a fourrun lead , we would rather not have him thrown out at second , said manager buck showalter , who watched polonia steal second twice and get caught trying to swipe third in the game that s the way luis plays the game we 'll make some adjustments as we go along the nohit suspense ended for key when tony phillips led off the sixth by rapping a single to right field three batters and two outs later , detroit had runners on first and second , and key needed one more out to push himself into the seventh he did not look like a machine anymore the count to travis fryman moved to 32 and key tried to catch the outside corner with a changeup , but fryman poked the ball into right field for a soft single to score phillips and make it 10 the situation deteriorated further for the yankees when key , after a brief visit from the pitching coach billy connors , allowed tettleton s homer on a high , 20 curveball it was tettleton s fifth homer in 45 atbats off key and it gave the tigers a fourrun lead key s brilliant beginning had dissipated into a 108pitch afternoon that ended after the sixth inning and eventually ended in a rare april defeat he s not going to give into you , tettleton said it was probably the pitch he wanted , but the location was n't where he wanted it neither was the result inside pitch luis polonia , who has walked in five of his last eight atbats , was able to outwalk most reporters after his trying day on the bases explaining in midstep that he had to go to the airport , polonia left the clubhouse while reporters were interviewing jimmy key paul o'neill hit his first homer of the season in the seventh off mike moore key is 174 lifetime at yankee stadium scott kamieniecki ended a streak of 18 straight starts by making a threeinning relief appearance buck showalter s statement that left field is not a strict platoon situation should be tested today because polonia \( 5 for 17 , 294 \) has a better lifetime average than randy velarde \( 111 , 091 \) against detroit s starter , david wells photo the tigers' mike moore walked four , struck out none and limited the yankees to three hits in seven innings \( michelle v agins the new york times \) \( pg 7 \)
moscow , jan 10 three months after russia s last parliament came to a violent end , a newly elected federal assembly starts work on tuesday amid signs that it , too , will become mired in confrontation and political grandstanding with its two chambers housed in separate buildings , even the openingday ceremonies will take place on a divided note president boris n yeltsin is to give a brief welcoming address to the federation council , or upper house , while prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin is to speak to the lower chamber , or state duma , across town without a permanent home to call its own , and with a role that has been greatly diminished by the adoption of a new russian constitution , the new parliament begins life with a grudge the strong showing in elections last month by the ultranationalist party of vladimir v zhirinovsky , together with the communist party and its ally , the agrarian party , is certain to produce a hardcore antiyeltsin opposition that on certain issues could command as many as 40 percent of the lower chamber s 450 votes gaidar leads biggest party their weight will be counterbalanced by various reformist factions , centered around russia s choice , led by first deputy prime minister yegor t gaidar and constituting the lower house s largest party , with 94 seats but simple arithmetic alone cannot predict the collective will of the chamber , where dozens of members 20 percent by one estimate are independents , elected from 225 singlemember districts with uncertain mandates and shifting loyalties among their number are several of russia s bestknown firebrands like aleksandr g nevzorov , the television show host who was repeatedly kicked off the st petersburg channel for his virulent antiyeltsin language mr yeltsin and his team are ready for confrontation today at the kremlin , his chief spokesman , vyacheslav v kostikov , appeared together with aleksandr n yakovlev , the new head of russian television , at a news conference and produced new documents on the bolshevik crackdown against the kronstadt rebellion of 1921 , in what was a clear attempt to discredit the presentday communist party yeltsin cuts offices since the elections last month , mr yeltsin himself has shown little interest in preparliamentary maneuvers today , on the eve of the opening of parliament , he issued a decree reorganizing the government cutting down the number of ministries from 30 to 23 , reducing the number of deputy prime ministers from 9 to 4 and instituting other measures that many members of the new parliament feel are their prerogative to review at least the fact is that the lower chamber has only limited power under the new constitution even its lawmaking powers are braked by the upper federation council , made up of two representatives from each of russia s 89 regions and territories although most attention has focused on the confrontations building up in the lower house , political experts said this week that mr yeltsin was likely to find the federation council not much more obedient to his wishes a majority of the new council s members are holdovers from an earlier council that last summer opposed mr yeltsin s moves to rein in the growing powers of russia s regions none of the contradictions that date from those times have been eliminated , the daily newspaper izvestia said today

enacted in the aftermath of the watergate scandal in the 1970 s , allows a special prosecutor from outside the government to be appointed by a threejudge panel of federal judges to investigate accusations of crimes by high government officials thirteen different special prosecutors were appointed under the law from the carter administration through the bush administration but the statute expired in 1992 when an extension was opposed by president george bush and blocked by republicans in congress mr clinton made his support of the law an issue in the 1992 presidential campaign and with a democrat now in the white house , many republicans in congress have had what representative jack brooks , democrat of texas , today called a change of heart the new law will probably mean a change of status for robert b fiske jr , the special prosecutor in the whitewater case he was appointed by attorney general janet reno , who promised him independence , but technically he remains an official of the justice department ms reno is expected to ask the panel of judges to name an independent counsel in the whitewater case although the measure that cleared congress today would not require the judges to pick mr fiske , they are expected to do so he is an accomplished prosecutor who has republican as well as democratic support , and it would make little sense to choose someone who would have to start from scratch as a practical matter , this would probably not mean much to mr fiske all his subpoenas would remain in force , and all the testimony he has taken would still be valid fee reimbursement allowed but it would allow clinton administration officials who are investigated by mr fiske but not indicted to apply to the panel to have their legal fees reimbursed by the government they must show that they would not have had the expenses if it had not been for the independent counsel and none of the costs they incurred before his appointment as independent counsel would be eligible for reimbursement the president s fees in the whitewater case could easily exceed 2 million presidential assistants said monday that they were planning to ask americans to contribute to a legal defense fund for the president the white house said today that no final decision had been made about the guidelines for such a fund but even if he is entitled to some reimbursement , mr clinton may need additional funds , not only because he has highpriced lawyers but also because none of the costs he has borne up till now can be reimbursed in their report accompanying the legislation , the lawmakers suggested that the judges approve reimbursement at a rate no higher than 40 to 75 an hour mr clinton is paying his lawyers 400 or more an hour such reports are considered by judges but do not have the force of law disclosure of evidence the measure would also open the way for public disclosure of evidence compiled by mr fiske by law , he cannot disclose material collected by a grand jury except in connection with a criminal proceeding but the panel of judges can and often has made such information public after investigations by other independent counsels this , for instance , was the basis for lawrence e walsh s final report on his investigation of the irancontra scandal in the senate today , a resolution officially setting the scope of hearings in the whitewater case next month was approved on a straight partyline vote , 54 to 44 two democratic senators were absent mr clinton and his wife , hillary , were partners in the whitewater development company with james b mcdougal , the proprietor of a failed arkansas savings and loan institution mr fiske is investigating whether the institution , the madison guaranty savings and loan association , improperly funneled money into whitewater , a real estate venture along the white river in arkansas the whitewater hearings will be limited to these matters , which will be covered in a preliminary report by mr fiske to be issued before the end of june the contacts this year between white house staff members and treasury department officials over a possible criminal investigation of madison guaranty the death of vincent w foster jr , who was the deputy white house counsel the way the white house handled material found in mr foster s office after his death , including a file on the clintons' whitewater venture wider inquiry is blocked republican efforts to broaden the scope of the inquiry were once more rejected by the democratic majority in the house , 239 democrats , 77 republicans and the one independent , bernard sanders of vermont , voted to reinstate the independent counsel law five democrats and 100 republicans voted against it under the new law , the attorney general could ask the panel of judges to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate members of congress if the attorney general found it was in the public interest to do so the old law limited investigations by independent counsel to officials in the executive branch the outcome of today s vote was never in doubt as a result the debate was perfunctory , with none of the fierce arguments that have taken place over the issue in past years proponents argued that it was simply common sense and responsible practice to have high government officials investigated by a special prosecutor free of the conflicts of interest that might face politically appointed prosecutors the opponents mainly complained that the measure put no limits on what independent counsels could spend in the course of their investigations special waiver for fiske the matter of reimbursement for legal fees seems to have been a byproduct that was never discussed by those who drafted the law the senate initially approved the bill last year the house passed its version in february , shortly after mr fiske was appointed by ms reno a conference committee reconciling the differences between the two versions realized that the way both bills were written , mr fiske would not be eligible to become an independent counsel that is because he was technically a justice department official , and the bills required that independent counsels come from the outside the government so the conferees wrote a special waiver that would allow mr fiske to become an independent counsel but they also retained provisions that for years have allowed officials investigated by independent counsels but not indicted to ask the panel of judges to approve reimbursement for their legal expenses many officials in the reagan and bush administrations had their legal costs

people who pay new york state taxes and were lucky enough to get refunds this year are finding a little something extra in their envelopes from the state department of finance and taxation inside is an orangeandwhite letter signed by ralph nader , the consumer advocate , with this message new yorkers are paying some of the highest electric and phone bills in the united states , but now you can do something about it ! the letter goes on to provide information about how to join an advocacy group called the citizens utility board , which represents consumers before the public service commission whenever telephone or power companies ask for an increase in rates the price of membership a contribution of 10 , 15 or even 20 officials and employees of at least one major utility , the nynex corporation , say the state should not be mailing out information about a board to fight utility rate requests , and they have organized a campaign to fight it and that has led officials of the consumer board to question whether nynex is using rate payers' money to try to undermine the consumer group before it can get off the ground 20 , 000 members required the information about how to join the citizens utility board , which is also included in some letters from the department of motor vehicles , is being sent out as a result of a 1991 action by gov mario m cuomo to set up a group to give consumers a voice in rate negotiations robert ceisler , executive director of the board , said that its bylaws , which had to be approved by the public service commission , say the board cannot represent utility customers before the commission until it has 20 , 000 members , to insure that it is speaking for a representative group of new york rate payers the public service commission has given the board five years to recruit members if fewer than 20 , 000 people join by december 1998 , the group must disperse and membership dues will be returned six million messages the first inserts were mailed in refund checks beginning in february , mr ceisler said by the end of december more than six million messages will have reached people from the tax and motor vehicle departments mr ceisler said that more than 13 , 000 people have joined and that more than 100 , 000 in membership dues have been collected mr nader , the consumer advocate , originally proposed setting up groups to give consumers a voice in rate disputes about 20 years ago , and a handful of states set them up blair horner , legislative director of the new york public interest research group , said that in 1982 , as utility rates soared in new york , mr cuomo first set out to create a utility board specifically modeled on groups in illinois and wisconsin , where information about the boards was included in utility bills a voice for the people i think his motivation to fight for the board was a genuine concern that people have a voice in their government , mr horner said but the legislature and the courts rebuffed the governor s initial efforts to set up a board and let people know about it through information in utility bills in 1991 the governor signed an executive order creating a citizens utility board and giving it the right to send out information in mail from state agencies this resulted in the mailings in the tax refunds and the protests from the nynex employees 'i need your help' after hearing from the workers , a nynex vice president , barbara patton , sent all 38 , 000 employees of the company a letter that said it is my opinion that the attack should not go unanswered i need your help to get a message to mario cuomo a sample outrage letter accompanied the letter from ms patton utilize all of it or none of it , but please write the governor , ms patton urged about 800 nynex employees mailed letters to governor cuomo s office in response to ms patton s letter , said mark marchand , director of public relations for nynex we do n't disagree with the existence of the board , mr marchand said we do n't disagree with the creation of any group we do disagree with what they have said to our customers 'outrageous and paranoid' mr ceisler , executive director of the utility board , said he was unhappy about what nynex was doing we want the psc to investigate whether nynex is billing customers for the costs of this outrageous and paranoid letterwriting campaign , he said they are trying everything they could to kill us before we get our 20 , 000 of the 4 , 167 , 000 inserts mailed in refund checks , about 16 people wrote letters inquiring about the inserts , said paul rickard , a spokesman for the department of taxation and finance most people just wrote or called because the inserts were something new and different , mr rickard said photo the back flap of a business reply envelope alerted new yorktaxpayers who got refunds to a message about a consumeradvocacy group
anthony dowell , the royal ballet s director , persuasively banished the ghosts of the royal past in his provocative and ultimately satisfying new production of the sleeping beauty the disordered and flamboyant world that the designer maria bjornson revealed at the metropolitan opera house this month was embodied in a clash of compositional forms the set s perspective was deliberately distorted a whirl of circular shapes within a huge oval frame drew the eye upward , while boldly tilted pillars at the sides closed in on the choreography s traditional diagonals and symmetry it was all a far cry from the harmonious and spacious sleeping beauty with which the company and its radiant princess , margot fonteyn , first conquered new york in 1949 what mr dowell seemed to say with this radically redesigned version of the royal s signature piece is that it is time to move on , to break with legends that are enviable but also a burden one can sympathize with this need for exorcising familiar images the royal has staged more than one sleeping beauty since ninette de valois s 1946 production , designed by oliver messel , became the company s touchstone but none has departed so definitively from the nostalgia that keeps both dancers and audiences attached to past models the royal is not currently at a new peak , but it is a more vigorous and exciting company than was last here in 1991 technique is inconsistent in the ranks , although it can be dazzling in principals like tetsuya kumakawa , deborah bull and the muchimproved viviana durante classical style achieves a superb purity when needed , making for the best bluebird pas de deux of any beauty seen here in years new talent is visibly on the rise with dancers like sarah wildor , gillian revie , belinda hatley and muriel valtat above all , there is the royal s fabulous ensemble spirit , all the more striking in that the troupe has recently absorbed a number of foreign dancers with diverse training one of the season s remarkable aspects was , indeed , the attention paid to stylistic detail in both dancing and acting the result was the kind of rich performance seen in works as different as mayerling , kenneth macmillan s flawed dancedrama of 1978 , and the dream , the 1962 gem by frederick ashton that shared an uneven triple bill the same sense of unity allowed the new sleeping beauty to succeed as a spectacle , despite the lack of an ideal aurora ms valtat , an elegant unknown , came within hailing distance of a wellrounded interpretation , and ms durante made up in technical brilliance for her inexplicable stern demeanor but others gave more studied performances as aurora , a failing that has been common in the postfonteyn era at the royal more spontaneity would have been welcome from leanne benjamin \( outstanding in contemporary roles \) and miyako yoshida , a wellschooled guest from the birmingham royal ballet \( the royal s sister troupe \) it is doubtful that things would have been different if the royal s bestknown ballerinas had been present darcey bussell and lesley collier were injured , and sylvie guillem , a principal guest artist , had commitments elsewhere the 19thcentury classics are not ms bussell s or ms guillem s strong suit the strength of this beauty is that it does not depend on a single dancer it is true , a perfect aurora would recall that the focus of the 1890 petipatchaikovsky classic is on a young girl s awakening to maturity and love but like all tchaikovsky ballets , this one deals with good triumphing over evil the idea is the work s larger theme and is meant to be expressed as it was grandly in this production through an allegory on an operahouse scale ms bjornson s designs , eschewing the usual references to french palatial style , initially came as a shock the dominant form is an oval frame through which many of the dancers enter this opening centers the action , although in the prologue and in the awakening scene it carries the eye up to an implied cupola there is a sense that the dancers are viewed within a glass paperweight \( snow even falls in act 2 , the hunt scene \) in that act , the oval closes down partly as if it were an eye and becomes a cave with icicles , through which the prince and the lilac fairy sail in search of the sleeping aurora in short , ms bjornson and mr dowell have created a theatrical fantasy rather than a picture full of historical fidelity ms bjornson s imagination sets the action in the prologue and act 1 in a freeform view of the 18th century mr dowell provides marvelous touches four little pages flee in terror when carabosse , the wicked fairy , enters she is obviously from the nether world and is wheeled out from under a banquet table , upon which her minions prance and eat the whirlpool of balustrades within the oval in act 1 suggests a scene that is only slightly more joyous than the muted prologue nonetheless , the four princes who vie for aurora s hand are 18thcentury gallants in a typical detail , they turn to aurora s friends and courteously plead for the flowers they will give her in the rose adagio by contrast , the men attending the prince who will wake her up after her 100year nap are regency fops who are especially nasty to the prince s old tutor the costumes at this winter hunt are 1810 period dress between the acts the ballet has moved from the 18th century to the 19th and not , as usual , from the 17th to the 18th aurora s awakening signals a change of seasons , from winter in act 2 to spring , and may explain the recurrent sun imagery at her wedding in act 3 even her father turns up looking like the sun king a conventional sleeping beauty often ends with allusions to the court of louis xiv but louis xiv after 1810 is an anachronism the wedding here is actually a theatrical conceit , a masked ball \( with plenty of fairytale characters who look like frogs , bulls , bears , wolves \) or a performance in a tiny court theater the apotheosis features the silhouetted lilac fairy and her suite surrounded by cardboard clouds choreographically , mr dowell has played it safe , preserving petipa s famous set pieces and a few additions by ashton and macmillan from past productions , while adding a bit of his own , like the male gold solo in the divertissement the male soloists were excellent in this act but none of the princes was ever as consistent as his aurora despite individual qualities , zoltan solymosi , irek mukhamedov and jonathan cope as well as jose manuel carreno and stuart cassidy \( i missed bruce sansom \) all ran out of stamina or technique no such problems were evident in the works created specifically for the current company in tombeaux , david bintley pays tribute to ashton s lyrical brand of neoclassicism but also evokes an allegory about a hero conquering fear or inner turbulence the protagonist steps out of the mouth of a sculptured lion s head in an enchanted wood and resolves his crisis in a pas de deux with a ballerina like the corps , she has some unexpected drops to the floor the choreography is exquisite and clear by contrast , the judas tree , the last ballet macmillan completed before his death in 1992 , offered a muddled and fragmented tale of brutality and death on a london construction site nonetheless , macmillan , hinting at a nonlinear structure , was trying something new like the sleeping beauty , the premieres were part of the royal ballet s surprisingly experimental season photo a scene from the royal s new sleeping beauty at themetropolitan

toronto , nov 15 so what exactly is the date to announce the cancellation of the national hockey league season \? thanksgiving \? christmas \? new year s day \? valentine s day \? would april fools' day be appropriate \? obviously , if we 're not playing hockey in january , there s not going to be a season , commissioner gary bettman said today as he left a meeting of general managers whether or not the deadline is dec 1 , dec 2 , dec 10 , that s something that you 've got to deal with the schedule on , and what other surrounding circumstances have to be dealt with so as we get closer , everybody s going to know it at least one executive was more emphatic glen sather , the president and general manager of the edmonton oilers , said deadlines were discussed in the session pick the date , and if there is no deal , there is no season , sather said i am of the firm belief that bob goodenow will not make a deal until there is a concrete day and time that says , 'if the deal is not done , there is no season' we have to have a deadline , not only for us , but for the fans let s get a date and put it in steel a similar idea was proposed by patrick roy , the montreal goalie , only he suggested that the date be set by the union bettman , who was scheduled to attend the hall of fame induction ceremonies tonight , said he expected to negotiate again with goodenow , the executive director of the players association , perhaps on wednesday before returning to new york a quarter of the 84game schedule has been lost , although the league has formally canceled only 14 games earlier in the lockout , which began oct 1 , bettman said a schedule of 40 to 50 games would be necessary for a legitimate season before the stanley cup playoffs , and he said the playoffs could be extended until the end of june , more than three weeks longer than originally planned because players would need at least two weeks of training before beginning the season , it would appear that the realistic point of no return for these negotiations would be after the first of the year , more than a month away there are those who say it s deadlines that bring a deal about , bettman said clearly , i think we all agree that we 're running out of time we 're not running out of time in the next 48 or 72 hours , but time is getting short the general managers were pessimistic after the daylong session , attended by the entire command structure from league headquarters one of few who left early was phil esposito of tampa , who carried his suitcase out the door saying i 've got to play golf tomorrow earlier , he said if you 're going to be a union and i was in the union for 19 years then you 've got to have an agreement or do n't be a stinking union if we do n't get something within the next two or three weeks , sayonara , as my japanese partners say neil smith , president of the rangers , called the meeting pretty grim and said there was really no indication of any progress in the negotiations does he think the owners would scrap an entire season \? if they have to , they will , smith said i'm very worried about that he said league management is sincere and is n't just trying to win and hardball the players cliff fletcher of toronto said , everything is becoming more critical because time is passing mike keenan of st louis said , there has to be an agreement made here , hopefully sooner than later asked if the executives were pressuring bettman to make a deal , keenan replied , there was n't the sense of urgency to a point where we wanted to do something that would not be correct for the industry right now pat quinn of vancouver was asked about the latest proposal by the players , which would accept some cutbacks in the contract rights of rookies none of the general managers like it , it does n't address the problems we 've been talking about for 10 months , quinn said pierre lacroix , firstyear general manager of the quebec nordiques , said he expected the league to officially cancel 10 more games in the next few days i'm pessimistic , he said bettman announced today that league employees making more than 30 , 000 a year will get a 10 percent wage reduction those below 30 , 000 will be cut 5 percent in addition , there will be some layoffs at league headquarters , bettman said
columbus , miss it was august , when this part of the country sags under a slathering of humidity and heat t scott berry was up the road from here at a dealers show in tupelo , displaying some of the furniture he makes he was in the back of a warehouse , not doing much of anything , when he got a call from the desk a man was there to see him so i go out and there s this guy standing there , mr berry recalled i almost threw him out , but i said , ok , i 'll talk to him three months later , at the invitation of the chinese man who came to call , mr berry , a descendant of arkansas mule traders and mississippi furniture makers , was in beijing trying to figure out how to work china into plans for his family company , the johnston tombigbee furniture manufacturing company he returned with a deal to have the chinese make chairs for him the first shipment will arrive next month entering the global market i was trying to move as fast as possible , said mr berry , 40 , a touslehaired redhead who charges like a halfback through his vast factories , clambering over conveyor belts , scrutinizing racks of rough wood bedposts and calling out to many of his 1 , 000 employees by name it could be the future here in columbus , a town of 23 , 800 people , of whitecolumned antebellum mansions and a main street languorous in its pedestrian traffic , the global economy seems to intrude in a scattering of japanese cars , a handful of chinese restaurants and not much else but for johnston tombigbee , the future probably lies as much in china in cities like dalian , in what used to be manchuria as it does in america s southern heartland china , with asia s fastestgrowing economy , has aggressively sought out international markets for its growing industries , including furniture chinese business officials are diligently trolling the waters of trade shows , scrutinizing merchandise , buttonholing manufacturers , looking for deals and furniture makers like mr berry are often obliging in an effort to lower manufacturing costs and increase profitability mr berry s new chinese partner , a man named yang yijian , who he said preferred to be called james , quoted johnston tombigbee prices for the chairs that were twothirds lower than what mr berry pays in countries like brazil i said to myself , where is cheap labor and massive amounts of raw material \? mr berry said i thought it was brazil , but now it looks like it s china although taiwan has exported furniture to the united states for several years , china has made a big push only in the last year , according to bruce plantz , the executive editor of fdm furniture design and manufacturing , a trade publication for the first nine months of 1993 , furniture imports from china were worth 225 million , up 56 percent over the corresponding period of 1992 and combined imports from china , malaysia , indonesia , singapore and the philippines were up 52 percent from 1992 , to 687 million during 1993 , the value of the united states wholesale residential furniture market was about 18 billion , according to mr plantz for johnston tombigbee , the cheap labor and materials in china are the backbone of an expansion strategy with reported sales of 40 million last year , johnston tombigbee ranks 139th among the top 300 makers of furniture in america , according to fdm but mr berry says he intended to move up the ladder by expanding into higherend furniture , which he has started to make in honduras and the philippines , and by reducing the number of parts in other finished products to make them easier to produce in china i see my furniture being made mostly of foreignmade parts , mr berry said i would say that foreign countries like china will play a big part of it with all the growing government intervention in manufacturing , whether it s the epa , osha , workers' comp , we 'll get to the point where we 'll be an assembler and packager that s what will happen a company s revival seven years ago , johnston tombigbee had all but collapsed , largely the result of family warfare and not a small bit of neglect and weak management , mr berry said he had quit the family business i had all i could stand , he recalled and was wandering around brazil , looking for someone to make some furniture he could sell in the united states then his wife called i told him the company was going to be sold , ruth berry said , and i told him to get home and fix it it was worse than moribund mr berry hurried back to columbus and the shards of the family business the factories , including the original brick factory , were silent there were no orders , no piles of lumber , not a piece of furniture and 1 , 000 people were out of work it was pretty scary , mr berry said , but when you 're 34 , 35 , you 're bold boldness , in this case , meant three plans for the business , ranging from liquidation of remaining assets , to a partial restart of the factories coupled with some importing of furniture , to a complete startup of all the factories we did a fullblown massive restart , he said , and that s where we are now
darakeh , iran it was not yet 9 in the morning and mehdi nazemi , with a full day s work in front of him , had broken into a heavy sweat it has been bad all morning , he said girls in baseball caps , covered with makeup , coming up here without proper head scarves and the boys use words i ca n't repeat and strip off their shirts it is a dirty , lonely job but we must be ready to die for god each weekend several thousand young iranian men and women take off for the small village of darakeh , at the northwest corner of teheran , to climb the sharp , rocky peaks that surround the city and to escape the rigorous restrictions imposed by the islamic state and each weekend the members of governmentbacked islamic popular militias like the bassij send their fittest followers to make sure that iranian youths enjoy the fresh air and the hike , but not each other militia members hide in bushes along the sides of the trail and pounce on groups of teenagers boys dive from rocks into the pools bare chested and scamper up the rocky slopes as panting militiamen try to catch them girls tuck baseball caps under their head scarves and apply makeup and fingernail polish once they have passed checkpoints and on the tops of some jagged peaks , girls brazenly strip off their required baggy cloaks and black head scarves to have picnics with their boyfriends facing defiance by the young men and women , many of whom come from westernized middle or upperclass families , the militias have set up detention houses in the mountains where they try to teach proper islamic behavior to smirking teenagers caught defying the rules and for repeat offenders , the militias keep buses at the base of the park to ferry young men and women to detention houses that hold them overnight despite the best efforts of volunteers like mr nazemi , the park has become the biggest pickup spot in teheran some boys spend the evening before they come here copying their phone numbers on dozens of slips of paper so they can hand them out to prospective girlfriends a few said they had forged identification documents to make it look as if their girlfriends were their sisters in desperation , the militias recently began to use megaphones at the base of the park to warn young iranians that if they did not stop misbehaving , access to the park could be restricted to allow girls and boys to visit only on alternate weeks but few of the youths appear ready to redirect their interests to the slopes and streams this is the only fun left to us in this country , said 17yearold nahid azaripour , who was being sent home for wearing a forbidden white head scarf and if women are n't allowed up here , the boys wo n't come either this is the last place boys and girls can go out and be together romances are , not surprisingly , made in these hills edris shafeyian , like many young men , met his girlfriend , nargees takteherani , on the mountain path she kept falling down , he said and i had to help her the winding trail leads past nine openair restaurants the small restaurants , supplied by pack mules , sell soft drinks , kebabs , buckets of fresh raspberries , walnuts , sour cherries and dried fruit rolls water cascades along concrete channels through the restaurants , sometimes in small , manmade waterfalls , and then flows back out into the streams , combining with the mountain air to offer a cool relief from the sweltering summers in teheran the restaurants are mobbed by scores of young men and women , many of whom huddle and flirt in open defiance of the rules imposed by the government life is so boring until we get here , said roja ghadaakpour , eating a red popsicle it s a catastrophe and look at the guys around here , she said , with a mock grimace that provoked howls of laughter none of these crazy boys are good enough for me the adventurous fill their knapsacks with forbidden western music cassettes , blankets and food , and head up the sides of the mountains if they hike for three or four hours they can usually outdistance the militias , who rarely make forays into the outer reaches of the park we have learned how to keep away from them and live a normal life in secret , said amir parviz khorsandi , an 18yearold student who sometimes sleeps overnight in the mountains it requires a bit of walking , but it s worth it on the summit of one peak , a young man and his girlfriend , both of whom insisted on anonymity , looked as if they were performing a scene from the poetry of the ancient persian master omar khayyam she sat under a tree , her hair flowing freely down her back , dressed in white jeans and a blue halter top the young man , his head in her lap , was eating pistachios she was cracking and dropping into his mouth these are the only moments we feel free in this country , she said and the freedom is all the more delicious because they try so hard to take it away from us but the imposition of rigid islamic behavior can often be as trying for the militia members as for the young renegades when we see couples go up the peaks , we must follow to make sure they are brothers and sisters or are married , mr nazemi said but all this climbing , all this walking , is hard by the end of the day i collapse photo the high , rugged country above teheran lures young iranians by the thousands who go to escape islamic rules , and often

ernest hollings , chairman of the senate commerce committee , declared yesterday that he will keep the senate from voting this session on the trade accord that the clinton administration signed with more than 100 other countries last april in marrakesh , morocco this is a craven and destructive bow to the demands of textile firms in his home state of south carolina , who fear competition from abroad under the accord if mr hollings is successful , as he well might be , he would thereby delay and possibly block for good approval of a bill that would add 200 billion a year to the us economy mr hollings is the main culprit , but the white house was his enabler it dallied in getting the legislation to congress then it rejected advice to sidestep mr hollings s committee the danger is that the senate vote could be delayed until next year , or longer delay , in turn , could jeopardize approval here and abroad the legislative rules that govern the trade accord are known as fast track which requires congress to vote quickly and without amendment under the rules , mr hollings s committee has 45 days to deliberate before sending the bill to the floor but the 45day period did not begin until tuesday , when the administration delivered its bill to congress , and congress is scheduled to break for the election campaign in nine days the administration took months to settle upon ways to pay for the bill it spent precious weeks fighting , unsuccessfully , for a provision to apply fast track to future trade deals by the time the trade bill arrived at mr hollings s door , he could put off a vote past the end of the session in effect nullifying fast track even as late as tuesday , however , the administration could have run around mr hollings by removing two nonessential provisions from its bill , thereby denying the commerce committee jurisdiction but the administration was not certain the strategy would work and it feared alienating the powerful chairman with the benefit of hindsight , the white house seems to have erred if the trade bill is put off until next year , it might not qualify for fasttrack status because the statute expires at the end of the year that would open up the bill to dealbreaking amendments and parliamentary delay the loss would be large for 50 years , the us has led its partners through successful rounds of open trade accords , each one giving a powerful boost to the world economy the marrakesh accord would add trillions to world production by dismantling barriers to trade and investment the administration has possible ways , none good , to get the trade bill back on track it could pressure mr hollings , but that is likely to fail it could try a quick parliamentary maneuver to grab the bill away from the commerce committee , but the tactic is legally suspect and perhaps politically unrealistic the fallback tactic , mentioned yesterday by the president , is to keep the senate in session , at least officially , through elections so that the 45 days elapse and the senate is forced to vote after elections this strategy seems feasible , but it would also be ugly visibly displaying the administration s inability to push highpriority bills through a democratcontrolled congress just as voters prepare to cast their ballots this has been a brutal week for mr clinton the senate majority leader , george mitchell , buried health care reform , blaming obstructionist republicans now , a fellow democrat knocks down the administration s second most important initiative , free trade the administration unwittingly aided and abetted but mr hollings has singlehandedly jeopardized the economic fortunes of the world for some shortlived , parochial interests
jarratt , va , april 28 timothy w spencer died wednesday night in virginia s electric chair , becoming the first person executed in the united states for a conviction based on the dnamatching technology popularly known as genetic fingerprinting mr spencer , 32 , known here as the southside strangler , was convicted of raping and strangling four women over 11 weeks in 1987 none of the victims survived to identify him , no fingerprints were found and no one confessed then , dna tests linked semen from the crime scenes with mr spencer s blood the clock above mr spencer s head read 11 13 pm when he died at the greensville correctional center , 60 miles south of richmond less than a halfhour earlier , the united states supreme court rejected a lastminute appeal by mr spencer s lawyers for a retesting of the genetic evidence a court spokesman said justice harry a blackmun had cast the lone dissenting vote mr spencer s execution was expected to be the first of many such sentences imposed as a result of dna matching dna , the body s genetic code , can be used to tie suspects to crimes by matching strands of dna in samples of their blood to strands found in semen or blood stains found at the scene of a crime scientists have testified that such matches can be made with a high degree of certainty , estimating the odds of an error at one in millions such evidence , not introduced in united states courts until 1986 , is now in wide use and has been the basis of many capital convictions as is the case with most issues related to the death penalty , genetic fingerprinting attracts passionate debate it s peace of mind for prosecutors , said virginia s attorney general , james s gilmore 3d , who argues that dna matching minimizes the likelihood that innocent people will be executed but defense lawyers assert that the technology can be too complex for juries to understand and courtappointed lawyers often cannot afford the scientific expertise to challenge the prosecution scientists mr spencer s victims all were killed while he was living at a richmond halfway house after being released from a state prison where he had served three years of a 10year sentence for burglary the slayings took place on weekends when mr spencer was signed out of the halfway house mr spencer s case has also drawn attention because of a protest by the chief doctor of the virginia department of corrections , who took a vacation day on wednesday state law requires a doctor employed by the corrections department to be present when a death sentence is carried out but last month , the american medical association said its ethics code prohibited doctors from participating in executions it called on state licensing and disciplinary boards to treat participation in executions as grounds for active disciplinary proceedings , including license revocation
to the editor donald mccaig s gone to the dogs \( oped , aug 3 \) is a pitiful attempt to discredit the country s second oldest sports governing organization the american kennel club staff has not swelled thanks to technology and efficiencies , the staff has decreased from 442 in 1989 to 399 today registration has not declined it has steadily risen from 1 , 085 , 248 in 1983 to 1 , 422 , 559 in 1993 mr mccaig states , the club decided that tall labradors meet the breed standard but short labradors do n't sorry , mr mccaig , the height standard for labradors has n't changed in half a century then there s the very creative notion that the club s singleminded showdog orientation has created witless dogs however , the truth is that we sanction more performance events \( hunting tests , retriever trials , obedience trials , field trials and , yes , mr mccaig , herding trials \) than dog shows of the 11 , 000 events the club sanctions each year , only 1 , 400 are allbreed conformation dog shows none of these events are grounds for witless canines mr mccaig also charges that we are trying a hostile takeover of the cavalier king charles spaniel and the border collie , the breed he likes to call his the truth is that we have been lobbied by responsible breeders for the option of registering these breeds so they can participate in our events and take advantage of our services wayne r cavanaugh vice president , communications american kennel club new york , aug 12 , 1994
columbia university is unusual because it has one woman on the faculty in its physics department most universities in the united states have none last spring elena aprile , an associate professor of physics at columbia with a strong independent streak , was unanimously recommended for tenure i call it a miracle , she said i'm very proud but for now , at least , the miracle is on hold dr aprile said a recent change in administration has caused her bid for tenure to be delayed i am not satisfied with how things are going when i talked to a colleague about it he asked 'why do you need an increase \? you have a husband why do you have to rush \? ' it makes you think that the delay is connected to gender officially they say that s nonsense , but i ca n't help but wonder , if i were a man would it have happened faster \? eduardo macagno , dean of columbia s graduate school of arts and sciences , denied that any sex discrimination was involved and said the tenure decision was simply being held for further review dr aprile , though not happy about the delay , said she was confident she would eventually be approved but whatever the outcome , problems persist for women trying to break into science faculties particularly physics on campuses across the country women are more commonly represented in the humanities than the sciences , though even in humanities they do not match their male colleagues in number in 1989 , women accounted for about 30 percent of academics employed in humanities departments but they represented only 18 percent of those in the science and engineering departments regardless of academic field , women are less likely to receive tenure than their male counterparts , and on average are paid less betty vetter , the executive director of the commission on professionals in science and technology , says it takes women two to three years longer than men to receive tenure once they become eligible , and two to six years longer than men to become eligible in physics the discrepancies are even greater both male and female physicists describe hostile , demoralizing environments of male camaraderie and female isolation departmental faculty are largely male and are more likely to give him tenure and decide that she has n't quite proved herself yet , dr vetter says the american association of university professors says women comprised 30 percent of faculties in 1992 , but only 3 percent of physics faculties of 20 developed nations studied by the national research council of the national academy of sciences , america tied with south korea for the least women on physics faculties in france and italy women accounted for 23 percent in hungary nearly half the physics faculty were women american institute of physics data showed more than half of american physics faculties had no women the national research council has found that american women physicists consistently earn less than male counterparts and that the disparity increases as experience increases in 1992 a woman in physics earned 85 percent of a man s starting salary , one of the largest gaps in the sciences explanations for the paucity of women on american physics faculties range from the physiological to the sociological but the physiological factors are a matter of continuous dispute some scientists studying hormonal influences on brain function conclude that men as a group have innate neurological patterns of ability that tend to make them more capable in physics than women but others say these studies fail to prove significant brain differences or , if minor differences do exist , that they result in different aptitudes no encouragement female students have tended to score lower than males on standardized math aptitude tests still , one federal department of education study shows that when math scores were the same , nearly twice as many males pursued physics as females female students with a physics aptitude are often not encouraged or recruited sheila tobias , a political science lecturer , says women often do not possess the characteristics males feel are essential that is , a certain manner and sense of being consumed by science to the exclusion of all else women are often seen as outsiders , ms tobias said , and scientists are deeply prejudiced against noningroup types so the problem is n't women as women but women as a subset of the outgroup difficulty in getting tenure may itself discourage women from entering the field tenure is quite a subjective thing , said dr kay kinoshita , who left harvard last year for a tenured position at virginia polytechnic institute there is plenty of room for discrimination because it s based on pseudoobjective criteria , like the quality of the person s research not just the research , but its quality and since the advancement process can be nebulous , discrimination suits are rarely successful when women complain about sex bias , dr kinoshita said , they are perceived to be blaming some other inadequacy on that but as more women do manage to enter academic physics , some universities are noticing sexbias concerns and are trying to address them dr stewart smith , chairman of the physics department at princeton university , said , we know that the male students and faculty have not been supportive of women students and we are trying to raise the consciousness of our faculty to alleviate anxiety , dr smith said , physics professors are trying to keep courses as informal and interactive as possible i 've seen evidence of this many times in classes , he said , when , even if the man has the wrong answer he will just open his mouth and say it , whereas the woman will be more concerned and careful before participating even when she has the right answer conversely , dr smith said , it is hard for older male professors to advise young women about what they can expect and how to adjust , since he and many other senior staff members were students at a time when family roles and structures were dramatically different it makes it very difficult for older males to relate to the situations young women face and they probably do n't identify with us very well either setting a precedent dr aprile says one of her goals is to help establish a precedent for young girls like her daughter , susanna , who is 9 years old four years ago , when she was pregnant with her second daughter , giulia , she not only continued to teach throughout the pregnancy but , one month after the baby was born , she submitted a research proposal to develop a gammaray telescope for nasa she said the experience was grueling , but she took pride in achieving what no male colleague could i can put together a big proposal , which was accepted , and i can have a baby they should be jealous photo i call it a miracle , said dr elena aprile of columbia university , on her being recommedned for tenure but the miracle is on hold \( cm hardt for the new york times \)

sale totaled 134 million , and the evening contemporary sale brought in 121 million this is a fastgrowing segment of the market , said peter rathbone , who heads sotheby s department of american art and when you 're offering compelling works , it grows even faster christie s held its american paintings , drawings and sculpture sale last week in manhattan , too , but it was a considerably smaller affair , bringing in only 99 million , right at christie s low estimate of 99 million \( final prices include the auction house s commission , 15 percent of the first 50 , 000 and 10 percent of the rest estimates do not reflect the commission \) at both sales , top works brought top prices an unidentified american collector bought thomas moran s cliffs of green river , wyoming \( 1881 \) for 27 million at christie s not only was the price above its 2 million lower estimate it also set a record for the artist the painting was sold by william i koch , the investor and 1992 winner of the america s cup at sotheby s , childe hassam s poppies \( circa 1890 \) , a seascape with bright red poppies in the foreground , was bought by max berry , a washington collector , for 26 million , well above its 12 million to 14 million estimate seventeen paintings in sotheby s sale were marked property of a connecticut collector in its catalogue they were being sold by anne burnett marion , the wife of john marion , chairman of sotheby s in america many pieces in her group , which included works by such artists as hassam , maurice b prendergast , frederick carl frieseke and william merritt chase , were bought at sotheby s at the height of the market in the 1980 s many of them sold last week for considerably less than mrs marion paid for them , showing again that paintings that have been around auction rooms too recently generally do not fair so well as works that have not as for the bidders at the auctions , vance jordan , a manhattanbased dealer , said , there were a lot of new players in the market this season mr jordan added that the buyers were predominantly american collectors prices were not going crazy , he said it s a market for fresh material both dealers and collectors are eagerly awaiting sotheby s spring sale of american art , which is to include works from ibm s vast collection national gallery the national gallery of art in washington is smarting from a threepart television series called gallery of shame , which was broadcast last week by a local station , wjla \( channel 7 \) the program centered on a leaked copy of a report compiled last year by a team of consultants hired by the institution to examine the museum s facilities department , including the building s physical condition the confidential report contended that some of the museum s greatest works of art were at risk of serious damage both the report and the television series said the museum was grappling with such problems as leaking skylights , faulty humidifiers , a malfunctioning climate control system and a burst pipe in a storeroom the level of hyperbole and exaggeration by the media was astonishing , said earl a powell 3d , the national gallery s director they portrayed this report as new when , in fact , everything has been known and addressed none of this is a big mystery or a big secret in terms of due diligence , everything has been done there has been no damage to any work of art the museum did concede that the varnish on john singleton copley s watson and the shark had been damaged by a malfunctioning humidifier , but it said conservators had repaired it the museum also said it had addressed many of the building s problems , such as placing what mr powell called raincoats , or rubberized greenhouselike structures , over the building s skylights to make them watertight mr powell said that in early 1995 a 20 million , fouryear program to install new skylights would begin with the west building next year the museum plans to start a 3 million , twoyear project to install an electronic system to monitor heat and humidity congress has approved the system , mr powell said and last year it gave the institution 1 million to begin the skylight project the museum is awaiting approval for the rest representative ralph regula , republican of ohio , who is likely to be the next chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee that oversees the museum s budget , said in a written statement this week that he was very concerned about the issues raised by recent press reports when hearings of the appropriations subcommittee on the interior begin at the start of 1995 , he added , these issues will be fully examined as for channel 7 , gary wordlaw , its news director , said his station s report was journalistically sound the national gallery can make any claims they choose , but the fact is that the art sitting out there is being jeopardized mr powell replied i disagree that our art is at risk we have had very rare problems that have been addressed and until our new systems are in place , those that are there now are commensurate with most international museums morgan library the pierpont morgan library in manhattan announced this week that william m griswold had been made head of its department of drawings and prints mr griswold has been associate curator in the department of drawings and prints at the metropolitan museum of art for six and a half years he will join the morgan library on jan 30 the morgan s drawings collection , along with the metropolitan and the art institute of chicago , is one of the biggest collections in america , mr griswold said the attraction about the morgan s collection is that it is virtually uncatalogued and that s a wonderful challenge george goldner , who heads

washington , march 23 after voting against president clinton s original proposal to overhaul the nation s health care system , a congressional subcommittee today approved an alternative plan to achieve his goal of universal insurance coverage but supply a more modest package of medical benefits the subcommittee voted 6 to 5 to approve the alternative and send it to the full house ways and means committee for further action the alternative drops the idea of a payroll tax on all employers , which had been proposed by representative pete stark , the california democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee considering the legislation the payroll tax has been dropped and is not included in this substitute amendment , mr stark said in announcing a compromise on the alternative devised over the last few days in quiet negotiations among democrats on the panel , the house ways and means subcommittee on health moving to the center mr stark had earlier proposed an alternative to the ambitious health care proposal offered by mr clinton in october but mr stark had to make concessions to gain the support of some democrats on his panel like representative sander m levin of michigan , who said he would not vote for any bill with a general increase in payroll taxes the tax proposed by mr stark , equal to eighttenths of 1 percent of payroll , would have raised 24 billion a year but the democrats found other ways to raise the same amount of money , with a variety of new taxes and cutbacks in the growth of medicare , the federal health insurance program for the elderly the taxes are similar to those proposed by mr clinton the new proposal , like one devised by representative john d dingell of michigan , chairman of the energy and commerce committee , moves toward the center of the political spectrum in an effort to find votes for health legislation , which president clinton has described as his top priority the chairman of the full ways and means committee , dan rostenkowski , said today that his panel would pass a much more conservative bill than mr clinton has been seeking in an interview with the washington post , mr rostenkowski said that members of congress would not fall on their swords to pay for health insurance for all americans , even though mr clinton has said such universal coverage is a major goal earlier today , in a vote engineered by republicans to embarrass mr clinton , the ways and means subcommittee formally rejected the original version of the president s proposal democrats praised the president for initiating serious discussion of the nation s health care problems , but declined to vote for his bill the vote was four against and none in favor , with all seven democrats on the panel voting present by voting present , the democrats declined to take a position for or against the bill all four republicans on the panel voted against it representative bill thomas of california , the ranking republican on the panel , offered mr clinton s bill as a substitute to show that it had little support in the subcommittee first of many revisions the health care bill is likely to be rewritten many times , but the work of mr stark s subcommittee is significant because it is the first panel to vote on the issue these are the major provisions of the compromise devised by mr stark , mr levin and other democrats on the health subcommittee employers with more than 100 employees would have to provide their workers with a standard package of health benefits by jan 1 , 1996 other employers would have to buy such coverage starting on jan 1 , 1998 medicare beneficiaries would have to pay 20 percent of the cost of health services delivered to them in their own homes this would raise 6 billion a year no such payments are required under current law mr clinton proposed requiring a 10 percent payment companies with 1 , 000 or more employees could serve as their own insurers , but in that case , they would be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of payroll this would raise 9 billion a year under mr clinton s bill , companies could have served as their own insurers only if they had 5 , 000 or more employees states would have to maintain current levels of spending on health care for medicaid recipients and for people who get welfare benefits through programs financed entirely with state money states that help elderly people buy prescription drugs would also have to continue such spending at current levels taken together , these requirements would raise 7 billion a year state and local governments and their employees would all have to pay the payroll tax for medicare hospital insurance \( 29 percent , equally divided between employer and employee \) this would raise 1 billion a year by a vote of 6 to 5 , the subcommittee today also rejected a bill that seeks to increase access to health insurance and control costs by fostering competition by the same tally of 6 to 5 , the panel rejected a republican health care bill proposed by mr thomas and senator john h chafee of rhode island photo despite some indications of wavering by democrats in congress , president clinton is pushing his proposal for overhauling health care sister bernice coreil of the daughters of charity moved a platform she had used as mr clinton prepared to speak to 200 doctors and nurses at the white house yesterday with him were vice president al gore , hillary rodham clinton and dr jim haggerty \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
paris , july 28 after several months with virtually no movement in the bosnian war , the prospect of major changes , none of them to the liking of the west , is propelling the foreign authors of a peace plan to scramble to save it before the dire scenario they envision can unfold with the bosnian serbs again tightening their siege of sarajevo , western officials see an increasing likelihood that nato air power will be used against them , leading to serbian reprisals against united nations troops and a subsequent withdrawal of some peacekeepers with a major battle between a joint croatianmuslim force and the serbs in the posavina area of northern bosnia also looming , it is clear why the united states , russia , france , britain and germany are trying to revive their peace plan before their foreign ministers meet on saturday to decide how to respond to the serbs , who rejected the plan last week message to the serbs on monday , british diplomats trekked to the bosnian serbs' headquarters in pale and tried some coaxing , to no avail russia is also urging the president of serbia , slobodan milosevic , to press harder on his bosnian brothers the message to the bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , is simple just agree to the map , which offers 49 percent of bosnia and herzegovina to the serbs and 51 percent to the muslimdominated government everything else is negotiable except the existence of bosnia the government has accepted the plan , albeit with some ambivalence there is always a possibility the serbs will change their position and we will get an agreement , but it must be very slim , charles e redman , the united states envoy to the peace talks , said in a telephone interview if there is no agreement , the united states , russia and the major western european powers have committed themselves to tough measures against the serbs tightening trade sanctions is first , but few think that will make the serbs tremble so a swift use of nato air power to keep sarajevo and gorazde clear of serbian heavy weapons is expected but russia , which regards serbia as an ally , is not enthusiastic about nato air strikes and has insisted that talks with the serbs should continue , even after saturday the united states is opposed to any such talks until the serbs unequivocably accept the proposed map pacification , zone by zone apart from stricter policing of the weapons exclusion zones , the creation of a new zone around tuzla is also being considered , diplomats said we are pressing ahead with our planning for saturday , including more sanctions and stronger enforcement of exclusion zones , mr redman said we 'll be following through one way or the other but these plans , which are vulnerable to lastminute russian opposition , have major implications for the united nations peacekeeping force put simply , the soldiers are potential hostages for the serbs the commander of the force , lieut gen sir michael rose of britain , and the united nations secretary general , boutros boutrosghali , noting this danger , have suggested the force will have to be adapted or withdrawn planning a pullout all the planning has been done for a partial withdrawal to take place before any nato air strikes , said one senior united nations official if these people really want a war , we have to minimize our exposure on the ground in recent days , the serbs have made it clear that they are ready for an extension of the war they have fired on united nations planes , temporarily closing sarajevo airport and stopping the arrival of food aid on wednesday they closed the one land route out of sarajevo and they have threatened to cut off electricity and water supplies the message is that if the united nations , nato and the government want a wider war , it will be ruthless on the face of it , the government of president alija izetbegovic has opted for peace but its commitment appears paperthin as soon as the serbs in effect rejected the peace plan last week , president izetbegovic was declaring his own acceptance invalid fear of a war to come conversations with muslim commanders throughout bosnia suggest that they believe in a long war of attrition in which their superior numbers , their emergent alliance with the croats and an eventual end of the arms embargo against the government will eventually bring victory talk of peace makes them laugh the planning is going forward for a fall offensive , said one united states diplomat who recently visited croatian and muslim commanders in bosnia we could be facing a war in the fall that is a lot bigger than what we have seen that war , military analysts say , would probably focus on posavina , where the serbs must defend a narrow corridor linking serbia with serbheld territory in western bosnia in such a battle , the bosnians could benefit from a lifting of the arms embargo the united states , diplomats said , is close to feeling that all other options are exhausted , and opposition from france and britain could fade as soon as the number of their soldiers in bosnia was reduced maps of bosnia and herzegovina show the international proposal forareas of control and current areas of control
a week ago austin , tex , a liberal stronghold mobilized by conservative christians , voted almost 2 to 1 to repeal a measure that had extended insurance benefits to unmarried partners of city employees the next day , in a mother s day commencement address , hillary rodham clinton told the graduates of george washington university that no matter what a family unit looks like today , the family remains the essential ingredient of shaping our later lives instead of families looking like the cleavers on 'leave it to beaver , ' she had already explained , we have families that include testtube babies and surrogate moms mrs clinton was not suggesting that beaver would have looked any different had he been a testtube baby she was simply trying to make room for all the differing versions of what a family unit looks like today the emphatic vote in austin and the commencement remarks in washington may appear totally unrelated in fact , they both reflect the continuing turmoil about what norms regarding marriage and family american society ought to uphold in austin , for example , both sides agree that the city s domestic partnership measure was overturned not just because it seemed to lend official recognition to gay relationships but also because it did the same for unmarried heterosexual ones with some municipalities adopting domesticpartner policies and some repealing them , with the white house acclaiming family values but offering no definition of family , this debate stretches as far as the eye can see maybe it is backtobasics time before society can intelligently debate whether other relationships should qualify for the recognition and advantages traditionally reserved for married couples , perhaps it needs to review why marriage itself deserves special status perhaps people divided about whether the twoparent heterosexual family should remain the social norm should first ask this question why should there be any norm at all \? try this thought experiment simply do away with legal marriage entirely not that consenting adults would be forbidden to pledge their troth till death do them part , or to walk down the aisle , or to make whatever living arrangements they wished , with or without benefit of clergy but the state would have nothing to do with it the whole business would be strictly a private agreement it could be entered into without any stated conditions or it could be spelled out in the most detailed private contract , with provisions for child custody and possession of the microwave in case of dissatisfaction people could contract their way into heterosexual unions or homosexual ones , into monogamous ones or polygamous ones , into permanent ones or ones of any duration specified , renewable at will the only thing that would be essential is that the couple or the triad or the quintet agree freely there would be no such thing as joint incometax returns insurance companies could offer family policies but not assume that coverage would extend to only one spouse school boards would not wrangle over the appropriateness of books titled heather has two mommies because heather might , after all , have three or four in short , the number , the sex , the hierarchy or permanence of spouses in any household would be no more a matter of legal requirement or , ultimately , of social concern than the number or size of the rooms and whether they were owned or rented , by the month or on a longterm lease now what possible arguments might be raised against this libertarian daydream \? what kinds of justifications might be offered for granting special status to any form or forms of marriage \? at least three come to mind first , the good of the partners this is the argument that feminist supporters of monogamy make in societies that allow polygamy it rests on the claim that some patterns of life are simply more in accord with human wellbeing and flourishing than others in fact , this is a difficult argument to sustain in today s intellectual climate , even with regard to bizarre forms of marriage not well established , as polygamy is in numerous cultures and religions the liberal political philosophy reigning in much of academia insists that the state should remain neutral toward rival conceptions of the good life second , the most obvious basis for arguing that state and society should establish a norm for marriage promoting , say , stable , longterm heterosexual unions over others is the good of children evolution seems to favor the social groups that keep both parents around to provide the protection , nurture and training during the extended period needed for human offspring to pass safely from infancy to adulthood anthropologists point out that norms governing sex , marriage and family have varied widely from society to society but that nowhere have there not been norms these norms were originally enforced by kinship groups , then by the state , with religion always a major force only in modern times has the idea emerged of leaving these matters to private choice children , of course , are not party to those choices , so it makes sense for society to set up norms on their behalf furthermore , the existence of children inevitably makes demands on society , so society makes demands back on couples a third possible basis for arguing that state and society should give special normative status to some forms of marriage or sexual union is the necessity of socialization humans are not sprung into existence as fullblown consenting adults but are shaped into adulthood by role models , by internalized ideals , by socially reinforced expectations of how adults behave and what adult life is like is an integrated personality capable of entering adult relationships likely to emerge amid an anarchy of competing models of sexual unions and family structures \? it is at least plausible to answer no none of these elementary points resolves the question hotly contested in austin and in several religious bodies as well , whether samesex unions should be afforded some status similar to traditional marriage in fact , a number of strong supporters of maintaining the norms of lasting marriage and twoparent families also back some measures to recognize samesex relationships , to encourage their permanence and stability and to make practical provisions for health benefits and inheritance rights they would probably find grounds for their position in the first and third of the points cited above , even while their concern for children makes them balk at eliminating the special social status of heterosexual childrearing marriages

do you remember the scene in the movie gigi in which the aging courtesan teaches her niece to eat ortolans \? the bones of the tiny birds crackle horribly in the old lady s mouth but she remains the picture of elegant ease gigi , attempting to imitate her aunt , merely looks uncomfortable every meal i have eaten at les celebrites has reminded me of that scene unfortunately , i am always gigi the setting is undoubtedly what brings this to mind no restaurant in new york so perfectly recreates another time and place les celebrites is a precious art deco parlor , all lacquer and lalique to those who appreciate the opulence of that ebony and gold period , the intimate room with just 18 tables will seem the last word in luxury those who do not may find the atmosphere slightly suffocating personally , i always have the fear that when i sit back in those wellpadded sofas my feet will not quite touch the floor wellmeaning waiters hover anxiously they do not enliven the atmosphere the dismay of our captain , who went hopping around the table one night trying to provide the correct cutlery as we passed our plates to taste one another s food , would have been comical had it not been so oppressive at one point i actually found myself crossing knives with him as he snatched a fish knife away to replace it with the proper one for meat he looked triumphant i was embarrassed yet another captain , on another visit , steadfastly refused to allow us to order a fish course between the appetizer and the entree our portions are very large , he said firmly it will be too much for you we persisted , he insisted we finally gave up another time our captain murmured approval of my choice of ferraricarano , a rich california chardonnay i'm glad you like it , i replied , attempting irony he drew back a bit oh no , he said severely it is not a wine for me in this restaurant you must play by the rules stick to the proper cutlery , do n't try to order too much and be grateful for wine advice , even if uninvited you will be rewarded with some of the city s finest food after a few forkfuls of foie gras , even the most anxious waiter fades into the background where he belongs foie gras is one of the signatures of the chef , christian delouvrier , who piles it onto his plates with joyous abandon he might plunk morsels onto a bed of baby pea sprouts and top them with a deep , dusky prune sauce as a tidbit to offer diners before they order or stuff fat slices of foie gras between rings of green apple and turn it into the world s most decadent burger he hollows out an onion and fills it with a seductive mixture of foie gras , prosciutto and sweetbreads sometimes he just sautes the rich liver with fresh figs when a dish is as simple as this one , the sheer generosity of the serving is heady mr delouvrier can be equally cavalier with caviar once last winter he used caviar like mustard in a sauce for scallops and shrimp the graininess of the roe was a treat and a surprise in a playfully delicious dish he is no more respectful of truffles , handling them as if they went for the price of potatoes rock shrimp ravioli arrive in a wild mushroom broth scented with truffle oil the perfume of the dish is dizzying and in truffle season , a small mountain of crushed potatoes arrived hidden beneath shaved black truffles it was the most wildly indulgent dish i 've had all year even a simple salad of green beans becomes a luxury in mr delouvrier s hands in springtime the beans shared the plate with morels so large and so black they were shocking long after the morels had disappeared , their musky flavor was still echoing on the tongue the appetizers are a continuous kaleidoscope of surprises tomato consomme with scallops sounds unimpressive but the soup is topped first with a scoop of icy tomato sorbet , then with a single leaf of fried basil in this company , the sliced white scallops are mere threads in a tapestry of textures the wine list is equally impressive it is tempting , faced with so many good choices , to succumb to the excesses of the room and decide that this is not the time to economize but those who keep their heads will discover that a surprising percentage of the wines are affordable , especially to people willing to venture beyond burgundy and bordeaux they will also find that if they ask for advice , it is reliable if only the entrees were as dependable many are honeyandorangelacquered duck , perfumed with coriander and cumin and served with a fig puree , is a reminder that mr delouvrier once worked with the threestar french chef alain senderens with its spicy medieval flavors , the duck is irresistible squab with garlic confit and wonderfully truffled polenta is rare , gamy , satisfying tiny chops and saddle of extraordinary lamb are served with sweet little tomatoes and a special one night , the loin , saddle and rack of baby goat , was fine enough to revolutionize the image of that unlovable animal surrounded with thyme , it was gently flavorful and absolutely tender

yesterday afternoon , while major league baseball owners decided to cancel the remainder of the season , john franco one of the mets' union representatives went to macy s to buy new underwear he saw no reason to sit home and wait for a phone call that would tell him what he already knew franco and his teammates will not be returning to shea stadium this season the owners' decision left franco angry and frustrated but it did not come as a surprise i guess i started giving up hope almost three weeks into it , said franco , who will finish the season as the national league leader with 30 saves sitting in on the meetings and seeing the way both sides went at each other , i had the gut feeling nothing was going to get done hitler could n't stop the world series , vietnam could n't stop the world series , other disasters the earthquake that could n't stop the world series but a couple of owners led by richard ravitch , they got together and they stopped the world series for the mets , the 1994 season ended at a most unfortunate time after two seasons of humiliation both on and off the field the franchise had begun to lure back its fans and win respect throughout the league they were an overacheiving bunch their thirdplace standing in the nl east was better than most would have predicted although they did not reach manager dallas green s goal of finishing 500 the record will stand at 5558 they did finish with a better record than 16 of the other 27 major league teams a thirdplace finish with an asterisk in 1994 it s not where we wanted to be , green said in a statement released yesterday by the club but it s better than 1993 and hopefully we will be able to continue to build from what we started on the field this season what the mets started was a resurgence , one sparked by the surprising debuts of players like rico brogna , the talented young first baseman , and jason jacome , the rookie lefthanded pitcher it was underscored by the rebirth of several veterans particularly franco and the 30yearold bret saberhagen , who was pitching better than he had since 1989 , the year he won his second cy young award i wish it was last year , said franco , who had more saves this season than he did the previous two combined \( 25 \) the kind of year i 'd had , i 'd be packing the bus for everybody like dwight gooden , pete smith and several other mets , franco is supposed to become a free agent this winter his future will remain uncertain until the owners and the union decide what players with freeagent status can do about contract negotiations that situation also ties the hands of general manager joe mcilvaine , who plans to meet with green and several coaches tomorrow to discuss future plans the only comfort in that is that the 27 other teams are in the same boat , said mcilvaine , who has yet to have any concrete discussions with franco or his agent and has not spoken to gooden , who is in the midst of a 60day suspension nobody s going to get too much jump on anybody else for most mets , the news came days even weeks after they had begun to treat the strike as the start of the off season , rather than a brief interruption of the game david segui was in the basement of his new house in kansas city , working out in his weight room , when the baseball season died i do n't know if it was so much hope as just keeping myself in shape , said segui , who was happy to be on strike earlier this month , when his wife gave birth to their daughter haley ryan thompson has been taking his 2yearold daughter , taylor , to the playground at mcdonald s as often as he has been heading to the gym at first , thompson went to the batting cages every day , then every few days the trips dwindled to once a week at best i 've been golfing with todd a lot , said thompson , who remained in his queens apartment , which is in the same complex as catcher todd hundley , for the duration of the strike i think i kind of figured it was over the first week of september with only a few months of major league pay to save , brogna did not rent an apartment in his hometown of watertown , conn , until the strike rolled into september he s serving as the assistant defensive coordinator for the high school football team at taft prep school , where his father teaches but from brogna , who makes the league minimum 109 , 000 for a full season to franco , who would have made 35 million in a complete season , none of the mets had complaints about their finances or believed that the union was in any danger of breaking over the winter it s not about cracking , it s about getting it done , bobby bonilla said yesterday from los angeles we do n't want a salary cap period we like baseball the way it is from his home in staten island , franco said basically , i'm going to gear up and get ready for next season if there is a next season if not , i 'll keep in shape playing in a beer league there s an over30 league out here , i think inside pitch three mets are expected to undergo arthroscopic surgery during the next week ryan thompson will have minor repairs done to his right knee , which has bothered him since may , todd hundley will have his throwing shoulder and elbow cleaned out and eric hillman will have surgery on his left elbow none of the injuries are serious the mets had planned to have the medical work done following the season team owner fred wilpon issued a statement for himself and fellow owner nelson doubleday in which they expressed sadness and said that the entire mets organization shares the agony and the pain that is felt by so many because of the loss of the game we all love so much several members of the organization are expected to participate in winter leagues , with thompson slated to rehab his knee in puerto rico rico brogna said he planned to skip winter ball this year dallas green had suggested it but david segui might play in the dominican republic photo just when mets fans were starting to believe again , their team and their seats at shea stadium were taken away from them for the rest of 1994 \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)
president clinton preached open trade in april when he signed an international trade agreement in morocco proclaiming it would add 1 trillion to the us economy over the next few years but when the administration withdrew from public scrutiny to translate the marrakesh accord into us law , it lurched toward protectionism at issue are antidumping rules , which countries use to retaliate against foreigners who sell goods at prices below their production costs the marrakesh accord puts limits on the rules so that countries will no longer be able to exploit them by finding dumping where none exists but the administration s draft language includes provisions that either change the words of the marrakesh accord which the us signed along with more than 100 other nations or twist their meaning in such a way that the us would be able to exclude more imports than the accord intended to prove dumping , the us typically must show that the price of an import falls below its production cost the higher the estimated cost , the higher the price the foreigner must charge the marrakesh accord permits new foreign companies to base prices on production costs at the end of a startup period by that time , costs have usually declined but the administration changes the accord to include some earlier and higher costs that makes dumping easier to prove another administration provision would have the effect of forcing foreigners to raise prices when output is low during a recession , for example just when domestic companies are cutting prices to survive the administration also plans to waive part of the accord that would rule out retaliation for minor dumping infractions where prices are set within 2 percent of costs finally , the accord permits retaliation only to the extent that dumped imports have injured domestic industry but the administration would allow retaliation beyond the injuries caused by goods sold at unfair prices the pattern here is to rewrite marrakesh for protectionist purposes and while this pattern provides new evidence of the administration s split personality on trade , it comes as no surprise to those who have witnessed other internal battles officials like laura tyson of the council of economic advisers have fought from the beginning to promote more open trade others seem determined to protect steel mills and other politically powerful industries from competition the draft document is an assault on consumers , who pay higher prices to domestic companies when they are insulated from competition it is also an assault on domestic exporters like pharmaceutical and computer companies whose products will be shut out of foreign markets when trading partners mimic the us rules that reflects poorly on a president who claims nafta and the marrakesh accord as hallmarks of his first term

it is eastertime and so there will be a taste of latin american tradition in the streets of east harlem , where the faithful will walk the way of the cross many of polish descent will not eat their kielbasa and bread without the blessing of their pastor on sunday , a church in chinatown will be draped in banners of white and gold and a dominican woman named ana will baptize her youngest child all because they say he has risen easter sunday is the most important holiday on the christian calendar this week , more than 15 million new yorkers will celebrate the day they believe jesus christ rose from the dead after being crucified at calvary the rituals of celebration are centuries old , and in many ways , universal there is communion , baptism , reflection , revelry but also indelibly stamped on religious tradition are the nuances of culture and ethnicity , and perhaps nowhere is that better shown than in the multihued sanctuaries of the northeast the central message of easter is the same , but it picks up the clothing of the particular ethnic culture that it finds itself , said the rev w franklyn richardson , pastor of grace baptist church in mount vernon , ny it becomes the mission of the church to screen the message through whatever cultural context it s in that s how it can be heard just as the religiously prescribed services and events commemorating the resurrection begin long before easter sunday , so do the special preparations and ethnic celebrations that occur in anticipation of the holy day the owners of the de robertis pasticceria in lower manhattan began two weeks ago filling their shelves with the sweets that accompany the celebration of easter in many italianamerican households there were easter lambs made of marzipan , lounging on beds of sugar aluminum pans filled with struffoli , a fried egg dough dipped in honey , and pupo con uovo , easter bread baked with a hardcooked egg inside many families try to bake their own , said john a de robertis , manager of the bakery that his family opened in 1904 but then they mess it up , he said , laughing , so they wind up coming here anyway they also come for a taste of their youth , and of italy people who 've moved away come back and reminisce , mr de robertis said they want to see the old neighborhood a final rehearsal a borough away from the bakery , 30 parishioners of st joseph s church in the tremont section of the bronx gathered on a cold tuesday evening for the final rehearsal of the good friday procession commemorating jesus christ s walk to calvary they were , like other congregations throughout the city , carrying on an established tradition in latin america , and many islands of the caribbean and the philippines but at st joseph , there was a slight problem it was a quarter to 8 , and jesus was late when manuel cortez , the 18yearold playing jesus , finally showed up , he explained he lost track of time during practice with his heavy metal rock band , driven by hatred he also hid under his new york yankees cap a fresh buzz cut that would make it difficult to pin on the wig he would wear as he carried a hollow wooden cross through the streets of his neighborhood but all could be forgiven today , he will actually be put on a cross in front of hundreds , his hands clutching straps , his feet resting on a wooden block during rehearsal , as his chest heaved with emotion , his sincerity seemed to fill the church most of my friends are n't really religious , said mr cortez , who has played the role of jesus for four years it s a part of my life that s always been there i do n't hide it in the procession , he will be accompanied by parishioners playing roman soldiers , the virgin mary and john the baptist together they will wend their way through streets mr cortez said he would not walk down on an ordinary day indeed , the church moved its climactic mock crucifixion from nearby crotona park , where it was staged for more than 20 years , inside the sanctuary to avoid violence but good friday is no ordinary day the whole neighborhood changes for that couple of hours , he said it s peaceful washing the feet at the church of the transfiguration in chinatown , the rev raymond j nobiletti performed an old religious ritual last night , washing the feet of some parishioners it is a symbol of service , in memory of jesus washing the feet of his disciples in previous years , his church had incorporated chinese tradition , substituting the pouring of tea for the washing of feet that s a respectful thing , the priest said , saying that he would walk down the aisle , and with the cantonese words cheng yum chah \( meaning , have some tea \) , serve the tea it s very powerful as a symbol of service some find it hard to continue traditions from home in a new country modern urban problems and customs can interfere with the ancient rituals there are several good friday processions throughout the region , for instance , including one in east harlem involving thousands but unlike in the dominican republic , where ana knight was born , not everyone gets the day off , nor cherishes the significance of the holiday no easter eggs
a roaring fire engulfed the bottom floors of a threestory building in downtown brooklyn last night , killing one person and critically injuring another , the fire department said at least four residents were safely evacuated from the burning building at 426 atlantic avenue but seven firefighters were injured , none of them seriously , while fighting the blaze that broke out about 6 52 pm , said firefighter cosmo romeo , a fire department spokesman firefighters , struggling to keep the fire from spreading to adjoining buildings , declared a third alarm at 7 29 , bringing the total number of firefighters at the scene to 150 , firefighter romeo said the fire was contained to the basement and ground floor of the building , which had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the second and third floors by 8 pm , the fire was extinguished firefighters discovered the body of one victim while searching in the basement another person was taken to long island college hospital in critical condition , firefighter romeo said the victims were not identified the cause of the fire was not determined
almost from the start , investigators thought they knew who chased nathaniel gaddy on a bicycle last year in harlem and shot him in the back but it took seven months of cajoling frightened witnesses to build a case against the leader of a local drug gang , officials said cameron knight , whose indictment on charges of murder and weapons violations was announced yesterday , has a record of several drug and weapons convictions at the age of 22 , but prosecutors said the may 1 death of mr gaddy , 32 , had nothing to do with drugs by their account , it was a case of jealousy and retribution mr knight was arrested on dec 13 on drugrelated arrest warrants the night before the killing , officials said , mr gaddy , of 21 west 112th street , saw his former girlfriend and mr knight coming home from a date there was a confrontation between the two men , who had never met , and mr gaddy punched the other man , knocking him unconscious the next day , officials said , mr knight took a 9millimeter pistol , mounted his bicycle and went looking for mr gaddy he found him outside the taft houses , on 115th street just east of fifth avenue , fernando camacho , an assistant district attorney in manhattan , said mr gaddy ran , but his pursuer caught him at the corner of fifth avenue and 112th street and shot him six times more than 10 people were nearby , but at least at first none would admit to having seen anything mr knight s name surfaced early on in the investigation by the housing authority police and district attorney robert m morgenthau s office , mr camacho said but witnesses were very afraid and were unwilling to come forward initially he would not say what other evidenceinvestigators had compiled mr knight pleaded not guilty yesterday in state supreme court , and acting justice brenda s soloff ordered him held without bail
candidate john g rowland producer greg stevens company , alexandria , va script mr rowland i do n't blame you for being disgusted with politics i'm pretty disgusted too as you know , the hartford courant and some of my political enemies will do anything to stop us they want you to believe that something awful occurred between my former wife and me but that s not true we 've had our problems , but they do n't belong in a political campaign protecting my children from this media madness is more important to me than this election all i ask is that you look beyond the desperate politics and join us for a real change in connecticut visual john rowland , the republican candidate for governor and a former congressman , speaks directly to the camera , in front of a gray backdrop the words , john rowland for governor , appear at the bottom of the screen at the beginning and end of the ad accuracy mr rowland was divorced earlier this year , and it is true that for the several months the hartford courant has tried to obtain documents regarding a police visit to the house of mr rowland s former wife , deborah , in response to an argument between the two of them the middlebury police have released a brief summary of the incident , describing it as a nonviolent family dispute , but the town and both rowlands have opposed providing any additional documents the hartford courant is challenging this position before the state s freedom of information commission the newspaper s stories about the incident have not been featured prominently and have never speculated about or hinted at what may have occurred its coverage has focused on the legal wrangling over whether the documents should be available to the public similar stories have appeared in other newspapers and on television and radio news programs none of mr rowland s gubernatorial opponents have referred to the stories it is unclear to whom he is referring when he mentions political enemies scorecard mr rowland has been the frontrunner in the race since january , but in recent weeks his lead has narrowed , and he appears to be losing support among republican women this commercial is a bold attempt by mr rowland to defuse a growing problem attacking the media has sometimes worked well for candidates the risk is that the commercial will add fuel to the fire , sustaining the controversy and making more people aware of it jonathan rabinovitz
two days before west point s oct 22 football game with the citadel , 600 west point cadets rallied for a socalled spirit run past a line of army team members cheers were shouted , backs were slapped and the breasts of 18 of the 51 female cadets were groped another tailhook \? no , partly because the run involved a cordon of excited college students , not a gantlet of drunken adult louts , and mostly because west point was very quick \( within 24 hours of the run \) to investigate the incident and contemplate appropriate measures that is a lot more than the navy has ever been able to boast about its response to tailhook '91 there is one thing to be said for that notorious las vegas convention it was an invaluable learning experience for the nation s armed forces fifteen of the 18 women at west point considered the groping to be deliberate , if fleeting , instances of sexual harassment none were able to identify the grabbers but after three of their group made the initial complaint , all had enough faith in the cadet chain of command to come forward three of the players also came forward , and said their brushing against the female cadets had been inadvertent not so , said several teammates who reported seeing what happened and hearing the classic lockerroom badinage that followed the superintendent of the academy , lieut gen howard d graves , moved rapidly , intelligently and with an openness that should constitute a watershed in the armed forces' treatment of what in recent years has seemed an endemic sexism in the time since the inquiry began , he notified the pentagon and congressional oversight authorities and asked for onthescene oversight by specialists from the inspector general s office investigators first interviewed both the female cadets and the 200 varsity and junior varsity players this week five of the players will face an official inquiry the maximum penalty for those found guilty \( unless there is evidence of more egregious behavior \) will be a threemonth suspension from the team , along with several other restrictions losing some or all of these players might be a blow to west point s football season but that is a small matter compared with the condemnation the united states military academy would have deserved had its command not moved so quickly , decisively and wisely
the national hockey league players association formally rejected the league s latest contract proposal yesterday , and as of last night there were no further negotiations scheduled in their labor dispute as the deadline approached for reaching agreement and starting the season on time if there is no settlement by tomorrow morning , commissioner gary bettman has said he will postpone the opening of the season , scheduled to begin with 12 games on saturday night coincidentally , this weekend was also supposed to mark the conclusion of baseball s regular season , which was curtailed by a players strike at the deadline approached , players continued to point to bettman s approach as the main problem in the dispute , portraying him as an outsider lacking real knowledge of the sport or the league the critics included the los angeles kings' wayne gretzky , a longtime superstar and the league s bestknown player the rejection of the hockey proposal came in a telephone call between bettman and bob goodenow , the executive director of the union it was really only a formality goodenow had strongly suggested tuesday in toronto , after eight hours of bargaining , that the union regarded the newest proposal as unacceptable we have no formal talks planned , goodenow said late yesterday we know how to reach each other we are quite far apart there are some serious problems there is also a small ray of hope the latest league offer did show movement in the management position , and bettman said that neither side had made its final best offer if they are to make them before a postponement of the season , the likely place and time is today in new york , city of league headquarters , or in toronto , city of union headquarters by late last night , the two sides seemed to be in staredown mode , waiting for one side or the other to blink in this sense , they were practicing collective bargaining in the classic manner although both sides have said that they become more pessimistic about a settlement as the deadline draws near , the reality could be the opposite pressure and incentive for settlement are greatest in the final hours the two sides have conducted frequent talks in a businesslike and professional manner their lines of communication remain open both say they want to make a deal bettman , the secondyear commissioner , continued to receive personal , verbal criticism from players it s disappointing when one person takes the bull by the horns and decides we 're not going to play , gretzky said of bettman to have a guy who s only been around about one year do this is very frustrating although somewhat understandable , the personal criticism of bettman is somewhat simplistic he is acting on behalf of the 26 team owners , none of whom have voiced any public opposition to his tactics another aspect of the criticism against him takes on a nationalistic tone , particularly in toronto , canada s media capital a toronto sun columnist , under the headline yankees , go home , referred to bettman in unflattering language , and accused both bettman and goodenow of a true american cowboy mentality both bettman and goodenow are from the united states but so is chris chelios of the chicago blackhawks , who voiced the harshest words yet in a television interview last night in which he belittled bettman s qualifications to administer the league s business the main thing is , he does n't know anything about hockey , that s obvious , said chelios he does n't recognize players like jeremy roenick and brendan shanahan at the meetings whether it s this little man s syndrome thing or whatever in a sign that the league has put all other business aside , it indefinitely postponed the annual waiver draft , which had been scheduled for yesterday afternoon according to league rules , the waiver draft must be held within seven days of the start of the season which clearly is up in the air right now under the rules of the waiver draft , each team is allowed to protect 18 skaters and 2 goaltenders the trading deadline prior to the draft was last sunday , but it has been lifted indefinitely the latest owners proposal suggested a system that would penalize teams for paying high wages and would make that penalty money available to teams with lower revenues the plan called for a salary surcharge that is less severe than that which was first proposed under the earlier proposal by the owners , teams that exceed a fixed payroll limit would pay a surcharge of as much as 200 percent under the most recent owners proposal , the surcharge maximum would be 125 percent a person familiar with the management side of bargaining said last night that the league is willing to revise its tax surcharge downward there is room , he said , if they want to negotiate the numbers however , he also said that the league would hold firm to its demand for a rookie salary structure , although the league was willing to sweeten it with a guarantee of performance bonuses in addition , he said the league would continue to demand the abolition of salary arbitration unless the union makes major concessions according to figures the league has provided to the union , the average team payroll last season was 1416 million under the most recent proposal , if a team were to go above that figure or any figure that is agreed upon in collective bargaining the team would be penalized 5 percent for first 250 , 000 over the limit and another 5 percent for each additional 250 , 000 , up to a maximum of 125 percent the union s objection to this is twofold one , the union feels that a team willing to spend money on salaries , for free agents or for its own players , would be inhibited if a new contract for 6 million would result in a surcharge of up to 75 million secondly , the players say that any meaningful plan for revenue redistribution among the teams should include the sharing of gate receipts between the prosperous clubs in the big markets and the lesswelloff clubs in the smaller markets under the most recent proposal from the players , the payroll tax and the tax on gate receipts would be raised from 5 percent in each category to 55 percent in each category and would raise 397 million to be put in a pool according to calculations by the union , the rangers last season would have paid 24 million into the pool and the islanders would have paid 141 million only the top 16 teams would be taxed the devils would have received a subsidy of 144 , 000 from the pool
why are there so many bad chinese restaurants in new york \? blame it on the politicians the first wave of immigrants from southern china came to this country from the pearl river delta in 1848 the earliest to arrive were men who went to work in the gold mines , on the railroads and on farms , intending to send for their families once their fortunes were made the chinese exclusion act of 1882 changed all that because subsequent immigration was all but prohibited , the first chinatowns were largely bachelor societies the men knew very little about cooking , but they yearned for the food of the villages they had left behind they did their best to recreate it , and this clumsy cooking is what americans came to know as chinese food sticky sweetandsour pork , leaden egg rolls , greasy chow mein the first large group of women did not arrive until 1945 , after the repeal of the exclusion act and passage of the war brides act but the big change in chinese cooking in america came in 1965 when the hartceller act changed the quotas , increasing asian immigration and bringing an influx of chinese chefs in the meantime , several generations of americans had grown up on a bad parody of a great cuisine americans have welcomed each new style of chinese cooking , falling for the spiciness of sichuan in the early 70 s and the simplicity of hong kong cooking in recent years \( courtesy of the immigration reform and control act of 1986 , which greatly increased the colony s quotas \) still , americans remain lamentably wedded to old ideas most chinese restaurants are so wary of american customers they do n't even bother to offer them their best regional specialties which brings me to tang pavilion chinese friends kept insisting that this calm and lovely midtown restaurant served wonderful food and yet the menu was filled with pedestrian dishes there i sat , eating dreary seafood delight and big apple chicken , watching elegant chinese men eating what looked like elegant chinese dishes what was i doing wrong \? i was not , it turns out , asking for the shanghai menu the cooking of eastern china from cities like shanghai , suzhou , hangzhou is still relatively hard to find in the united states it is a complex cuisine , much prized in china and quite different from the more familiar southern food as soon as i found out that there was a special menu of shanghai specialties , printed in english , tang pavilion was transformed for me i discovered all the rich dishes i had seen on other tables i immediately ordered a plate of drunken chicken and sat back to savor its deep , musky flavor the chicken had been steeped in the local shao hsing wine until the flesh was silky and aromatic it was a cool , simple but extremely satisfying dish next we had vegetable pie , a terrine made of many thin layers of dried bean curd it was subtle , delicate , deeply delicious shanghai , which is famous for its vegetarian dishes , has devised hundreds of interesting ways to use bean curd one of my favorite dishes at tang pavilion is green bean and tofu sheet long white bands of almost translucent dried bean curd tossed with small bright green beans the combination was fresh and light , like some delightful new take on pasta looking through the menu i spied baby eel , a famous eastern chinese dish it must be eaten with great speed as soon as the dish loses its heat it loses its appeal tang pavilion s version was fabulous , a mixture of sweet , slender strips of eel , yellow chives and ginger we followed it with hearts of chinese cabbage steamed with velvety black mushrooms , a perfect end to the meal there were even more interesting dishes on the menu , but they required advance notice so a week later i gathered a group and returned for a feast we began by nibbling on pickles triangles of turnip marinated in sesame oil , chewy pieces of pressed bean curd , salty preserved greens peanuts sprinkled with shards of dried seaweed were impossible to resist a beautiful plate of cold hors d'oeuvres contained more of that wonderful drunken poached chicken , long golden strands of jellyfish slicked with sesame oil and crisp curly strips of baby eel , a sort of elegant jerky soup was so potent and so fragrant that the scent preceded the tureen to the table the aroma was chicken , but what you tasted was the saltysweet flavor of shredded ham and the earthiness of black mushrooms nestled in the bottom of each bowl was a single delicate crescent of egg dumpling the centerpiece of the dinner was braised duck stuffed with sweet rice , a masterpiece the color of mahogany soft enough to eat with chopsticks , this dish would make any meal into a banquet it was so rich it was almost impossible to eat more than a couple of bites , so delicious it was hard to stop yourself from having more next there were fillets of yellow fish wrapped in sheets of bean curd and deepfried they crackled invitingly each time you took a bite the crisp puffs of fish had a clean , fresh flavor that filled your mouth and then quickly vanished one of the most famous eastern dishes is named for a poet and statesman of the 11th century , su tungpo , who wrote the recipe in the form of a poem over a slow fire , with a little water , simmer till soft a very good taste the recipe has changed very little since then the pork is braised in soy sauce , rice wine , sugar and ginger , then steamed until the flesh has the texture of butter at tang pavilion the sweet , soft chunks of meat were stuffed into chewy white buns and turned into seductive little sandwiches if this had been a western meal , it would have been followed by salad being chinese , there was the simplicity of bright green , quickly cooked pea shoots \( dou miao \) and small bowls of rice as we sat sipping tea and eating fruit we wondered why all these dishes had been segregated on a separate menu was it because the waiters got tired of telling people , you wo n't like that when they tried to order sea cucumber \( another wonderful shanghai specialty that has the consistency of hard jello \) \? were they weary of warning diners about all the bones in stewed fish tail \? or does tang pavilion simply fear that its best dishes will not be appreciated by an american audience \? whatever the answer , the very fact that the shanghai menu is printed in english is a hopeful sign a few years ago , the menu would have been written entirely in chinese characters times do change tang pavilion  65 west 55th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 9566888 atmosphere spare , elegant and comfortable service professional and helpful ask for advice recommended dishes drunken chicken , jelly fish , egg dumpling soup , pickled cabbage soup , braised duck stuffed with sweet rice , tungpo pork , pork with dried bean curd and green chili , jumbo shrimp with seaweed , chinese cabbage with black mushrooms , baby eel with yellow leeks , green bean and tofu sheet , pork with preserved vegetable wine list minimal , but the 1992 sancerre from michel redde goes well with the food hours 11 30 am to 10 30 pm daily price range appetizers 250 to 995 , main courses 650 to 42 \( braised duck \) , desserts 250 to 12 credit cards all major cards wheelchair acccessible what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change
the building , on a castiron soho street , is anonymous , undistinguished the sign is so discreet it s often missed the door is solid , locked and stubbornly resistant to jiggles and shoves only a symphony of knuckles does the trick this is bark frameworks , the tiffany of the frame business , an appropriately unobtrusive , and somewhat exclusive , atelier for an art that is seen by all but rarely noticed which is precisely the point inside the door is an expanse of architecturally planned open space with a glass staircase leading down to workrooms to one side , at the bottom of the steps , there is an alcove set up to look like an outdoor cafe jared bark seats the visitor , walks across to the little kitchen area and returns with two coffees , fortunately stronger than the containers , which leak slightly no matter the private collectors , architects and museum curators do n't come to 85 grand street for coffee richard avedon came recently with ideas for framing his show , richard avedon evidence , 19441994 , at the whitney last year , the people who know about such things at the metropolitan museum of art came to order more than 200 different frames for its waking dream exhibition on photography s first 100 years the museum of modern art is also a client a bark frame is not distinguished by the extravagant use of gilt , by elaborate curlicues or massive scale its signature is an absence of decorative effect some reflections on what mr bark calls the art of preserving the art we are not involved in framing as decor the frame has to play a service role it can be a compelling design in itself , but in no circumstances should it dominate the painting a modest landscape , for instance , could be killed by a frame that tried to make it a great presence , but the right frame would bring out the work s full potential the period of the painting , the subject , the color and the form all must be taken into consideration a 17thcentury dutch landscape might get a bourgeois frame dark , somber and ebonized , simple rather than carved and decorative , to fit the character of the picture a contemporary painting by jasper johns would probably be done in the way johns himself prefers straightforward , simple blond ramin wood with a deep offwhite mat the basic reason he is so good is that he is an artist at heart with a sensitivity , especially to works on paper , that is as fine as it gets , said maria hambourg , curator of photography at the metropolitan museum of art in his development of matting and framing solutions , he has an openminded approach he has no fear of playing with a variety of solutions until he comes up with the optimum one bark frameworks is one of the few companies still in the business of framing fine art among the prestigious survivors , some of which also deal in periodreproduction frames \( bark does not \) are julius lowy frame restorating company \( 223 east 80th street \) and eli wilner company \( 1525 york avenue at 80th street \) galleries and artists are major bark clients , and museums can account for 5 to 10 percent of a year s business in the last few years , however , individual collectors have become increasingly important , particularly as many corporate collections were put on hold there is little difference in framing for a museum and a collector , he said , other than that museum curators are often more explicit about what they want generally , we hear what the client wants and come up with prototypes , mr bark said in some cases mr avedon was one the client basically designs his own frames and the company executes them in others , mr bark or one of his partners suggests what seems most suitable with the avedon exhibition , the objective was to present the photographs with as little encumbrance as possible , to achieve a direct encounter between the viewer and the photograph we used frames without plexiglas , as avedon had requested , so that the nature of the paper was clear the photograph was presented as an object , he said for some of the pictures , we did a special deepset aluminum frame that looks a little like a photographic darkroom tray mr bark grew up in california and came to new york after graduating from stanford university in 1966 he became interested in the profession when he earned extra money working in a frame shop in palo alto during high school and college mr bark founded the business in 1970 and now has three partners james barth and jamie dearing build most of the designs , anne grant looks after administration and mr bark does a

wood frames were at the low end of the market \( four sticks of wood banged together , he said \) the popular and innovative frames were done by kulicke , a framing company \( now specializing in antique reproductions \) that had developed the metal section frame , the welded aluminum frame and the plexiglas box frame bark began using a wide range of woods , ramin from borneo , blond , nondescript and characterless but providing a particularly good foil for art , as well as hard maple and ash the stock also expanded to cherry , curly maple , rosewood and several african and south american woods finishes were washed for more variation hardwood frames never completely disappeared but in the bark frame design , these materials were given a new prominence , exploiting the character of the wood in a way that had not been done before until well into the 1980 s , 90 percent of our work was simple modernist frames in wood or welded metal , mr bark said the percentage is n't as high today , but it is still substantial we have developed a modernist esthetic , a range of species of wood so that the frames can be both interesting and subtle , mr bark said none of this was unheard of but we 've focused on having a wide and rich range the bark client is rarely of the walkin variety , though once in a while , someone who has heard about the company stumbles in with sort of a glazed look , he said the glazed look is likely to solidify when the walkin discovers the cost of a bark frame 125 to several thousand dollars posters and reproductions need not apply famed

seeking to reverse two decades of policy on how to handle the most troubled children in new york city s schools , chancellor ramon c cortines wants to establish a new system of disciplinary academies , where attendance would be mandatory for students expelled from other schools for carrying guns or illegal knives mayor rudolph w giuliani and gov mario m cuomo have both endorsed the concept in recent days the academies which would resemble parttime reform schools with rigorous academic programs , are the centerpiece of a new safety plan , created by school and union officials , that mr cortines sent to mr giuliani yesterday it also includes a smorgasbord of other recommendations , including the extension of weapons detection programs to all city high schools and 10 specialeducation sites mr giuliani asked mr cortines to develop detailed school safety proposals after the accidental shooting of a freshman in a stairwell at sheepshead bay high school in brooklyn by a 16yearold friend on sept 14 both youths had been transferred into sheepshead bay high after disciplinary problems at other schools , and both had lengthy criminal records , officials said until the mid1970 s , most violent students were consigned to special schools , called 600 schools , which were often criticized as dumping grounds for troublemakers and because they included mostly minority youngsters that system was dismantled by court order the new disciplinary academies are needed now , school officials said , because there is a constitutional right to free public instruction until the age of 21 , which means that while violent students may be suspended , they may not be expelled as a result , the school system now has hundreds of repeatedly violent students against whom its only recourse is brief suspension or repeated transfer from school to school the city already has two academies for troubled students , but placement is voluntary , and they can accommodate only 250 students the new plan is subject to approval by the sevenmember board of education more important , at a time when all city agencies , including the schools , are facing budget cuts , it would need the backing of mayor giuliani in order to receive city funds cristyne f lategano , mr giuliani s press secretary , said yesterday that deputy mayors peter j powers and ninfa segarra were studying the board proposals but that the mayor had not yet been briefed on them we have yet to study how this is going to be funded , so i ca n't comment as to whether we will be supporting this specific plan , ms lategano said but we favor alternative schools for students who are going to endanger the lives of other students the mayor obviously has strong opinions about this if a student brings a gun into school , you need to classify that student as a criminal , because they are breaking the law they need to be separated that student should not be returned to the same school the new emphasis on segregating violent youths comes as the city tries again to focus a school security policy that has seemed to lurch from initiative to initiative in recent years also in the wake of school shootings , the city s two previous chancellors and mayors developed sweeping safety plans that have had decidedly mixed results you ought to be able to separate violent kids from the nonviolent kids , mr cuomo said last week in an interview with reporters and editors of the new york times you ought to establish schools where you can put the kids who carry guns and otherwise upset things attendance should be mandatory , he said mr cortines declined to comment on the safety plan yesterday a draft version of the plan was provided to the new york times by someone who helped write it the plan had immediate critics the board s whole history in providing things like this is they do n't turn out the way they are described , said joan harrington , associate director of advocates for children , a private group that represents students in suspension hearings they end up poorly staffed and poorly run this is going to be just another place to warehouse youngsters the plan outlining the new schools , which are termed mandated instructional programs , goes to considerable lengths to describe them as more than mere holding pens the schools would provide a highly structured alternative setting for youngsters who have been expelled from their home schools , offer a full curriculum and feature computer labs as well as programs offering credit for community service , the plan says the schools , which would be mandatory for any student caught at school with a gun or illegal knife or who uses any weapon in an aggressive act , would focus on selfesteem building , long and shortrange goal setting , establishing a locus of control , dealing with bureaucracies , and improving peer and authority relationships , the plan says the plan urges mr giuliani to use funds from the federal crime bill to establish one academy for intermediate and another for high school students in each of the four large boroughs and one in staten island it estimates that an academy with 150 places would cost 16 million to build and 650 , 000 a year to run , and it requests city hall s help in identifying suitable sites the nine schools would have a capacity of 1 , 350 students during the 199293 school year , the last for which figures were immediately available , 1 , 632 students were suspended for weapons possession in 121 cases the weapon was a gun in addition , however , over 1 , 200 students reenter city schools directly from state correctional institutions each year , and school officials often receive no notification in a closeddoor meeting with mr cortines and other school , police and union officials in the principal s office at sheepshead bay high two days after the recent shooting , mr giuliani not only endorsed the academies but also suggested it might be possible to persuade prosecutors and judges to enroll students convicted of felonies in them as an alternative to incarceration , said sandra feldman , the teachers' union president , who attended the meeting that s a very good idea because a lot of the kids get into the justice system , but nothing happens , and they get into trouble again , ms feldman said here , they would go into a positive program with specially trained teachers in a toughlove setting besides the academies , the plan makes dozens of other recommendations many center on improving coordination among schools and the police , courts and other government agencies the plan also calls for the police , prosecutors and judges to apply tougher treatment to youths arrested with weapons in preparing the plan , school officials said they picked 10 students who were arrested for weapons possession in schools during the 199394 school year and reviewed their histories none of the 10 students were incarcerated , the officials said instead , they appeared at school suspension hearings and were placed back in regular schools within five days
belgrade , yugoslavia tito , long the absolute ruler of yugoslavia , strides forth , resplendent in his marshal s uniform , surrounded by a generally bedraggled throng , some offering flowers , others spitting in disdain a serbian woman approaches and points a finger i cried when you died , and then i regretted my tears , she said but now if you really would return , i suppose i would vote for you this scene of poignant ambivalence is taken from a movie released here this month , tito for the second time among the serbs , in which an actor playing tito , who died in 1980 , strolls the streets of belgrade part documentary , part candid camera , none of it rehearsed , it captures the confusion of a fractured nation , unsure of its history , bewildered by its present , utterly at a loss as to its future tito , born jozip broz in the small croatian village of kumrovec , is himself confused in the movie , and with reason his country , yugoslavia , has been dismembered by war his currency no longer exists streets and towns named after him have new names , and the myriad monuments to him have vanished but it is the reaction of ordinary people to the apparition that intrigued the director , zelimir zilnik , who has won awards for his documentaries at the berlin film festival and elsewhere i made the film because the bosnian war is a war between tito s successors , he said i wanted to confront people with their past people in this region are like geese they have problems with leaders they follow them blindly it was true of tito , of the kings before him , and now of slobodan milosevic or franjo tudjman he was referring to the serbian and croatian presidents and then , after the leader goes , we malign him , mr zilnik continued the past disappears , is never rationally appraised it becomes a big black hole , a taboo , a gap in our identity and taboos lead to repression and the savagery in bosnia what emerges above all from the movie is anger not the retrospective anger of serbs against a ruler who was born of a croatian father and a slovene mother and is now widely said to have used proclamations about the brotherhood of the southern slav peoples to hide discrimination against the serbs not the anger of people who have been quick to rewrite the history of their onceadored dictator , the man who found a warm spot in the cold war by perching yugoslavia skillfully between east and west but rather a sharp , practical anger that tito left successors who have brought ruin and war in your time , at least there was only one tito , a man tells the tito character now there are 55 you stole a little , but you had class these people steal everything another man tells tito to take his people with him back up to heaven when he goes all the people \? tito asks no , your successors , is the reply and make sure they do n't return when tito died 14 years ago , a rotating presidency was established , on the theory that the great ruler was irreplaceable but progressively the system broke down as mr milosevic in serbia , followed by mr tudjman in croatia , alija izetbegovic in bosnia and other leaders of yugoslavia s constituent republics began to seize on nationalism as a useful substitute for communism in a europe freed of its eastwest divide the process culminated in the outbreak of war between serbia and croatia in 1991 in the movie , people ask tito how he could have let this happen a serbian nationalist accosts tito and says he should have handed over absolute power to mr milosevic , and then all the disarray would have been avoided another serb accuses tito of having been a vatican agent who engineered the destruction of yugoslavia in favor of his native croatia mr zilnik was no fan of tito the director , now 52 , was arrested several times by tito s police for making movies critical of his rule but he now views much of the long tito era as positive compared with the current devastation nobody could seize tito s heritage singlehanded , so they grabbed what they could , he said we had the worst elites in the world after his death , a real lumpenelite but exploiting control of the media , they whipped people into this frenzy milosevic is negative , an expression of destruction he started with a local quarrel , and now he has a quarrel with the whole world the dead weight of this quarrel hangs over the movie there is a riveting exchange as a young man tries to explain to tito , convincingly played by the actor dragoljub ljubicic , what is going on in bosnia it is all about gaining control of hills , the young man says are hills worth lives \? tito wonders the commanders who order their boys on believe so , the man answers tito asks whom the hills belonged to in the first place , serbs or muslims that s the terrible thing , the man concludes by the time ownership is proved , everyone will be dead later , tito meets a bosnian refugee , gets angry and wants to know when the war will end there s no end to it , the refugee says , when those who started it are still in power the movie is not without its moments of dark humor looking for marshal tito street , tito is informed that it is now called street of the serbian rulers by god , i was a serbian ruler , too , he grunts mr zilnik said he emerged from the movie with two particular memories the first was of being arrested on the street for making the film and seeing the policemen cower when tito strolled into the police station and said come on , let my friend go he s a harmless movie maker mr zilnik was released the fawning fear of leaders lives on , he said the second memory was of a woman s bleak outburst when tito told her that he was considering returning again in 15 years' time you had better come back before then , because if this continues , in 15 years you might find there s nobody here photo a scene from tito for the second time among the serbs , a candid camera style chronicle of belgradians' reactions to an actor impersonating the longdead leader of a yugoslavia that was not in turmoil
in california , a new world of power is taking shape , and none of the state s three big private utilities may be as ready as the pacific gas and electric company , which has been preparing for the last eight years to compete with outside rivals the california public utilities commission said last month that it was considering issuing an order in august allowing electric producers other than pg e and the two other stateregulated utilities to sell power starting in 1996 to large industrial and commercial customers outsiders can now sell power to the three state utilities , but not directly to customers industry executives and analysts say the commission is almost certain to issue the order , although there may be changes before august the order would probably drive down commercial rates as well as the share of the power market controlled by the three utilities , which also include the southern california edison company and the san diego gas and electric company the three utilities have been taking steps to prepare for the order but none has been more closely watched in the industry than pg e , both because of its size it is the nation s largest private utility and its farreaching moves to change its operations most of the country s 226 private utilities anticipate a competitive freeforall as other states move to follow california s lead in deregulating utilities most utilities are used to a regulatory environment in which they are guaranteed a set rate of return when they build new plants , they generally recover their costs from a captive customer base through rate increases but pg e is no longer operating on that assumption since 1986 , it has drastically cut its staff and stopped building new plants in its own markets to cut costs it has cut the rates of its industrial customers to breed loyalty and has not taken authorized rate increases it has even built new plants in the most lucrative industrial market , the east coast , to ready itself for widespread deregulation we 've spent the last six to eight years getting ready , said robert d glynn jr , a senior vice president of the utility , in an interview the idea is to be in a position to take advantage of new competitive opportunities and not have the residential customer be stuck bearing the cost of this change while the california commission s proposal was expected , the sweep and the speed of the planned changes caught many in the industry by surprise most thought it would be phased in over a longer period and would not apply to so many customers so soon there was a feeling within the industry that there would be time to get ready for the competition , said thomas j keller , a utility analyst for moody s investor service under the proposal , outside producers would be allowed to sell power to large commercial and industrial customers in 1996 and to residential customers in california in 2002 \( until then , these customers may pay higher prices as utilities may be forced to raise rates to make up for lost revenues from large customers \) the power would likely come from producers in a dozen western states , or parts of canada and mexico the proposal by the california commission , long a leader in changing how utilities operate , is being viewed as a big domino that will set off changes in other states if large industrial customers elsewhere see savings in california , they will demand similar treatment in fact , some companies outside california are already putting pressure on their utilities to bring down rates state governments may take steps in that direction to remain competitive with california in attracting new industry , although most are watching the california experiment before trying it themselves such a regulatory shift would be particularly tough on utilities with high rates and large bases of commercial users in the new york metropolitan area , those utilities include consolidated edison , the long island lighting company and the public service electric and gas company other utilities with large industrial customers , like detroit edison , centerior energy in cleveland and philadelphia electric , would also feel the pressure industry analysts say the changes could force some utilities to merge or go into bankruptcy , disrupting service and prompting layoffs and analysts have also been warning investors that the traditionally steady and high dividends of utility stocks may come to an end an indication of the new industry pressures came on monday , when the fpl group , whose main subsidiary is the florida power and light company , said that after paying a dividend rate for many years of 90 percent of its earnings it was cutting that rate to about 60 to 65 percent james l broadhead , the chairman of the group , said the anticipation of greater competition was forcing the company to bring itself more in line with other big utilities wide service area for pg e , the makeover has been daunting based in san francisco , the utility serves a large area 128 million people over 94 , 000 square miles , stretching from eureka in the north to bakersfield in the south
lawyers for the city university of new york told an appeals court yesterday that a speech by dr leonard jeffries , the head of the black studies department at city college , had disrupted the university and hurt its fundraising efforts the university is appealing a federal district court decision last year that reinstated dr jeffries , who was dismissed as chairman after making a speech in albany in july 1991 that was widely regarded as antisemitic kathie ann whipple , a lawyer with the state attorney general s office who was arguing for cuny , said that the university received angry letters after the speech and that she believed the speech had scared off some donors judge joseph m mclaughlin , a member of the threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit , said he had gone through the trial testimony looking for some tangible evidence of some hurt to the university i could n't find any , he said did i miss something \? joseph fleming , dr jeffries s lawyer , said the university could present no such evidence because it had none they have been and remain hellbent on punishing dr jeffries , mr fleming said , because they disagree with his ideas 'poisonous and reprehensible' in may a jury sided with dr jeffries and awarded him 400 , 000 in august , judge kenneth conboy , who had presided over the case , ordered the university to reinstate him , even as he said that dr jeffries had made hateful , poisonous and reprehensible statements during the oral arguments in the appeals hearing yesterday , mr fleming defended the speech , in which dr jeffries blamed rich jews for the black slave trade and said jews and italians had conspired in hollywood to denigrate blacks in films , among other remarks judge ellsworth van graafeiland asked mr fleming , are you saying that it was a fine speech \? yes , your honor , mr fleming responded do you think he will go on making the same kind of speech \? the judge asked i have advised him not to , mr fleming said i would , too , the judge said i disagree with you that it is a fine speech he has a right to say it , but that does n't mean that it s good it is not clear when a decision would be made
charleston , sc , may 29 on saturday evening , three days into the spoleto festival usa here , john kennedy sounded an unofficial keynote in the first of the 20thcentury perspectives concerts he directs at grace episcopal church pointing to a theme of redemption in the programming this year \( most notably in beethoven s fidelio \) , he opened with henry cowell s brash return , written in 1940 when cowell was released from a threeyear prison term mr kennedy directed the series from 1990 to 1992 but bailed out last year after a dispute with the new music director , steven mercurio now everything has changed gian carlo menotti , who founded the festival in 1977 and directed it through 17 seasons , resigned last fall after years of farcical bickering with the board and the city , and milton rhodes , the former director of the american council for the arts , took over as general manager mr mercurio left , and his predecessor , spiros argiris , was reinstated as part of a triumvirate of artistic directors mr kennedy s brief exile has ended and most important , despite dire predictions in menottiloyalist quarters , spoleto has survived , seemingly in fine shape and with a palpable sense of tranquillity before mr menotti s departure , the festival announced that because of a mounting deficit , the season would run only 12 days this year , down from 17 , with the number of events also sharply reduced in fact , mr rhodes has crammed in 110 events , hardly fewer than last year and the debt , he reports , is under control it feels good , he said so here was mr kennedy , among many veteran artists returned from last year or previous years , with monkey business as usual , almost the weird music at 5 series should no longer be referred to that way , he noted , only because it begins at 5 30 indeed , most of the program was weird and wonderful , including drum quartets by james tenney and pivotal works by edgard varese marisol montalvo gave a lovely turn to the soprano solo in somei satoh s anodyne homa , of 1988 but truly unexpected was the 1936 string quartet by johanna beyer , a german emigree who studied with cowell and served as his leonore , mr kennedy said with reference to fidelio the piece made ivesian sport with papageno s aria der vogelfanger bin ich ja from mozart s zauberflote and hinted at a fascinating musical personality mr kennedy promised further explorations of beyer s music in the future , including recordings the festival s continuing commitment to young performers was evident during the day on saturday in two chamber concerts at the venerable dock street theater , with several excellent performances and although spoleto has not yet hung up a shingle specifically for multiculturalism , the international mix was striking charles wadsworth , the pianist and palavererinresidence who directs the chamber series , played a kreisler prelude and allegro with an excellent young violist \( they are everywhere these days \) , nokuthula ngwenyama ms ngwenyama , 17 , is the very personification of multiculturalism , having been born in los angeles to zimbabwean and japanese parents cheeyun \( a korean violinist \) , alban gerhardt \( a german cellist \) and annemarie mcdermott \( an american pianist \) gave a stirring fullbodied account of brahms s bmajor trio cheeyun made some uncharacteristic slips and seemed still to be finding her way into largescale chamber collaboration , but both she and mr gerhardt projected strongly , allowing ms mcdermott to play out in the best brahmsian manner cheeyun , ms ngwenyama and mr gerhardt also gave a brilliant performance of dohnanyi s cmajor serenade under mr menotti , opera was the hallmark of the festival , and again this year , two opera productions are at the heart of the schedule fidelio , which was given its first performance on friday evening , and handel s acis and galatea , which received its second on saturday evening but what emerged seemed selfconscious , almost embarrassed opera in spite of itself both works pose almost insuperable dramatic problems , fidelio famously so , and in each case the director chooses to sidestep them nikolaus lehnhoff opts for the old deconstruction gambit in fidelio at several junctures , an annoying knowitall stands before the audience and pontificates about artifice not only the ruses in fidelio but also the inherent unreality of opera istelf only music and light are what they seem to be , says mr knowitall , who turns out to be the forgiving minister don fernando , played by alan held since any possibility of compelling drama is thus written off , it hardly matters that mr lehnhoff dispenses with all the spoken dialogue , reducing act i to a quick series of set pieces played out on thomas gabriel s abstract sets still , real drama intruded on friday by sheer force of character at the beginning of act ii , when only the ample girth of florestan was visible johan botha , a south african making his american stage debut , took vocal hold of the role better than any tenor in recent memory he showed real metal at the top and baritonal strength below , all held under good control alas , the leonore , ulla gustafsson , a swedish soprano , was no match for him her upper register , lacking support , was widely variable and unreliable clare gormley and john horton murray applied clear , smallish voices to marzelline and jacquino alicja mounk conducted the wellhoned festival orchestra with vigor and subtlety , although it took her much of the first act to synchronize stage with pit as for acis , the director , ulderico manani , writes it is an opera in which no special event occurs it is more appropriate to speak of contemplation rather than of action perhaps acis , a shepherd , loves galatea , a water nymph the cyclops polyphemus takes a shine to galatea , too , and , spurned and jealous , mortally clobbers acis with a boulder galatea magically brings acis back to life as a spring but mr manani does not even make an attempt at persuasive drama , and what he offers for contemplation throughout this gentle romp is unedifying and often ghastly nymphs and swains in nikes and sweats seem ready for a softball game in central park the littered set is elaborated with hoary cliches \( a popup bed of roses for happy we \) and wretched puns \( polyphemus as a biker cyclops on a cycle , with a headlight for an eye , get it \? \) of myth , mystery , unforced whimsy , there is none yet this is a glorious score , which no number of unwelcome distractions could entirely eclipse one ditty , polyphemus s o ruddier than the cherry , has proved literally unforgettable , sticking in the memory over decades between hearings then again , there seemed no reason to want to forget it until aurio tomicich mauled it here maria fortuna did well by acis alexandra papadjiakou was merely serviceable as galatea joel sorensen , with a light , almost frail tenor , was more annoying than this opera s knowitall , jason , should be joseph flummerfelt , the festival s third artistic director , conducted exuberantly his usual charges , the westminster choir , sang with the usual assurance for the most part , but looked utterly ill at ease on an opera stage acis and galatea seems suddenly to be gaining popularity , with a spate of recent recordings both of the original and of mozart s more fully orchestrated german version can anyone tap its magic onstage the way mark lamos did with mozart s re pastore at glimmerglass in cooperstown , ny , a few years ago \? the festival runs through sunday , with dance , theater and visualarts events as well as music photo in the cast of acis and galatea at spoleto were , from left , alexandra papadjiakou , maria fortuna , aurio tomicich

belmont park will close its 40day autumn meeting today with mike smith riding high and with a 23 percent increase in attendance that reverses the trend of recent seasons at most race tracks and some history will be marked on tuesday when the new york racing scene shifts to aqueduct in queens , 100 years after the gates first opened smith has been making the winner s circle regularly all year as the rider on major horses like sky beauty , devil his due , lure and holy bull , the leading candidate for horse of the year none of those horses were running on belmont s final weekend , but smith was riding and closing in on more of the titles and honors that made him the nation s leading jockey the last two years the 29yearold rider from new mexico scored a double coup yesterday he rode two more stakes winners and matched the national record of 62 stakes victories that he set last year and he clinched the championship of belmont s fall season even before the season closed , beating out jerry bailey and julie krone when the weekend began , smith stood four victories short of matching his record for stakes riding but on friday night at the meadowlands in new jersey , he rode winners aboard cinnamon sugar in the long look handicap and aboard the 241 long shot conveyor in the meadowlands cup so , he needed two to tie when he went to work at belmont yesterday for an afternoon of racing fashioned as a showcase for the breeding business in new york he was booked in six of the seven stakes for new yorkbred horses , and he missed on four mounts but scored on the two others , starting with the 45 favorite corma ray in the hudson handicap then he won the big one aboard the 65 favorite itaka in the empire classic , outrunning terrorist by two and a half lengths and matching his own record of success in stakes races it s funny , he said , it s like i'm going after someone else s record hopefully , i 'll be able to break it and take december off it s been five years since i had a vacation as for the belmont title , smith went to work yesterday leading bailey by 35 winners to 34 , with krone a distant third but bailey was riding at keeneland in kentucky yesterday and was scheduled to ride at laurel in maryland today and krone was en route home from a week s visit as a guest jockey in hong kong uncertainty at aqueduct aqueduct opened for business 100 years ago , but closed from 1956 to 1959 for rebuilding , and it has evolved over the years into the home of winter racing in new york the future of both aqueduct and winter racing is unclear these days the new york racing association would like to take a sixweek intermission each winter to cut financial losses gov mario m cuomo wants to keep it open to preserve the jobs of the winter racing stables and to sustain business for the offtrack betting system the only thing certain , as aqueduct opens its meeting , is that it will run six days a week between now and the end of the year , with post time at 12 30 pm it will be closed every monday and also on christmas eve and christmas day but in the new year , it seems likely that the track will close two days a week , although the dark days have not yet been designated some simulcasting is expected from gulfstream park in florida , even though last year s experiment with television betting proved a disaster when snowstorms forced the cancellation of 15 racing programs however , last year s format will not be revived five television races from gulfstream interspersed with seven live races at aqueduct the two racing programs reportedly will be kept separate this time , with special betting windows likely for the florida action paradise creek rolls on paradise creek outran a field of american and european horses by five and a half lengths yesterday as he won the 600 , 000 washington international at laurel in maryland and established himself as a strong candidate for honors as the turf champion of the year the 5yearold son of irish river took the lead turning for home and extended it down the homestretch over redcall , who edged the english horse beneficial for second place by a nose the winner ran the mile and a quarter on the turf in 1 593 5 , just onefifth of a second off the track record , returned 240 and earned 360 , 000 to raise his career winnings past 24 million
cincinnati , june 3 bret saberhagen called it painless that is exactly what the mets wanted to hear tonight at riverfront stadium , saberhagen s previously sore back did not plague him on the mound and it definitely did not bother him at the plate in his first start since experiencing back spasms in pittsburgh nine days ago , saberhagen pitched eight impressive innings and scored the winning run as the mets defeated the cincinnati reds , 43 , to even their season record at 2626 saberhagen gave up seven hits , two of them homers , but he also struck out nine and walked none to earn his sixth victory i was real surprised that i had the control to hit the corners with the fastball , said saberhagen , who altered his delivery to relieve pressure on his back but as far as throwing is concerned , i was hoping i 'd be able to go late in the game and get the ball to johnny saberhagen retired the final eight batters he faced , three on strikeouts , before turning the ball over to john franco , who closed for his 13th save he pitched super , manager dallas green said of his starter he maintained his stuff i did n't see any letup i felt that that was a great effort and we had the right guy out there while saberhagen pitched at riverfront , dwight gooden got the victory for class aa binghamton in an impressive rehabilitation start and paul wilson , who the mets made baseball s top pick in the free agent draft thursday , pitched florida state to a 63 victory over louisiana state in the college world series in omaha three of our big pitchers won today , said green , pleased by the thought the biggest victory , though , came from saberhagen , who halted a mets' threegame losing streak with remarkable control on the mound initially convinced he would not have to miss a turn in the rotation , saberhagen complained that his back felt sore earlier in the week and ended up missing one turn in the rotation tonight , though , saberhagen s only complaints were about a few mistake pitches that cost him a few runs we get three runs and i ended up giving them up , said saberhagen , who is 62 if i would have held them , i would n't have needed the double after hal morris tied the game with a home run in the reds' sixth the second home run for cincinnati , the first coming from kevin mitchell saberhagen hit a line drive to center that bounced over the outfield wall for a groundrule double with two out in the seventh jose vizcaino then singled up the middle to score him and put the mets ahead , 43 that run saved saberhagen , who had been given earlier run support from david segui s runscoring double and homer , and ryan thompson s runscoring single inside pitch bobby bonilla said friday that he had spoken privately to center fielder ryan thompson about his fielding efforts two weeks before his public dressingdown of thompson in the mets' dugout wednesday night at shea stadium , and that he did not regret his decision to question thompson in front of his teammates i 've never done anything that i have n't told him to his face that i was going to do , bonilla said he knew what i was going to do everything is to make ryan the best player he can possibly be thompson reacted angrily to bonilla s remarks on wednesday and the two had to be separated by teammates but bonilla and thompson were spotted with their arms around each other , laughing , near the batting cage before friday night s game the mets activated kevin mcreynolds from the disabled list and he started in left field
chicago , aug 26 the customers in the coffee shop were talking politics health care , the deficit , mandatory prison sentences a television behind the counter was tuned to the news as the screen flashed on the united states senate , the crowd grew quiet , waiting for some impassioned oratory from that august chamber what they saw was alfonse m d'amato , the republican senator from new york , bouncing jovially and singing to the tune of old macdonald here a pork , there a pork , everywhere a porkpork standing next to a huge picture of a pink pig feeding at a trough , intended to symbolize the waste in the crime bill , which the senate passed late thursday by a vote of 61 to 38 the next image on the screen was that of senator frank r lautenberg , a new jersey democrat , countering mr d'amato s claims with nonetoosubtle references to what gets shoveled out of a pigpen a restaurant worker shook his head in disbelief and mumbled something in spanish several patrons groaned in embarrassment what a show , sighed joe riehl , a 37yearold video technician i do n't think we can lay much hope on the guys in washington coming up with answers to our problems americans seem to be little amused by the state of affairs in the nation s capital these days judging from dozens of interviews around the country , from the suburban culdesacs to the ganghaunted pockets of tattered urban neighborhoods and to little towns ringed by cornfields , voters increasingly see a government so riven by partisanship that civic duty seems to have become an afterthought and the truth seems as malleable as putty even president clinton s success in pressing congress to approve a bill intended to fight crime an issue that most americans say is their top concern has left many voters confused about what exactly is in the bill or has been taken out after all the wrangling , and skeptical about what the legislation can accomplish it s all smoke and mirrors , groused wayne konecny , a 38yearold union pipefitter , clutching a coffee thermos and a rolledup newspaper as he waited to board an el train under a moody gray chicago sky it s not going to do anything but raise my taxes , he snapped the democrats want more social programs the republicans want more prisons neither one s going to do any good pitted against gang members , what s a social worker going to do \?

books of the times the alienist by caleb carr 496 pages random house 22 you can practically hear the clipclop of horses' hooves echoing down old broadway in caleb carr s richly atmospheric new crime thriller , the alienist , set in 19thcentury new york city you can taste the good food at delmonico s you can smell the fear in the air the year is 1896 on a march night so cold that horse waste has frozen in the streets , john schuyler moore , a police reporter for the new york times , is awakened in his grandmother s house at 19 washington square north and summoned to the site of the newly begun williamsburg bridge , on the east river there he encounters the new police commissioner , theodore roosevelt , so grimvisaged that his huge teeth are for a change not snapping inside the bridge s tower , roosevelt shows moore the mutilated corpse of yet another boy from the brothels of lower manhattan a seemingly insane killer has struck once again the task of tracking this madman has been assigned to moore s and roosevelt s old friend from their harvard days , dr laszlo kreizler , who is an alienist , or an expert on mental pathologies \( minds that are alienated from themselves \) , as the novel s epigraph explains these three men became acquainted during their harvard undergraduate years , when kreizler debated william james on determinism , james having argued for free will , kreizler having sided with psychological causation the dredging up of this argument takes us to the philosophical heart of the alienist , which explores the causes of insanity and criminality , and ultimately the nature of evil having been secretly put in charge of the investigation , kreizler begins asking questions about the crimes why do they always occur in a high place near water \? what explains the sexual mutilation \? why are all the victims' eyes gouged out \? what happened to the killer in his or her childhood that would provoke such violence \? kreizler also gains the services of two brilliant forensic specialists , the isaacson brothers , lucius and marcus , whom roosevelt has hired onto his more progressive police force over a sumptuous multicourse dinner at delmonico s , the isaacsons introduce kreizler to new investigative techniques like anthropometry , the measurement of body parts , and dactyloscopy , the science of fingerprinting the isaacsons also believe that dead retinas retain the final images impressed on them they wonder if this explains why the killer gouges his \( or her \) victims' eyes out yet kreizler and his colleagues are not free to investigate these conundrums in a vacuum unhappily , the mad killer works on a schedule apparently dictated by religious holidays and there is an abundance of those coming up as a voice keeps whispering in the back of moore s mind , hurry up or a child will die ! moreover , certain forces are working to thwart kreizler s investigation when j p morgan gathers a group of powerful citizens to confront kreizler and moore , anthony comstock , the notorious censor of the us post office , expresses his outrage on behalf of respectable society 'rank determinism ! ' comstock declared , unable to contain himself 'the idea that every man s behavior is decisively patterned in infancy and youth it speaks against freedom , against responsibility ! yes , i say it is unamerican ! ' mr carr is by and large successful in bringing to life his period thriller an editor at mhq the quarterly journal of military history and the author of the devil soldier , a biography of the american mercenary frederick townsend ward , among other books , mr carr has lovingly evoked not only a physical sense of old new york but the spirit of the time as well , when the powers in charge were worried about unrest among the masses of cheap immigrant labor the only real weakness of the book lies in the stringent rationality of kreizler s investigation the more his logic makes sense the less threatening his quarry seems , at least to the reader for if the murderer is purely the product of negative conditioning , then he or she is somehow drained of evil as moore sums up kreizler emphasized that no good would come of conceiving of this person as a monster , because he was most assuredly a man \( or a woman \) and that man or woman had once been a child first and foremost , we must get to know that child , and to know his parents , his siblings , his complete world it was pointless to talk about evil and barbarity and madness none of these concepts would lead us any closer to him but if we could capture the human child in our imaginations then we could capture the man in fact true , the narrator of the alienist later distances himself somewhat from this outlook by lightly mocking kreizler s radical determinism still , the story s fatalism grows tedious you begin to long for a touch , say , of bad old hannibal lecter nor does it help that throughout most of the story none of the major characters are directly threatened by the killer of course , it is deplorable that children are being murdered but none of them figure strongly enough in the story to arouse the reader s visceral identification still , despite the absence of a truly evil threat and despite the somewhat musty quality of the narrative with its pseudovictorian prose , its mustachetwirling villains and its cliffhanging chapter endings the alienist does keep its philosophical questions simmering and by the time these are resolved we have been caught up in the resolution of the action if mr carr s novel remains somewhat mechanical , its parts are intricate enough to keep us entertained with a simulacrum of the past photo of caleb carr \( andrew semel random house \)
houston , may 9 in what abortionrights advocates hailed as the largest civil award ever against the antiabortion movement , a state jury in houston today ordered two antiabortion groups to pay more than 1 million in punitive damages to a planned parenthood clinic whose operation was disrupted by protests during the 1992 republican national convention here the size of the award , which was slightly more than planned parenthood had sought , elated advocates of abortion rights and raised the prospect that people who had contributed money to antiabortion causes could see some portion go to abortion clinics in the form of damages paid by antiabortion groups leaders of the two groups that were ordered to pay the money , operation rescue and rescue americanational , said that they would never do so and that they would appeal but the fact that the sevenman , fivewoman jury made such a large award in a relatively conservative state like texas had leaders of abortion rights groups contemplating lawsuits in other states where antiabortion protesters have disrupted the operations of abortion clinics abortionrights advocates around the country hailed today s ruling as a new legal tool and said they believed that the threat of large monetary damages might do far more than the threat of jail to deter many abortion opponents from blocking access to clinics or engaging in other forms of protest under today s order , operation rescue must pay 350 , 000 , and its leader at the time of the protests , the rev keith tucci , was assessed 150 , 000 rescue americanational must pay 355 , 000 , and its director , don treshman , was told to pay 155 , 000 leslie sebastian , special projects coordinator for planned parenthood in san diego , said of abortion protesters , they 'll go to jail as a badge of honor , but if you start talking about 'this is going to cost you some money and you 're going to have to pay , ' it s a totally different scenario the rev flip benham , the dallasbased director of operation rescue , said , however , that members of his group would go ahead with plans to demonstrate this month at a new abortion clinic in waco , tex they 're going to have to kill us to bury the message , but i promise you this the message will not die , never , mr benham said speech or blockade \? still , the ruling stunned mr benham and other abortion opponents our breath has been taken away , he said planned parenthood was given a judgment for 1 million because we preached the gospel on a public sidewalk across the street from an abortion mill but neal manne , the lawyer for the local branch of planned parenthood here , said in an interview , when you block doors , when you block patients from entering a building , that s not preaching and praying the jury found that the protesters had conspired to disrupt the clinic s business operations the award was obtained under a section of texas commercial law that the pennzoil company used several years ago to win a 105 billion judgment from texaco inc , which eventually paid 3 billion in the case the law prohibits the purposeful disruption of a business s operation planned parenthood officials also likened their texas suit to a strategy employed by the southern poverty law center in montgomery , ala , which files civil suits against whitesupremacist groups and crippled a branch of the ku klux klan a few years ago by winning a huge civil damage awards from it decision awaited but abortion opponents argued today that freespeech issues were at the heart of the texas abortion case , and they predicted that a ruling in a coming united states supreme court case would give them the basis for a successful appeal in that case , involving a clinic in melbourne , fla , the court has said it will rule on the constitutionality of an injunction that keeps protesters at least a dozen yards from clinics and that creates a 300foot buffer zone in which demonstrators cannot confront someone visiting the clinic without an invitation to do so but kathy patrick , a lawyer for the florida clinic who also represented nine clinics and eight physicians in the houston case , none of whom were seeking monetary damages , said the damages awarded to planned parenthood would be unaffected by any supreme court ruling in the freespeech case this was gardenvariety wrongful interference with business relations , said ms patrick your first amendment rights do not include the right to block access to a place of business the defendants said they would also include in their appeal arguments that the state judge who oversaw the trial , eileen o'neill , had shown favoritism toward abortionrights groups and had once been represented by planned parenthood s lawyer , mr manne , in an electionlaw matter another state judge ruled at the outset of the trial that that relationship did not bar judge o'neill from presiding over the abortionprotest case large award the size of the award 101 million in punitive damages , slightly higher than the 1 million sought by planned parenthood , along with the 204 , 000 in actual damages that the jury awarded last friday was as striking as the precedent it set the actual damages were to reimburse the clinic for lost business and for expenses incurred in providing heightened security measures , including escorts for patients and employees leaders of several abortionrights groups said the jury award was the first in which a commercialconspiracy statute was used to levy an award against the antiabortion movement , and that the award itself was by far the largest against abortion protesters smaller awards , based on actual damages only , have been levied in california , kansas and binghamton , ny , and at least one such case was settled out of court in san diego for well under 100 , 000 , according to research compiled by planned parenthood , the national abortion federation , and the center for reproductive law and policy pleading poverty in at least some of those cases , damages have proved all but impossible to collect , as individual protesters have argued in court that they had little or no assets but pamela maraldo , president of the planned parenthood federation of america , pledged in an interview today that her group would work to seize any assets of the antiabortion groups or their leaders we 'll take cars and houses and whatever in the way of payment they have available , she said in some copies yesterday , a picture caption about reaction to the 1 million verdict reversed the identifications of judy reiner , deputy director of planned parenthood of houston , and kathy patrick , a lawyer for the organization ms reiner was on the right , in the dark jacket photo a lawyer for planned parenthood of houston , kathy patrick , left , getting a hug from judy reiner , the group s deputy director , yesterday after a jury verdict against abortion protesters two groups were ordered to pay more than 1 million to a planned parenthood clinic \( f carter smith for the new york times \) \( pg a16 \)
reading terminal cafe \( spectra bantam , paper , 1295 \) , by ian mcdonald , was hard work i persisted only because of my admiration for mr mcdonald s last novel , the broken land , which created a haunting sciencefictional analogue for the selfdestructive frenzy that has gripped mr mcdonald s homeland of northern ireland unfortunately , the excesses of diction and design that sometimes got in the way of the storytelling in the broken land have grown to appalling dimensions in terminal cafe in a decadent nearfuture america , the development of nanotechnology bioengineering on a molecular level has made possible the resurrection of the dead those who are resurrected retain their memories and quirks of character , although they lose interest in their former attachments they also lose their civil rights in the eyes of the law , they are no longer people this is a promising conceit , capable of sustaining a number of different narrative strategies , from straightforward horror to social satire to philosophical meditation to psychological exploration unable or unwilling to choose his ground , mr mcdonald ends up with an all but incomprehensible mix of tall tales and pseudohistorical lectures that fails to hold our attention , much less engage our intellect or emotions there are five main characters and many secondary figures , all of them larger than life and none of them even slightly sympathetic as if the relationship between meat and dead in his nightmarish los angeles were n't complicated enough , mr mcdonald piles on layer after layer of invention and speculation about designer drugs , cyberpunkish virtuality , space wars , corporate wars and generational wars a reader attempting to make sense of this toomuchness must also contend with the author s penchant for stirring new characters into the mix 10 or 20 pages before he explains who they are and what they are up to at times , even mr mcdonald seems to lose his place the resolution of a key plot element , having to do with the creator of this ghastly world , turns on a violation of the book s basic conceit all writing is a compact with the reader the greater the effort required , the

seamless blending of current and futuristic weather science through an ingenious subplot involving dr mulcahey s equally brilliant but quite differently obsessed brother , he succeeds in dramatizing

the multiple suspects , petty jealousies and rampant adulteries that typically bedevil smalltown law enforcement , but with the incomprehensible behavior of the torku , who are given to comments like i create my universe in brightness , and you create yours in dark you drag us down with you but if this is what you want , it becomes so not surprisingly , the solution to the murder and the solution to the mystery of the torku are intertwined , but in ways i could never have predicted you may not grok everything the denouement touches on the relationship between truth and justice , and how secrets can undermine the fabric of the universe as well as the fabric of society but you wo n't be bored
teopisca , mexico , feb 8 with its neatly kept plaza , wellstocked shops and brightly painted homes , this market town in the southern state of chiapas seems remarkably distant from the peasant uprising that has torn through the highlands and the rain forest not far away until yesterday , teopisca was the calmest town in the state , the mayor , hector alvarez gordillo , said today on monday , hundreds of angry peasants poured into teopisca from outlying farms , seized the town hall and demanded the removal of mr alvarez , the latest in an unbroken and unopposed line of mayors from the institutional revolutionary party of president carlos salinas de gortari and they were not alone other town halls seized around the state , peasants in at least a dozen other villages and towns who were apparently inspired by , but not part of , the rebel zapatista national liberation army were reported by newspapers and television stations to be demanding the removal of the local authorities in at least four , the protesters were said to have taken over their town halls in the last 48 hours by grace , the zapatistas have opened our eyes , said miguel hernandez , 36 , a teopisca corn farmer who said he was a stalwart member of the governing party we do not know them , but we must thank them before , we did not have the valor to do this the protests are among the political aftershocks that have hit chiapas and other parts of mexico even as a ceasefire between government and rebel troops nears the end of its fourth week in mexico city and other cities , protesters have held rallies and marches to press the government to answer the zapatistas' demands for economic aid , the redistribution of land and better treatment for the country s indians opposition parties have echoed the rebels' call for democratic reforms to the political system , growing more vocal despite promises by governing party leaders that further changes will be made before presidential elections scheduled for aug 21 in chiapas , nonviolent peasant groups that the government had hoped to balance against the zapatistas have instead come out more and more forcefully on the insurgents' side the drive against town officials of the governing party appears in at least some instances to be a settling of old scores and local disputes but among many of the peasants of teopisca , where mayor alvarez was accused of offenses ranging from corruption to sloth , the zapatista rebellion appears to have set a deeper example today , as hundreds of farmers in straw cowboy hats and scores of their wives and children milled around the central square , the word they used again and again was awakened that was what the zapatistas , they said , had done to them it has been 60 or 65 years that the authorities have been tricking us , said felipe oseguera , a 56yearold corn farmer they have gotten us very accustomed to the lies , he continued 'i will give you roads i will give you land i will give you everything , but you have to vote for me' when they get into the office , they forget us , and we continue more wretched than ever the campesinos have awakened now things are no longer as they were before as far back as any of the men could remember , there had been only one political party in teopisca , the one known by its spanish initials as the pri several farmers recalled the closest they had ever come to supporting an opposition candidate the time in 1985 when scores of them surrounded men from the town s 10 most powerful families as they met at the lion s club to choose the pri candidate for that year s mayoral election the farmers opposed mario urbina , an accountant , and instead supported the owner of the local hardware store , another member of one of the powerful families but after a 16hour standoff , the farmers said , scores of state policemen came in swinging clubs and rifle butts and drove them from the club mr urbina was duly elected and when the hardware store owner , mr alvarez , was finally chosen in 1991 , he turned out to be just as bad , they said there was a fear before that we would be stopped by the authorities , and maybe we never had the mentality of defending our rights , said braulio gutierrez , 35 , a teacher who began to organize the town s first opposition group , a chapter of the leftist democratic revolutionary party , in 1988 mr gutierrez said that after almost six years he had managed to recruit only about 200 people to the party from the entire municipality of 18 , 160 residents but with a few leaders of a large semicollective farm , the ejido teopisca , he said he had begun thinking in the days after the zapatista uprising that something new must be tried we do not support their method of violence , but we are in favor of their demands , raimundo gonzalez vazquez , 39 , the elected leader of the ejido , said of the rebels mayor denies most charges mayor alvarez sat only a few dozen feet away , telephoning potential supporters he roundly denied most of the accusations against him that he had never distributed promised food and medicines , that he had lied about patching up a dirt road and that he had botched a project to improve the town s water system among people who lived in the town itself there was some support for the mayor but among the peasants , there seemed to be almost none this was like a plant that had never died but never grew , either , said mauricia velazquez , a nun at the local roman catholic church now the earth beneath them has moved , and the plant is growing

louisville , ky so , after all the slipping and shoving in the rough and rainy 120th kentucky derby last saturday , what did it prove \? jimmy jones , a hall of fame trainer , won the derby for calumet farm eight times in partnership with his father , b a jones his superstar , citation , was the last horse to win it on a sloppy track until go for gin did it 46 years later after watching the roughhouse derby on saturday at the age of 85 , he said it did n't prove anything it was like a rodeo everything happened everybody stepped on everybody else s toes holy bull got turned upside down at the start valiant nature got turned upside down on the first turn one incident like that after another you have to give the winner credit because he got there first , and nick zito did a good job getting him there but it did n't prove anything the winner got a springboard start , and never looked back you run them again , and you 'd probably get a different story not even nick zito has any illusions he won the trophy and the first prize of 628 , 800 and the glory of getting go for gin through the maze of miseries into the winner s circle , and he also owns the distinction of winning the grandest race in the land for the second time in four years but he admits that he is not moving on to maryland with a clear shot at sweeping the triple crown , or even at repeating the performance in the preakness no dominant horse went back to the barn saturday at churchill downs these horses are so good , he said , that you ca n't even think one of them might sweep the triple crown you have to go from one race to another and hope for the best look , holy bull might come back and run his race but the derby did n't establish any one of them as the dominant 3yearold in the country remember last year , when the champion of the division was prairie bayou , who fractured a leg and did not survive the belmont stakes in june he won the eclipse award posthumously three different horses won the triple crown classics the same scenario could be rerun this year , but not because there is any shortage of 3yearold stars there are plenty of 3yearold stars this year , but none of them has seized power yet it s not like 1947 when the jones team , pere et fils , blitzed the washington futurity with a threehorse entry starring citation , bewitched and free america , and they ran 123 it s also not like 1948 when they put the twohorse entry of citation and coaltown into the kentucky derby , and ran 12 none of this detracts from what zito accomplished with go for gin , a colt who in his last three races had not been able to catch dehere , holy bull and irgun when it counted most , in the kentucky derby , he was ready he did some clobbering of his own coming out of the gate , straightened out and quickly shot into the lead while everybody else was trying to get untangled after a mile and a quarter , it was go for gin still on the lead with strodes creek closing in full stride but two lengths too late but it did n't prove anything , although it did foreshadow something the second half of the racing year will produce new contenders for the breeders' cup and the final championships in a talented but wideopen class of 3yearolds in fact , charlie whittingham and some other major trainers are basing their strategy on it whittingham , still cunning at 81 , knows that strodes creek has breeding and stamina he did n't even race as a 2yearold , but in his fourth race this year he ran third in the santa anita derby and in his fifth race he ran second in the kentucky derby and , after skipping the preakness , in his sixth race he has a good chance of running first in the belmont then in the second half of the year , more fresh faces will appear scotty schulhofer s undefeated twining skipped the triple crown series entirely in order to get some experience , but he won the withers last week and he is being aimed for the travers stakes in august via the peter pan later this month and they all may be joined by irgun , the horse who beguiled jerry bailey into abdicating his seat in the saddle of go for gin but who then was sidelined by knee chips charlie whittingham considered the question will there be a triple crown this year \? he kind of snorted and replied maybe not in this century the way they 're going in horse racing , we 'll be all casinos by then , anyway
hamar , norway , feb 19 a gold medal for aleksei urmanov \? not likely never had he finished higher than third at an important figure skating competition he was onedimensional , a jumper who broke his ankle in april 1992 and struggled through most of 1993 what good is a jumper who ca n't always count on his jumps \? brian boitano , the 1988 champion , would win at these olympics or viktor petrenko of ukraine , the 1992 champion they were professionals , with style and artistry kurt browning of canada was a fourtime world champion surely , they would finish ahead of the callow urmanov i did not think so , the 20yearold russian said tonight when asked if he thought he could win yet , there it was , the gold medal sparkling around his neck as he spoke to reporters in halting english boitano was not the champion neither was petrenko nor browning urmanov was while the favorites stumbled , urmanov stayed on his feet and won both thursday s short program and tonight s long program he landed eight triple jumps today , skating cleanly if not inspiringly to the music of rossini , winning firstplace marks from six of the nine judges elvis stojko of canada took the silver medal , and philippe candeloro of france won the bronze unwilling to take any big risks , urmanov left out his trademark quadruple toe jump , which he landed in a fifthplace performance at the 1992 olympics in albertville , france he faltered only once with this traditional , conservative approach , losing his balance on a triple flip and nearly crashing into the boards , but he regained his composure and his chance for the gold medal when i made the mistake , it was not a tragedy for me , urmanov said it was just a mistake finally , he has recovered , physically and mentally , from a broken ankle suffered after the 1992 winter olympics , which hampered his jumping and his confidence until he unexpectedly finished third at the 1993 world championships in prague all of his landings became extremely complicated , said urmanov s coach , aleksei mishin he was afraid a little bit to land his victory tonight signaled an ushering out of skating s old guard none of the favorites won so much as a medal boitano finished sixth petrenko recovered from a ragged short program , receiving a perfect score of 6 from the romanian judge for artistic impression , but he could only jump from ninth place to fourth browning skated engagingly to music from casablanca , but he will not look back on his fifthplace finish with any fondness neither will scott davis , the american champion who fell on his first jump , botched the next two and skidded from fourth place to eighth this is the first time since 1976 that an american has not won a medal in the olympic men s competition 'i did n't have the fire' i learned i did n't have the fire , said boitano , who appeared deflated and listless after stumbling on his first triple axel before recovering to land the second one and finish amid a rain of flower bouquets tossed from the stands at the olympic amphitheater rushing in to fill the void were a pair of theatrical young skaters , stojko , who claimed his silver medal in a skating tribute to the late martial arts master bruce lee , and candeloro , the frenchman who took the bronze with a showy performance to music from the godfather stojko , a 21yearold dirt biker and karate black belt from the toronto suburbs , left out a quadrupletoe , tripletoe combination jump that would have been unprecedented at the olympics he altered and stitched his program on the fly , though , and recovered nicely with an improvised triple axel , triple toe to rescue the silver medal stojko received seven scores of 59 for technical merit , but he suffered , as in the past , for his artistic marks , receiving only a 55 from the russian judge candeloro , a 21yearold frenchman , mugged shamelessly to the crowd with an overacted performance to the godfather , a tribute to his italianborn father , and he skated flawlessly until the final seconds of his program , when he reduced a triple axel to a single axel and fell to the ice if not for that fall , and one relatively low mark of 56 for artistic merit , he might have won the gold medal this is a young generation , candeloro said we need time to prove to the judges you ca n't stop evolution , stojko said of the reduced marks that he and candeloro received for artistry things have changed with kung fu and 'the godfather' all skaters do n't look alike they have to realize that there is more than one style of skating , and not always will the classical win over paul wylie , the 1992 silver medalist , described urmanov s victory as one for the laundry list judges , the technocrats who pay more attention to the correctness of the jumps than to inventiveness and passion and interpretation and point of view i think he speaks not from his heart but from his choreography , wylie said still , urmanov must be saluted for sheer persistence , succeeding when his family and his country have fallen apart his mother , who once worked on an assembly line in a defense factory , now cooks in a cafe in st petersburg his father divorced his mother and left when he was young embarrassed , urmanov told those who asked that his father was in prison a summer job for coach money is hard to come by in the former soviet union for skaters as for everyone last summer , one of the rinks in st petersburg was closed to skaters because it was more profitable as a place to store bananas ice time is free , but the russian federation pays only for one hour of training in the morning and another hour at night urmanov earns 50 a month from the federation , so his coach , mishin , works in italy during the summer to make money to pay for costumes before the short program , urmanov trained in the same costume that he competed in , which is unheard of among figure skaters i do n't have a problem , urmanov said i just skate i'm not a politician sometimes there is a problem with ice and with money , but i never think about this much with a gold medal , he will have to think of these problems even less do you think your life will change \? he was asked very much , he said photos elvis stojko of canada landed seven triple jumps to win the silver medal in men s figure skating \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 7 \) aleksei

ask any baseball fan if he \( or she \) would play third base for a major league team for a 500 , 000 salary plus 2 , 500 a game or second base for a 15 million salary plus 10 , 000 a game beyond the 90th game , and that fan could n't answer yes quickly and emphatically enough most fans , in fact , would tell you they would play for nothing of course , none of them have the ability to play major league baseball , but that does n't stop them from wondering how anyone who does could be unhappy playing any position for 500 , 000 or 15 million or any salary major leaguers earn these days tony fernandez is unhappy playing third base for the cincinnati reds bip roberts is unhappy playing second base for the san diego padres the aforementioned salaries and bonuses are theirs fernandez , a career shortstop , wants to play short roberts , who has displayed a career of versatility , wants to play the outfield barry larkin is the reds' shortstop , the best in the national league , and fernandez knew that when he signed with them as a free agent during spring training the padres' strongest area is their outfield , and roberts knew that when he signed with them as a free agent in january these are changing times in baseball the owners want to change the economic system from a getwhatyoucan market to a market fixed by a salary cap the players do n't want a salary cap and note that even national football league team officials are complaining about their new salarycap system rather , they were complaining until the commissioner threatened to fine them for their critical comments in advance of their effort to secure a salary cap , the baseball owners implemented an interim system under which they set out to eliminate the middle class of salaries not players they still want the players but they want them at their idea of a correct salary 350 , 000 for jack morris , for example , instead of last year s 5 , 425 , 000 or 500 , 000 for fernandez instead of 23 million and 15 million for roberts instead of 39 million unlike their collusive assault on free agents in the mid80 s , the owners' strategy to get players at drastically reduced salaries is legal and sensible if they create a twotier salary system of stars and spear carriers and in the process make the spear carriers unhappy , all the better to lure the players into a salarycap system , they reason for the most part , though , players do not grumble about the lower salaries they are forced to accept maybe if fernandez and roberts were making more money , they would not be so unhappy at their present positions but this most likely is not primarily about money in their freeagent forays , the 31yearold fernandez and 30yearold roberts discovered they did n't have much of a market john davimos , fernandez s agent and manager of the world boxing association heavyweight champion , michael moorer , asked toronto for three years at what the club said but davimos denies was 12 million the blue jays , for whom fernandez had a big postseason last year , had no interest in such a lengthy or lucrative deal three weeks into spring training and two agents later , fernandez reluctantly accepted the reds' offer to play third recently , however , fernandez , who always has been unusual , has behaved erratically , tossing his clubhouse chair into a laundry bin , knocking over a clothes hamper and putting items from his locker in equipment bags and storming out of the clubhouse jim bowden and davey johnson have been very above board and very patient with tony , said tom reich , the agent who secured the job for fernandez , referring to cincinnati s general manager and field manager , respectively it s understandable that he s terribly frustrated he lost his spot and a couple million dollars to boot hopefully , it will work out he s better off where he is than sitting at home the deal with the reds apparently includes an understanding that the club will trade fernandez to a team seeking a shortstop if the opportunity arises but no such prospect is in sight pat gillick , the general manager of the blue jays , a team that could use a shortstop , said yesterday that he has no plans to trade for fernandez roberts , hitting only 217 , rejoined san diego in chicago last night after receiving permission to leave the padres for a few days , the club said , to help him cope with stress and pressures that have been bothering him roberts s problems were said to stem more from migraine headaches than playing second base , but he was n't always a happy player the previous two years in cincinnati because of the position or positions he was playing although he is one of the most versatile players in the majors , roberts does n't like changing positions and he does n't like second base but the padres have tony gwynn , derek bell and phil plantier in their outfield , leaving no room for roberts so roberts and fernandez are stuck with their unwanted jobs and their lower but nonetheless livable salaries in these changing times , they should be happy they have any jobs at all photo padres' bip roberts wants to play the outfield and not second base \(

peoria , ariz , feb 28 two reasons for american league hitters to fear the sight of randy johnson this year he expects to pick up where he left off last season and he does n't think he received the proper recognition for what he achieved last season i have n't got a whole lot of respect from my peers , johnson said i do n't need to be respected by them , but they have to face me coming from a 6foot10inch longhaired pitcher whose left arm flings the ball at speeds 95 miles an hour and faster , those words should strike even more fear into the minds and hearts of the people who see johnson from a distance of 60 feet 6 inches no doubts speaking at a closer distance before the seattle mariners worked out today , johnson sounded like a pitcher who no longer has any doubts about his talent and what he can do with it some who hear or read his words might see them as the output of a massive ego , but they are warranted with his performance last season , especially in the latter part , johnson gave notice that he is ready to become the dominant pitcher in the american league roger clemens was the power pitcher of the 80 s , johnson said i feel i'm coming into my own and can be the same type of pitcher johnson , whose wildness and inconsistency have delayed his ascent to that height , led the major leagues in strikeouts \( 308 \) , strikeouts per nine innings \( 109 \) , fewest hits per nine innings \( 652 \) and batting average against \( 203 \) his strikeout ratio was the fourth highest in baseball history , and his 112strikeout lead over mark langston , the runnerup , was the fifth largest lead in baseball history he also was the first lefthanded pitcher to strike out 300 since steve carlton of the phillies in 1972 perhaps just as impressive for what it indicated , johnson did not lead the american league in walks for the first time in four seasons in fact , he pitched 45 more innings than the year before and walked 45 fewer batters but he did lead the league by hitting 16 batters , which might not have been a negative development most of the batters in this league know i can be effectively wild , the 30yearold johnson said i understand from dave valle , who used to be my catcher , that batters do n't want to face me i throw hard and i can be wild batters have to stay on their toes they ca n't dig in on me because they do n't know where the ball is going one of the highlights of last season was the confrontation between johnson and john kruk in the allstar game after a pitch sailed over the lefthanded kruk s head , he swung meekly and wildly at two more pitchers and went gratefully back to the dugout 'a little comedy thing' the john kruk thing was a little comedy thing , johnson said but it was n't funny when i hit mike greenwell in the head if batters do n't feel comfortable up there , i 've won half the battle the other half is getting them out i want the hitter to know when he comes to the plate , it s going to be one of the toughest atbats he has as fearful as he makes the hitters , johnson feels they showed him no respect when they elected jimmy key of the yankees the lefthanded pitcher on the sporting news s allstar team key had an 186 record and a 300 earned run average while johnson had a 198 record and a 324 era maybe they forgot i'm a lefthander or they do n't know where seattle is , johnson said he also feels he was shortchanged in the voting for the cy young award , receiving six firstplace votes to 21 for the winner , jack mcdowell but baseball writers do that voting , and none of them would be foolish enough to stand 60 feet 6 inches away from johnson s left armcw0 on the other hand , johnson noted that many of the league s lefthanded hitters , including john olerud , wally joyner and mo vaughn , disappear from the lineup on days he pitches i guess that s a form of respect , he said don mattingly is the only lefthander who wants to hit against me there was a game last july , though , where all of the cleveland indians enjoyed hitting against johnson they battered him for eight runs in one and onethird innings , prompting manager lou piniella and sammy ellis , the pitching coach , to summon him to a closeddoor meeting they said i had to step up my work program , the pitcher related i have to work harder than other pitchers because i'm a power pitcher , and i'm taller so i have to work on my mechanics more i did that in the second half and it paid dividends in his last 10 starts , from aug 14 on , johnson compiled an 80 record and a 214 era and struck out 103 in 84 innings i do n't feel there s anybody in this league who can do the things i can do , johnson said as nolan ryan said , 'i can carry a team for nine innings and i have the potential to pitch a nohitter every time i go out there' nolan is gone now he s given me his imprint that he feels if anybody is going to duplicate some of the things he s done , it s me i take that as the biggest compliment anybody can give me photo i have n't got a whole lot of respect from my peers , said mariners' randy johnson , who throws at speeds of 95 miles an hour and faster \( associated press \)
the managers of a dozen new mutual funds say they see great growth ahead in many emerging markets , and so they are plunking down money to snatch up bonds bulls buying bonds \? curiously , yes while stocks are the standard way to cash in on growth , managers know that debt works , too and the new funds plan to use that tool for a future they see as very bright the world is changing , said simon nocera , who manages the g t global highincome a fund , the oldest of the emergingmarkets debt funds at just two years from argentina to morocco , emerging economies are opening markets , raising taxes and capping spending in fact , he said , many emerging nations now have better fundamentals than developed ones consider italy and mexico italy , the developed one , has a budget deficit that is nearly 9 percent of gross domestic product mexico , the emerging one , has a surplus the italian debt is 120 percent of g d p mexico s is 22 percent yet , italy is an aa country , mr nocera said , while mexico is still a bb the funds welcome the doubledigit yields that attend low ratings and no wonder global bond funds yield only 55 percent , said amy arnott of morningstar , which tracks the fund industry but the new funds also expect to profit from rising bond values as emerging nations advance and the world sees their lower risk theory aside , how have these funds fared \?

clearly something went wrong , as gen john shalikashvili put it , in the friendlyfire downing of two us helicopters ferrying turkish , british , french , kurdish and american personnel across the exclusion zone in northern iraq the helicopters were reportedly en route to a meeting with kurdish tribal elders to discuss responses to iraqi military pressure in the area the only thing certain is that us fighter pilots mistook the helicopters for iraqi craft and fired missiles at them , killing all 26 on board beyond that there are only questions a needed investigation has already begun needed as well is a reconsideration of us objectives in iraq risky military operations and prolonged economic sanctions are justified only when linked to explicit policy goals the profiles of iraq s hind helicopter and america s blackhawk are different , but it is understandable that fighter pilots flying by at high speed might make a mistaken identification , even in daylight why , though , did none of the fallback safeguards against misidentification then intervene \? what about the flight plans for the helicopter mission that should have been available to the fighter pilots and the awacs radar surveillance plane overflying the area \? why were the electronic signaling devices that identify american military aircraft to each other not operating \? why was it urgent to shoot down a slowflying helicopter already under direct surveillance \? iraq has no history of using helicopters for combat purposes in the kurdish exclusion zone that zone , like a similar one in southern iraq , grew out of the messy sequel to the persian gulf war in the weeks after the ceasefire , iraqi kurds and shiites heeded allied calls to rebel against baghdad but the allies then stood by while saddam hussein used what remained of his army to suppress these rebellions belatedly , the un security council passed resolutions calling on iraq to treat its people humanely on their own , the us , britain and france established noflight zones to keep iraqi aircraft out of the two main rebellious regions but these allied air operations are no longer linked to any coherent policy goals independence for the two protected regions is not the goal because it is strongly opposed by many neighboring states so the rebel regions remain in limbo , under formal iraqi sovereignty but with no way for baghdad to regain control that serves a humanitarian purpose in protecting the kurds and shiites , but it also invites continuous confrontation , of the kind that indirectly contributed to thursday s accident the united states needs a better policy , one that points toward an eventual end of military and economic confrontation after much delay , iraq itself has taken the first steps toward complying with the longterm arms control provisions imposed after the war baghdad argues that its moves entitle it to the prospect of some relief from allied pressure , especially economic pressure the language of the relevant security council resolutions , drafted to us specifications , supports iraq s position and some security council members are now ready at least to take note of iraq s positive steps but the us and britain remain adamantly opposed to any timetable for ending sanctions it is hard to sympathize with iraq s brutal government , which appears to be behind the recent attacks on aid workers , journalists and political dissidents but it serves no american purpose to be trapped in an ugly stalemate with iraq investigating the helicopter tragedy is essential so is revitalizing america s policy on iraq
washington , april 5 hundreds of thousands of boxes of crayons imported from china were recalled today after the government said they contained traces of lead that could poison children who ate the crayons the recalled crayons , most of which were manufactured a few years ago , amount to only a small fraction of the millions of boxes sold each year although very few tainted crayons are thought to be on store shelves , many may be in use and should be discarded or returned to stores for refunds , the consumer products safety commission said the agency said parents and schools should buy crayons and other art materials only if they carry the label conforms to astm d4236 , or a similar phrase , indicating that a toxicologist has determined that the product poses no chronic hazard main brand is found safe the recall highlights a continuing , broad effort to eliminate sources of possible lead exposure , a danger to children that is well established by toxicologists but not fully appreciated by many parents and health professionals agency tests of crayola crayons , the dominant brand with about half the united states market , found them safe among the brands recalled was one sold by the nationwide chain toys r us , and labeled as safe 48 nontoxic i'm a toys r us kid !

trust us , the hockey bosses told the players , the news media , the fans and the whole wide world yesterday afternoon believe us when we tell you we 're losing money , they said , as they sat on the dais at the new york hilton we 're not trying to break a union or take your money , they said , as they announced the postponement of the national hockey league season and who could doubt their sincerity \? sitting right there , speaking in two languages , was marcel aubut of the quebec nordiques near him were neil smith of the rangers and ed snider of the philadelphia flyers two years ago , aubut traded one player , eric lindros , to the flyers and the rangers on the same day it took two weeks and a roomful of lawyers to settle that one sitting behind smith was mike \( i'mnotgoinganywhere \) keenan , the former flyersblackhawksrangers coach , now representing the st louis blues no knife marks were visible in the back of smith s stylish suit coat it s been , oh , weeks since these two statesmen exchanged obfuscations and halftruths after keenan left the rangers in a bitter power struggle with smith it took a commissioner and more lawyers to sort that mess out but what this event really needed was bruce mcnall , partowner of the los angeles kings until last summer , mcnall was the chairman of the board of governors but he s much too busy these days he s negotiating a plea bargain and facing a possible jail term following an investigation of financial fraud this media event was a counterpunch to one held the day before in toronto by the players association , when the workers called the bluff of commissioner gary bettman postponement of the season was necessary , bettman had said , because he could n't risk a midseason strike , like the one in baseball ok , the players countered , why not continue bargaining with a nostrike nolockout pledge \? this won the players a publicrelations coup , so bettman responded with his slick show of solidarity yesterday , just down the street from radio city music hall , home of the rockettes perhaps those dancers could have taught these executives to kick in a chorus line that footage would make the evening news ! no , scratch that they 'd probably put steel toes in their wingtips and go for each other s shins , with all those cameras and reporters around it shows hockey s growth to see that even its labor troubles are now big news the glib commissioner smoothly changed gears yesterday , explaining that the player offer was seductive and that he would think about it , but that he could n't risk being in the same position next fall , with no contract , so why not talk , talk , talk for two more weeks to see how sincere the players are \? it is a transparent effort to buy time and circle the wagons and figure out what to do next for the first time since this showdown began , after slashing player benefits and strutting his power and backing the players into a corner , bettman was on the defensive the twoweek delay is like sending jimmy carter to haiti , said jeff pash , bettman s bright , young counsel and conegotiator perhaps carter should intervene in the hockey talks , using the language of diplomacy , because the players do n't believe the words of bettman , who uses orwellian flourishes to call a lockout a postponement and a salary cap a luxury tax his attempt to restructure the economic relationship is a wolf in sheep s clothing , a plan to hold wages in check while revenues soar in a period of arenabuilding , increased television exposure and 1 billion per year in souvenir sales when the players hold another infomercial today in toronto , they probably wo n't invite chris chelios , the undiplomatic chicago defenseman who issued vague , menacing comments about bettman s safety the other day the folks at the league office were aghast at this crude attempt to intimidate , but they should n't be employees sometimes react emotionally and irresponsibly when someone messes with their medical insurance and threatens to shut down their place of business this is a profession that rewards some employees for fistfighting skills do they think chelios is the only one talking this way behind the closed doors of the locker room \? during formal , polite dialogue , the players keep asking the wealthier owners to show sincerity by taxing their gate receipts and sharing them with their lessfortunate brethren what fun it would be to let them run their fingers through each other s books forget it , say many owners , but bettman hints they might consider it as part of a larger compromise for this union , this sort of stuff is revolutionary a few short years ago , there was none of this sophistication , none of this confrontation the players were led by alan eagleson , a union boss who had more in common with management than with labor his sweetheart contracts were part of the reasons the players dumped him he had so much in common , in fact , that he is under indictment for racketeering eagleson could n't be part of yesterday s show he s in canada , battling the american feds , who want him here to face charges if he shows up in the united states , he might get arrested photo cliff fletcher of toronto , left , and boston s jeremy jacobsflank commissioner gary bettman yesterday as the nhl delivers its message at a news conference \( marilynn k yee the new york times \)
effecting a line drive is among the more unsung pleasures available to humans but as anyone who has done it can tell you , swinging a bat levelly , crushing a baseball and then watching it describe a flat parabola toward the horizon is a jolt at once as potent as morning coffee and as inspiring as fireworks for this , i patronize batting cages in the stepandslash repetition of swinging a bat , i 've discovered the satisfaction of honing a small and unimportant physical gesture i 've learned to savor the occasional joyous confluence of serendipity and skill , the moment when ball and bat meet with the resonant sound of an orchestral wood block \( ok it s tinnier when the bat is aluminum \) here s how it goes you step into a cage , your private tunnel for facing down a nemesis , a mechanical pitcher , and maybe once or twice out of 12 or 15 chances , you get the right pitch , you time it right and , on top of that , your swing uncoils the way you envisioned it beforehand the ball approaches and is launched , and in your body you feel a nothing , a heavenly nonresistance , a sensation akin to fitting the right key into a lock and having the tumblers slide open as if melted my girlfriend , a newly minted fanatic , found another way of describing the moment she did n't play ball as a child , but she has taken to batting practice as a 9yearold boy would , as i did at that age we go to the batting cages together trips that have become more frequent , lately , since the baseball strike started and she 'll keep pumping coins into the machine long after i 've run out of patience or my hands are blistered three more rounds , ok \? she 'll say do you mind \? she s hooked but it was n't long ago that she stood in for her first cuts , and even in the cage marked slow , where the pitching gun looped softballs benignly toward the plate , she could n't find her bearings her stride was off , or she was pulling her hips back even as her arms and shoulders surged toward the ball , or her elbows were tucked in too tightly , robbing her of her own power the balls were popping up or dribbling on the ground her hands were buzzing from the vibrations of having hit too many balls off the end of the bat she was miffed , and , if i recall , she gave me a speech about how unfair it was that women did n't learn how to do this as young girls ted williams , i told her , once famously defined hitting a baseball as the single most difficult enterprise in sports really \? she said , brightening and then , for whatever reason coincidence , her own determination , or , as i like to think , good coaching she found her stroke the pitch came in , her shoulders rolled , her arms extended and the meat of the bat did its work the ball rocketed back out at the pitching machine and spanked sharply off the fiberglas that was protecting it my girlfriend was beaming she came out of the cage and looked at her hands that felt so great , she said it was like a wonderful silence visit to the past like the typewriter as a writing implement , the volkswagen as transportation and even baseball itself as a pastime , the batting cage has probably passed its moment as a primary diversion there are n't many of them that stand alone anymore it has been ages since i 've driven by one on an unfamiliar highway and thought , hey , why not stop for a while , something that used to happen pretty frequently instead they are usually banished to far and generally littleused corners of carnival venues or amusement parks , places where there are many other , more recently invented games to play indeed , to spend a rainy afternoon , as i did , at sportime usa , an indoor amusement emporium in elmsford in westchester county , is to understand why baseball has lost its premier place in america s recreational pantheon children between 4 and 16 were engaged in every conceivable mechanical and electronic diversion , but they were treating the batting cages with almost complete indifference \( i'm actually of two minds about this unlike donkey kong , batting cages can be dangerous a brooklyn boy was recently struck in the chest and killed by a ball pitched by a machine and though one would like to see an interest in baseball on the part of youngsters , the cages require a kind of adult supervision that was supplied by none of the halfdozen places i visited recently and though all of the places provide batting helmets , there was no insistence on the part of anyone anywhere that hitters wear them , and many did n't sportime usa does ask that participants sign a form acknowledging the dangers and absolving the management of responsibility , but nonetheless , in my afternoon there , many of those who entered the cages did n't bother with the forms , and i witnessed a couple of neardisasters in one , a distracted boy wandered aimlessly into a cage where a rather large batter was ready to swing and in another , a terribly small boy , watched by an apparently uninformed grandmother , stepped up to the plate at first he stood on the plate in a cage where the pitching was much too fast for him , and he was nearly beaned \)
chicago , april 7 michael jordan , the 31yearold rookie right fielder for the white sox , spoke with a few reporters before the exhibition game against the cubs in wrigley field this afternoon what if i got a hit today \? he said you guys would fall over , would n't you \? the reporters smiled , but courteously withheld comment michael jordan smiled that internationally famous smile , the one that has accompanied him as the star of basketball courts , commercials and home videos and then he left to play the game in the press box , in the white sox half of the sixth inning , a few reporters and others in the stands may not have fallen over , but they thought about it , when jordan , on a 32 pitch by lefthander dave otto , hit a high chopper that bounced off the top of the glove of the leaping third baseman for a runscoring single the crowd gave him a standing ovation , and the great smile emanated from the lean , 6foot6inch person standing on first base the very next inning , there was reason to fall over again , for jordan cracked a gametying double down the thirdbase line the crowd erupted again it was a great feeling just to come out and do well , said jordan afterward in major league ball parks , michael jordan , for his career , is batting 400 , an average ted williams would not be ashamed of jordan went 2 for 5 today he batted in two runs , scored one astounding even though jordan is considered by many the greatest athlete on the face of the earth , the man who led this town s bulls to three straight nba championships in the last three years , the man known as air jordan for his ability to fly through the air without aid of cape or propeller , he has hardly shown , in his widely reported experiment this spring , that he is a baseball player especially a baseball hitter but none of this held back a capacity crowd of 37 , 825 , nor did it keep others from paying handsome prices to watch the game from the rooftops of threestory buildings across the street from the ball park gets a cheer it was not the finest day that a firstyear player ever had , but it will do , and the hits in fact salvaged what might have been a tepid , if not embarrassing , outing jordan went out meekly his first two times at bat , and he made two baserunning mistakes after his double first , he failed to score on a subsequent double because he tagged up at second base on the drive to the outfield instead of positioning himself halfway to third base when the next batter grounded to third , jordan was caught off the bag and tagged out in a rundown he also misplayed a single in right field , allowing the batter to go to second , as well as permitting a run to score when he caught a fly ball in the sixth inning , he was cheered mightily , if not somewhat sardonically he proved that catch was no fluke by gloving another an inning later when the right fielder trotted out to his position to start the game for the white sox on this chilly but sunny afternoon , the fans in the bleachers bowed and cheered he was treated like royalty , which , in chicago terms , he is when the right fielder came to bat for the first time , hitting sixth and leading off the second inning , the cubs pitcher , a young prospect named lance dickson , brushed him back on the first pitch and then forced him to pop up to first base on a 30 offering jordan was made to look like a rookie in the next inning , he looked confident at bat , not fishing for balls outside , and fouling off one 32 pitch before grounding to short on an offering by chuck crim in the ninth inning , with the score tied 44 and a runner on first with one out , jordan batted with a chance to put his team ahead like another legendary ballplayer , named casey , jordan struck out , going down on three pitches , the last one called game ends in a tie the game ended after 10 innings in a 44 tie manager gene lamont of the white sox , commenting on the fielding and baserunning mistakes by jordan , said improvement would come with experience , which he hoped jordan would gain in the minor leagues in birmingham but he has a lot to work with , lamont added before the game , jordan said that the thing he thought was most important , and most different , about baseball in comparison to basketball , is the aspect of patience in basketball , he said , you can be more active in trying to produce but the more games i play , the better i think i 'll become after having suddenly and stunningly left the world of basketball last october , he came out of sports retirement within months to pursue what some have thought was a whacky dream that of becoming a bigleague ballplayer he has spent the last two months with the white sox and their minorleague affiliate , the class aa birmingham barons and the sox decided to bring him to chicago for this annual city series game against the cubs after all , it would n't hurt ticket sales , and jordan was all for it unexpected start he was n't scheduled to start until lance johnson , the regular center fielder for the white sox , was hit on the arm by a pitch in toronto on wednesday darrin jackson was moved from right to center , and the sox decided this was a perfect opportunity to show off their moreorless middleaged prospect after the error you kind of secondguess yourself , said jordan i was able to bounce back i'm very proud of myself for just staying in there after the game , he flew to birmingham , where he will start his regularseason professional career on friday night he smiled again when he left , but it appears he is not kidding photo michael jordan of the white sox driving in a run against the cubs yesterday with a sixthinning base hit \( reuters \)
uniondale , li , oct 22 herb williams has probably heard the question more times than he cares to remember how much longer , the 13year veteran was asked , can he play in the nba \? williams , who will turn 37 in february , paused for effect and then delivered his measured reply probably until i'm about 50 , he said , a slow smile spreading over his face wishful thinking for someone not named moses \( he can still play , williams said of old man malone \) but it s obvious williams has thought about it and when pressed , he finally conceded the way we play here , it s hard to say probably two or three more years that the next two would be in a knicks uniform was by no means a certainty this past offseason williams became an unrestricted free agent on july 1 and there was some question as to whether the knicks would attempt to resign him , though there was plenty of interest elsewhere around the league but none other than patrick ewing the man williams has backed up the past three seasons went to management over the summer and stated his desire for the team to resign his understudy i had a lot of offers , said williams , who finally signed a twoyear pact with the knicks on aug 30 it all depended on what they wanted to do there are those who see williams as something of a luxury for a veteran knicks squad why , the argument goes , have a guy that old as a back up for ewing when if something happens to him you might as well be grooming a younger player because you 're not going anywhere anyway williams s teammates do n't see it quite that way he is a luxury , rivers said he s the best backup center in the nba i do n't think you 'll get an argument on that harper agreed some guys that start do n't know the game the way he knows it , he said and i'm talking about the small details , every part i think herb will make a tremendous coach one day he s one of the few guys i really listen to when he gives me advice while williams is a crowd favorite the chants of herrrrb ! resonate through the garden every time he scores it is more because he seldom plays than because the fans realize how good a player the young herb williams was that does n't bother me , said williams , who averaged 199 points per game for indiana in 198586 i know what i can do when i get the ball consistently when i get it with any kind of regularity , i do n't have any problem scoring but williams also knows that is not his role here i provide quality minutes , he said basically , i go in , play defense , block shots and rebound for the time patrick s not in there it s not like they 're coming down and running plays for me with ewing still recovering from offseason knee surgery , williams has been the starter this preseason and is ready to step in if anything happens to the franchise here this afternoon in the knicks' 115101 loss to utah , he showed he could score when needed , getting 8 of the knicks' first 11 points and hitting his first 6 shots he finished 6 of 9 for 13 points asked what happens if ewing goes down during the season or is hampered in his recovery , williams said then , everything changes for me i would then have to think more along the lines of doing a lot more i would go from sitting to playing a certain role and if that happened , we definitely need scoring out of that position the knicks are praying that does not happen but regardless , they always know what they are going to get from williams he can play 48 minutes or he 'll play none and he 'll do the same thing every game , said rivers maybe not until he is 50 but at least for a couple more years rebounds karl malone scored 23 points and john stockton added 19 as utah handed the knicks their first preseason defeat in five exhibitions saturday afternoon before a sellout crowd of 16 , 232 at nassau coliseum john starks had 23 points on 6for16 shooting for the knicks there were 52 fouls whistled today as opposed to 84 on friday as a result , the game was about 15 minutes shorter photo as utah s david benoit watches , knicks' herb williams shoots during jazz s 115101 victory yesterday \( alan zale for the new york times \)
concerned about a published report in which unnamed players were quoted as questioning the team s offensive philosophy , the knicks held a cleartheair team meeting after yesterday morning s shootaround the 39minute lockerroom summit came in the aftermath of anonymous quotes from two players published in yesterday s editions of the daily news the unnamed players reportedly complained about a lack of diversity in the knicks' offense , saying that coach pat riley s offense had become overly dependent on patrick ewing , especially late in games considering their 2611 record heading into the game last night against the phoenix suns , none of the players wanted to overreact but the front office , and most players were upset about this latest distraction for a number of reasons regardless of where the quotes came from , the matter was a distraction players wondered who made the statements and even if one or two players were upset about the knicks' offense and shot distribution , their overall goal , winning a championship , remained much more important after the meeting , none of the players admitted to making the comments after the meeting , none of the players admitted to making the comments late game problems the knicks' lategame predictability has been a topic all season , but it became magnified after their losses to the orlando magic on friday and to the philadelphia 76ers on sunday in both games , almost all of the knicks' lategame set plays featured either ewing or john starks as the first option whether riley will make adjustments remains to be seen but the bigger issue is whether the team will remain unified , regardless of who takes the most shots charles smith s return from knee surgery has created a crowded situation in the frontcourt , with smith , anthony mason , anthony bonner , and charles oakley all vying for minutes the battle for minutes will become even more intense once hubert davis returns from hand surgery next month one or two players complaining about their role , or the offense , was not enough to make the front office lose its composure it s a trivial issue , and i'm not going to comment in depth on it , said dave checketts , the knicks' president pat riley is the best coach , and we 've got a talented team during the course of the long season , there are going to be distractions if you do n't address them right away , they have the potential to become bigger than what they are but i'm not concerned players talk about it not only did riley address the team during the meeting , but players talked among themselves after riley left smith thought the meeting served a purpose , saying we do n't want to get to the point where we do n't back each other when times are tight , we have to stick together asked what riley said during the meeting , smith said he felt maybe one or two guys were getting off the same focus he said , 'we 're winning , keep , your eye on the prize' oakley wanted to know where the comments came from , because he said he disagreed with them we 'll find out , sooner or later , oakley said they 're going to tell somebody like the fbi , when you get a clue , you 're going to follow it
yellowstone national park , wyo after more than a century of policy flipflops that saw the gray wolf go from the most loathsome animal in america to the celebrated subject of perhaps the most extensive environmental impact statement ever done , the mythic predator is a single court hearing away from a formal return to the west that it has taken two decades , 120 public hearings , directives from six presidents , dozens of congressional committees and 12 million worth of studies to get to a point where wolves could soon run through yellowstone national park tells much about the heavy load of significance that has been saddled on the wolf what federal biologists hope to do in early january is to return a predator with a lust for fresh meat back to a part of the country that is overrun with moose , elk and deer staples of a wolf s diet but even as yellowstone park rangers put the final touches on oneacre pens to be used to acclimate the wolves to the park s lamar valley , cattle and sheep ranchers are balking at the turnabout in attitudes and policy the ranchers , the biggest beneficiaries of the campaign 70 years ago to eliminate the wolves from the west , have filed a lawsuit that threatens to hold up the project on dec 21 , a federal judge in wyoming will decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction for those most passionate about bringing the wolf back , the project is viewed as a grand restorative deed , balancing a zealous act of one era with a corrective act of another it is absurd , they argue , that wolves still roam free not far from the urban masses of rome , but are not yet allowed inside north america s largest temperate zone ecosystem , the greater yellowstone area without wolves , the world s first national park is a heart without a heartbeat , in the words of renee askins , founder of the wolf fund , a wyoming group devoted to returning the animal to this area under the plan , 30 wolves in canada , tagged with radio collars so biologists can track them , are to be released into yellowstone and into the wilderness of central idaho , 15 to each area eventually , over five years , the plan is to establish a population of about 150 wolves in each area but one person s call of the wild is a rancher s nuisance with a 1 , 500poundpersquareinch bite the ranchers see an america where less than 2 percent of the population works the land and where beef prices continue to fall with declining demand when wolves were a fact of the area , most people made their livelihood from the land , said bill wheeler , a thirdgeneration rancher in western montana now , only 1 1 2 percent of the population is involved in agriculture , and the other 98plus percent have been indoctrinated by a disney mentality about the wolf studies in minnesota , where nearly 1 , 700 wolves live among dairy farms , and in northwest montana , where a few wolves have trickled down from canada , show that very few domestic animals are killed by wolves the rate in minnesota is less than one loss per 10 , 000 cows and in montana , dogs kill far more sheep than does any wild predator federal biologists say fewer than 20 cattle and 110 sheep a year would be lost to wolves near yellowstone but if livestock loss is not the real issue , what exactly has made wolf restoration such a complicated , divisive and expensive effort \? ranchers say keeping the wolf out of the west is a symbolic stand for control wolves , like bison , were eliminated from the west to make way for cows and sheep some farmers think they are being pushed aside now to allow a bit of the wild back into the equation with restoration , they fear , will come a host of regulations until very recently , the score stood at cows , 99 , 200 , 000 wolves , 0 , rick bass wrote in his book , the ninemile wolves \( clark city press , 1992 \) now , even in their own communities , ranchers seem to be losing the spin battle once viewed overwhelmingly as the embodiment of lechery and predation , the wolf has become such a cuddly favorite that agriculture groups have tried to force school boards in the west to present them in a less sympathetic light a few years ago schoolchildren in bighorn , wyo , a tiny ranching town on the front range of the rocky mountains , were asked to conduct a mock civic debate on the wolf to the surprise of their parents , none of the middleschool children wanted to take the side against wolves , teachers said a 1991 poll by the fish and game department in wyoming , perhaps the most conservative state in the west , found that a majority of those surveyed favored a return of the wolf and surveys in yellowstone park have shown that visitors favor a return of the wolf by 6 to 1 this change is all the more remarkable considering what the federal government did over a 50year period to demonize and eliminate the wolf from the 1870 s to the mid1920 s , up to 1 million a year was paid in bounties for dead wolves the animals were tortured , burned and poisoned by the thousands , all the while portrayed as childeating sneaks by the 1930 s , nary a single wolf could be found in all the west
storrs , conn as the college class of 1994 approaches graduation , it is that nervous time when parents who have not nagged once in four long years find themselves blurting out , have you found a job \? jeremy palmer , an engineering student at the university of connecticut here , is one who , somewhat to his surprise , does have a job , at general electric before his successful internship at ge during the semester break , he said , i had almost been locked into graduate school but to mr palmer and his classmates , who entered college at the start of a recession and are leaving in what economists are saying is the first foothold of a recovery , landing a first job out in the real world is not what it used to be as college career officers across the country sound their final alarm this month , they are telling seniors that the job market is improving , even in the northeast , where the recession hit hard but after four years of cutbacks and reorganization and , plainly put , mass dismissals at the great names of american industry and finance , students know the market has changed , perhaps for their lifetime it may always have been a jungle out there , but they sense they are stepping back into the kind of workplace jungle that upton sinclair would recognize , one where loyalty is a luxury and security a dangerous illusion people have been warning us , especially our parents , that you need to have an escape plan , mr palmer said what i mean is , that once you 're over 40 , companies are likely to weed you out you have to be prepared to start your own business or change careers with nearly 3 , 000 seniors graduating with degrees in liberal arts , business , engineering and health , the university of connecticut offers a wide window into the changing job market and the evolving expectations of employers and their potential employees career officers at the university say they know the job market is finally improving because more employers are coming to them at the peak , in the late 1980 s , 400 employers a year came to campus to interview seniors at the nadir , in 1992 , 150 did this year , the number should pass 200 , said gene policelli , assistant director of the department of career programs as important , he said , as many as 100 companies with job openings call his department each month , asking for the resumes of qualified students what i suspect , with this class , is that there is less frenzy about landing a job , mr policelli said not less anxiety , less frenzy no one s surprised by what s out there for most students , february is a month for basketball fever , with both the men s and women s teams ranked in the top 10 nationally this year but for seniors , it is the month when career officers offer workshops on preparing resumes , interviewing , searching and networking mock interviews are conducted students start submitting their resumes for the real interviews sit down front could i ask of you a favor \? mr policelli said to 25 students gathered in a lecture hall one afternoon , none seated within 10 rows of where he stood all of you who would like jobs , please sit down in the front seconds later , everyone rearranged , he continued , what i really want to do today is psych you up to give you some hope that there is hope , and to put the fear of god in you that it wo n't happen unless you get out there the message that mr policelli and his colleagues deliver is doubleedged the whole concept of employment has changed , he warned downsizing is real that tremendous work force we had is not coming back but even companies that are dismissing thousands of older , experienced , higherpaid employees , he said , still need entrylevel workers , especially those with the skills to step right in and do the work piling up on vacated desks maybe instead of hiring 10 , they 'll hire 3 , he said so it s more competitive , but they 're hiring even getting a campus interview is competitive , he said most recruiters talk to only a dozen students many companies want to see only students with gradepoint averages above 30 this bothers us , he said , confiding that the university does not screen out students with averages below an employer s cutoff point we 've done some research , and we 've found there s absolutely no correlation between a high gpa and success on the job yes ! someone in the rear said softly but firmly there s your hope , mr policelli said afterward , students talked about their plans lisa diamond of newington had built up her resume with a double major in psychology and journalism , an internship with the state alcohol and drug abuse commission and , last semester , had worked full time at a law firm back on campus , she finally had time to think about life after graduation i just want a job with benefits , she said padrick power of west hartford was hearing contrary advice adults were steering him toward sales , classmates toward teaching his father had advised him not to worry about his philosophy major he told me , 'you 're going to have to change careers anyway not jobs careers'
los angeles you 've probably never heard of cynthia rothrock but whose fault is that \? certainly not the motion picture industry , which pumps out star vehicles for her with alacrity certainly not cable television executives pay services like hbo , showtime and cinemax program her movies sometimes three or four a week and certainly not cynthia rothrock , who armed with an amazing talent , an interesting biography and a high tolerance for pain and sexbased inequity has been battling for your attention for years so pay attention , please , if only this once when ms rothrock was a 13yearold growing up in scranton , pa , she started taking karate lessons because her best friend s parents had opened a private gym soon she was traveling every weekend to manhattan to take classes with a master teacher when she became the world women s karate champion in forms and weapons peaceful disciplines more akin to rhythmic gymnastics than to street fighting or kickboxing she defended her titles for five straight years , putting up with a nonstop training regime and negligible prize money , just for the pride and honor of it all when she heard that a hong kong film company was looking for a new leading \( and fighting \) man , she went along to the audition with a group of her male karate buddies , just for laughs that was 9 years and 20 films ago today her movies , with titles like fast getaway , and blonde fury , are staples of the paycable and home video markets they do not play in american movie theaters and hence are not widely advertised or reviewed , but they are seen two nights ago , for example , hbo offered a rothrock double feature , followed by another of her movies on showtime as the only real female counterpart to bigbudget american martial artists like steven seagal and chuck norris , she receives reams of fan mail , particularly from 15 to 20yearolds for all that , she gives the appearance of being almost untouched by the effects , both positive and negative , of hollywood fame the guy from the federal emergency management agency came to check my house for earthquake damage , she recalled , shaking her head in wonder he could not believe that he was actually meeting me she adds i feel good about myself i'm working steadily the audience for my movies is out there which is not to say that a single celebrityconscious head turns as ms rothrock , a rather petite woman in a midcalflength print dress , has lunch at a trendy west hollywood restaurant overseas , her movies play theatrically in countries where action movies are especially popular , like germany or indonesia , she cannot walk in public without being mobbed how famous am i \?

early this month , at a lecture sponsored by new york s architectural league , frank gehry took a shot at those who have been calling on architects to be more socially responsible it was n't a cheap shot it was an honest , spirited defense of values that matter deeply to gehry and should also matter to anyone who cares about the vitality of the art form he practices but as a critique of what is going on in architecture today , his comments somewhat missed the mark not long ago , gehry told the standingroomonly audience , he had turned down an invitation to join a panel discussion on star architects and social responsibility he was right to smell a setup the mere pairing of those two phrases is implicitly judgmental stars , after all , are n't meant to be responsible they just twinkle star architects like gehry , went the unstated message , do n't really give a damn about the homeless they just want to glorify themselves with snazzy artistic statements just being an architect is an act of social responsibility , mr gehry said even the strangest concoctions of our imaginations have to do with humanist values with people , society and context we 're all part of the human fabric and to have this backlash now is strange i suppose it s human but i wish people would stop it this was n't the first time gehry had been put on the defensive in city of quartz , a 1990 book about los angeles , mike davis assailed gehry s hip portfolio \( the goldwyn library in hollywood , the loyola law school building in los angeles \) as a nostalgic evocation of revolutionary constructivism and a mercenary celebration of bourgeoisdecadent minimalism still , not everyone who has raised the issue of social responsibility is part of an antiesthetic backlash it does not require a great mental stretch to admire frank gehry s buildings and to feel compassion for the homeless at the same time indeed , his buildings are best appreciated as works that heighten social awareness by formal means mike davis gets the point better than most when he writes that gehry s work clarifies the underlying relations of repression , surveillance and exclusion that characterize the fragmented , paranoid spatiality toward which los angeles seems to aspire not the ideal critical rave , perhaps , but at least mr davis grasps that mr gehry s buildings are not formalist abstractions while mr gehry evidently finds his stardom distasteful , he nonetheless believes that the celebrity of architects stands for something good when he was younger , he told the audience , there were only four or five star architects in the country now there are many more whose names are widely known is n't this a welcome sign that the public is paying more attention to what architects do \? it s not architecture s fault if fame is the index of public interest but there s a critical difference between wellknown architects of the postwar years and those who came to prominence in the 1970 s and 80 s as the sociologist robert gutman observes in his book architectural practice , firms that specialize in the visual packaging of buildings are a recent phenomenon in america thirty years ago , a firm assumed responsibility for the technical as well as the esthetic aspects of building today , major projects are often the work of collaborations in which one firm provides the expressive forms while another provides the nuts and bolts the reason is not that some architects consider themselves superior to grunt work often , clients prefer to have technical work performed by firms that specialize in it a formalist architect like peter eisenman , for example , would not have secured the commission for the greater columbus convention center had he not joined forces with richard trott partners , a columbus firm an association with the boston firm payette associates has enabled venturi , scott brown associates to focus on the facades and main public spaces of science buildings at the university of pennsylvania , princeton and ucla whether or not this division of labor has advanced the art of architecture , it is not likely to be reversed the trend throughout the profession has been toward specialization yet even diehard formalists must concede that other areas of specialization are cast into shadow by architecture stars not just the nuts and bolts beneath the building skin but the increasingly diverse kinds of practice that lie outside the skin altogether from educating communities about urban design to drafting public policy on housing , transportation and public spaces from documenting historic excavations to imagining potential applications for virtual reality these alternative practices are changing the shape of architecture for many architects now entering the profession , creative fulfillment is no longer staked to the design of the individual building to a degree , this is a realistic response to the dwindling job market for conventional services but it also reflects the idealistic expectation that the profession should accommodate a broader range of interests the call for greater social responsibility is one expression of that belief it s a way of redistributing the stardust , of gaining public recognition for architects whose work affects the environment in unconventional ways this expanded field of practice cannot be neatly divided into art and social action that simplistic division is dissolving within a broader cultural framework clearly , there is as much room for vision in the framing of public policy as in the design of a facade by the same token , a facade does n't automatically rate the status of art simply because it offers a visual image if it s important to recognize the social dimension of visual forms like gehry s , it is also important to discern that architecture comes in forms that do n't make striking photographs none of this is going to topple the well designed building from its lofty cultural pedestal after all , it s not only glossy magazine photography and 80 s pizazz that have equated architecture and visual images it is thousands of years of cultural history and anyone who serves that tradition as capably as frank gehry can twinkle all he likes but the fact remains that formal innovation has lost a good deal of the luster it acquired in the 1970 s and 80 s , when architects were busting loose from the restrictions of the modern canon once the principle was established that architects enjoyed virtually unlimited freedom to design in any style , the dazzling diversity of postmodern forms began to lose its creative spark diversity of practices , not diversity of forms that is the news from the edge of architecture today photo frank gehryit is possible to admire his buildings and feel compassion for the homeless at the same time \( dorothy alexander \)
tokyo , jan 20 the volume in the angry trade dispute between the united states and japan was turned up another notch today , this time with the japanese insurance industry vigorously denying that it is closed and countering that the american market goes further in discriminating against foreign competition japan has the secondlargest insurance market in the world , but american companies have complained for years that rigid government regulations and tight links between industrial concerns and financial companies effectively block access for foreign competitors insurance has thus become one of the key industries the united states is trying to crack open along with automobiles and auto parts , medical equipment and telecommunications in time for a deal to be signed when prime minister morihiro hosokawa meets president clinton in washington on feb 11 in recent days , however , japanese officials , government advisory groups and business leaders have fired off a series of salvos in an increasingly tough war of words today , takashi onoda , chairman of the marine and fire insurance association of japan , issued a paper attacking the united states for keeping its insurance market closed and for trying to unfairly protect the strong position of some american insurers in several market niches despite the fact that the japanese surplus with the united states rose to exceed 50 billion in 1993 , the japanese are now arguing that whatever fault there is lies with washington the clinton administration replies that it is resorting to these tactics because none of the past agreements have worked in the case of insurance , american companies say they are being kept from a gold mine in premiums japan s property and casualtyinsurance market is about a third the size of that in the united states , but its life insurance market is larger one of the major problems is that because of burdensome regulations , foreign companies find it difficult to win business in japan by offering innovative products or cutting premiums in addition , the top 10 japanese insurance companies control about 80 percent of the business , compared with about 30 percent in the united states that concentration and the tight financial ties between insurers and industrial concerns all but block the foreigners from competing , washington maintains work harder , japanese saay mr onoda insisted today that the american companies were not trying hard enough to sell policies in japan the united states is making onesided demands based upon an inadequate understanding of the japanese insurance market , he said if they insist on not discussing problems in the united states , which we think is contained in the principle of twoway talks , the japanese government should not compromise his association argues that the splintered american regulatory system each state has its own regulations , and rules in some areas require that brokers be fingerprinted must be changed the american side is demanding liberalized rules on offering new insurance products here , rules permitting agents to sell policies from more than one insurance company and , perhaps most important , measures to break the grip that insurers have on selling policies to members of their keiretsu , or industrial groupings japanese business practices we feel that you have to address all the issues , not just regulatory , but the business practices , as well , to make any real progress , said evan greenberg , the american international group s chief executive in japan another tactic the japanese have used to fend off united states negotiating demands has been to argue that only one american company , mr greenberg s american international group , is pushing for major changes the company , active in japan since 1946 , has aggressively tried to pry open the market japanese officials suggest that the united states government is being manipulated by american international that has been vociferously denied by american negotiators and american insurance associations
to stimulate thinking about global business ethics , the columbia university graduate school of business has prepared case studies one study , by joanne b ciulla , karen marquiss and hans a wolf , is adapted below if you ran puredrug a fictitious company , with fictitious employees what would you do \? you are the chief executive of puredrug , a large , global pharmaceutical company your firm has an outstanding reputation for quality as well as a longterm record of growth and profitability but by october 1993 the company is in trouble due to a general economic downturn and product development problems , the firm faces a declining market share and weak profits you call an emergency meeting of your top managers charles dunn , head of the export division , reminds you that his department has an opportunity to sign an 8 million sales contract with the philippine government the contract involves travolene , a new injectable medicine developed by puredrug for treating serious viral infections , including measles the drug remains difficult and expensive to manufacture and has been in very short supply since its introduction the 1993 budget did not include this philippines sale because there was not enough product available mr dunn mentions that puredrug s inventory contains a large lot of travolene , produced at a cost of about 2 million the united states government rejected the batch for the domestic market on the basis of a new , very sensitive test for endotoxin , a toxic substance the authorities recently added the new test to the standard safety test , which had been used for many years the new test revealed a very low level of endotoxin in the travolene the old procedure uncovered none you ask ann doe , the company s chief medical safety officer , whether this rules out shipping the batch to the philippines she explains that the philippines and many other countries still rely exclusively on the old test it always takes them a while to adopt more sophisticated practices , and sometimes they never do , she said endotoxin might cause high fever when injected into patients , she added , but i ca n't tell you that the level in this batch is high enough to cause trouble still , how can we have a double standard , one for our nation and one for third world countries \? mr dunn disagrees it s not our job to overprotect other countries , he said the philippines health authorities know what they are doing our officials always take an extreme position measles is a serious illness last year in the philippines , half of the children who contracted measles died it s not only good business but also good ethics to send them the only batch of travolene we have available the sale also would put puredrug into the black for 1993 and help foster a lucrative relationship with the philippines uneasy , you leave the meeting you have 72 hours to present a plan to your company board
bujumbura , burundi , april 11 the worst part , says phil van lanen , was not the constant crackle of gunfire around the house , or the trucks piled with corpses , or even the gangs of wildeyed young men who were always outside , somewhere , waving clubs and machetes and looking for someone to kill the worst part , said mr van lanen , a relief worker with the seventhday adventist church mission in rwanda , was fleeing kigali , and leaving behind african friends and coworkers now that we are out , mr van lanen said today , i fear , in a way , that we have betrayed the people we came to help fighting both guilt and tears as he spoke , the 37yearold dental technician at the church s clinic in kigali added , i think we have left a scar on our soul that will take a long time to heal church missions account for most of the 250 or so americans who were residents of rwanda , and they were among the last americans to leave rwanda by overland convoy sunday , after the united states ambassador , david rawson , the son of missionaries himself , persuaded them to go anguish over what to do has my faith been tested by what happened in kigali \? said ron clark , another church worker he paused yes yes i suppose it has i keep asking myself , how could i have left \? for four days , the van lanens and the clarks and other church workers prayed and anguished over what to do at the same time , and at considerable risk , they provided refuge and comfort to frightened rwandan friends desperate to escape the blood lust and ancient ethnic hatreds that have once more inflamed rwanda now , they fear that most of those people deprived of their protection will become victims of the bloodletting that has set the majority hutu tribe of rwanda against the minority tutsis red cross officials estimate that the violence has taken more than 10 , 000 lives in kigali alone , and as many or more in the countryside to be in the middle of all this , to watch them turn from the most wonderful , the most smiling , the most gentle of people , to such treacherous murderers is beyond comprehension , said dr per houmann , a dentist who runs the adventists' clinic it is almost as if someone flips a switch thoughts of returning this morning , nearly a dozen weary missionary families stood on the steamy tarmac of the airport here , among some 65 people waiting to board a c141 cargo plane bound for the sanctuary of nairobi a contingent of united states marines had secured the airport , where another group of about 150 americans had left sunday like most of the foreigners who were evacuated from rwanda over the weekend , the americans spoke today of their relief and their thanks that they too had escaped the chaos of kigali but they also spent much of their time talking of the day when they would go back , and contemplating who and what they would find when they got there mr van lanen begins to weep when he talks of the eight tutsi girls who used to work in his dental clinic they lived in a shantytown suburb of kigali called nyarmirambo , or the place of skulls , where hutu mobs last week left bodies of tutsi victims stacked against walls mr clark s voice catches , and he gulps for air , when he recalls the telephone call from a tutsi worker , her voice quivering with fear as she said that hutu gunmen were going from house to house on her street , breaking down doors and shooting she said she was hiding in the kitchen , that they were just next door , that they were coming to get her , mr clark said and then the line went dead one chose to remain the adventists have the secondlargest church mission in rwanda , after the catholics , with a staff of about 100 , including some 40 americans they operate a university , an orphanage , a school and a hospital , as well as the dental clinic in kigali at least one of their number has chosen to stay behind , an american relief worker who remains in kigali , even though the america embassy has evacuated all of its staff and relief agencies have shut down operations kigali erupted in violence early thursday morning , after a suspicious plane crash killed the presidents of both rwanda and burundi , both of whom were hutus soldiers and roving hutu gangs immediately set out to exact retribution against tutsis , who make up the bulk of a guerrilla movement that opposes the government the horror , said mr clark , who speaks kinyarwandan , the language of rwanda , is that many of the people who are killed are killed because of the shape of their nose , a reference , he explained , to the sharply different physicial characteristics of tutsis and hutus tutsis tend to be taller , with narrow features and high cheekbones the hutus are shorter , with flatter , broader noses for the most part , the mission workers said they never felt they or other foreigners were the specific targets of the violence the threat lay in the wholly unpredictable behavior of the mobs , which included many drunken young men the shelling was also random on friday morning , a mortar shell crashed into the patio of the home of scott mueller , a baptist missionary , blowing out all the windows in the house moments of bravery it killed our dog , but none of us were hurt , said cindy mueller , who had been hiding in the hallway with her husband and their two young children later , when the muellers made their own way to the airport during a lull in the fighting , they were stopped at a roadblock by rwandan soldiers who threatened them when mrs mueller began to cry , she said the soldiers offered to give back the blankets and soccer balls the muellers had given them to allow the family to pass in the horror and bloodshed of the next four days , there were also moments , they said , of bravery and sacrifice one of the gardeners at the adventist compound , a hutu , risked his life to wander into the chaos of the streets to retrieve tutsi families who feared they were in danger by saturday , there were 23 people inside the houmann s tiny house for his part , mr clark sat at the airport today , his eyes red , while he wrestled with the terrible events of the last few days i had always believed that somehow , somewhere along the line , there is going to be a person god can use to take care of others , said mr clark , as he sat alongside his wife and two children , thinking about the people he knew in kigali but in rwanda , perhaps , people learned long ago not to count too much on others they have a proverb , he said it goes 'when life is thrown up , every man will catch his own'

vijaka , bosnia and herzegovina , sept 13 after eight months as croatian refugees and a journey home that required evading militarypolice checkpoints , josefina pestic and her husband , ivo , had a frustrating welcome back to their hanselandgretel village in the forested highlands of central bosnia i have strawberries and blueberries over there , mrs pestic said , looking down from the porch of her home toward her sister s house but i ca n't go near anymore because muslim refugees have moved into the place muslims have taken our cow and our gardens , too , and it really bothers me to see them walk around wearing our clothes we ca n't do anything except watch , the 55yearold woman said before remarking about how fortunate she and her husband have been compared with the hundreds of thousands of other bosnians driven from their homes over the last two years , perhaps forever we were so lucky to have our home back , and none of us was killed , and we did n't do evil to anyone else quietly , against the will of the bosnian croat and muslim authorities , the pestics and about 1 , 000 other displaced croats have over the last two months come home to vijaka and vares , the rundown steel town just up the road the croats have returned in a trickle , but they constitute the first reversal of the ethnic cleansing that has been the hallmark of the bosnian war it is also a setback for militant nationalist croats from another predominantly croatianpopulated area of central bosnia , around kiseljak , who want to join with croatia the militants want to uproot the indigenous croatian population in the vares area and move it to their own area , which had been cleared of muslims we walked around the barricade on foot , and a friend of ours drove us home , mrs pestic said , explaining how the couple skirted the croatian and bosnian police on their journey from the croatian militiaheld town of kiseljak to vijaka , once an allcroatian village that has become a haven for muslim homeless we did n't have any kind of permission to come back we keep a suitcase packed , mrs pestic said the police were coming around every day after we arrived telling us to leave they are n't coming by anymore , but we 're still afraid they will take us away the croats' return to vijaka and vares has been made possible by the signing in the spring of a federation agreement between the bosnian government and nationalist croatian leaders the accord ended a yearlong croatianmuslim war begun when the nationalist croats , backed by croatia s government , tried to wrest away bosnian territory in june 1993 , nationalist croats from kiseljak , who had already ethnically cleansed their town of its muslims , overthrew vares s legal croatianandmuslim government and began mistreating the town s muslims it was our civilian police in vares that kept the militants from kiseljak away from the local mosque , said a croat from vares who is now living in a gymnasium in kiseljak and who asked to remain anonymous because he fears retaliation by the nationalists who still run the town local croats in vares were hiding muslims in their apartments to protect them under the command of a kiseljak militia leader , ivica rajic , the nationalists killed 38 muslims on oct 23 in destroying stupni do , a village just outside vares fearful of muslim retaliation for the atrocity , the pestics and all but 78 of vijaka s 875 croats abandoned their homes on oct 29 , 1993 , when nationalist croats ordered all the croats out two days later , the nationalists , warning of an imminent bosnian army offensive , sent practically all of the vares district s 8 , 800 croats fleeing into serbian territory and on to kiseljak the guys from kiseljak sold out the vares district s croats , said a croat from vijaka who also insisted on remaining unidentified they wanted the croats of vares to move into the houses of muslims they had cleansed from kiseljak in a span of two hours we had to leave everything we had made in a lifetime , said marija lekic , a 60yearold croatian woman who returned to vijaka we only know that we had to run we were like hostages in kiseljak , she said the croatian authorities tried to bar us from coming back rajic was going around telling us not to come back if we returned to our homes , she explained , the muslims would have to be allowed to go back to kiseljak , and rajic will never allow the muslims to return to kiseljak but she returned , she said , because i could n't stand it in kiseljak anymore it does n't belong to me , she said i wanted my own house i 'll never find anywhere else what i have here the pestics moved back to find that bosnian army troops had ransacked most of vijaka , including their own home , and burned down a few nearby houses muslim refugees , driven from their homes by nationalist serbs in 1992 , had occupied most of the place there was a policeman living in our house when we arrived , mr pestic said he stayed with us one night and left but he s still in the village somewhere what else is he supposed to do \? she said he s a refugee , too photo josefina and iva pestic working in their garden last month before they were driven out of vijaka , the croatian family had three gardens since the pestics have returned , two of the gardens are used by muslims \( rachel cobb for the new york times \) map of bosnia

rome , jan 19 with little more than two months before national elections , the christian democratic party has yielded to the political changes sweeping italy and given itself a new name , new leaders and , it hopes , a new chance to salvage some of its former power base after the scandals of the last two years the leadership of the party , which effectively controlled italian politics since the country s emergence from world war ii , said it would now be called the italian popular party the emblem of a shield , with its white cross on a red field and the latin word libertas , or freedom , that once symbolized the party s militant roman catholic and anticommunist spirit will remain breakaway group formed to take effect , the changes must still be approved by a party congress on saturday and on tuesday a sizable minority resistant to the changes broke away and set up a splinter party called the christian democratic center to this group , the renamed party fails to present a unified front against the threat of a leftistled victory in the elections that are scheduled for march 2728 , and it has vowed to ally itself with conservative forces like the separatist northern league to build a new centerright bloc but there is almost no doubt that the word christian is about to fade from the italian political vocabulary , because the party secretary , mino martinazzoli , commands a broad majority favoring the proposals put forward this week change , mr martinazzoli says , is essential if the party is to salvage anything of the catholic center that dominated italian politics since the war the program unveiled this week appeared to be a commitment to protecting jobs and standards of living amid economic uncertainties mr martinazzoli acknowledged that change had been forced on the party by the scandal as concerns the crisis of christian democracy , he said , it is clear that this is identified with the metaphor of tangentopoli , the italian expression translating roughly as kickback city famous names absent but none of the christian democratic names that have dominated italian politics in recent years former prime ministers like giulio andreotti or arnaldo forlani were present at the meeting held in a palazzo named for the rev luigi sturzo , a sicilian priest who founded the first popular party 75 years ago , the group from which christian democracy emerged after world war ii dozens of christian democratic politicians , including virtually all of the major party figures , are under investigation for various crimes christian democracy was founded at a clandestine meeting in rome in 1942 by alcide de gasperi , an ardent catholic whom the vatican shielded from mussolini s fascists during the war mr de gasperi , who led eight italian governments , joined other roman catholic leaders in europe , like robert schumann of france and konrad adenauer of germany , to found broadbased political movements that sought to reassert christian values in a postwar europe devastated by the barbarism of fascism and nazism but the christian democrats' dominance of postwar italy ultimately spawned corruption in elections for the governments of major cities last month , christian democratic candidates were swept from the scene statement by the pope the defeats have come as a serious blow to the roman catholic church leadership , and last week pope john paul ii made a rare public statement about italian domestic politics , urging italian catholics to support a unified political force , and not to smear all five decades of christian democraticled rule with the mud of recent scandal still , mr martinazzoli fought a difficult battle against a sizable minority in the party that believes he has steered the party too far to the left in seeking an alliance with the democratic party of the left , the renamed communists , who have finally overtaken the christian democrats as italy s leading political force the leaders of the christian democratic center announced its founding on tuesday as they see it , christian democracy led the longago fight against communism why , they ask , should they now abandon their name just because it was abused by a recent generation of party leaders \? drawing the christian democratic party has changed its name to the italian popular party , but the emblem remains the same
mexico city , sept 11 even though mexico s most important trading partners expressed confidence in the country s ability to survive peacefully any result of last month s presidential election , they quietly put together a 6 billion plan to back the peso just in case there was trouble united states treasury secretary lloyd bentsen has disclosed , and mexican finance officials have confirmed , that in the weeks leading up to the aug 21 election a plan was secretly put together for several european central banks and japan to extend a 6 billion line of credit to mexico the money was available to help mexico in case there was a run on the peso after a governingparty loss or , as mr bentsen said , in case violence broke out disclosure of the election backup plan is sure to cause a political controversy , just as occurred after some previous plans were disclosed in news reports the 6 billion credit line from the europeans and japanese was in addition to 6 billion made available to mexico by the united states in march in the uncertain hours after the assassination of the ruling party s presidential candidate , luis donaldo colosio thus , in all , the mexicans had 12 billion in backup to withstand any postelection difficulties under both agreements , the mexican central bank would lend pesos to the foreign banks in exchange for hard currencies the mexicans then would be able to use the dollars , franks , marks and yen to augment their own foreign reserves in staving off panic selling we obviously put together the fund and got several other countries to join in , mr bentsen said during an interview here last week he had traveled to mexico to meet with the winner of the aug 21 election , ernesto zedillo ponce de leon , and other important mexican officials playing financial bodyguard to mexico is something the united states has done at least three times in the last year , including the elections the support that came after the assassination of mr colosio was the only time united states officials openly discussed the contingency plans in fact , last fall mexican officials often denied there was any contingency plan prepared in case the north american free trade agreement was not approved in the united states congress however , it was later learned that two weeks before the crucial congressional vote last november , united states treasury officials helped arrange what in total was a 12 billion line of credit to support the peso in case the trade plan was defeated president carlos salinas de gortari had made the pact a crucial element of his plan for economic recovery and modernization the failure to get it passed in 1993 would have seriously hurt the mexican stock exchange and caused a flight of capital , analysts believed the tradeaccord contingency plan involved money from two sources the united states put up 6 billion and a group of european central banks put up an additional 6 billion the arrangement was kept quiet , and after the accord passed in congress in november , the deal was essentially shelved , although the legal papers were preserved those documents formed the basis of a round of negotiations that began within hours of the colosio assassination in tijuana on march 23 because mr colosio had been heavily favored to become the next president , the situation was considered threatening and the response , officials said at the time , had to be immediate mr bentsen and mexico s finance minister , pedro aspe , signed the arrangements for the money swap within hours and quickly put the 6 billion united states side of the deal back into action but because of complications from the time differences and distances involved , the european half was not enacted mexican officials said that the same arrangement with the europeans was essentially what was revived this summer one highranking mexican finance official , who did not want to be identified because he said the european banks were not eager to have information about the deal exposed , said the terms of the preelection contingency plan were similar to what had been struck last fall before the vote on the trade accord he said the banks involved were the central banks of the leading industrialized european nations , plus spain and japan the deal was coordinated by the bank for international settlements the european offer will continue for an undisclosed period of time , the mexican official said the earlier credit line for the tradeaccord vote expired after two months in the weeks leading up to the mexican election , president clinton the united states ambassador to mexico , james r jones , and other officials said openly that they believed the mexican elections would be fair and peaceful but at the same time , treasury officials were completing the negotiations for the contingency plan , just in case the earlier interventions by the united states were criticized by some mexicans , who felt the support amounted to a tacit

jerusalem , feb 14 simcha dinitz , chairman of the influential jewish agency and a former israeli ambassador to the united states , was indicted today on charges of having fraudulently used agency credit cards to pile up thousands of dollars in personal expenses insisting he was innocent , mr dinitz said he would take a leave of absence from the agency to defend himself against the charges , which could carry a prison sentence of up to five years if he is convicted besides the personal disgrace for a 64yearold man with a long and distinguished public record , the indictment seemed likely to intensify already loud calls for a shakeup of the jewish agency and its sister body , the world zionist organization , which mr dinitz also headed agency oversees immigration the agency is a quasigovernmental body principally charged with overseeing jewish immigration to israel that task has become monumental since mr dinitz took office in 1987 , with the arrival of nearly 500 , 000 newcomers from the former soviet union over the last five years and with heralded achievements like the airlift of 14 , 000 jews from ethiopia in 1991 created in 1929 as the vehicle for jews around the world to contribute funds for jewish settlement in what was then palestine , the jewish agency was in effect the government of the jewish state in the making its executive board became israel s first cabinet after the state was founded in 1948 and its leader , david bengurion , became the first prime minister although it has none of those powers now , the agency remains an important political force , with hundreds of patronage jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars at its disposal , much of it raised in the united states by the united jewish appeal and scores of local jewish federations indeed , among the charges made by those calling for change is that the agency and the zionist organization have become dumping grounds for israel s political parties , which choose the heads of each of the 13 departments along with questions raised about the agency s role , some israelis and overseas jews have urged a thorough review of their partnership , arguing that it is overly dependent on cash donations that they say sometimes breed mutual resentment and misunderstanding while mr dinitz s indictment has nothing to do with those broader issues , it is likely to be cited by critics of the jewish agency as further evidence of a bloated bureaucracy the indictment brought by the attorney general in jerusalem district court had been expected for months , since the emergence of allegations in the local press that mr dinitz had used his agency credit cards to buy clothes and pay for expensive overseas trips he responded that he had repaid those expenses and that the worst he could be accused of was careless bookkeeping a year ago , the agency s comptroller absolved him of having acted in bad faith but the indictment charged fraud and breach of trust , alleging that mr dinitz had used agency cards intended for business expenses to make 22 , 000 in personal purchases in stores in the united states after he put himself on leave today , the head of the agency s board of governors , mendel kaplan , asked the treasurer , hanan benyehuda , to take over temporarily as chairman mr dinitz , born in tel aviv in 1929 , is a wellknown figure in the united states , especially for his tenure as israel s ambassador there from 1973 to 1978 when israel was caught off guard by an arab attack that inflicted heavy losses and started the 1973 arabisraeli war , he campaigned vigorously , and successfully , for an airlift of american military equipment by an initially reluctant nixon administration
after months of gang warfare for control of half a dozen blocks on the upper west side of manhattan , 48 suspected drug dealers and gunmen were indicted yesterday in 8 murders and 13 shootings in a bloody struggle over a neighborhood business that earned 5 million a year touting crack cocaine and heroin and packing semiautomatic pistols , the drug gangs terrorized residents in a neighborhood of wellkept brownstones and reconditioned tenements their domain , the manhattan district attorney said yesterday , stretched along 107th street from amsterdam avenue to central park , along amsterdam avenue between 104th and 105th streets , and included the corner of 109th street and columbus avenue an enforcer for the largest gang , which called itself young talented children , carried a semiautomatic pistol fitted with a special sight that sent out a red laser beam , the district attorney , robert m morgenthau , said the enforcer would flash the beam on the chests of residents and competitors in a chilling demonstration that , with a squeeze of his trigger , they could be dead 'a nightmare' it s been a nightmare , said majorie cohen , executive director of the west side crime prevention program , a community group that helps organize block and tenants associations her assistant , tamar lynn , added a lot of people were afraid to the point of not wanting to leave their houses once they got home from work even those people who were less afraid were going about with a certain degree of fear you had guns going off at all times of the night and evening the violence began to worsen last fall as the young talented children started trying to drive out competitors and their targets began retaliating late april and early may was a particularly bad time with shootouts on several corners and wild police chases in the fall , hundreds of new york city and housing police officers had begun trying to break the gangs' grip on the streets after a group of drug dealers mistook three teenagers for rivals and sprayed them with 30 bullets as they sat chatting on a park bench at 112th street and eighth avenue , a few blocks west of the main sales area of the young talented children one of the teenagers was hit by three bullets in the head and died the two others , who were wounded , managed to run away 'enormous relief' just how lasting an effect the police operation will have is anyone s guess but there was enormous relief , for the moment , as ms cohen put it , adding that she believed more people would be willing to come together in protective groups now that many of the suspected gunmen have been removed we do anticipate that this big bust is going to make a significant impact , at least for a short time , ms lynn said we 've been through smaller busts is the impact permanent \? usually not but this should have a slightly longer effect because they rounded up the organizers there was no sign of drug dealers in the neighborhood yesterday , but the police seemed to be everywhere uniformed officers patrolled 107th street on foot , and at 109th street and columbus avenue , two plainclothes officers sat watching the intersection from their unmarked car periodically , patrol cars moved through the streets the indictments and roundup of 34 of the suspects on tuesday night and wednesday morning 14 are still at large came just one day after the united states attorney in manhattan , mary jo white , announced the indictment of 20 members of the latin kings the huge group , with members in several states , describes itself as a hispanic selfhelp organization but it is widely known for its violence in the federal indictment , some of the latin kings are charged with murdering seven of their own members no less violent mr morgenthau said the timing of the actions against the gangs was totally coincidental for more than a year he has been focusing on gangs like the young talented children , which have sprung up across the city to sell drugs and sometimes guns these gangs are much smaller than the latin kings , investigators say , but they are no less violent in their investigation in manhattan valley , a heavily populated strip between amsterdam avenue and central park from 100th to 110th street , mr morgenthau and the police found that the young talented children , whose members were mainly in their early 20 s , had built a complex business structure with a pair of partners at the top , two supervisors who oversaw six street managers , who in turn were in charge of more than a dozen pitchers , or street sellers damon springer , the 20yearold youth who carried the semiautomatic pistol with the laser , worked with six other gunmen , mr morgenthau said , to defend the territory claimed by the young talented childrens and carry out attacks as directed by the two leaders , martin mejias , 20 , and jose rosa , 21 the investigators said the young talented children often employed youths under the age of 16 , who are legally regarded as juveniles and generally subjected to less severe penalties , as lookouts and couriers of drugs , guns and money none of the younger people have so far been arrested wholesale crack business besides their primary business of selling cocaine and heroin on the streets , the young talented children ran a wholesale business in which they provided hundreds of vials of crack , priced at 2 or 3 each , to street dealers working other parts of the city , said fernando camacho , an assistant district attorney in mr morgenthau s homicide unit in addition , mr camacho said , the gang leased the southwest corner of 107th street and manhattan avenue for use by two smaller streetsales gangs between late morning and early evening for a percentage of their profits they shut down at 8 o'clock , mr camacho said , and after that , the young talented children took over we do n't know exactly how much they were paying , but it was a large percentage of their sales other gangs two other small gangs ran wholesale businesses in apartments at 945 and 950 columbus avenue the gangs supplied the young talented children as well as other street dealers in the city , mr morgenthau said one of the murder victims , wilkins acevedo , who had worked as a street dealer , had been a good high school student and was planning to attend long island university in southampton , li , on a scholarship , mr camacho said if these people had gone straight , mr morgenthau said , they might have been very successful businessmen map of the upper west side shows sites of murders
jeannie t had a restraining order against her exhusband , who had beaten her repeatedly during their marriage and continued to threaten her during their divorce proceedings the couple had a 2yearold child , and because of the husband s history of violent behavior the judge ordered that the father s visits to his daughter be supervised mrs t was grateful that her daughter was to be protected , but her relief was short lived the judge , who himself had granted the order of protection for mrs t , also named her as the supervisor of the visits it was awful , said mrs t , whose last name is being withheld because she fears further repercussions from her exhusband i had to be in the same room with him , in the car with him and oversee everything that went on with the baby i did it because i had to protect my daughter but it was terrible mrs t returned to court , asking the judge to name another supervisor and eventually it was decided that a professional social worker would do the job , a service for which mrs t herself must partly pay still , she worries the woman appointed to supervise the visits is elderly , and the father and child meet most often at discovery zone , a play area that has a labyrinth of small tunnels the father and daughter are often alone together because the supervisor is unable to follow them people keep telling me nothing terrible has happened to my daughter , but that is because i have always jumped in the middle before it starts , mrs t said , crying it really hurts me to think that something can happen to her without me protecting her mrs t s situation is not uncommon both the family court and the supreme court order supervised visitation between a parent and child when a decision is made that the child may be at risk when it spends time alone with the parent in question but once the order has been given , there is no system that provides either professional supervision or a safe , neutral meeting ground now , once a case leaves the courts , parents must make their own arrangements for supervision individual social workers are sometimes available on a freelance basis , but families can often not afford the services the job of supervision frequently falls to family members or friends , who may favor one party over the other in other cases , the supervision reverts to the custodial parent , who is already in an antagonistic position with the exspouse , who they are supposed to oversee the situation affects a great many children in the county last year , the county s department of probation undertook about 500 custody investigations , in which they examined situations where one parent accused the other of being unfit to care for the child some of the children affected are in foster care , while others live in homes in which there has been domestic violence or sexual abuse still others have parents who have a history of drug and alcohol abuse supervision in a neutral place would work in about 70 of these cases at any given time , said judge adrienne hoffmanscancarelli , supervising judge of the family courts , ninth judicial district , in white plains to address the problem , the county board of legislators task force on women and youthatrisk has proposed that westchester begin a supervised visitation program the task force recommends a director and three sites , with two parttime social workers , a security officer and tables , chairs and toys at each site we are talking about a gap in services , said amy paulin , president of the league of women voters of westchester and a member of the task force this would effectively address the problem such programs exist in new york city as well as in other parts of the country , and we feel strongly that this would benefit families in the county the task force estimated that each site would cost about 85 , 000 and recommended that the program be subcontracted to a nonprofit agency and monitored by the department of probation paul j noto , a republican of mamaroneck who is cochairman of the task force with lois t bronz , a democrat of greenburgh , said that the program should be financed by savings or other cuts in the 1995 county budget the current situation is very destructive , mr noto said there are many situations where without this program there may be no visitation , or it takes place where it compromises the safety of one of the parents we believe this proposal is profamily because it enhances parent s involvement in their kid s lives , but in a safe environment at a recent public hearing of the board of legislators committee on budget and appropriations , several women none of whom would give their full names testified about their frustrations with the current system of supervised visitation deborah s , the mother of a 2yearold , said that her exhusband was a drug addict with a violent temper the court had ordered that the father s visits with the child be supervised but named the father s uncle and aunt as supervisors i did n't want to lose the rights to supervised visitation so i did n't resist having his family as supervisors , mrs s said i am still uncomfortable when i wonder how my son is being cared for by a family who covers up his drug and violence problems , but what am i to do \? i felt i had to take this offer or my son would end up alone with this man sue j said that her husband s supervised visits with her 5yearold daughter took place at amusement parks or in busy malls where it was impossible for the supervisor to monitor the conversation or actions between the child and her father i 've seen how incapable the child is of seeing her own best interests even when her very safety is concerned , mrs j said i see the necessity for supervised visitation where there are no distractions for the supervisor , because the continued abuse and threats can be very subtle and yet serve the purpose of keeping the child quiet and victimized for good barry goldstein , a lawyer who serves on the board of my sister s place , a shelter for battered women , said that many of his cases involved domestic violence and abuse and that his clients frequently had problems with supervision there certainly should be visitation with fathers but all too often it is done in a way that risks the child s safety , mr goldstein said i 've had several cases recently in which there were orders for supervised visitation , but there was no supervision available the problem is that when there is n't a ready alternative , the judges are ordering unsupervised visitation , and the children are getting hurt
kuwait city , oct 8 as improbable as it may seem , saddam hussein appears to be pushing iraq toward a confrontation with the forces that drove him from kuwait over three years ago , senior kuwaiti officials and western diplomats said today saddam hussein has always been unpredictable and inscrutable , a western diplomat said when he invaded iran in 1980 he took everyone by surprise the same was true when he invaded kuwait 10 years later we do not know if he will use force , but his efforts to find a diplomatic solution to lift the oil embargo appeared to have ended at this point , we cannot rule anything out the iraqi leader appears to have concluded , according to diplomats who follow iraq , that even if he complies with the united nations resolutions the crushing restrictions on iraqi oil exports will not be lifted many western diplomats agree , saying that the united states , britain , kuwait and saudi arabia are determined to keep the sanctions in place as long as mr hussein is in power the united nations demands that mr hussein permit the monitoring of the iraqi arms industry , scrap his weapons of mass destruction , recognize the common sea and land border with kuwait and acknowledge the sovereignty of the country his forces invaded in 1990 iraq has permitted united nations officials to set up an elaborate monitoring system of its arms industries , including the placement of about 50 remote cameras at ballistic missile production sites but it refuses to recognize the border with kuwait , or kuwaiti sovereignty , although deputy prime minister tariq aziz told united nations security council members that both were possible in exchange for a commitment to allow iraq to sell oil the lifting of the sanctions will be a very , very long process , said abdul hamid alawadhi , a senior kuwaiti foreign ministry official this is not just a matter of sanctions , but a whole range of political issues behind the sanctions that will make sure there is a change at the top the severity of the sanctions has become apparent in recent weeks , as the iraqi currency has slid in value and the government has again cut food rations iraqi delegations have courted french , pakistani , turkish , chinese and russian officials , promising lucrative business contracts and the repayment of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt once oil sales are resumed there is now a race to secure future profits in iraq , if the government meets the requirements of the security council , said suleiman majd alshaheen , the under secretary at the kuwaiti foreign ministry but kuwaiti officials have doggedly followed iraqi officials around the globe to present their case , often arriving days after their iraqi counterparts departed and kuwait has not been shy about using its oil income to buttress it stance the emirate pledged in august to pay about 250 million for eight fast patrol boats from france and another 100 million for armored personnel carriers from russia earlier this year , kuwait agreed to buy 800 million worth of missiles and armored vehicles from russia and is considering buying shortrange surfacetoair missiles and artillery equipment and services from france the arms deals , western diplomats say , come with the understanding that russia and france will continue to support sanctions none of this is equipment the kuwaitis really need or could not get , with better technology , from the united states or britain , said one european diplomat it is part of the political war kuwait has signed defense pacts with the united states , russia , france and britain over the last three years it is hoping to sign a similar accord with china , giving it formal defense links with the five permanent members of the security council iraq had hoped to convince the council to ease , or end , the oil embargo when rolf ekeus , head of the united nations commission on disarming iraq , gives his report on monday the monitoring system is provisionally operable and in september , for the first time , iraq handed over some information on 45 of 609 kuwaitis missing since the iraqi invasion , although kuwaiti officials said the information was totally inadequate the iraqis have made a huge effort to get a commitment from the security council that the oil embargo would be lifted , said one kuwaiti official now that they have failed , we must expect the worse iraq has tried , up until now , to do the minimum and appear compliant as possible , said one western diplomat while they have done little to nothing , they will probably not even pretend to play the game now the failure of the iraqi diplomatic initiative means that saddam hussein has little to gain by continued compliance , western diplomats said in fact , they say , defiance may enhance mr hussein s image as a leader willing to stand up to western domination the iraqi president remains a hero in much of the arab world and his picture adorns shop windows from tunis to amman mr hussein maintains that the persian gulf war was a victory for iraq , since his government remained in power and baghdad was never occupied if he fights again , even if he is unable to get into kuwait , it will enhance his position as a warrior and a leader , said one western diplomat as long as he appears to stand up to the west , for many of his followers , he wins photo kuwaitis say president saddam hussein of iraq appears to be pushing toward a confrontation but there were few signs of outward anxiety in kuwait city , where a man carried groceries he had bought \( associated press \)
there is the right to free speech and the right to bear arms and , if you 're in the brokerage industry , there is apparently the right to conceal the price of the bonds you trade for customers or so it would seem from the sound of 348 letters to the securities and exchange commission blasting the idea of 'fessing up to bond commissions the sec last march published a proposal that brokers begin divulging the markups or costs to customers on some of their bond trades innocuous as the suggestion might sound , it elicited a hue and cry from the securities industry , which apparently has a lot to lose should the public get smarter about what it costs to buy a bond the sec is summarizing the comments , said robert colby , deputy director of the division of market regulation then , mr colby s division will make a recommendation to the commission to adopt some , all or none of the proposals if history is any guide , the industry will get its way the sec tried in 1978 to force brokerage firms to give investors information about the costs of bond transactions but the industry back then lapsed into a similar apoplectic state , and the idea was dropped the latest attempt to pry loose more information about bond trading costs has the backing of the sec chairman , arthur levitt , who has frequently irked industry executives with his proconsumer tendencies whether mr levitt cares to spend all his political capital championing an unpopular cause , though , is an open question meanwhile , the municipal securities rulemaking board is readying a pricereporting system that it hopes will make it easier to get price information on certain bonds and make further reforms unnecessary but the msrb s new system , which will be unveiled tomorrow , would have no effect on other sometimes hardtoget quotes , such as those for corporate bonds the sec might have had a stronger hand had it not begun with a compromise position instead of floating the notion of revealing all markups \( amounts added to a brokerage firm s actual costs \) or markdowns \( amounts subtracted from the investors' take when they sell back to a brokerage firm \) , the sec said it only wanted confirmation slips to show markups and markdowns on riskless principal transactions riskless principal trades are those in which a broker locates a bond for a client at another securities firm and owns those bonds for a minute amount of time before selling it to the customer , said mr colby left out of the proposal are principal transactions in which brokerage firms turn over bonds from their own inventory that they may have owned for weeks or months the sec , mr colby explained , excluded those transactions because it did n't want investors to feel gouged if a bond that had been sitting in a firm s inventory had simply appreciated from a rising market by only going halfway , however , the sec invited a barrage of letters from small firms that predicted that big firms with big inventories would put them out of business they fear investors will flock to brokers that have no disclosure requirements mistakenly thinking they had escaped the charge if they did n't see one but the sec could have attacked the problem in other ways it could have demanded that buyers of bonds be told on their confirmation slips how much their bonds would have fetched if they had been sellers instead mr colby said such an idea was actually proposed once for stock transactions , but the brokerage industry deemed it too costly and another possible solution printing on a confirmation slip what a particular broker earned on a bond trade was considered but never done , he said why not \? it s extremely controversial , he said no kidding the public securities association , which is opposed to revealing markup information on confirmation slips , instead endorses the notion of investors shopping around for the best price michael green , a psa official , said that the sec s suggestion to disclose markup information on a confirmation slip would not give investors the information they really need price and yield besides , he said , confirmation slips sent by mail come too late to be useful like mr green , william walsh , president of nori , hennion , walsh inc , a brokerage firm in parsippany , nj , argues that small investors , apparently unable to pat their heads and rub their bellies at the same time , will become confused by all that extra information it will make retail investors concentrate on the amount of the dealer markup rather than on the safety , credit quality and yield of the security , he wrote to the sec in all my years dealing with and talking directly with retail investors , very few are concerned with dealer markup maybe because they do n't know to ask a letter from the director of fixed income trading at charles schwab company mentioned that new customers frequently believe that principal transactions are done free the industry may win its battle to keep markups off confirmation statements , but , in its zeal to win , it has betrayed much about itself in the comment letters rather than shop around for the best price for customers , brokers under the new system would simply wait for a bond to come into inventory , to avoid disclosing the markup , said one writer another predicts that firms will manipulate timestamping to make it look like newly arrived bonds have been sitting in inventory and elude the reporting requirement though investor confusion , industry fallout and potential abuse were the points most often made , one writer got to the heart of what the flap was really about no buyer is going to like it when confronted with how much you just made off him her , wrote ronald e blaylock of blaylock partners such a disclosure on the confirmation is going to have a truly chilling effect indeed on completion of that sale at that price
zagreb , croatia , nov 4 even as the united nations discusses lifting the arms embargo on bosnia and herzegovina , the embargo appears to have become largely a fiction , openly flouted helped by the ready availability of arms and military components in the former soviet bloc countries and by an apparent american readiness to turn a blind eye , croatia is now building or assembling everything from battle tanks to mig21 fighter aircraft and acting as the main conduit for the flood of weapons reaching bosnia what i need , i get , the croatian defense minister , gojko susak , said in an interview the arms market is saturated , so saturated you would pay three times the price if you got things legally mr susak described buying arms in countries including poland , bulgaria and russia as an open market and said croatia was now providing the army of the muslimdominated bosnian government with antitank weapons and ammunition for mortars , cannons and machine guns the effect of this increase in the arms available to the bosnian muslim and allied bosnian croat forces has been evident in the last week in two successful offensives against the longdominant bosnian serbs the first offensive burst through serbian lines east of bihac in the northwest the second resulted in the capture of the town of kupres in the west central part of the country an arms embargo imposed on the former yugoslavia in 1991 froze the bosnian serbs' weapons superiority in place because serbs controlled the yugoslav army and dipped into its arsenal to supply the bosnian serbs the serbs used this advantage to take 70 percent of bosnian territory , routing the nascent bosnian army and terrorizing muslim civilians their superiority in artillery and tanks remains but now appears to have been offset by the success of the bosnian government in providing basic weapons to a large army operating in a mountainous terrain where mobility can outweigh armor the bosnian army has doubled in size over the past year to about 164 , 000 men , all in uniform and equipped , against about 102 , 000 serbs , said paul beaver , a military analyst at jane s defense weekly in london they have obtained russianmade rocketpropelled grenades from the former east germany , chinese antitank weapons from pakistan and ammunition from iran since the americanbrokered muslimcroat federation in bosnia was formed in march , most of the weapons reaching bosnia have come through croatia , a country with more than 1 , 000 islands , several remote airstrips and a number of land routes into bosnia the united states appears to have pursued a policy of turning a blind eye to this arms trade , which has had the effect of advancing one element of american strategy in the balkans achieving a balance of power in bosnia to create conditions favorable to a peace settlement for example , mr susak said the american military attache at the embassy in zagreb , col richard herrick , had attended a recent demonstration of croatian air power among the aircraft on show were 12 mig fighter planes croatia had no more than four when the embargo was imposed and several mi24 armored assault helicopters that fired guided antitank missiles croatia had none of these helicopters or missiles when the embargo took effect in 1991 colonel herrick declined comment an official at the american embassy in zagreb , who confirmed colonel herrick s presence at the military exercise , said , yes , of course we 're aware of circumvention of the embargo she then corrected herself , saying the state department had no verified reports of violations asked if the united states had done anything about possible violations , she declined comment mr beaver of jane s defense weekly described the american approach to croatian arms imports as not quite connivance , but almost mr susak said croatia was now assembling migs at a factory just outside zagreb and already had about 20 aircraft he added that tanks were being manufactured in slavonski brod , and mortars and rocket launchers at plants in other towns at the duro dakovic factory in slavonski brod , the success of croatia in getting what it needs for its weapons industry is evident the gleaming green hulls of five m84 battle tanks stood recently , waiting for turrets and 125millimeter cannons to be installed when yugoslavia broke up in 1991 , the tank plant was paralyzed because more than 70 percent of the components assembled there came from republics other than croatia , the plant s managing director , antun milovic , said but by diversifying its own industry , and by buying essential military components in the former soviet bloc , croatia has now returned the tank plant to operation , and duro davkovic executives said prewar production levels of 100 to 150 tanks a year could soon be met mr susak and mr milovic said croatia aimed to export tanks to kuwait next year under a contract that had been interrupted when yugoslavia collapsed apart from east europe , the other major source of arms in trafficking valued at about 500 million in the last two years appears to have been muslim countries mr beaver and other analysts estimated that iran alone had provided at least 1 , 500 tons of ammunition that reached bosnia through croatia last week , prime minister haris silajdzic of bosnia and prime minister nikica valentic of croatia were in teheran , where they agreed to set up a commission that would meet twice a year to strengthen economic and political ties among iran , croatia and bosnia although croatia and bosnia are clearly cooperating in the import of arms and on the ground in the capture of kupres there are limits to their partnership mr susak said croatia was not providing tanks or artillery to bosnia , a decision that is perhaps not surprising , since bosnian muslims and croats were at war with each other last year thus a lifting of the arms embargo remains important to the bosnian government , because it would mean emancipation from dependence on croatia and because it would provide access to the tanks and artillery the bosnian army still needs on thursday the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution calling for a lifting of the embargo on bosnia though the general assembly has no enforcement power , the united states has drafted a resolution for the united nations security council calling for an automatic lifting of the arms ban on bosnia in six months the bosnian serbs still have an estimated 600 pieces of heavy artillery against about 100 for the muslims , and a marked superiority in tanks a counterattack against recent bosnian gains is possible we cannot accept the status quo , mr silajdzic said in a recent interview that is why we want the lifting of the embargo to gain strength and negotiate from a balance of power photo bosnian croat forces fired rockets from a mobile launcher near kupres yesterday croatia s defense minister says the arms market in the balkans is so saturated with weapons from former warsaw pact countries that the bosnian and croat allies can easily buy what they need to fight the serbs \( associated press \) \( pg 5 \) map of

with more than 3 , 000 stock mutual funds clamoring for investors' attention , it s not surprising that a few good ones slip through the cracks but it s worth the research to find them , particularly today as more and more topnotch funds slam the door on new investors in its fifth annual list of forgotten funds , morningstar inc , fund researchers in chicago , presents a handful of overlooked stock funds it calls real winners despite impressive returns , none of the funds had more than 125 million in assets when morningstar did its screening in february , perhaps because of poor marketing or bad naming or just plain bad luck , say the researchers the five funds have managers who have steered them for at least three years morningstar says the funds offer prospective buyers the comfort of an established track record and their portfolio managers the luxury of putting assets to work gently four of the five funds hunt for bargains , one abroad the last built its record on highflying technology issues while the stock market has taken a big dive , most of the five managers are waiting for further dips in prices before buying connecticut mutual growth \( 5 percent load \) is a 65 million quantitative fund that picks stocks based on low priceearnings ratios and earnings surprises cheap stocks are normally what value investors look for , while earnings surprises are traditionally in the growth investors' camp , but the fund s manager , peter antos , says one or the other of the two strategies works most of the time he looks for belowmarket priceearnings ratios the fund s pe is roughly 13 1 2 times projected 1994 earnings , compared with 17 or 18 for the market as for earnings surprises , he collects the consensus of wall street analysts and compares them quarterly with reported earnings mr antos whittles a universe of 1 , 700 stocks down to 150 or 200 , which he then analyzes for changes in management or industry fundamentals , litigation or other qualitative factors , and ends up with roughly 65 stocks in the portfolio he has avoided food , drugs and tobacco companies for the last three or four years but is starting to move gingerly back in , he says the fund s top five holdings are compaq computer , ameritech , xerox , mattel and john deere the 62 million evergreen value timing fund \( no load \) is a classic case of a good fund with a bad name , says morningstar while most investors think of market timing funds as risky , evergreen is as staid and conservative as they come its manager , edmund h nicklin jr , says he looks for undervaluations , which leads to a contrarian approach a current theme is productivity enhancement because companies that can do that will prosper in the 90 s , almost independent of the stock market the fund s largest holding is reynolds reynolds , which supplies computer systems for auto dealers mr nicklin also likes restructurings , including w r grace , where the new ceo has been liquidating businesses , focusing on home health care and specialty chemicals the 58 million franklin balance sheet investment fund \( 15 percent load \) owns an unusual mix of cheap stocks and closedend funds its comanagers , william j lippman and bruce c baughman , look for stocks selling at 10 to 20 percent discounts to their book value today , they find the biggest bargains in banks and savings and loans they also look for closedend funds that sell for 20 percent below their historical discount because if you buy a decent closedend fund with a good investment team , you 're buying quality stocks worth 1 for 80 cents , mr lippman says today , funds account for only 12 percent of their portfolio because the market has been so strong the last three years but because of the recent break , in a couple of months we might see a lot of closedend funds go to historically low discounts , he says the largest fund holdings are gemini ii , quest for value and morgan grenfell small cap the 91 million gam international fund \( 5 percent load \) , a money management firm with worldwide operations , has the best record among international funds since its 1985 inception , morningstar says its manager

holdings account for roughly 25 to 30 percent of the fund , split equally between german and dutch issues but that can change quickly 20 percent of the fund was invested in singapore until december the largest holdings today include severn trent water , northern ireland electricity and banco popular investors are already discovering the seligman communications and information fund \( 475 percent

dr daniel fass , a radiation oncologist with a private practice in greenwich , conn , and his wife , jessica , expected to breeze through the mortgage process for their first home after all , he had the money for a down payment , a squeaky clean credit history and a rocksolid career the lender sized up the situation far differently dr fass was rejected because he could not show that his practice had been profitable for at least two years , the customary requirement for someone selfemployed it was a real catch22 , he said , explaining that his office had been open only a year like many firsttime home buyers , the fasses learned that anything unusual can stymie a mortgage application and that lenders have changed since the freewheeling 80 s the screws have definitely been tightened , said paul havemann , vice president of hsh associates , a mortgage tracking company in butler , nj he cited as reasons the increases in both delinquency and default rates during the recession and the regulatory pressure on lenders firsttime buyers get particular scrutiny , mr havemann said , because they are notorious for fudging the facts out of fear of being rejected and many of the people flooding into the housing market , where sales rose to a sevenandahalfyear high in november , are firsttimers , as low rates and low prices combine to make housing more affordable this week , the average fixed rate on 30year mortgages fell below 7 percent for the millions of americans considering a home purchase this year , selfemployment is just one of the potential stumbling blocks problems may arise over an incorrect or a tarnished credit report even a history of paying bills on time may be insufficient sometimes lenders balk at multiple credit cards , which expose the potential for future debt with some persistence , such obstacles can generally be surmounted the fasses , for example , ultimately triumphed with the help of a mortgage broker who found a more accommodating lender the hassle , though , could be costly if your mortgage application is delayed , someone else may step in to buy the house you so desire or interest rates may rise while you smooth out problems and if the lenders with the best rates completely reject you , you will wind up paying more a few simple steps can help make the most of your situation among the easiest problems to detect is an error on a credit report margaret scott , president of mortgage advisory services of manhattan , advises people to contact the three big reporting agencies trw , equifax inc and the trans union corporation before they even apply for a loan a mortgage broker can also screen your record through available data bases if you find an erroneous entry , you will probably have to send a letter of explanation to the bureau , which will contact the source of the problem if a legitimate debt appears on your report , say a longforgotten unpaid account at a department store in another city , you may want to contact the lender and set up a payment plan mortgage brokers , real estate brokers and lawyers can all provide advice on how to deal with a credit problem a credit advocate or counseling agency might be able to help be cautious , though fraud has been a problem in this unregulated business make sure the credit counselor will do more than charge 100 for copies of your credit reports , available for no more than a nominal fee steven berman , president of credit advocates of manhattan , said he would negotiate with creditors for a settlement of overdue debts , urging them to accept partial payment , at an average cost to the client of 400 to finish the job , he gets creditors to submit a clearance letter to remove the blot from credit reports any delinquency on a credit report or unusual gap in employment history should be explained in a letter accompanying a mortgage application for example , if bills fell overdue because of an illness , divorce or layoff , inform the lender and explain that payments have otherwise been timely the same applies to a break in work because of a death in the family or some other crisis of course , mortgage makers may still balk , even at apparently good credit records cathy huskins and her husband , dennis , stumbled over a problem last fall because they had paid a mortgage in the past and owned some property outright , they considered their record stellar we owed no money , said mrs huskins , who lives in fairfield county , conn we had no car loans , no debt yet the couple had a total of 150 , 000 in credit lines on about a dozen credit cards , none of which they were using they had to cancel all but two of those cards before they could borrow 100 , 000 geri detweiler , executive director of the bankcard holders of america , a consumer education group in herndon , va , said lenders used to look only at the amount of debt outstanding , but now delve deeper you could run up bills on all those card tomorrow , she explained , and not be able to pay your mortgage because home lenders still consider an applicant s total debt , it may be wise to postpone major purchases , like a new car , until after buying a house in any case , home buyers will want to pay off credit cards and other debt where possible , to keep the total , including mortgage payments , under the lender s benchmark of 36 percent of gross monthly income a lender may be unwilling to approve a loan if it appraises a house for less than the selling price , a particular problem in the northeast alternatives include renegotiating with the sellers , challenging the appraisal by showing similar valuations in the market and asking the sellers to finance the difference the simplest solution might be to try another lender , since appraisals vary , as well as down payments some lenders permit a 5 to 10 percent down payment instead of the usual 20 percent countrywide funding of pasadena , calif , for example , makes lowdownpayment loans with geographic and income restrictions , and most governmentbacked loan programs have relaxed requirements scanning the market can be timeconsuming , whether looking for a lender who will be flexible or simply finding

all but one of the eight gunshots that turned a crowded east side subway station into a battlefield monday night were fired by police officers mistakenly aiming at each other , police officials said yesterday the remaining shot , they said , occurred when a suspect dropped his shotgun and it went off in the tumult , an offduty new york city police officer opened fire on a black undercover transit officer , hitting him four times , at least twice in the back , the officials said the incident , which began when passengers reported seeing two teenagers with guns in the 53d street subway station , ended with the transit officer , desmond robinson , critically wounded the city police officer , peter del debbio , was shot in the arm , and a civilian , patricia coples , was struck in the legs by shotgun pellets the shootings raised questions once again about police safeguards intended to protect undercover officers from socalled friendly fire the shooting of officer robinson also focused attention on whether black undercover officers are more at risk in such confusing situations police commissioner william j bratton said he would consider instituting in his own department the training that transit officers already receive to teach them to recognize that a person who appears to be a suspect may actually be an undercover officer but he defended the actions of his department and those of officer del debbio , who opened fire on officer robinson although the investigation is not complete , mr bratton said , police officials have so far concluded that officer del debbio made a snap judgment that was tragic but understandable this was 15 seconds of sheer terror for these two men who did what they were supposed to do , mr bratton said we 're not going to secondguess them but the guardians , a black officers' association with chapters in both the city and transit police forces , saw the incident differently , saying it could have been averted with better training they called for the arrest and prosecution of officer del debbio for shooting officer robinson to shoot him three times in the back is outandout murder period , said sgt kelvin alexander , the president of the transit police unit of the guardians and he should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law i do n't think he knew it was a cop he was just killing another black man , and that is indicative of a sickness right there several crucial questions remain unanswered , including why neither officer del debbio nor officer robinson apparently identified himself as a police officer , and why officer robinson was not displaying his badge or wearing the colored bands that undercover officers often use to identify themselves to other officers mayor rudolph w giuliani held a news conference at city hall yesterday in an attempt to play down the racial issue , and police officials repeatedly said officer del debbio is hispanic the officer s mother is puerto rican , and his father is italianamerican officials also noted that officer robinson was in civilian clothes as a member of an undercover squad seeking pickpockets it would really be unfortunate for people to draw conclusions , mayor giuliani said we should try to suspend judgment he added that the two wounded officers were acting as they have to act to protect others the events which led to the shootings began about 7 pm , when two people leaving the station at 53d street and lexington avenue told a uniformed transit police sergeant and his driver that they saw two armed teenagers on the e and f subway platform the two officers ran down the up escalator and were joined by officer robinson and his pickpocket detail in pursuing the teenagers the sergeant captured damal parham , 16 , as the youth dropped a 22caliber derringer on the platform the second suspect , shea kisine davis , 17 , ran , drawing a sawedoff shotgun from a slit in the leg of his pants , said joseph borrelli , the chief of detectives while mr davis was trying to drop the gun between the parked e train and the platform , it went off with a sharp explosion , chief borrelli said , and some of the pellets struck ms coples , who was not seriously injured then mr davis ran into the queensbound e train , in which officer del debbio was sitting , though apparently in a different car the police said the accounts of more than 40 witnesses differ in several respects at this point but at least one witness said officer del debbio crouched down on the subway car floor in a militarystyle firing position , with one knee on the ground , as he trained his gun on officer robinson through a door that repeatedly opened and shut pointblank firing \? a 47yearold new jersey commuter named dennis kearns said he saw a man , later identified as officer del debbio kneeling with his gun over another man , later identified as officer robinson , who lay face down , half in the train and half on the platform he said the kneeling man fired his gun three times at pointblank range into the other man s back
the myth man by elizabeth swados 326 pages viking 2195 a theater artist is an alchemist of human behavior we take what is horrible and make it into something deep and beautiful sometimes , however , we must take golden moments and change them into something savage with these highflown words , sasha novotny , the director of a famous lower west side of manhattan theater ensemble much admired by the likes of susan sontag and ionesco , invites a 9yearold mute girl to go on the soulsaving pilgrimage recounted in elizabeth swados s ambitious new novel , the myth man the child whom sasha addresses is actually the daughter of a florida prostitute who named her rikki nelson , after the rockandroll singer from the happy postcard family when a doctor threatened to turn rikki over to the social service department because of the sexual abuse inflicted on her by her mother s older customers , rikki s alcoholic father kidnaped her , drove her north to new york city , coached her to become a child star of television commercials and then sold her to sasha s drama company rikki s reaction to her traumas was to cease speaking talking was treacherous , she explains i chose silence like nuns or monks still she willingly submits to rigorous training in mime , music and dance by the multicultural members of sasha s troupe looking back at the age of 20 , she describes in the first person how she became the central figure of a show called the myth man as bruce , the company s dramaturge , explains to her the way it goes is that there s a small child guess who \? and the kid wo n't go to sleep so her ancient , wise grandfather conjures up some greek gods to teach her about life , death and the here , there and everywhere after the gods become so real , the grandfather has no power to help the little girl she must save herself and her grandfather with what she learns on her journey ms swados is , of course , the playwright , composer , songwriter , director and choreographer whose bestknown theater works are runaways and nightclub cantata but she has also published a previous novel , leah and lazar \( 1982 \) , and a memoir , the four of us \( 1992 \) , both of which concerned her embrace of art as a way of overcoming the experience of growing up with an emotionally disturbed elder brother in the myth man , she has distanced herself from this material somewhat , sublimating it into a plot removed from herself and writing about it in a cooler , more objective style than she did in her earlier books where the poetry of leah and lazar was in its language , here it is more in the events of the story , leaving the language to be sharper , wittier and more playful the most lyrical passages are spent on descriptions of the mythic scenes in sasha s drama sasha began to spin , rikki recalls he was a heron the sky was turning red it blazed behind his circles after a while i did n't hear the drum anymore sasha had taken off i was behind him he was circling manhattan higher and higher i was on his wing we were going to burn up and god was waiting in the flames yet such verbal flights are continually undercut by humor the overserious sasha has a brother , charles , a famous drag queen who takes over as rikki s nanny and nurtures her with a healing love after a spellbindingly sensuous performance of narcissus falling in love with his reflection , charles gets stuck in the trapdoor representing the pool of water when rikki gets sick from training too hard , charles visits her in st vincent s hospital dressed in a nun s magnificent white habit as the fame of the troupe spreads , and europe vies with america to toast its celebrity , ms swados misses no opening to satirize what happens to artists in the corporate state predictably enough , the myths that rikki must learn from grow more and more contemporary , as ms swados develops her thesis that no matter how much human beings may have advanced technologically , we are still ruled by the same forces which tormented our primitive ancestors unfortunately , the reader is not as deeply engaged by the experience as rikki becomes one problem is that the story s appeal depends on our caring about an experimental theater company that resembles the living theater of the 1960 s and 70 s or artaud s theater of cruelty or jerzy grotowski s polish laboratory theater or brecht s berliner ensemble , none of which ever resembled a utopian community , even in an age when the profession of acting is no longer disdained and , after all , even shakespeare retired from the king s men at a relatively early age when he could afford to moreover , ms swados fails to create a goal worthy of a reader s deep concern when she has sasha take his troupe into the amazonian jungle in a nonsatirical search for some annealing vision the author does write strongly about the sufferings of the ensemble on its trek deep into the heart of darkness but as rikki and her companions grow feverish from heat and disease , you half expect the appearance of ambrose , the butler who shows up in the jungle hallucination at the end of evelyn waugh s novel , a handful of dust , and announces to the delirious protagonist , the city is served finally , although ms swados has created spirited characters , along with vivid , often funny , scenes for them to act in , you do n't care enough about their conflicts to stay deeply engaged the myth man , for all its flights and aspirations , never quite bursts into the flame of truth photo elizabeth swados \( sara krulwich viking \)
with school in full swing , lice and ringworm have once again gone to the heads of the class but while the families of affected children are most distressed by what they regard as embarrassing if not repulsive infestations , dermatologists say the real problems lie in misdiagnosis and inappropriate and sometimes hazardous treatments ringworm reemerges a halfcentury ago , ringworm , a fungal infection that most often attacks the scalp , was a common scourge among schoolaged children and while it lapsed into relative obscurity for decades , ringworm is now back in a more insidious form that is harder to recognize and trickier to treat in its previous incarnation , ringworm mainly affected caucasian children and could be detected easily because the fungus that caused it fluoresced under ultraviolet light the current form of the disease most often attacks africanamerican children and must be diagnosed by taking scrapings of the scalp and culturing the fungus although primarily a disease of schoolage children , it is becoming increasingly common among adults and infants , according to dr ilona j frieden and dr renee howard , dermatologists at the university of california in san francisco ringworm is a misnomer , since the new infection does not form a ring and neither resembles nor is caused by a worm this fungal infection , known medically as tinea capitis , can be present for months or years before subtle but widely distributed hair loss and inflammation become apparent children with ringworm in its early stages may complain about itching and flaking of the scalp , which is often mistaken for dandruff and treated futilely with overthecounter medicated shampoos as the infection progresses , a closer look should reveal tiny black dots on the scalp at the hairline the dots are the remnants of hairs that have broken off within the follicle as a result of the infection misdiagnosis and delays in diagnosis have allowed ringworm to spread unchecked in classrooms , daycare centers and within families , said dr rebat m halder , chairman of the department of dermatology at howard university hospital in washington the infection is easily transmitted through shared combs , brushes , caps , hair ribbons , barrettes and the like , although simply washing such items in hot soapy water is all that is needed to get rid of the fungus , dr halder said it can also be acquired from contact with telephone receivers and seat backs that have been contaminated by a previous user children from 3 to 9 years old are most likely to pick it up while it is more common in inner cities , every schoolage child poor or rich is a potential target genetic factors and certain haircare practices like tight hair braiding and the use of pomades and oily hair dressings are believed to increase the vulnerability of black children the fungus at first attacks nonhairy skin tight braids can leave parts of the scalp exposed and unprotected , and gluey hair dressings can give the fungus a better opportunity to adhere to the scalp and invade the current culprit is a fungus known as trichophyton tonsurans , which is estimated to cause 90 percent of cases in this country unlike the ringworm fungus of yore , this one does not respond to topical treatments , because the organism grows within the hair shaft so that substances applied directly to the scalp cannot eradicate it rather , t tonsurans infections must be treated with oral medication , typically an antifungal agent called griseofulvin taken daily for at least six weeks since many adults are symptomless carriers of the fungus , to reduce the chances of reinfection , when one person in a family is found to be infected , all members of the household should be tested and treated if necessary epidemics of head lice in the last 15 years , outbreaks of head lice have become commonplace in schools and show little respect for education , social class or degree of cleanliness every school year , more than six million cases come to light , a significant share of them representing repeated attacks by these tiny , wingless insects that feed on human blood head lice are uncommon among black children dr mervyn elgart , chairman of dermatology at george washington university medical school in washington , describes head lice as more of a psychological problem than a real medical problem parents understandably cringe when their wellcaredfor children are invaded by creepy , crawling creatures but head lice can become a medical problem if the wrong substances are used to treat the condition or if the appropriate substances are overused because remedies are sold overthecounter as shampoos , creams and lotions , many parents fail to appreciate the fact that they contain potent insecticides that can become highly toxic if misused particularly risky are products that contain lindane , which can sometimes cause seizures or convulsions and brain damage , especially in very young children , even when used according to directions although the bestknown lindane product , kwell , is no longer being manufactured , generic forms of lindane are still available louse bites can cause severe itching , and those who scratch for relief can sometimes develop secondary infections most commonly , it is not the insects themselves but their oval , yellowishwhite eggs , or nits , that are noticed by parents undisturbed , the female louse lays three to five eggs a day for about a month the eggs are attached to the base of hairs , often on eyelashes and eyebrows as well as on the head they spread easily from person to person , usually through direct headtohead contact but contaminated clothing , bedding , grooming items and headphones can spread them as well , for example , when several children s coats are hung together on the same hook getting rid of lice requires simultaneous treatment of all infected individuals who are in close contact although there is considerable controversy about the best and safest products , most dermatologists now recommend a cream rinse called nix , which contains permethrin , a pesticide minimally toxic to mammals a onetime treatment kills only the adult lice , but the chemical remains active on the hair and scalp for 10 days or longer \( even if you shampoo and swim daily \) and can kill adult lice that emerge later from the impervious eggs deborah altschuler , president of the national pediculosis association in boston , said there were problems with all the available products , with none living up to

what to rent \? it happens all the time in video stores movie seekers do n't find what they want and leave emptyhanded or with consolation choices that do n't live up to cassettebox blurbs , critics' assessments or clerks' recommendations the truth is , though , that with 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 movies in circulation , there is a lot to like that even heavy renters do n't know about you have to lead them to it , said brad burnside , the owner of the video adventure chain , based in evanston , ill to do that , mr burnside and two partners \( both computer experts and one a psychology professor at northwestern university \) , have invented a computerized titlehunting system for customers in video stores they call it clair v \( for clairvoyance \) title hunts often focus on genres , stars or descriptions of films clair v takes another approach movies are identified and recommended solely based on the opinions of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide to begin , movie seekers step up to a clair v monitor and rate several movies they have seen , picking one of six choices must see , highly recommended , recommended , ok , poor or bad those ratings are entered into a computer and correlated with ratings by thousands of other people using that information , mr burnside said , clair v can confidently recommend movies the renter would like the computer s correlations might surmise , for example , that if an individual rates schindler s list as a must see and days of thunder as poor , then that viewer would enjoy certain other movies , based upon thousands of ratings given to those and other films by all kinds of people many of the recommended films might be ones the viewer had not even heard of , let alone rented clair v correlates titles simply by whether people like the films or not it has no interest in why we do n't want to know why , because each person has different reasons , said johann george , a partner in the venture three years ago mr burnside began to collect data , by mailing a list of 100 titles to 1 , 000 video retailers around the country their ratings were the first of what he says he hopes will become millions and even billions of pieces of information as more consumers rate more movies in video stores as the data pool grows , he added , the system s correlations will become more sophisticated and clair v will be able to recommend more and more films to each user on a first visit , clair v can recommend a movie or two after a user has rated five or six films mr burnside said the system was to begin operating next month in

carpets are a perfect furniture one can sleep or socialize or meditate on them they can be rolled or folded for easy transport , and admired on the wall or underfoot they define a home wherever they are spread , and the house from which they are missing is inhospitably cold so , at least , thought many ancient cultures , including that of persia it was from persia that some of the world s finest rugs came , and none were more luxurious than those produced under the safavid dynasty in the 16th century , a magical moment for islamic art , when lavishness and suavity were in precise alignment this balance is evident in the small , elegant exhibition titled silk kashan rugs at the metropolitan museum of art organized by the curator daniel walsh , it consists of four carpets of the same size \( roughly 5 feet by 8 feet \) hung in an intimate culdesac , the hagop kevorkian gallery everything about them is special , beginning with their provenance the city of kashan in central iran was famed for its innovative lusterpainted ceramics , its copperware and perfumes \( distilled from the great rose fields of qamsar nearby \) , and for its magnificent carpets only 20 examples of such carpets are known to exist today of these the met owns four a unique collection , though the two grandest kashan examples are in boston and vienna and this exhibition is the first time they have ever been shown together although many rugs of the period were woven of wool , the kashan carpets have a pile of fine silk that has developed a slightly crumbly , tenderlooking surface texture in places the nap is worn to bare thread and the rugs look as sheer and pliable as garments their mineral and vegetable colors have softened with time to rose and ivory , pale seagreen and midnight blue , with a touch of pink here and there in floral border designs flowers are , in fact , the primary motif in the three medallion carpets in the show , so called for the large lobed or starshaped geometric form at their centers although they vary in design , these medallions all suggest stylized flowers plump , glamorous hybrids of the islamic rose and the chinese lotus , defining in a stroke the cultural mix of persian art the twining , selfgenerating arabesques of smaller blossoms and leaves that surround them elaborate the image of a symmetrical but dizzyingly decorative garden , which draws its energy from a single source this vision of vegetable abundance contrasts sharply with the motif of the fourth rug here the medallion itself is replaced by the very specific , violent image of what appears to be a mongolstyle blue dragon attacking a horse or ass and wrestling it to the ground similar acts of animal aggression fill the rest of the rug s central panel , all set against a field of vivid wildflowers such conflicting emblems lie at the very heart of a culture that delighted in contradictions , between good and evil , art and utility , the sacred and the profane the designs of the kashan carpets were probably copied from books , of very different kinds flowered medallions from the illuminated korans animals from illustrated epics and both themes equally suited the rugs' intended audience ruling aristocrats who saw themselves both as citizens of a selfcreated paradise and masters of the political universe that complex selfimage is evident in the carpets themselves , where animals look more balletic than predatory and the delicate flowers are frozen in a kind of supernatural perfection and one can see it more clearly still in the persian manuscript room a few steps from the kevorkian gallery here one finds the jewellike painted pages of the 16thcentury book known as the houghton shahnama , a history of the ancient persian kings these are stories of cruelty and intrigue , bloodshed and betrayal , though one would scarcely guess it from the fairytale palaces pictured , each a densely curtained and carpeted world of pure , exquisite ornament whatever the reality , this is the world for which the kashan carpets were conceived , and magnificent barely describes it silk kashan rugs remains at the metropolitan museum of art , fifth avenue at 82d street , through jan 8 photo a magical moment for islamic art two 16thcentury kashan silk carpets , at the metropolitan museum of art \( don hogan charles the new york times \)
jerusalem , dec 9 israeli and palestinian leaders flew off today to pick up their shared nobel peace prize in oslo , where they are likely to find the political climate considerably warmer than what they left behind their departures for the nobel ceremony on saturday said a lot about the balance of power prime minister yitzhak rabin and foreign minister shimon peres of israel went to norway on an israeli military plane , accompanied by an entourage of 100 guests , aides and security guards yasir arafat , who does not have a plane let alone an air force , left his selfrule headquarters in the gaza strip with his newly pregnant wife , suha tawil , drove to egypt and boarded a small jet provided by norway we 're not rich like the israeli government , mr arafat said teasingly on thursday , casting himself , with mr peres at his side in gaza , as the poor country cousin of the oslo extravaganza but even if their travel arrangements were unequal , the recipients had a lot more in common than the peace prize in gamblers' parlance , none of them are on a roll mr arafat has been politically clobbered in gaza , where the antiisrael uprising known in arabic as the intifada , which began seven years ago today , is all but finished now except in name foreign aid has been slow to arrive , and his selfrule government is beset by a strong islamic resistance and a cascade of criticism from palestinians questioning his competence , his commitment to democracy and his ability to make the transition from revolutionary to governor moreover , many palestinians doubt that the nobel by itself can turn things around for him , especially since people in gaza and the west bank have little affection for the prize the last middle eastern winners were prime minister menachem begin of israel and president anwar elsadat of egypt , in 1978 , when they signed the camp david accords to palestinians , those agreements were a sellout of their interests mr rabin and mr peres may also find it a relief to be away from home opinion polls suggest that if elections were held today , mr rabin would lose to benjamin netanyahu , leader of the rightist likud party and an opponent of israel s selfrule agreement with mr arafat , which like the nobel was birthed in oslo instead of rejoicing in their peace treaty with jordan and new contacts with other arab nations , israelis worry more about a steady wave of terrorist attacks by islamic radicals from the territories instead of celebrating a sharp drop in unemployment and economic growth estimated this year at a robust 65 percent , they have dwelt on their climbing inflation rate , now 15 percent on an unpopular new capital gains tax , and on a stock marked where prices have falled 40 percent this year a few months ago , mr rabin s party lost control of the giant labor federation , histadrut , a development that once would have seemed as likely as roman catholics' being tossed out of the vatican frantic labor leaders , smelling possible disaster in the 1996 elections , have begun squabbling among themselves , so fiercely that one member of parliament , avraham burg , warned this week that the party was a footstep away from the abyss at a labor caucus the other day , a lawmaker named shlomo buhbut pleaded with mr rabin not to go to oslo yitzhak , the house is on fire , he said stay in israel , and we 'll put it out

in a change intended to encourage mental health professionals to view a patient s religious experience more seriously , the next edition of the standard guide for psychiatric diagnoses includes a new entry entitled religious or spiritual problem by recognizing religious problems as a category of concern distinct from any mental disorder , the revision reflects psychiatry s steady movement away from an earlier tendency to treat religion as a delusion or as evidence of immaturity , escapism or neurosis the entry will appear in may in the next edition of the american psychiatric association s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , a barometer of cultural change as well as a tool for psychiatric diagnosis the entry will be added to a section listing conditions that do not necessarily indicate a mental disorder but that may nonetheless lead people to seek help from psychiatrists , psychologists , counselors or social workers problems of living the section , called other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention , contains categories as general as marital problem , bereavement or educational problem these are considered problems of living , as distinct from psychiatric illness according to the forthcoming manual , the kinds of religious or spiritual problems that may lead people to seek help include distressing experiences that involve loss or questioning of faith , problems associated with conversion to a new faith , or questioning of other spiritual values dr francis lu , a san francisco psychiatrist , said he and two other mental health professionals in the bay area proposed the addition because they feared that people with such problems were being misdiagnosed and mistreated dr lu is also an associate clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at the university of california medical school at san francisco these are somewhat unusual states of consciousness and experiences , he said , and the mental health practitioner might diagnose them as a sign or symptom of a mental disorder the hope here , he added , is to alert the mental health practitioner to the possibility of considering a religious or spiritual problem instead 'neardeath' experiences dr robert turner , another proponent of the change , gave the example of what have been termed neardeath or afterdeath experiences reported by people who have suffered cardiac arrests or other nearly fatal incidents researchers now recognize that such experiences , however they are explained , are not uncommon but 20 years ago , dr turner said , if a person had been resuscitated and reported this kind of experience , he or she might have been labeled psychotic and given medication similar problems exist , he said , with mystical experience or various forms of peak experiences , transcendent experiences these are usually quite positive , happy experiences , he said , but when people come down from that , they go through a great deal of upheaval trying to integrate the experience into everyday life one tendency in the mental health field , dr turner added , is to take all this as a mental disorder or a sign of psychosis , something pathological , a regressive state this reduces to a sickness something that can be lifechanging in a positive way , he said but if a religious perspective is brought to this , he said , there is a way of validating the experience these people are going through , enabling them to integrate it and reach a higher level of functioning as much as possible in these cases , he indicated , therapists should deal with patients' distress while letting them understand the transcendent experience within their own spiritual framework besides maintaining a private practice , dr turner is an assistant clinical professor in the same medical school department as dr lu the new manual will still contain categories of mental illness applicable to people displaying bizarre religious behavior , delusions or obsessions , though mental health workers may inevitably disagree about specific cases in recent years psychiatry has been drawn into controversies about cults and other new religious groups , and the added reference to conversion may encourage practitioners to take religious conversion at face value and remove it from the inflammatory language of thought control , brainwashing and cultists , said stephen post , an associate professor at the center for biomedical ethics at case western reserve medical school in cleveland a common terminology all proposed revisions in the manual were reviewed and approved first by a 23member task force and then , last may , by the trustees and about 200 members of the assembly of the american psychiatric association as psychiatry s official manual , the diagnostic and statistical manual provides therapists with a common terminology for research and billing , although all practitioners do not follow it strictly in their diagnoses changes in the manual can have an impact on social attitudes and legal practice outlook , as well as psychiatric treatment in 1973 , for example , after a bitter controversy among psychiatrists , homosexuality was removed from the manual s list of personality disorders two months ago the american journal of psychiatry published an article concluding that the manual s glossary of technical terms frequently referred to religion in illustrating psychopathologies this stereotyping of religion as clinically harmful , the authors of the article wrote , contradicted extensive findings that religion was positively associated with mental health in another article in the american journal of psychiatry , the same researchers found that from 1978 to 1982 fewer than 3 percent of the studies published in four leading psychiatry journals included any systematic attention to religion , and that virtually none had treated it in a sophisticated way dr david b larson , a psychiatrist who teaches at duke university medical center and was a chief author of these articles , said that many mental health clinicians either ignored religion or treated it negatively reform is needed in psychiatric and psychological training , dr larson said , where people get the same old stuff that religion is harmful , the same anecdotes about a fundamentalist who was always the first one at church but was sexually abusing his kids in the garage long history of hostility antagonism between religion and the mental health profession has a long history although a few pioneers of psychology like william james studied religion sympathetically , others , including sigmund freud , treated it as a comforting illusion that a mature person or society would outgrow dr harold alan pincus , deputy medical director of the american psychiatric association s office of research , called the new entry on religion a sign of the profession s growing sensitivity not only to religion , but also to cultural diversity generally dr pincus served as vice chairman in charge of revising the manual dr lu attributed his own concern partly to his chineseamerican background and interest in buddhism this has given me a sense of difference , he said , and a sensitivity that certain religious experiences might be seen as pathological because they are not as familiar he also said that after attending a fiveday seminary by joseph campbell , the scholar of mythology , in 1978 , he had a revelation or an epiphany , that in some way my purpose in life was to bring together the east and the west this proposal , he added , is part of my living out of that epiphany
of all public television s problems , and there are many , one must be especially galling the tendency of viewers and critics to take excellence for granted the stunning photography in nature , the keen intelligence of american playhouse , the best of british television on series like masterpiece theater and mystery , the political courage of domestic series like pov and rights and wrongs all taken for granted after a season or two this evening s case in point is the metropolitan opera presents and its superb rendition of richard strauss s elektra , taped during live performances in january this presentation \( a stereo simulcast is being broadcast on wqxrfm \) opens the 19th season of metropolitan opera telecasts on pbs , supported prominently by texaco in the beginning , there was some uncertainty as camera crews , needing extra lighting , were monitored with occasional hostility by paying customers in the audience but advances in technology have made the tapings remarkably unobtrusive , and , in fact those performances are now preferred by many ticketholders who believe that the very presence of cameras pushes singers and musicians into top form in addition , a few directors have been able to hone into an art the process of transferring big productions to small screens none is now more accomplished than brian large , whose string of powerfully effective electronic translations continues with this elektra it helps , of course , that the production includes a triumphant performance by hildegard behrens in the title role mr large captures it all , down to the most subtle nuances as the first of strauss s six collaborations with the austrian poet hugo von hofmannsthal the most popular would be der rosenkavalier elektra is a breathtakingly daring opera running an hour and 45 minutes without an intermission , it wraps the greek tragedy of sophocles , taking an occasional cue from euripides , in the lush orchestrations and harmonies , the ravishing waltz melodies that have established strauss as a towering figure in 20thcentury music wearing a black gown and white makeup , miss behrens is a memorably dramatic elektra , obsessed with avenging the death of her father , agamemnon , at the hands of her mother , klytamnestra , and her mother s lover , aegisth when not railing against her fate \( i'm nursing a vulture inside my body \) , this elektra dominates the stage , whether dancing maniacally or sitting absolutely still , her intense obsession undiminished a rapturous ovation for miss behrens at opera s end is richly deserved and she has some magnificent support , most notably from james levine , the conductor , and from the two other female principals in the cast brigitte fassbaender as a bizarre and rather pathetic klytamnestra who keeps wondering why everything happens to her , and deborah voigt as chrysothemis , elektra s hapless sister who only wants an ordinary life \( i 'd rather be dead than be alive yet nothing once again , following last season s acclaimed broadway production of medea starring diana rigg , greek tragedy proves remarkably attuned to our times , reducing much of contemporary drama to piddling anecdote grappling with primal sources , not psychobabble , proves curiously refreshing public television can still be essential the metropolitan opera presents elektra pbs , tonight at 8 \( channel 13 in new york \) music by richard strauss conducted by james levine produced by otto schenk set and costumes by jurgen rose lighting by gil wechsler stage director , paul mills producers for television , louisa briccetti and daniel anker the metropolitan opera presents is produced by the metropolitan opera in association with thirteen wnet new york peter allen , announcer with hildegard behrens \( elektra \) , deborah voigt \( chrysothemis \) , brigitte fassbaender \( klytamnestra \) , james king \( aegisth \) , donald mcintyre \( orest \) photo hildegard behrens as the metropolitan opera s elektra \( winnie klotz \)
washington , jan 4 medicaid officials in many states have objected to a new directive from the clinton administration that requires states to help pay for abortions for lowincome women in cases of rape or incest in a letter written on behalf of the state medicaid directors' association , ray hanley , the chairman of the group , strongly objected to the administration position mr hanley is also the medicaid director of arkansas the new directive , the latest in a series of efforts by the administration to expand access to abortion , interprets an appropriations bill passed by congress and signed by president clinton on oct 21 but mr hanley said the administration had misinterpreted the law and imposed a firm requirement where congress intended to give states flexibility congressional intent in this area was to be permissive for states , not mandatory , mr hanley wrote volatile issue the complaint by state medicaid directors reopens the volatile issue of abortion just as congress and the administration prepare for a fight over whether to require insurance coverage for the procedure as part of mr clinton s health plan mr hanley was apparently not speaking for all 50 state medicaid directors the organization did not vote on the question he wrote the letter , dated dec 30 , after consulting with a number of state medicaid directors and the organization s executive committee , which is made up of eight state directors in interviews with several state officials , some said they strongly supported mr hanley s letter and a few said they did not know about it none expressed objections to it the association has asked the federal government to reconsider the directive , and the state officials said lawsuits to challenge it were likely timing of announcement in an interview today , mr hanley said the clinton administration had decided to make a political statement by distorting what was intended to be an optional clause in the new law he said the administration had not consulted state officials before issuing the directive on dec 28 and had not given the states time to adjust their laws at least one state , utah , has rejected the federal mandate to pay for medi caid abortions in case of rape or incest we do n't intend to implement that mandate until it is clarified to our satisfaction that it was intended to operate in the way described by the clinton administration , said rod l betit , executive director of the utah health department the utah medicaid program does not cover abortion in case of rape or incest , and congress did not demonstrate a clear intent to supersede state law on this point , mr betit said federal officials insist that their reading of the law is correct and that congress intended to require states to pay for abortions when pregnancies resulted from rape or incest in an interview , sally k richardson , director of the medicaid bureau of the federal health care financing administration , said our interpretation is legally correct i see nothing in mr hanley s letter that would cause us to reconsider our position she said she suspected that some state officials agreed with the clinton administration in any event , she said , the new policy would require medicaid coverage for only about 1 , 000 abortions a year in the past , federal law said no federal medicaid money could be used for abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term language of the law the new law is more convoluted it says , none of the funds appropriated under this act shall be expended for any abortion except when it is made known to the federal entity or official to which funds are appropriated under this act that such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest ms richardson said , states are required to cover abortions that are medically necessary by its action last year , she said , congress added abortions for rape and incest to the category of medically necessary abortions asked tonight about the new directive from washington , audrey rowe , the commissioner of social services in connecticut , said the extra abortion coverage should be optional it s very important that states have the option to determine what their medicaid programs pay for , she said differences among states in his letter , mr hanley said some states would have voluntarily expanded abortion coverage as an optional service for which the congressional appropriation language would have allowed federal financial participation on the other hand , he said , some states , for different reasons , would not elect to expand abortion coverage again in keeping with the optional nature of the appropriation language opponents of abortion made similar arguments when the policy was announced they said the administration had violated assurances to congress that the additional coverage for abortions would be optional in new jersey , alan g wheeler , the acting state medicaid director , said the new federal requirement would not have a big effect because the state was already using its own money to pay for medically necessary abortions in new york , richard m cook , a health policy adviser to gov mario m cuomo , said he had not seen mr hanley s letter the medicaid program in new york pays for approximately 45 , 000 abortions a year , using 15 million of state and local money mr hanley said the federal directive imposed another unfunded federal mandate with apparently no notice or allowed time for comment this , he said , appears to violate an executive order in which the president on oct 26 promised to reduce such mandates the arkansas state constitution says , no public funds will be used to pay for any abortion , except to save the mother s life mr hanley said that a dozen states had similar laws officials from some states that have used state money to pay for abortions in case of rape or incest endorsed the concerns expressed by mr hanley for example , donald w herman , the medicaid director in iowa , said , as a matter of principle , i join my fellow medicaid directors in opposing a federal mandate imposed by a government agency when the language of the statute is permissive kate michelman , president of the national abortion rights action league , said the administration directive faithfully reflected the intent of congress states cannot refuse to provide necessary medical services payment for victims of rape and incest is a necessary medical service , she said
saugerties , ny forget , for the moment , about traffic , parking and facilities do n't think about how long ago the 1960 s were , or about the onslaught of corporate sponsorship , or about how music that once evoked freedom now generates a vast apparatus of control woodstock '94 is , after all , a music festival before it s a cultural symbol it s a bunch of bands playing for a lot of paying customers , on the site in saugerties , and before television screens all over the place and its sheer magnitude more than 40 bands in three days guarantees some good performances woodstock '94 , which opens today , has booked dozens of known quantities , from surviving 60 s stalwarts to current millionsellers what no one can forecast is how the chemistry will work out will the festival become a battle of the bands , geezers versus whippersnappers \? will tiedyed neopsychedelic bands beg to jam with 60 s pioneers \? will young songwriters' adolescent angst meet its match in their elders' midlife crises \? will moshers , mopers and psychedelic swayers all dance on the same patch of farmland \? this time around , the music should be more professional than it was in 1969 better sound systems , less drug use and 25 years' more experience in rock logistics ought to make a difference maybe it wo n't rain so much , either musicians are also more careful now , particularly when , as at woodstock '94 , the world will be watching in 1969 , performers did n't seem to worry much about how they 'd look in the eventual documentary now , after more than a decade of mtv , performers are more selfconscious about images destined for posterity , and they know how to play for the payperview television cameras as well as to the people in front of them for one thing , all the musicians will tune up woodstock '94 does n't take a lot of chances or expose much new talent then again , neither did its 1969 predecessor there are two stages , north and south , separated by a 10minute trek via craft vendors and ecology exhibits there will be overlapping sets , so how the payperview telecast will work is anybody s guess the bestknown performers are scheduled for the north stage , which has a rainbow backdrop and is flanked by giant video screens , while more eclectic and international offerings \( including youssou n 'dour from senegal , hassan hakmoun from morocco , zucchero from italy and geoffrey oryema from uganda \) are set for the south stage to earn its 135 ticket price , woodstock '94 has booked mostly namebrand , markettested performers , representing every wave of rock , from the original 1969 festival \( joe cocker , santana , the band , and crosby , stills and nash \) to the present even today s lineup , which will not be telecast live , leans on the same guitarcharged bands mtv has been pushing lately candlebox , live , collective soul a little babyboomer nostalgia is probably inevitable if joe cocker does n't open the telecast tomorrow by belting with a little help from my friends , i 'll be astonished but as a whole , the festival represents not one generation of performers , as the 1969 festival did , but a quartercentury of musical branches and crosscurrents rock is more fragmented now than it was in 1969 , and the lineup dips into most major commercial genres , from heavy metal and hard rock \( metallica , aerosmith , the rollins band , nine inch nails , king s x \) to hiphop \( cypress hill , arrested development , salt 'n' pepa \) to neopsychedelia \( blind melon , the spin doctors , blues traveler \) to alternative rock \( primus , green day , the cranberries , porno for pyros , candlebox \) to singersongwriters \( melissa etheridge , peter gabriel , bob dylan , sheryl crow \) to reggae and other panamerican grooves \( jimmy cliff , santana , the neville brothers \) there s gospel on sunday morning by singers usually known for more secular songs , like phoebe snow and thelma houston and in the wee hours today through sunday , after the live music ends , techno wizards including many of the style s major figures , like aphex twin and the orb will wield their turntables and electronic devices , generating bleeps and thumps and sputters , turning woodstock into ravestock for those who have enough stamina left to dance perhaps worried that woodstock '94 will lack spontaneity , the festival s organizers have even tried to build in some onetimeonly events jam sessions on sunday night , paul rodgers , the former lead singer of free and bad company , will play blues and rock songs with guest guitarists , including slash \( of guns 'n' roses \) and brian may \( of queen \) and tomorrow , the group billed as the band \( which does not include the old band s main songwriter , robbie robertson \) will be joined by bob weir of the grateful dead , roger mcguinn of the byrds , and hot tuna , whose members played at the 1969 woodstock with the jefferson airplane the original band , of course , recorded its great album music from big pink in saugerties having seen nearly every band on the bill , i can recommend tomorrow s twopart thunderous doom team , nine inch nails and then metallica , followed up with aerosmith s hormonecharged strutting tomorrow afternoon , the impassioned mr n 'dour , whose band knows rhythms that would baffle most american musicians , is well worth hearing , as is the cackling offkilter funk of primus and the levelheaded but lusty raps of salt 'n' pepa on sunday , arrested development brings both melody and a sense of moral uplift to its raps green day sets its punk alienation to hummable tunes santana and the neville brothers , two longrunning bands , have never abandoned the wonders of polyrhythm , while peter gabriel s introspection earns its pomp and mr dylan may just decide to play a great set after all , he snubbed the first woodstock
jerusalem , june 7 his triumphal return , long anticipated by devoted followers , finally came to pass today tens of thousands of people , both the ardently loyal and the discreetly respectful , poured into the streets to welcome back this longabsent leader , hero of the antizionist struggle , who had stayed away from this land for so many years no , it was not yasir arafat , whose planned date of arrival in jericho and the gaza strip continues to be one of the bigger mysteries since judge crater s disappearance the focus of adulation was rabbi moses teitelbaum , spiritual leader of the satmar hasidic sect , who came to jerusalem from brooklyn to tell his disciples here that they must stay true to their beliefs among those tenets total opposition to the zionist entity whose soil they tread , for they believe it is a sin to create a jewish state until after the messiah comes jerusalem is hardly unaccustomed to highprofile visitors but the city and its zionist police , who were left to cope with inevitable traffic jams , were turned on their collective ear by the 82yearold satmar rebbe , or grand rabbi by some estimates , he drew as many as 100 , 000 people when he went to the mea shearim neighborhood , a hasidic stronghold that had been festooned for weeks with banners and wall posters welcoming the king streets became surging rivers of men in black hats and caftans , of women in head scarves and long dresses many waited hours just for a glimpse of the rebbe , women standing behind rope barriers and kept apart from the men , as they are in synagogues and other religious places the turnout was so large that some abandoned false modesty without hesitation , yehuda meshizehav , logistical coordinator for rabbi teitelbaum s twoweek trip , pronounced this royal visit to be the biggest welcome since king david moved his capital to jerusalem from hebron 3 , 000 years ago satmar is not opposed to jews living in the biblical land of israel but the existing state of , by and for jews is another matter since jews do not believe that the messiah has yet come , the creation of this state by the zionists is , for the satmars , an abomination that can only delay god s redemption of the jewish people in israel , satmar s numbers are not overwhelming 3 , 000 or 4 , 000 people , according to some estimates but the sect has influence well beyond those figures , and it is supported by a wellfinanced , politically active organization in the united states with important centers in the williamsburg section of brooklyn and in kiryas joel , a village near west point , ny kiryas joel is the focus of a major case before the united states supreme court , which has been asked to decide whether the town s school for the handicapped should be permitted to receive federal and state aid while kiryas joel is far from rich , the sect has money as a sign of the wealth , rabbi teitelbaum arrived today from new york in the company of 2 , 000 followers who had filled five jumbo jets \( none of which belonged to el al , the zionist state s national carrier \) some 350 raffle winners got to fly on the rebbe s plane one new york loyalist , elazar kastenbaum , paid 500 , 000 to help cover the trip s costs , and his reward was to drive rabbi teitelbaum up winding hills to jerusalem from the national airport named after the legendary zionist figure , david bengurion for those interested in such matters , the honor cost mr kastenbaum about 17 , 000 a mile but the honor is n't in the driving , mr meshizehav said the honor is in whom he s driving the rebbe himself came with 5 million to distribute among individuals and institutions of his sect , which was founded by his uncle , the late rabbi joel teitelbaum , and which takes its name from the romanian town of satu mare rabbi moses teitelbaum became grand rabbi after his uncle s death in 1979 , and he last came to israel 11 years ago satmar is the dominant force in eda haredit , a coalition of hasidic groups in israel that are militantly opposed to the state of israel by contrast , a wellknown rival , the lubavitcher sect , is strongly prozionist its leader , rabbi menachem mendel schneerson , 92 , who lives in new york city and has been hospitalized there since suffering a severe stroke in march , has come out strongly against any israeli compromise with the arabs on territory otherwise , on most theological matters and in their members' physical appearance it is often difficult for outsiders to distinguish the various hasidic groups from one another one element in eda haredit , a small sect called naturei karta , is so antizionist that it has solidly allied itself with mr arafat and his palestine liberation organization in fact , when mr arafat issued his celebrated call last month for a jihad in arabic , a holy war or struggle to liberate jerusalem for muslims , he cited naturei karta as a shining example of jews who are refusing to recognize the state of israel and are considering themselves as palestinians for the satmars , naturei karta goes too far there will be no meetings with the plo on this trip , mr meshizehav said , because the rebbe sees it as an organization that has killed , and anyone who associates with it is a killer besides , he added , while the rebbe may have no use for zionists , he loves jews the sect is not opposed to talking peace with arab states indeed , a satmar hero is yaakov yisrael de haan , a fervent antizionist who had contacts in the 1920 s with arab nationalist leaders and who is said to have been killed 70 years ago by the haganah , the underground military of the jewish settlement in prestate palestine on wednesday , the rebbe is to visit mr de haan s grave on the mount of olives from there , mr meshizehav said , he will look out upon the old city of jerusalem , with its western wall , judaism s holiest site and he will symbolically rip his garments , the aide said , to mourn its fall into the hands of the zionists photos members of the satmar sect struggle to touch the car of their rebbe , rabbi moses teitelbaum , in jerusalem \( agence francepresse \) rabbi moses teitelbaum at

a good friend of mine has lived on duane street for 20 years and she says bouley ruined the neighborhood it brought limousines ! she says with disgust and then the next thing we knew we had bob row bob row , for the uninitiated , is what locals call the block anchored by tribeca grill on greenwich street and nobu on hudson both restaurants are owned by robert de niro and both , according to my friend , are too expensive for most of the artists who live in the area but then they all are , she says , pointing to the nearby chanterelle she worries that her neighborhood is being taken over by restaurants for rich people , and she considers the new spartina the sole ray of hope at last , she says , a real neighborhood restaurant the food is affordable and they always have something i want to eat at most times of the day and night , spartina is filled with people who seem to agree the seats in the sprawling , comfortable room with bare brick walls are occupied by casually dressed people who wave to the neighbors walking past on the sidewalk on nice days , the front of the restaurant is thrown open to the street and the whole room feels like a sidewalk cafe even in the cold months the wall of windows brings the activity outside right into the room spartina clearly wants to be part of the local scene have the pizza , says my friend everybody does and no wonder the rectangles of dough are grilled rather than baked , which makes them thin and crisp if you have had the pizzas at il forno in providence , ri , or at fresco on 52d street you will recognize the style the pizzas are topped with fresh sauces or various cheeses and they are usually fabulous occasionally , however , the dough is stretched too thin , making the pizzas taste like cheesetopped crackers but this is not an italian restaurant the menu seems designed to feed restless appetites and it roams the world for inspiration so the sweet , lusty lamb ribs are sprinkled with moroccan spices , the cod is basque , the lamb shank catalan so much to choose from ! exults my friend the first time my friend took me to spartina i had veal bolognese unfortunately , the classic version of the dish , which was completely delicious , has disappeared from the menu was it too traditional for the neighborhood \? perhaps every time i go to spartina i find myself surrounded by people happily digging into huge platefuls of black linguine with calamari and spicy chorizo it s catalan , our waiter said helpfully when i tried the dish i'm not sure catalonia would want to be burdened with the responsibility for this rich and awkward dish i find it so heavy that i can never eat more than a couple of bites i have trouble with the lasagna , too , a baroque combination of chicken , goat cheese and mushrooms served in a slab large enough to obscure an entire plate when i had the lasagna , it was tepid and dull after a couple of bites , i found myself staring miserably at the plate , wondering what i was going to do with the rest of the mound all of the portions are large the roasted beet and onion salad with mushrooms is made of such big and meaty beets , the dish seems like an entree fried calamari arrive in a big heap that begs to be shared by a couple of people , and the ribolita , a bland version of the breadenriched soup , would make a nourishing supper as for grilled chicken livers with madeira , gorgonzola and polenta this is an appetizer \? the chicken livers , like many of the first courses , seem to be trying too hard the entrees are more relaxed and more appealing chicken roasted beneath a brick is a fine , flattened bird , straightforward and appealing with its garlic mashed potatoes codfish basquaise \( it becomes monkfish on the dinner menu \) is a wonderful piece of fish draped in a tasty stew of sauteed peppers and served on the same garlicky potatoes the grilled chicken breast is a bit stringy and overcooked , but it comes on a bed of polenta so buttery and seductive that its faults are easy to overlook this is earthy rustic food , appealing for its simplicity but you know what i like best \? asks my friend i like to come in and order all the side dishes cauliflower with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese , broccoli rabe , a bowl of whipped potatoes i can do it any time i get hungry and if i'm alone i can sit at the bar and find someone to talk to that s why this is such a great neighborhood place even my friend agrees that the desserts need work oh , do n't have that , she urges when i order the angel food terrine like a fool i do n't listen and soon find myself staring glumly at a glass filled with cubed angelfood cake , whipped cream and berries it looks exactly like something that should be served at a doll s tea party chocolate bread pudding is not much of an improvement the big clunky square of stuff looked like an oversize brownie this is the best dessert , says my friend , ordering sauteed strawberries really \? i ask , dubious she is right the cooked berries are drizzled with balsamic vinegar and served with cool ovals of vanilla ice cream it leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed it is a perfect way to end a meal i wish everything were this good , i say oh , says my friend , i'm glad you 're not wildly enthusiastic about spartina we do n't need uptown people coming down to ruin our favorite places this one is for us spartina  355 greenwich street , tribeca , \( 212 \) 2749310 atmosphere the brickwalled room of this neighborhood restaurant is comfortable , relaxed and casual service easygoing and pleasant recommended dishes grilled pizzas fried calamari penne with tomato sauce and ricotta salata roasted monkfish basquaise with garlic mashed potatoes and piperade brickroasted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes grilled pork tenderloin with pomegranate sauce and basmati rice cauliflower with bread crumbs and parmesan sauteed strawberries with vanilla ice cream wine list wide ranging and inexpensive , with many bottles below 25 hours lunch mondays to fridays , 11 30 am to 3 pm dinner mondays to fridays , 6 pm to midnight saturdays until midnight closed sundays prices lunch appetizers , 450 to 650 entrees , 950 to 1350 desserts , 5 to 6 dinner appetizers , 550 to 10 entrees , 1150 to 20 desserts , 5 to 6 credit cards mastercard , visa , american express wheelchair access there is a streetlevel ramp the dining room is on one level what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change
san francisco , nov 2 a jury in federal district court here may have finally ended the longrunning saga of janet malcolm and jeffrey m masson it ruled today that while two of five disputed quotations ms malcolm attributed to mr masson in a 1983 profile of the psychoanalyst in the new yorker magazine were false and one of those was defamatory , none were written with the recklessness required for libel the verdict , from a panel of seven women and one man , culminated and may well conclude nearly 10 years of litigation in which the case reached the united states supreme court once and juries twice , consumed a fortune in legal fees and triggered a debate over what constitutes quotations and the license reporters may take with them in 1993 , another jury concluded that ms malcolm had fabricated the five statements attributed to mr masson and that he had been libeled by two of them but it deadlocked on damages , with some seeking to award mr masson \( pronounced maysun \) 1 million and others deeming him so sullied by his braggadocio that he could not be further damaged that led judge eugene f lynch of federal district court here to order a second trial this time , after three days of deliberation , the jury found that only two of the quotations were falsified and only one was defamatory but it ruled that ms malcolm neither knew that the defamatory quotation was false nor acted with a reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity , the standard public figures like mr masson must meet to win libel judgments martin garbus , a libel lawyer in new york , praised the verdict and predicted that it would not be challenged setting aside a jury verdict as intelligent and balanced as this would be nearly impossible , he said this case will not be bleak house ii by finding ms malcolm had erred but clearing her of legal responsibility , mr garbus said , the jury sent a cautionary message to journalists everywhere what is common is taking large quotes , squishing them and moving them around , he said what is not common is being as loose as she was journalists now know that if you do this , you do it at some risk as the jury filed into judge lynch s courtroom this morning , the two principals , whose lives have been intertwined for the last dozen years , who exchanged tens of thousands of words during numerous interviews but not a single one during the past three and a half weeks , sat stoically on opposite sides of the aisle in contrast to the last verdict , when the room was crowded and the atmosphere electric , the room today was largely empty and the mood subdued a reflection , perhaps , of collective public exhaustion with a seemingly interminable case in three weeks it will be 10 years since the filing of mr masson s complaint , the same span of time it took freud to devise most of the basics of his theory of psychoanalysis when the court clerk enumerated the jury s findings and ms malcolm s legal victory became apparent , she began sobbing she then hugged her husband and editor at the new yorker , gardner botsford , and her lawyer , gary l bostwick of santa monica i guess i think it s over and i hope it s over , she said afterward , heaving a sigh of relief enough already afterward , jurors said ms malcolm had been careless in some instances , but no more than careless asked whether she had changed any of her techniques as a result of the case , ms malcolm who acknowledged cobbling together 50 or 60 separate conversations with mr masson into a single lunchtime monologue replied , absolutely not have n't there always been people who sued journalists \? she asked it s an occupational hazard mr masson s past volubility had given ms malcolm a mother lode of material and may have done him in with the jury one juror , cathy l mathias , said the verdict finally had a lot to do with him running his mouth off another , who asked to remain anonymous , said masson was too honest he opened himself up , and he just showed his true colors she painted him and he did n't like it but after today s decision was announced , mr masson was crestfallen and uncharacteristically laconic i'm deeply disappointed , as you can imagine , he said we really lost , no question about that it s very different from the last time , much worse as he stashed legal papers in his briefcase , mr masson declined to say whether he would need them for another appeal , but he hinted there would be none that he had moved on to other things , including a new book on the emotional life of animals but he said he would always be tarred as an intellectual gigolo a selfdescription that ms malcolm attributed to him and that the jury considered him erudite enough to have used , but one he still maintains he never employed at issue in the case was ms malcolm s 1983 portrayal of mr masson , who had recently been dismissed as projects director of the sigmund freud archives in london for criticizing freud s theory of child sexual abuse , and whether the quotes she attributed to him had been fabricated or merely rearranged and compressed

haddon heights , nj , sept 14 to the bishop of camden , his new policy to control and discipline teachers in the parochial schools reflects a need to enforce moral authority in morally tenuous times but to the roman catholic schoolteachers in south jersey , 85 percent of them lay people , who have gone on strike , the bishop s action is an attempt to reach beyond church and classroom and into their private lives if we agreed to this , he could make any policy he wants to fire people , said maureen simzak , an english teacher of 23 years at paul iv high school here we might as well throw away the rest of the contract then about 200 of the camden diocese s lay teachers struck the system s eight high schools on sunday after bishop james t mchugh insisted on adding language to a proposed threeyear contract granting him power to determine , solely and without appeal , when a teacher has overstepped catholic doctrine , public morality or other , unspecified , policies of the diocese as stated by the bishop in many respects , the strike is a reflection of the enormous change in catholic schools' teaching staffs in the last decade at the beginning of the 1980 s , 85 percent of the diocese s 260 highschool teachers were nuns , brothers or priests , and a strike against the mother church was unthinkable today 85 percent of the staff is lay people they belong to the south jersey catholic teacher s organization and they have been walking picket lines for three days now the number of catholic schoolteachers' unions in the country is small but growing the union members in the camden diocese are intent on restraining a bishop whom they feel is reaching beyond the realm of the sacred to the temporal intimacy of their private lives the camden diocese situation is sharpened by bishop mchugh s rising status as a moral spokesman in the american catholic church as a leading member of the committee for prolife activities of the national conference of catholic bishops , he enunciated the church s recent warnings against removing feeding tubes from terminally ill comatose patients earlier this month , as a vatican delegate to the cairo conference on population , bishop mchugh joined the vatican s criticism of the clinton presidency by saying that the administration s support for abortion rights gave a powerful incentive to american catholics to walk away from the democratic party almost every catholic school system has a clause in there that speaks to the rights and powers of the bishop , said william j blumenstein jr , president of the diocese s teachers' union mr blumenstein is a catholic who has taught for 23 years in catholic schools but none that i know of has this additional section which refers to rights of the bishop to state unspecified policies that would be binding on us , mr blumenstein said that could include preventing us from supporting certain political candidates , or banning noncatholics from teaching in the schools david coghlan , the diocese s school superintendent , disagreed , saying the bishop did not want to limit his faculty s personal freedom i regret the rhetoric that is flying around that we want to fire teachers who are n't catholic , or fire teachers who spit on the sidewalk , dr coghlan said that s absurd , and so is the implication that catholic teachers are immoral this language is a strong statement of who we are in catholic schools , who we are and what our values are , the superintendent went on we are living in a time of moral confusion , and we need to know what we stand for , and to say it proudly there is certainly a movement among catholic schools to reaffirm our moral identity none of this can be resolved until thursday at earliest , when bishop mchugh is scheduled to return from the united nations population conference in cairo he is scheduled to meet with teachers on thursday afternoon paradoxically , in challenging her bishop s authority , teachers like mrs simzak acknowledge that they are resisting an aspect of catholic education that they most admire and cherish its moral clarity and discipline , the freedom it offers to teach sharply delineated values , in contrast to the moral leveling many remember from teaching in public schools above all , they say , teachers who work under the authority of a bishop are insulated from the petty school board politics and favoritism several found in public schools freedom , mrs simzak said when she was asked why she had spent 23 years earning only twothirds as much as her friends in public education we have much more freedom to teach here if anything , camden s parochial high schools are already more conservative than most in new jersey many of the state s parochial high schools have dropped the traditional uniform in favor of a dress code that stresses neatness and modesty , but not in camden here , even chinos for boys were banned in favor of wool slacks a few years ago when the lowslung grunge look began to appear , and boys still must wear jackets and ties for girls , the uniform is unchanged over the years , consisting of skirts and blouses with a monogrammed school sweater in winter , a sartorial requirement some girls consider sexist , mrs simzak cheerfully admitted they 're free to choose their own shoes and earrings , said kevin gallagher , a lay teacher and ribbons all eight high schools have remained open during the strike but on limited schedules classes are taught by members of religious orders and a few dozen nonstriking union members there are 157 , 000 teachers in the country s 8 , 345 catholic elementary and high schools , and all are governed by policy language known as the bishop s or cardinal s clause , which generally includes a statement prohibiting teachers from contradicting church law and doctrine in the classroom , and from immoral public behavior or behavior contrary to church law in their private lives for example , catholic teachers here who divorce and remarry without obtaining an annulment are expected to resign or face dismissal , teachers said as in other dioceses , the camden diocese s bishop s clause distinguishes between violations of church law and nonchurch issues , such as failure to meet teaching standards while the head of the diocese has undisputed authority to rule singlehandedly on religious issues , including in deciding to fire a teacher who teaches contrary to teach church doctrine , teachers are afforded appeals , mediation and outside arbitration when brought up on nonreligious issues the striking teachers maintain that bishop mchugh , by adding the following language to the union contract , wants to enlarge his authority over nonchurchrelated issues in those matters which , in the sole and absolute discretion of the bishop of the diocese , concern serious and or public immorality , and or public rejection of official doctrine and or teachings of the church and or the policies of the diocese of camden as stated by the bishop , the bishop of the diocese shall be the ultimate judge whose decision shall be final and binding on all concerned it was the phrase or the policies of the diocese of camden as stated by the bishop that the strikers view as ominously vague the bishop , in an attempt to quell these concerns , circulated a letter stressing that any new policies would be consistent with church statutes , but the teachers are not mollified photos the move by the camden diocese to tighten its grip over its teachers has resulted in a strike that is a reflection of the changes in catholic schools today , 85 percent are lay teachers a decade ago , most were nuns , brothers or priests some of the strikers picketed yesterday in haddon heights , nj \( pg b1 \) william j

scottsdale , ariz for terry steinbach , it was disappointing ron darling used the word embarrassing dennis eckersley said it was miserable for tony la russa , it was upsetting brent gates was shocked yeah , i was shocked , said gates , the oakland athletics' rookie second baseman last year , because all you hear about the oakland a s is the tradition and the success of the organization gates probably figured it was a cruel hoax the athletics played on him a month into only his third season in professional baseball , he is promoted to the major leagues as an everyday player , but instead of being a part of another division champion , he never sees a position in the standing higher than sixth place and finishes with his equally stunned teammates in seventh after winning the american league west four of the previous five seasons , the athletics plummeted into last place , ending the season 26 games from the top with a 6894 record the a s had not finished last since 1979 , a season that was the last of a threeyear plunge from the top as a result of the freeagency breakup of another dominant oakland team for years , you 're staying on top or you 're in contention and all of a sudden you go right out of it , steinbach said last place stays with you you never enjoy losing , eckersley added , but with all the success we 've had , it s that much worse there s a lot of pride in this organization , starting with tony it made it tough on tony he said your stats are your stats , but last place stays with me forever darling , too , mentioned the manager you just do n't picture tony la russa managing a lastplace team , he said the athletics encountered injuries , and they were beset with poor pitching and poor defense , but la russa blamed none of the players for the team s collapse i blame myself more than anybody , he said the manager sets the course in spring training i believe in the value of a good spring training we tried to have a good spring training , but it was obvious to me the club was n't properly prepared the blame goes to the guy who sets up the camp and that was me la russa said he misread his team he explained that a manager has a long list of things to cover in spring training , too long to cover each item thoroughly picking the priorities you can try to work on it all , he said , but you wind up with a club that has an idea about everything but is prepared in nothing you have to pick your priorities and touch on the other things if you pick the wrong priorities , you set your club back you get your choice of what you emphasize if you choose wrong , it can hurt you la russa believed his team was better defensively than it turned out to be its errant play undermined the pitching effort and helped put the athletics in last when the season was less than a month old our defense dropped below the standards we set here , and part of that was the way camp was run , la russa said people say you did n't have mark mcgwire well , if the white sox did n't have frank thomas , they would n't win , but they would n't finish seventh in his first 25 games , mcgwire had 28 hits , including 9 home runs , and drove in 24 runs the way offensive production soared over all last season , he could have had a monstrous performance , but an injured left heel ended his season may 14 , except for two pinchhitting appearances , and required surgery in september even before the 1993 season began , the athletics lost third baseman carney lansford to retirement he was the keith hernandez of this team , darling said , calling on his days with the mets for an analogy he made the great defensive play when you needed it , and he got the big hit when you needed it pitching goes south and there was the lost effectiveness of the pitching staff as destructive an offensive team as the athletics were in their championship seasons , the key to their success was their pitching last season the staff s 490 earned run average was the worst in the league and its 680 walks were the most la russa became so desperate he briefly abandoned his starting rotation and used three pitchers per game for a varying number of innings it s like we had the white flag up , eckersley said even eckersley was affected he squandered 10 of 46 save opportunities , and he had a relief careerhigh 416 era i started off bad , he said i was struggling and i could n't turn the corner i could n't make adjustments fast enough i threw the ball over the plate too much lefthanded hitters killed me but the athletics have put that aberrational year out of their minds they hope they even look for bright spots shining through the disaster if they were winning the division , the young guys might not have had the chance , said gates , who batted 290 now our experience could help and even though la russa has managed in the majors for 15 years , he gained experience last year , too i'm trying to read what we need this spring and give it to them , he said the athletics' intention is clear we got abused last year , darling said , and we want to give it back escape from cleveland
as james galway sees it , his popular image is not quite accurate he does not deny that he helped create it or that he is , to a degree , what he seems to be a jolly bearded irishman whose countless crossover disks and compilations of spiffy transcriptions as well as his lively stage manner and golden , rounded tone have helped him displace jeanpierre rampal as the world s most popular flutist but having made his name , the 54yearold mr galway would now like more attention paid to his serious side on wednesday evening at carnegie hall , he will join leonard slatkin and the st louis symphony in the new york premiere of william bolcom s lyric concerto , a work he commissioned and has played in st louis and on tour in europe this is by no means his first foray into contemporary music last season , he toured with new works by robert beaser , lowell liebermann , paul dunkel , dave heath and gary schocker in fact , well before his american debut tour in 1978 , when he was promoting baubles like annie s song \( his arrangement of the john denver tune , which topped the charts in europe \) , the man with the golden flute and his transcription of vivaldi s four seasons , mr galway had already commissioned works from a handful of european composers , and he has used the proceeds from his lucrative crossover sales to commission more among the contributors to his arsenal thea musgrave , lennox berkeley , john corigliano and joaquin rodrigo it s funny being in my business , mr galway reflected recently over a pot of tea everybody thinks i go around playing pop music all the time in fact , i do n't this year i played one pop concert , which was a special request to help raise money for a concert series in miami i like to help make these organizations successful , because i think they 're important for their communities to have a cultural base where kids can plug in and learn something and i 'll go on tv and talk rubbish ad infinitum , or make irish stew , if that s what it takes to get people on your side but normally i just play straightforward classical music all the time and i do a tremendous amount of new music you see , there are a lot of golddiggers in the world who want to make a fortune on my name , because they know that if i turn up and play a concert , it 'll be full , he continued so then they have to pay the price , and the price is i also play a modern flute concerto i do n't care if they get me to play 'clair de lune' or whatever else , so long as i get to do a concerto by one of my friends because it s up to guys like me to help these composers mr slatkin , who has collaborated with mr galway in several recent works , compared him to mstislav rostropovich , who in the 50 s and 60 s commissioned works from shostakovich , prokofiev and britten that have become centerpieces of the cello repertory he s emerged as someone who s willing to go out there with something new , mr slatkin said but he s very smart about it he s dealing with composers who communicate immediately with the audience he also knows his own entertainment value when he walks out and takes his bow , it s not like everyone else he does it in a lighthearted way but when the flute goes up to his mouth , it s all serious business composers offer similarly respectful assessments i was a bit intimidated at the idea of working with him , because he s so wellknown , and one expects people on that level to be difficult , said mr liebermann , who wrote a concerto for mr galway in 1992 but i have to say , he was the easiest performer i 've ever worked with , in terms of understanding my intentions also , i was struck by the fact that he insisted that he not have a period of exclusivity normally , when someone commissions a piece , they want it to be theirs for a year but he wants the piece to be well known he s played it 15 or 20 times since the premiere , and he s been more active than anyone in sending the score around and trying to get other flutists to play it several of the works in mr galway s burgeoning portfolio were suggested by his public persona mr corigliano , for example , first rejected a request for a concerto but as he followed the charismatic flutist s progress during his early american tours , the composer hit on the image of mr galway as pied piper in 1982 , he finished the pied piper fantasy , an unusually theatrical concerto the orchestra mimics the sound of rats' claws on cobblestones , and mr galway , clad in a red and gold cape and playing both flute and pennywhistle , leads an army of young flutists around the perimeter of the hall mr bolcom also focused on mr galway s personality it would be crazy not to , he said what i 've written is not the 'missa solemnis' or the 'goldberg' variations , he added , noting that reviewers in europe treated the work unkindly when mr galway played it there in november it s a piece for a popular performer it s light and lyrical , and it s meant to be entertaining and fun for which i expect to be roasted alive

car purse of 32 million sentimentally , he was back home at a track he thought he would never get a chance to race at when he decided to spurn indy cars for stock cars a few years ago for now , gordon will have to skip the indianapolis 500 and its traditions including the singing of back home again which have been built up since 1911 but now he and his fellow stock car racers have a substitute to me , this is the indianapolis 500 of stock car racing , said gordon , who grew up a 15minute drive from here in pittsboro , ind this is the biggest event to date he was n't exaggerating the crowd of over 280 , 000 made this the biggest race in stock car racing history gordon , who won the longest event on the winston cup tour , the cocacola 600 at charlotte , nc , earlier this year , has a penchant for winning the big ones after winning the 600miler , held the same evening as the other race they run here at indy , gordon was so exhausted physically and emotionally , he needed oxygen he was steady after winning today , though i'm a kid in a candy store , he said he s not too far off on the kid part , either gordon , the youngest driver in the race , was up front most of the afternoon , leading 93 of the 160 laps he took the lead for good going into turn 1 on the 156th of 160 laps when irvan s thunderbird suffered the flat and went high in the turn irvan finished a lap down , in 17th place before that , irvan and gordon had seemed headed for a lastlap battle the two swapped the lead starting with 25 laps to go , running nose to tail through the corners , trying to upset the air passing over the lead car this would force whoever was in first gordon or irvan to momentarily lose control and give up the lead the last guy i wanted to race at the end was ernie , said gordon , referring to irvan s reputation as a hardnosed competitor it was a mind game going on , irvan said of the battle with gordon at those speeds , with a concrete wall awaiting any driver who gets too far out of control , irvan was paying a great compliment to gordon in racing so close to him i had a lot of confidence in jeff , irvan said more than sibling rivalry you might call it brotherly trust until you think about what went on between geoff and brett bodine brett bodine , the runnerup , finished just ahead of bill elliott and rusty wallace , also in thunderbirds , and dale earnhardt in a chevy earnhardt managed to bang his car off the thunderbird of polesitter rick mast as well as the wall in turn 4 and that was just the opening lap of the race as an encore , earnhardt kept control of the car and fought his way from 41st to 5th by the end mast , in a thunderbird , dropped back steadily from the start with handling problems that left gordon and geoff bodine to fight for the lead , and they spent most of the first half of the race doing so at the prerace drivers' meeting , gary nelson , the winston cup director , urged the 43 starters to drive cautiously , noting that their progeny would be reading about this first brickyard 400 someday and you do n't want your grandkids to point at your picture and say , 'my grandpa did something dumb at indianapolis , ' nelson said a bump and a spin one can only imagine what geoff and brett bodine s grandchildren will be saying about one another in a few years there were only four crashes , none involving serious physical injury but the one on lap 101 started by the bodine brothers was notable for bruised feelings geoff bodine , just behind his brother , brett , in second , tapped brett s rear bumper going into turn 3 that forced brett high , allowing his brother to take the lead but as they entered turn 4 , brett returned the favor , sending geoff spinning brett kept going , and it looked as if the tightly bunched field just behind them would avoid hitting geoff until dale jarrett could not the collision put both men out geoff bodine , at 45 , was the eldest of three bodine brothers in this race brett is 35 \( todd , the youngest at 30 , did not get involved in this feud , much to the relief of the other drivers in the race \) geoff bodine told radio and television interviewers that his brother s actions stemmed from a family dispute he s my brother , i still love him , bodine told the interviewers , but he spun me out brett bodine was not immediately available for comment he was still out on the track , racing in the top five meanwhile , geoff bodine was walking back to his garage , which was directly next to brett s fortunately , there was a wall between them in the physical sense as well i would never , ever do that , brett bodine said after the race when asked whether his brother s car became dysfunctional because their family was i got a lot of guys in the garage area i do n't like , but i do n't take it out there on the track we 're professionals does he have personal problems with his brother \? if it was a personal problem , brett bodine said , i would n't discuss it in public he said he would probably get together with his brother to talk it over i'm sure if we do n't get together , mom will do it , he said if geoff bodine was upset about anything before the race , it was the slow sales at his personalized souvenirmerchandise stand across west 16th street from the track s main gate the souvenir business has been bad outside because everyone s been in here watching practice , he said indeed , the spectacle of stock cars racing for the first time at this indycar shrine fascinated most everyone the accent of choice in gasoline alley was a southern drawl , with none of the british and brazilian inflections heard in may the crowd seemed less rowdy and more interested in the race itself than the revelers who gather for the indy 500 the indianapolis news made one addition to its souvenir edition for this race a set of earplugs , a welcome bonus considering the higher decibel output of stock cars next weekend , the bodine family may need them , too the next stop on the winston cup tour is in watkins glen , ny , not far from the bodine family home in chemung , ny next week s a big family reunion , brett bodine told a room full of reporters , who immediately burst out laughing you like that , huh \? he said todd bodine , brother no 3 , took a handsoff view of the dispute but he did issue this warning mom s the boss in the family i would n't want to be geoff and brett photos geoff bodine going to his garage after he was hit from behind by his brother brett , causing a crash that knocked him out of the race \( mary ann carter for the new

last summer , people worried about whether the dinosaurs in jurassic park were too frightening for children this summer , some may look at the lion king and wonder if the death of the father lion is too traumatic in the first case , the worry was that brilliant special effects would leave children frightened of animals they know do not really walk the earth in the second , that a welltold story would have children identifying with an animated lion cub and his grief and guilt over the loss of his father in the lion king , which opened on wednesday , mufasa , the king of beasts , is trampled in a wildebeest stampede as he saves his little cub , simba mufasa s evil brother , scar , who provoked the stampede to kill his brother and take over the lion kingdom , convinces simba that he killed his father the distraught cub leaves home , nearly dies and wanders the veldt until he grows up enough to return and challenge his usurping uncle many reviewers have specifically noted the potentially frightening aspects of the movie janet maslin , writing in the new york times , referred to mufasa s disturbing onscreen death and wondered if the film really warranted a g rating terrence rafferty , writing in the new yorker , said the film dredged up deepseated insecurities and terrors richard corliss , in time magazine , said , get ready to explain to the kids why a good father should die violently and why a child should have to witness the death and variety pointed to scenes of truly terrifying animalkingdom violence that should cause parents to think twice before bringing along the 'little mermaid' set hamlet with fur an animated movie with the potential to move its audience , adults and children , to make them wonder and worry and cheer and , yes , cry is n't that what stories are supposed to do , on the page , on the stage or on the screen \? if children s entertainment is purged of the powerful , we risk homogenization , predictability and boredom , and we deprive children of any real understanding of the cathartic and emotional potentials of narrative as marie antoinette once remarked , let them watch barney so this is a disney cartoon about animals in which a loving parent dies surely we 've had this discussion before , at some point in our collective cultural pageant in fact , the world is full of adults who think that the death of bambi s mother is too upsetting for small children too sad too scary there will be parents who feel that the lion king may be too upsetting for children , too a movie about lions is a little , well , redder in tooth and claw than a movie about a deer as timon the meerkat says and there is no way to convey how much exasperation nathan lane gets into his voice carnivores ! i myself tend to worry more about human villains , both in real life and at the movies by my standards , snow white is the much more upsetting movie there is nothing in the lion king that can compare to a wicked queen who wants to kill her stepdaughter for being too beautiful or to a huntsman ordered to kill the girl and cut her heart out and for that matter , are two lions fighting for control as scary as cruella de vil , who , in 101 dalmatians , wants to kill the puppies and make them into coats \? do we really want to protect our children from being saddened or scared or even upset by movies or by books \? do we want to eliminate surprise , reversal , tragedy , conflict and leave children with stories in which they can be smugly confident that the good will always be rewarded and the bad always punished \? children do n't have to sit through friday the 13th at a tender age , but neither do they need an unending diet of wholesomely bland entertainment a child who is worried , truly worried , about the outcome of a book is a child who is learning to understand what pulls someone into literature , and in fact it is a triumph that in an age of special effects and interactive videos , words on a page still have the power to move children similarly , in an age when cartoons and live action films are full of bang'emonthehead violence that has no true dramatic impact , this is a movie in which a noble character dies and is truly mourned and when we talk about children made sad by a movie , we are talking about children being moved by things that are not really happening to real people , and that is what art and drama and literature are all about those children are recognizing a character and feeling for that character , and that is a giant step toward empathy maria tatar , professor of german studies at harvard and the author of off with their heads ! fairy tales and the culture of childhood , points out that stories and folk tales have always offered children a way to consider and even control death and other difficult and forbidden topics kids can handle almost anything if they 're authorized to see it , talk about it , she says they 're much smarter than we give them credit for barry zuckerman , chairman of the department of pediatrics at boston city hospital and an expert on child development , agrees that these stories offer children an opportunity to master troubling issues it s not bad for children to be exposed to stressful things they can cope by having a parent available , so they can cuddle up to a parent who provides safety and security
jerusalem , nov 15 president thomas klestil of austria , going where none of his predecessors had ever been , went before the israeli parliament today to say that his country had often failed to face its past and that it produced many of the worst henchmen in the nazi dictatorship mr klestil s remarks fell short of an explicit austrian apology for the nazis' mass killing of jews , though israelis had been told they could expect an apology he told the lawmakers , i bow my head with deep respect and profound emotion in front of the victims no word of apology can ever expunge the agony of the holocaust , he said his visit to israel , the first by an austrian head of state , was made more poignant for israelis by the background of his immediate predecessor , kurt waldheim , the former united nations secretary general who long hid details of his service in hitler s army during world war ii during the waldheim presidency , from 1986 to 1992 , israel refused to send an ambassador to vienna , filling the post only after mr klestil took office in june 1992
paris in july it seems there are more tourists than parisians in paris , american tourists especially so it was appropriate that the san francisco ballet was booked as the final dance attraction at the premier dance forum in town , the grand and storied palais garnier opera house the san franciscans finished their engagement on july 10 , and on july 17 the palais garnier was closed for renovation and wo n't reopen until february 1996 on the surface this is a typically eclectic american company , with a diversity of style reflected in its two programs here still , george balanchine remains the father of classical dance in the united states , and the balanchine connection in san francisco is especially strong , with two longtime new york city ballet dancers as artistic directors lew christensen , who died in late 1984 , and helgi tomasson the san franciscans opened with balanchine s bugaku \( 1963 \) , and if the dancers seen on july 6 , katita waldo and david palmer , did not erase memories of the formal purity and sensual extravagance of edward villella and allegra kent , this was still a handsome testimonial to the staying power of balanchine s erotic blend of classical symmetry and ethnic kitsch for balanchine to close in beauty , the garnier s dance season , as le figaro put it , served to highlight the differences between french and american dance american dance , and ballet in particular , still seems wedded to formalism in ways the more overtly theatrical , expressionistic europeans have long abandoned and while the french developed an involvement in expressionism later than the northcentral europeans , they seem increasingly drawn to it new slant in paris of course a gallic form of classicism pretty , precise and newly confident still prevails at the paris opera ballet , which with its current generation of etoiles and its productive school is internationally admired but where paris has really made strides is in modern dance and as is increasingly common throughout the world , choreographers here are busily erasing distinctions between ballet and modern dance while rudolf nureyev deserved credit for revitalizing the opera ballet s repertory , patrick dupond , his successor as dance director , has extended nureyev s innovations this season has seen at least three distinctive programs at the garnier a nijinsky evening including a reconstruction of his last ballet , till eulenspiegel a fullfledged return to the company by roland petit with a program of three new ballets , and the young french choreographer angelin preljocaj s first fulllength ballet for the company , le parc the nijinsky evening offered two of the four ballets the great russian dancer choreographed for diaghilev , till eulenspiegel and le sacre du printemps , along with petrushka , the fokinediaghilev ballet in which nijinsky created the title role the petrushka and sacre were both revivals of recent paris recreations , the former the fokine original as transmitted through bronislava nijinska and restaged by serge golovine , with the original alexandre benois sets and costumes recreated the latter a paris restaging of the millicent hodgson and kenneth archer recreation first done for the joffrey ballet the till was another hodgsonarcher production , with miss hodgson doing her best to bring the only sketchily documented choreography to life and her husband , mr archer , recreating the robertedmond jones decor this was a ballet , set to the richard strauss tone poem , that had only been seen in the united states , where the diaghilev troupe was on tour in 1916 it made for an amiable 18 minutes , with mr dupond winning warm notices for his dancing of the title character but it would take a braver person than most of the critics on hand to judge how close it really came to nijinsky s intentions mr petit , whose relationship with the paris ballet establishment has long been testy , has been honored in paris this season , with an engagement by his marseilles company as well as the evening of petit creations at the garnier the opening passacaille , to music of webern , had a kind of zippy formalist charm but otherwise , mr petit s idiom looks dated these days , with its jazzdance flavorings and aspirations to existentialist angst \( a ballet called camera obscura based on nabokov and set to schoenberg \) mr preljocaj \( of albanian origin , his name is pronounced here as prelzhokazh \) is much talked about , but le parc was overshadowed by a messy squabble in which he resigned the directorship of the ballet du nord in lille before actually taking over , following strenuous protests from the dancers and local politicians residual tension between ballet traditionalists and moderndance innovators is not dead yet le parc was interesting in that it seemed two ballets in one , perhaps all by itself reflecting tensions within the french dance esthetic at the center was a sequence of pas de deux for two of the opera ballet s greatest stars , laurent hilaire and isabelle guerin these were ingenious , compelling and sexy but they were set in a park populated by , among others , four strangely attired gardeners who looked like the rock band devo and seemed to represent extraterrestrial forces or some such the duets were wonderful their theatrical context was pretentious and silly good eye for collaborators
altamirano , mexico , jan 4 the peasant guerrilla army that burst into mexican life with the new year retreated today from this town and others it had occupied in the southern state of chiapas as army troops moved in fighting continued around the city of san cristobal de las casas and the town of ocosingo as rebels from the force , which calls itself the zapatista army of national liberation , battled soldiers backed by planes and helicopter gunships military officials said at least 93 people had been killed since the rebels seized the state s secondlargest city and three sizable towns just hours after the north american free trade agreement went into effect but while the rebels' offensive appeared to be waning , it seemed clear that mexico has not seen the last of them although the guerrillas disappeared with few traces from this town , and from nearby ocosingo and most of the other hamlets they had held , many of them vowed that they would return to fight another day government forces moved aggressively to take control of the area , drawing accusations of human rights abuse for the apparent executions of at least five rebels in ocosigno and the strafing and rocketing of rebels near a populated neighborhood outside san cristobal far from exulting over driving the rebels back , the government seemed chastened by the rebels' exposure of a vulnerability in the development model that president carlos salinas de gortari has used in his efforts to lift mexico from the third world in partnership with its northern neighbors mr salinas and his aides moved to strike at what they clearly took to be the source of mexico s first leftist rebel movement since the mid1970 s officials promised food programs , farm credits and other aid to fight poverty in the region they also promised strict respect for human rights in the elaborate pronouncements of its leaders and the often halting , inarticulate explanations of the peasants who joined them , the zapatista army seemed to make one basic point that while the salinas government may have brought new wealth to the affluent and new hope to the middle class , it has made far less of a change in the lives of its poorest citizens even as he lay bloodied and hogtied in a gazebo in the central plaza of oxchuc , a town he had mistakenly entered two days after the brief rebel occupation there , one young guerrilla said defiantly today that the trade agreement represented a future much like chiapas s sorry past it is always the same , the man , jose perez mendez , said of the government we work and they take advantage of us an army of innocents and on monday , mr salinas stood before congressmen as though at a political confessional we know that needs and inequalities persist , he said we know that the benefits and opportunities are not yet tangible realities for many virtually all of several dozen rebels interviewed in the past few days said they had come from towns like altamirano and oxchuc and more dismal hamlets in the pine forests and jungles beyond compared with the hardened , disciplined traditions of the peasants who fought in central and south america over the last two decades , the innocence of many of the mexican insurgents would be hard to overstate on the edge of altamirano this afternoon , two young rebels appeared to have simply taken off their bandanas and uniforms , showered and settled in by the wooden shack of one of their families , waiting to fight another day i think the war can be won , said one , a 29yearold man who might have given his full name had reporters not been uneasy about taking it in general , the people do n't support us some are against us but people see the advance that our army has made he said he had joined the zapatista army two years earlier , but that he still only knew more or less how to handle a gun he said he trusted in god to help the rebels overcome the far more powerful mexican army he said he understood little of the trade pact the rebel leaders explain everything to us , he added , how a peasant works from sunrise to sunset and we are more exploited all the time just who those leaders are is a question that the mexican authorities still seem to be asking they have linked the zapatista leaders to two radical fringe groups the revolutionary workers' and peasants' party of popular unity and the party of the poor that emerged from guerrilla forces operating in mexico in the 1970 s tonight , however , eloy cantu , a senior official of the secretariat of government , mexico s interior ministry , said an important number of the rebel leaders were foreigners , particularly salvadorans and guatemalans it is clear , he said , that the leadership is in the hands of professionals of violence after speaking in san cristobal , mr cantu did not take any questions but he added that the apparent leader of the several hundred rebels who occupied the area on saturday and sunday , a man who called himself commander marcos , was blond , greeneyed , spoke four languages and would soon be identified in greater detail a selfdescribed captain in the rebel force said that some of the movement s leaders had participated in the mexican guerrilla groups of the 1970 s and the huge student movement that flowered in mexico city in 1968 another said that some priests and members of the catholic church had also helped the guerrillas , although church officials and other rebels denied this at least in oxchuc , the guerrillas also appeared to have gained some support from townspeople they said they were going to attack the rich and the government , and those people received them , said a town commissioner , ricardo gomez we do n't know what happened to them , but they have taken off out of here central american role is seen san salvador , jan 4 \( special to the new york times \) highranking officers from the armies of guatemala , honduras and el salvador said at a meeting here today that current or former guerrilla movements in central america may be helping rebels operating in southern mexico the guatemalan defense minister , gen mario rene enriquez , said his army thought it was likely that the rebels in mexico had received help from guatemalan guerrillas , but none of the officers here offered any evidence to support their suspicions a honduran officer who attended the meeting today said the weapons and training could be coming from the sandinista army in nicaragua or former guerrillas in el salvador , while others said they suspected former contras ,

in my youth , growing up in new york , we held the rather stuffy position that we were collectively a city of point guards we had eyes behind our head we could tell when trouble was coming around the corner we could watch out for pigeons and not trip over the curb , both at the very same time we were cool we believed we had produced every great point guard that ever lived , through procreation or example cousy and mcguire begat wilkens and archibald who would eventually begat smith and anderson and hurley from just across the river when those wonderful knicks teams of the late 60 s and early 70 s materialized , we felt our innate urbane slickness had contributed to the cause we were sharp they ran the backdoor play none of this explains the glories of the celtics and the lakers and the pistons and the bulls , bird and magic and isaiah and jordan i am just talking about civic stereotypes pride goeth before a fall , and now we come into the seventh and final game of a desperate series between the first and the second cities of this great land , and goodness gracious , the team from the city of broad shoulders plays a more creative brand of basketball than the team from the city that never sleeps this may not guarantee a victory for the bulls this afternoon at the bruce lee memorial kickboxing center on seventh avenue , but clearly the chicagoans will be on a psychic roll after their 9379 victory friday night the knicks will be in trouble today because the officials will be giving careful scrutiny to the assorted limbs the knicks throw around as part of their arsenal the knicks are not so good at moving without the ball or spotting a teammate cutting toward the basket , but they are quite good at bringing down an opponent with a kick or a shove it has worked for three years but time is running out after the ugly brawl in chicago in the third game , the officials began using those devices that hang on a cord around their necks the personalfoul total was 3017 friday night , visitors to hosts , and you could n't say it was biased , not after john starks went into his searchanddestroy mode i am not suggesting that pat riley coaches dirty , but i do say he goes with what he has got mark jackson is gone and doc rivers is hurt and derek harper begs the officials not to call handchecks and greg anthony is basically a 17minute guy we are not a city of point guards anymore the fans will surely cheer the knicks today because they represent new york , and what new yorker would want the basketball season to finally end so you have to go outdoors \? the knicks could still go all the way on sheer menace , but it wo n't be pretty the bulls , without michael jordan , now play an even more scintillating brand of ball some of us can remember that phil jackson spent a lot of time on the bench in the presence of one william holzman , who now goes to all the games as a loyal senior adviser to the knicks red is n't about to divulge whether he is proud of his angular disciple , but a touch of fondness crept into his voice the other night as he ruminated phil used to hurt our own guys in practice you 'd say , 'geez , they 're your own guys , ' but , aw , he did n't mean it that s just the way he played fine but now this former thrower of elbows has turned into a threetime championship coach who has done his best job this year on friday night , the current knicks looked like the old bulls when jerry sloan and norm van lier were human scud missiles , and the current bulls resembled the old knicks when clyde frazier and dollar bill bradley were performing the backdoor play there were moments on friday when the ball would go flipping and zipping \( as clyde would say on the radio \) around the court , bing , in to the pivot , bing , out to the corner , bing , out to the top of the key , bing , into the other corner , and somebody would nail an open jump shot b j armstrong is smooth bill cartwright knows patrick ewing and scottie pippen and toni kukoc are coexisting gloriously a new yorker could enjoy this team with my own two eyes , i spotted luc longley , who is an australian , of all things , commit a blind backward pass to scott williams for an easy layup when australian centers are making blind scoring passes against the knicks , you know we are truly living in a global village maybe new york never did hold a patent on slick , enjoyable basketball it surely does not anymore photo scottie pippen \( barton silverman \)
philadelphia david meggett had leveled a linebacker , but now it seemed that dave brown s pass was floating to him floating slowly too slowly the ball took so long , the giants' little big man was saying after yesterday s bizarre 1613 victory over the eagles i had a thousand things going through my mind such as do n't drop it whatever happens , do n't drop it he did n't all alone out near the left sideline after getting up from having flattened blitzing linebacker william thomas , he caught the pass , turned upfield and hurried to the eagles' 9yard line to position brad daluiso s decisive 18yard field goal with 54 seconds remaining more than any other play , david meggett s maneuver kept the giants breathing in their struggle to qualify for the super bowl xxix playoffs their slim chance is this simple they must upset the cowboys on saturday at giants stadium , while the packers lose at tampa bay whatever happens , meggett s extra effort defined not only him , but also this growing giant team at 5 feet 7 inches , he s short , but at 195 pounds he s not small and at least 100 of those pounds must be in his heart in a thirdand15 at the eagle 42 , he not only chopped down a 218pound , 62 linebacker , he then hustled out to catch a pass and create a 34yard gain that set up the winning field goal the play also symbolized a season just as meggett blocked , got up and caught a pass , the giants had a 30 start , toppled during an 07 slump , then caught a 50 streak in a blitz situation , i'm responsible for the outside guy , he said , meaning the linebacker i picked him up , then i drifted off had he ever done it before \? absolutely my first time , he said i never cut a guy and then caught the ball it s just a presence of mind type of thing it s just being a football player but not many football players have done it not many could do it not many would do it and not many teams have done what the giants have done , generate a fivegame winning streak for an 87 record and a playoff scenario with a virtual rookie quarterback whose growth was also defined by his pass to meggett he was my fourth receiver on that play , the 24yearold dave brown said i do n't know if i would 've seen him early in the season i think i'm a lot calmer now coach dan reeves had called that play , which the giants regularly practice , because of the thirdand15 situation he was hoping that when brown scrambled to the right , as planned , one of the other pass receivers would be open for a gain that would shorten daluiso s fieldgoal attempt i really wanted to hit the two outlet receivers , brown said the play was designed for chris calloway to be the primary receiver , arthur marshall the second receiver and mike sherrard the third receiver then i saw david clapping and waving his hands , brown said i tell guys to clap their hands for some reason you can hear them clapping moments later , all the giants were clapping brown , who completed 18 of 27 passes for 264 yards , had been intercepted in the first quarter but when brown got to the sideline , meggett was the first to soothe him and late in the second quarter , meggett had fumbled at the eagle 24 coincidentally , greg jackson , the former giant safety , had forced meggett s fumble but on meggett s 5yard touchdown that created a 1313 tie , he actually rolled over his former teammate , who was sprawled across the goal line , into the end zone i was never down , meggett said , until i got in the end zone meggett talked about how he often sees jackson in a hackensack , nj , barber shop where each player gets his hair cut he drives up , meggett said what s the name of the barber shop \? i'm not going to give that barber shop no publicity , he said they do n't give me no free haircut they will now , it was suggested no , they 're too stingy , he said for the eagles , the game and their playoff hopes ended when eddie murray missed a 44yard field goal as time expired after referee gordon mccarter had put the final two seconds back on the clock had the eagles' placekicker forced overtime and the eagles won , the giants would still be boiling over linebacker jessie armstead running off with the football with two seconds to go , giving the eagles a final chance when murray s kick was wide , all that commotion was soon forgotten and the giants were smiling but none of the giants were smiling wider than david meggett , the little big man who leveled a linebacker and turned a pass into a 33yard gain that positioned the winning field goal in a game the giants had to win in order to measure how much they have grown this season it s just being a football player , he shrugged but not all football players are football players
here is a critical look at a sampling of new york city s parks , from the vast and famous lawns of central and prospect parks to a small and struggling playground in a hard patch of bedfordstuyvesant manhattan central park the jewel in the crown this 840acre park , of almost transcendental importance to new yorkers , is often described as the first example of a deliberately planned urban park in america today , it is like an engine gathering steam , a model for the publicprivate partnership many hope will save the city s parks lord chatham s famous declaration that parks are the lungs of london , might have been written for central park , a swath of green where some 15 million people come to breathe each year they come as individuals to sit on grass and benches , or to be part of any number of events , from the new york marathon to shakespeare in the park it was just two decades ago , as new york lay mired in a fiscal straitjacket , that central park appeared to be dying erosion was gnawing away at the park s increasingly brown skin , and floods were commonplace garbage was picked up , but all other maintenance had virtually stopped even the 36 famed stone arches and bridges none identical were falling apart in truth , while the overall parks department work force was cut 23 percent during the fiscal crisis , compared with an average of 13 percent in other city agencies , the deterioration of central park was not as serious as at other , less famous parks still , central park was central park , and in 1979 , mayor edward i koch named the park s most vocal advocate , elizabeth barlow rogers , the first administrator of a city park there was no salary and no budget mr koch explained , you know something about fund raising as it turned out , people were chomping at the bit to save the park in its first 10 years , the conservancy raised more than 50 million , a pace that seems downright laggardly compared with its success so far in the 1990 s to whit , richard gilder , a conservancy trustee , offered the group a 17 million gift , on the condition it raise 17 million from other donors , and that the city contribute 17 million the city has said yes this is not to say everything is perfect , although ms rogers beams with pleasure about the renovation of the longneglected northern end of the park , harlem meer cedar hill , where dogs run , needs to be redone ball fields are badly compacted , and need major drainage repairs meadows need to be replanted paths need repair but the fact is that central park has been able to weather a cut in its maintenance staff to 91 from 138 what we 've built here is a system that will insure there s a future for the park , ms rogers said riverside park progress , bit by bit henry hudson described this riverside ribbon of green as very pleasant , very high and bold well , you ca n't change that but in recent years , the park has grown dirtier , a bit more menacing homeless people make homes in bushes , and two weeks ago , a woman was attacked in the park and defended herself with an ice pick there has also been an insidious dialectic at work when robert moses redid the park in the 1930 s , he spent far less money on the northern part than on the south despite several current capital projects to perk up the north , this perception and some of the reality persists but even as the park s workforce has fallen from 54 to 24 over the last five years , new procedures have helped to lessen the sting one reform was to cut back shrubs in which people could live , an action that has saved three staff hours a day in the middle section of the park other changes have included asking the various city council members representing sections adjoining the park to allocate money from their portion of the city s capital budget for specific projects other money comes from the riverside park fund and in dribs and drabs from the city people also pay for their own projects for example , except for one summer attendant , the tennis courts at 95th street are now totally maintained and operated by the riverside clay tennis association the 91st street playground is similar parents raised 120 , 000 and councilwoman ronnie eldridge threw in 70 , 000 that was enough to hire a landscape architect and begin the job the first step was to enlarge the pits around the dying pin oaks then , the inner part of the playground whimsical hippopotamus statues that spray water was installed other phases will be done as more money is raised the other day , diane englander , a business consultant who lives at 90th street and riverside drive , was at the playground with her son it s getting nicer , she said of the park she loves there are more flowers , more trees , more improvements to the playground high bridge park a perennial problem high on the cliffs overlooking the harlem river and the bronx , high bridge park has long been an example of the trials of maintaining a park that is tremendously important to its neighborhood but a long way , physically and economically , from city hall in the mid80 s , mr stern had ordered a huge cleanup of the park dozens of abandoned cars , hundreds of tires , refrigerators , several dead dogs and a human body were found amid the tangled brush
arlington , tex , june 8 who would yankee fans want to bat with the bases loaded , no outs and a tworun deficit in the ninth inning \? paul o'neill \? don mattingly \? wade boggs \? all three were available tonight , but the rangers employed lefthanded reliever darren oliver so the yankees stayed with gerald williams and bob melvin as their last batters and lost , 65 after another ninthinning new york rally fizzled and texas snatched another onerun victory , there was considerable blame to be shared throughout the yankee clubhouse for a team that is still in first in the american league east , the yankees did not look or sound like it tonight melido perez blamed poor location and an ailing back for failing to protect a 40 lead willie randolph refused to blame anyone or anything and he declined to discuss why he held mike stanley at third base after melvin s single in the seventh inning when stanley was the potential tying run melvin made a rare start at first base and blamed shoddy footwork for not stretching and staying on the base for what might have been an important double play , but what instead helped fuel a threerun rally in the sixth the list of villains continued donn pall could only blame himself after he tossed four straight balls to walk pinchhitter juan gonzalez and force in the decisive run in the eighth manager buck showalter blamed too many walks and erratic defense for new york s eighth setback in 10 games , not the difficult selections he made in the ninth at the ballpark in arlington i could have pulled the trigger anytime , said showalter , when asked whether it was frustrating to have three batters who are each hitting over 307 in the dugout watching we had 12 hits and 5 or 6 walks that s enough to win a ball game our pitching and defense did n't get it done showalter , who was agitated as he answered questions about the ninth , knew he played the percentages properly by keeping the righthanded hitting williams and melvin in against oliver , a rookie with a 540 earned run average still , it could spawn a juicy debate should the yankees have used two reserves who now have a combined 54 atbats or chosen from among a fivetime batting champion , a onetime batting champion and a 431 hitter \? showalter chose the scrubs and texas manager kevin kennedy was ecstatic we just have to have faith in those people there , showalter said it did n't work out tonight after lefthander rick honeycutt hit jim leyritz in the left knee with an 02 pitch and walked danny tartabull and stanley to load the bases with none out , oliver was summoned into the 64 game williams swung at oliver s first pitch and smacked into a double play that scored pinchrunner daryl boston , trimmed the deficit to one and left the onus on melvin melvin strolled to the plate against oliver as none of the threesome budged showalter rested o'neill , boggs , mattingly and luis polonia against bruce hurst because the yankees play their next four games against righties and on the skydome artificial turf in his 12th atbat as a yankee , melvin popped out to first to strand polonia , a pinchrunner , at third base oliver notched his first major league save and dan smith won his first major league game as the rangers reached 500 for the first time this season you got to want to be up there in that situation , and i did , melvin said i know we have three batting champs sitting over there , but you ca n't think about that the yankees had two more homers to give them nine in the threegame series against the rangers , but they were humbled as the usual assortment of wacky plays in arlington throttled them three games into an 11game road trip that also takes them to toronto and baltimore , the yankees had a night and a ninth to forget that , said stanley , is part of being in a little funk inside pitch xavier hernandez may have lost his role as a lateinning reliever , but he has not lost his bravado on tuesday night , he hit juan gonzalez with a pitch in the lower back after will clark s tworun homer gonzalez did not start wednesday night
candidate gov mario m cuomo producer the garth group , new york visual the 30second advertisement begins with footage from one of state senator george e pataki s early commercials showing mr pataki , the republican candidate , walking toward the camera his image freezes , and the word untrue is superimposed across it in bold red letters below that is a new york times headline that reads , pataki s grim statistics collide with the facts the ad cuts to a shot of mr pataki being interviewed on television it ends with the words , george pataki politics as usual , stripped in white letters across the screen script announcer george pataki he s running commercials attacking mario cuomo using statements he claims are factual george pataki \( quoted from his own commercial \) it s a fact announcer but the new york times says pataki s statistics often collide with the facts and in this commercial , none of pataki s claims were true why say something that just is n't true \? mr pataki \( quoted from a june 6 interview with new york 1 news \) in the course of campaigns , people want to win and they say things about their opponents that they may or may not believe announcer what was that , george \? mr pataki that they may or may not believe announcer ok george pataki politics as usual analysis the commercial marks the third time in two weeks that the cuomo campaign has sought to use mr pataki s own statements to question his integrity in this case , the cuomo camp focuses on a pataki commercial contending that new york state is no 1 in taxes , wasteful spending and job losses none of which are true , according to federal labor and census statistics the cuomo ad then quotes from a television interview in which mr pataki seems to suggest that distorting facts is a valid campaign weapon the effect is apparently a double play mr pataki uses incorrect information , then is heard rationalizing it the ad s subliminal question seems to be , who could possibly trust such a man \? the cuomo camp accurately depicts mr pataki s commercial as factually wrong the times article shown in the ad pointed out that new york does not actually rank first in any of the categories cited but the truth is not much rosier for mr cuomo , since new york still ranked high among states in combined state and local taxes , jobs losses during the recession and government spending furthermore , the ad portrays mr pataki s comment that candidates say things they may or may not believe as a statement of personal ideology but in fact , it was offered as a defense of herbert london , who ran an acrimonious campaign against mr pataki for the republican gubernatorial endorsement he lost and then joined mr pataki s ticket as the candidate for state comptroller james dao
photocopier companies have been getting lots of bad publicity lately , both here and abroad in england , a scandal has been simmering for four years , and it s not unusual to pick up a british newspaper and see headlines about copy cheats ! leasing sharks ! dodgy dealers ! a recent investigation by the british office of fair trading found numerous excesses and malpractices , warning that schools , social groups and small firms have often made onerous deals as a result of hardselling , commissionpaid salesmen using contracts with misleading terms in texas last december , the xerox corporation agreed to a 225 million settlement of a classaction suit that asserted that the price of its copy machines was inflated by monopolistic practices , like refusing to give independent repairmen access to xerox replacement parts for copiers a similar suit has been filed against the eastman kodak company in california and last month , came the force by david dorsey \( random house \) , a nonfiction portrait of the harddriving sales team in xerox s cleveland office like the realestate salesmen in glengarry glen ross and the aluminiumsiding salesmen in tin men , the copy machine sellers are portrayed as men and women who will do almost anything for a commission their dream in the force sell enough big machines to make the xerox president s club and win a trip to palm springs , calif and therein lies a cautionary tale for schools in this era of tight budgets buyer beware when the copier salesman comes knocking dr gena cone had been principal of p s 40 on east 19th street in manhattan for five years , then took a leave in 1989 to finish her doctorate at harvard in the spring of 1990 , beatrice ramirezepstein was the acting principal of p s 40 when a top xerox salesman , michael brancale , a veteran president s cluber , came knocking at the time , p s 40 had 550 students and leased one xerox machine , a model 1040 with a capacity of about 40 , 000 copies a month the acting principal decided to add two , a model 1050 \( capable of 65 , 000 copies a month \) and a topoftheline 1075 \( 200 , 000 copies \) suddenly p s 40 had enough capacity to serve five schools \( for example , dallas officials advise their principals that for 500 students , they need about 60 , 000 copies per month \) p s 40 s basic monthly xerox bill soared from 137 a month to 1 , 116 with supplies and volume fees added , the monthly total at times reached 1 , 800 did a sharp salesman sell p s 40 more than it needed \? charles alexander , a xerox counsel , says mr brancale was just doing his job and the decision was p s 40 s ms ramirezepstein did not return calls , but in a letter two years ago , she defended leasing the machines because of a new program that was planned for the school , a professional developmental lab that would have made p s 40 a mentoring center for teachers but the program was never put in the place , and even if it had been , the principal on leave , dr cone , said she would never have ordered the big copier absolutely not , she said recently we did n't need a copier that size it was a gigantic thing it took up a whole room ! the two new machines arrived in june 1990 , but the big one could n't be hooked up because a special electrical outlet was required normally xerox does n't bill until a copier is operating , but as ms ramirezepstein explained in her letter , she requested that p s 40 be charged immediately because school money had to be committed by the end of the fiscal year , june 30 the big copier was not hooked up until december , despite repeated requests from the school to the board of education for an electrician for those six months p s 40 paid 770 a month to xerox for an unplugged machine during the next nine months , from january 1991 , until the start of the new school year , often two of the copiers and a few times all three broke down and were n't repaired because p s 40 fell behind in its monthly bills , said parents and dr cone at one point the parents association bailed out the school with a check to xerox for 2 , 308 to pay for three months on the big copier s lease sam bishop , a member of the parents' board at the time , says , teachers were sending home things to be copied by parents at their offices because none of the school machines were working when dr cone returned from harvard in august 1991 , she says she found piles of unpaid xerox bills and two machines that did n't work i quickly came to the realization no way i could afford all those machines , she said at first dr cone says she had trouble getting xerox to respond i dealt with one person , then another person , she said by then the salesman who had made the deal had shifted territories i reached the point of exasperation and decided there was just one thing to do get that big machine out , she said parents recall her kicking a xerox salesman out of the school , though she says she ca n't remember for sure now i was very upset , she said dr cone says that once she insisted on dealing with a xerox manager rather than a salesman , everything went a little smoother school district 2 gave p s 40 extra money to pay off the overdue bills xerox agreed to let p s 40 out of the last three years of the lease and took back two of the three copiers , including the big one xerox did not reimburse the school for the times the two machines were broken down or the six months the big machine was unplugged oh , no , said mr alexander , the xerox counsel if you lease a new car and decide to park it in your driveway for six months , that s your decision the bottom line taxpayers paid for two machines that everyone now agrees p s 40 did n't need at a cost of more than 1 , 000 per month for 16 months after a parent complained , in october 1991 the board of education s office of special investigations began an inquiry into the p s 40 case its findings were completed last fall it found absolutely no one to be at fault , concluding , xerox had not intended to defraud the school and the matter was addressed adequately by school officials ms ramirezepstein is now the principal of p s 40 dr cone , who has since left the new york city schools , says there s a lesson in the p s 40 case i ca n't tell you if xerox used highpressured tactics i was n't there , she said my guess is all companies do that i'm a firm believer 'you 're the buyer you must be aware of what you 're doing' xerox is a business they 're out to sell copiers they 're not looking out for the health and wellbeing of the buyer indeed , dallas school officials came to the same realization recently in 1990 xerox won a bid for the exclusive copier contract for the dallas schools however , principals subsequently felt that the xerox prices were too high so last week dallas changed its system to allow its schools to choose from many companies this time we got excellent prices from several companies , said emily hester , dallas s director of technology including xerox
declining to put his money where his mouth was , howard stern abandoned his campaign for governor of new york yesterday , refusing to accept the financial disclosure required of candidates and leaving the libertarian party , which has supported him , in the lurch this is what talk radio s top bad boy told his listeners yesterday morning while i 've told you everything about myself , and i 've been telling you about myself since the first day i started broadcasting , there s only one fact i never revealed i never told you how much money i made , i never told you how much money i have in the bank and the reason i never told you how much money i have in the bank is because it s none of your business on tuesday , justice harold j hughes of the state supreme court in albany denied mr stern s request to block the state from enforcing its disclosure requirements , adding in skeptical legalese plaintiff alleges that he is a celebrity radio talk show host according to mr stern , this guy , this judge , caused his withdrawal but he faced other obstacles , including eventually having to go off the air in new york media markets for the campaign since the libertarians chose mr stern at their state convention this spring , they said , he has neither returned their phone calls nor given the party any help collecting the 15 , 000 petition signatures needed to get him on the ballot party leaders unhappy yesterday , party leaders were bitter the state chairman , ludwig vogel , said mr stern should not have challenged the disclosure requirements , but simply delayed complying with them and paid any necessary fines , then withdrawn from the race , if he wished , after being certified for the ballot on oct 3 at that point , only death or nomination for a judgeship could remove mr stern s name from the november ballot , and the libertarians hoped he might get 50 , 000 votes even as a noncandidate enough to give the party a permanent ballot slot , which was the party s main goal all along mr vogel said the party would continue collecting petitions with mr stern s name on them , in the hope of meeting the aug 23 filing deadline , after which the party committee on vacancies could pick a successor perhaps james ostrowski , a buffalo lawyer who had been the original favorite but for that to happen , mr stern will have to file a written declination of candidacy , something he has not yet done most politicians believed that mr stern drew support from the republican nominee , george e pataki , thus helping gov mario m cuomo joel benenson , a spokesman for governor cuomo s campaign , would only say yesterday the campaign wo n't be the same without howard photo howard stern \( associated press \)
africa was given unaccustomed attention last week as the clinton administration held a twoday conference on the economic and political afflictions in 30 countries south of the sahara but what the conference unintentionally highlighted was the low priority mr clinton has given to a region whose enormous promise is blighted by declining economies and soaring fertility rates the cold war s demise , however welcome elsewhere , has proved a setback for black africa superpower rivalry once gave crucial influence to poor lands with prized real estate for military bases , or a grip on maritime choke points , or large reserves of strategic minerals but with the sovietamerican competition now over , the cia is closing 15 african stations actual us development aid to subsaharan africa has tapered to around 800 billion this year , as the industrialized world pumps an increasing share of multilateral development funds into the former communist countries as the times s john darnton detailed in a recent series , africa s leverage has markedly weakened during a grim decade when its gross national product declined 2 percent a year a single figure underscores the disastrous state of the region s economy excluding south africa , the total output in 1991 of all countries below the sahara , with a combined population of nearly 600 million , was roughly the same as the gross national product of belgium , home of 10 million people and as output plunged , the region s foreign debt tripled , to 180 billion its population will double in 25 years , further straining resources , if the present fertility rates continue none of this justifies passivity or despair subsaharan africa boasts far more arable land and mineral riches than other poor regions and in an unforeseen windfall , south africa , the region s industrial powerhouse , has ceased to be an economic and political pariah after a peaceful democratic revolution brimming with promise south africa s salutary transformation is the region s most stirring event since the postcolonial surge to independence 30 years ago not only has apartheid been revoked , but president nelson mandela has shown how to turn bitter adversaries into political allies , providing a model for african states polarized by ethnic and political rivalries and if pretoria really opens its own frontiers to freer trade , it could jumpstart stalled economies elsewhere given a spell of peace and trade across open frontiers , plus the stimulus of a dozen new stock markets , subsaharan africa s economy could grow by 39 percent a year in the coming decade , according to forecasts by the world bank but africa is not a machine that can accelerate by itself it needs the help of a world that has been too quick to take profits out of africa and too slow to extend a helping hand africa s immediate needs include debt forgiveness or at least a generous rescheduling of loans it cannot possibly repay seed money for smallscale development rather than bigticket prestige projects coveted by dictators , and aggressive diplomacy to help end wars and promote democratic reforms the clinton administration justifies the relative penury of its african development programs by pointing to competing needs maybe so but that excuse cannot explain the absence of a single highprofile appointee to serve as an advocate and goad to conscience africa has fallen into the lap of anonymous bureaucrats and stagers of conferences it deserves far better
a growing number of private employers around the country are refusing to hire smokers as a quickandeasy way to hold down health care costs but just as swiftly , state legislatures are coming to the smokers' defense , passing laws that prohibit hiring practices that discriminate against them while a hiring ban is a relatively new tactic less than 10 years old in the war against smoking , thousands of companies in the united states have forbidden their employees to smoke , even off the job companies say that not hiring smokers not only saves money but also improves safety conditions , cuts down on absenteeism and minimizes the need to train new employees to replace those who retire early because of lung cancer , emphysema and other diseases related to smoking when a lockheed plant in marietta , ga , announced this month that it would no longer hire people who smoke cigarettes , company executives said that nearly 77 percent of the plant workers with cardiac problems were smokers they also cited a study by the american lung association that showed an employee who smoked could cost a company up to 5 , 000 a year more in annual insurance premiums than a nonsmoker a congressional study said that in 1990 , the last year for which figures were available , the direct cost of providing health care to people with smokingrelated diseases had reached nearly 21 billion and that did not include nearly 7 billion in lost wages for employees out sick our goals with this new policy are to move toward becoming a smokefree facility , said james a blackwell , president of the lockheed aeronautical systems company in marietta accomplishing these goals will ultimately help lower our costs , improve our competitive position and put lockheed in a better position to win new business the marietta plant employs about 11 , 000 people and makes military planes like the c130 hercules transport and the p3 orion for maritime patrols beginning july 2 , new employees must sign a statement promising not to smoke the ban operates on the honor system and means , in effect , that new hires cannot light up even at home anyone found by a fellow worker smoking in a bar , restaurant or anyplace else could be dismissed the new policy does not affect current employees , who are allowed to smoke at designated places at the plant and anywhere else on their own time as aggressive as the hiring ban might appear , similar efforts by other companies have backfired by prompting a stampede of state laws written specifically to protect smokers against such discrimination five years ago no such laws existed by last year , 28 states and the district of columbia had enacted legislation to protect smokers , and experts say that initiatives by employers in states that have no smokers' rights law , like georgia , could ultimately help get one passed federal statutes protect against discrimination in hiring but for the broader reasons of race , religion , age and gender once enacted , the state laws generally cause companies to lift the hiring restriction , as litho industries , commercial printers in research triangle park , nc , did last year after passage of a law in 1992 but not always four years after colorado approved a law that protected smokers , another lockheed subsidiary , access graphics , a computer wholesale company in boulder , continues to deny employment to smokers for reasons a spokeswoman would not explain one former worker who said he was dismissed after a colleague spotted him smoking on the street during a lunch hour last year is suing the company this is blatant discrimination , said paul sherer , an accounts manager who lasted less than a week at access graphics not hiring smokers affects millions of people and puts them in the same category as woman able to bear children as people who contribute to higher health care costs it s unfair further , the hiring bans have been generating widespread criticism , including some from antismoking activists the critics contend that the bans violate the right to privacy and tend to deny jobs to people who may need them most despite a general decline in smoking in the united states , an increasing number of teenagers , women and blacks are bucking the trend an 'overreaction' it seems to be an overreaction on the part of employers whose interest is cutting costs , said don garner , a law professor at the university of southern illinois who has campaigned against smoking for more than 20 years if someone has the ability to do the job , he should get it what you do in your home is your own business while these measures may have an intuitive grasp of fairness , in practice it s a respiratory apartheid by now , most private employers in the country have cleared the workplace of smoke by designating specific times and places for smokers to indulge some companies have gone further by insisting that employees smoke only outside the building , which is how the lockheed plant currently accommodates workers who smoke
stamford , conn , nov 25 days before a judge is to consider whether to order a school desegregation plan for hartford and its suburbs , a state effort to avoid such a court order by encouraging voluntary measures is suffering serious setbacks as cities and towns vote on voluntary plans promoting racial diversity in the schools of the 11 regions covering the state , the plans for two regions have already been killed and two more have been crippled by key communities' refusal to participate most shocking to supporters of the state s voluntary integration law , enacted by the general assembly in 1993 in the hope of avoiding a court order in the hartford suit , the regional plans are being rejected by the communities likely to benefit most , cities with large minority enrollments for whatever reason , whether it s racial animus or nonracial animus , the 'no' votes prove the futility of voluntary measures , said john brittain , a civilrights lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the hartford case , sheff v o'neill mr brittain said he would attack the voluntary effort as a failure in final arguments in the sheff case on wednesday , when he seeks an order compelling 22 hartford suburbs to cooperate with the city in integrating its schools , which are 93 percent hispanic and black by then , one day before the deadline for communities to vote on the voluntary plans , hartford may be one of the few cities with a regional plan that survived the approval process that plan is mainly an expansion of the 29yearold project concern , which sends hartford children to suburban schools , and it is contingent on the state s paying the entire cost and the governorelect , john g rowland , has vowed to cut billions from the state budget new haven has approved its region s plan and is waiting for suburbs to vote but suburbs have killed the plan for the region that includes bridgeport , the state s largest city , with four of the seven communities around it so far saying no the plan for wealthy lower fairfield county has been killed by rejections in two cities , stamford and norwalk , whose schools have 85 percent of their region s minority students new britain rejected its region s plan , one of the most ambitious in the state , even though that city has 74 percent of its region s minority students and meriden , with its region s largest minority enrollment , rejected its plan the rejections mean that even in regions where a majority of communities approve plans , any measures that are undertaken may be largely symbolic because the districts with minority children wo n't be participating but they also show that officials in cities and suburbs are often on common ground when it comes to schools most value local control of schools over integration , and many fear that these regional plans are a prelude to a state takeover it has not mattered to those voting against the integration plans that the law under which they were drafted , the first in the nation to promote voluntary integration across a state , imposes nothing on local districts , or that the plans themselves are extremely modest , proposing , for example , just five new magnet schools in the state s 169 towns even the departure of gov lowell p weicker jr , who proposed the law , and the election of mr rowland , who strongly supports local control of schools , has not reassured the critics they feel that the voluntary plan is being driven by the sheff lawsuit and see the mandatory busing of their children as the state s hidden objective i really find it scary that everyone s concern about a judge sitting up there in hartford is determining what a whole state will do , said ralph f loglisci , the minority leader of the board of representatives in stamford , the first community to reject a regional plan it s time to stop them from dictating to us and who knows where their thoughts really lie \? stamford s rejection on nov 1 , before most communities even held public hearings , shocked many proponents of the law , for the city appeared ideally situated to benefit from interdistrict programs like magnet schools , which its plan endorsed without specifically proposing any while stamford , a corporate center of 110 , 000 people , prides itself on the diversity in its schools , the steady rise in its proportion of minority students , to 53 percent today from 32 percent in 1976 , has mirrored the growing isolation of minority children in the state s cities and most stamford children are already bused to achieve racial balance within the 37squaremile city , because the minority population is concentrated in the southern third like nearly all school boards that have voted so far , stamford s board overwhelmingly approved the regional plan for a plan to be approved , a majority of a region s towns and cities , representing a majority of its population , must vote yes but the law requires a positive vote by a town s legislative body as well as its school board , and the board of representatives here , which had followed the progress of the plan much less closely , said no
it s a common enough promotional device a special advertising section to tout a state s economy and attract new businesses but when fortune magazine recently discussed doing just such a section on new york state , some potential advertisers balked their concern the 10page section was scheduled to appear in the oct 3 issue smack in the middle of a gubernatorial race the potential advertisers worried that the section and therefore their companies would appear to be promoting the reelection of gov mario m cuomo , a democrat because of their misgivings , the section has been postponed until march there was a concern among some companies of this being perceived , even though it s not , as taking a procuomo position , said fran hall , director of special projects for fortune i do n't mean to say they are anticuomo it s just that they do n't want to be seen as taking any position the section is being promoted by the business alliance for a new new york , a joint venture between the state s department of economic development and 11 new york utilities in july , the alliance sent letters to scores of companies encouraging them to purchase advertising units for 19 , 800 according to the letter , the state planned to distribute 25 , 000 reprints of the section republicans called the alliance s efforts an attempt to pressure stateregulated companies to underwrite a campaign venture if mario cuomo wants to develop an ad campaign for his reelection bid , he ought to pay for it himself , said william d powers , the republican state chairman state officials said the section was timed to coincide with a national convention of realestate agents in new york city , not the november election you have to tell your story , and we 're not doing it , said tony gaetano , a senior deputy commissioner for economic development whom will giuliani support \? in primary , none of the above new york city s republican mayor , rudolph w giuliani , has done his best to keep people wondering about whom he will support in this year s gubernatorial race and now he has clouded the issue further by saying he will not endorse either candidate richard m rosenbaum or george e pataki in the sept 13 republican primary the choice posed something of a dilemma for mr giuliani on one hand , mr rosenbaum , a former state republican chairman , has raised money for mr giuliani in past races and is close to several of the mayor s top advisers yet mr pataki , a state senator from putnam county , is a heavy favorite to win the primary but he is also a protege of mr giuliani s sometime rival , united states senator alfonse m d'amato mr giuliani also faces a conundrum in the general election he could hurt himself among republican faithful if he drags his feet in supporting their standard bearer but he has not ruled out the possibility of endorsing the democratic incumbent , gov mario m cuomo , who has bent over backwards at times to help the city and its mayor republican state committee officials say they think mr giuliani will support the eventual republican candidate but karen crowe , a spokeswoman for mr giuliani , said he is keeping his options open and plans first to interview all comers he could support any candidate , she said it will depend on who can provide the best possible assistance to new york d'amato praises mitchell , only to be corrected senator d'amato has never been shy about attacking his opponents , but last week on the senate floor he lavished praise on one the majority leader , george j mitchell of maine , whose health care bill mr d'amato dislikes mr d'amato rose to say that the process of debating health insurance was too rushed and reminded him of events leading up to the vote he most regretted casting in his 14 years in the senate for the 1986 tax act that , among other things , eliminated deductibility for individual retirement accounts i always said to myself , 'yeah , senator mitchell voted the other way , and i applaud him' he stood up and he voted that way i wish i had then mr mitchell asked to reply i thank the senator for giving me credit , but i think i better make clear that i voted for it he added , in a gentle reference to mr d'amato s recent outrage over inconsistent testimony by treasury department officials in the whitewater inquiry i thought one thing we better do around here now is correct the record as soon as we can mr d'amato , by now chuckling steadily , said i was upset with myself for not having gone down there and voted that way i will not tell you why , added the new yorker , who eviscerated the young treasury chief of staff , josh steiner , for trying to back away from embarrassing diary entries under oath and who seldom misses an opportunity to make a political point i try to do it in my diary i hope the diary does not lie
j carter bacot , the strongwilled chairman of the bank of new york company , said yesterday that he would retire in early 1998 and that the bank s board had approved his choice of thomas a renyi to be his successor until now , mr bacot , 62 , had not set a retirement date and had divided management responsibilities among a group of executives , none of whom was a clear heirapparent in an interview in his ornate office on wall street yesterday , mr bacot , who has run the bank of new york for 12 years , said he had been planning to name a successor for nearly a year you 've got to let someone else run the show at some point , he said i will have been chairman for 15 years the bank of new york , with 50 billion in assets , is the country s 16thlargest banking company mr renyi , 48 , was named yesterday to the posts of president and chief operating officer of the holding company and its main operating unit , the bank of new york he had already been president of the holding company the appointment pushes aside alan r griffith , 52 , who had been chief operating officer and president of the holding company mr griffith will now be vice chairman of the company and the bank and will principally look after its rapidly growing creditcard operations mr renyi has most recently run the bank s other quickly expanding area providing computer processing and safekeeping for various securitiesrelated areas for example , the bank is the leader in holding shares of foreign companies so they can issue american depository receipts that are traded on exchanges in the united states mr renyi will keep those duties and also supervise banking with corporations and consumers and the bank s credit policy previously , he had been the bank s top officer in charge of preventing bad loans in 1988 , he oversaw the integration of the irving trust company into the bank of new york that merger , one of the few hostile takeovers in the banking industry , established mr bacot s reputation as one of the toughest bankers in the country , willing to offend the gentlemanly sensibility of the profession in the relentless pursuit of efficiency mr bacot said mr renyi s performance in that merger was one reason he was chosen for the top spot the two banks had very different cultures , mr bacot said tom did a fine job explaining to those people that we wanted to stay the way we did things around here and why we did them that way since then , the bank has grown by employing a strategy based on parsimonious spending and diversified businesses the bank has extensive branches in the suburbs of new york city , a nationwide mortgage company and a series of lending specialties for various industries , including the media business analysts said mr renyi s appointment was a clear signal that the bank of new york was no longer pursuing a merger with the fleet financial corporation , a similarly sized banking company based in providence , ri fleet has been looking for a partner for a socalled merger of equals in which the combined institution could achieve economies of scale and diversification such deals are easier to arrange financially than those in which one bank pays a large premium to buy another , but they are much more difficult socially , because the managements of the two partners must cooperate mr bacot declined to talk about fleet in particular he said that the company would like to diversify outside the new york area but that it would seek to do so by acquiring banks under terms that kept the bank of new york and its corporate culture under the control of the current holding company mergers of equals are hard to do , he said mr bacot said the bank would continue to seek acquisitions to expand its securities and creditcard businesses and would likely wait to buy banks until the prices for banks fall we do n't have to merge to grow , so we will be opportunistic , he said mr renyi lives in northern new jersey with his wife and the youngest of his three children in his spare time , he plays golf and hikes near his house on the coast in maine after receiving an mba from rutgers university and serving in an army military intelligence unit , mr renyi joined the bank of new york in 1971 as a trainee shares of bank of new york rose 75 cents yesterday , to 28 , on the new york stock exchange

washington the river jordan no longer runs chilly and cold , and so american diplomats turn their eyes to syria well , they should turn them back president hafez alassad , the failing despot in damascus , has almost nothing , except the grudging and late recognition of israel , to offer his gamesmanship is no longer fascinating his indifference to the moral , historical and sentimental motives of political action is tiresome king hussein of jordan and prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel accomplished many things in washington , and one of them was to expose mr assad as a rank anachronism the breakthrough between israel and jordan is exhilarating , after all , because it is not altogether a breakthrough this reconciliation is a little redundant , and that is the beauty of it between israel and jordan , the reality of peace preceded the promise of peace by more than a quarter of a century between israel and syria , too , the border has been still for decades but not all stillness is the same mr assad fills the stillness with hostility , anxiety , intrigue and , on his side of the border , with the peace of an efficient police state \( its disruption , at the city of hama in 1982 , was met with a massacre \) the violence that he will not tolerate in his own country he promotes in other countries there is a new alliance for regional peace and regional prosperity that includes israel , egypt , jordan , the palestinians , morocco , tunisia , saudi arabia and the united states before this alliance , syria is powerless its president is one of the great losers of our time why , then , court him \? the common answer is a comprehensive peace this is the oldest dogma of the middle eastern peace process it was adduced again by president clinton on the south lawn of the white house on monday , when he described the objective of the washington declaration as a just , lasting and comprehensive peace this dogma should have been retired in 1979 , with the signing of a treaty between egypt and israel for the progress between israel and egypt , israel and jordan , israel and the palestine liberation organization has been gained not because of the ideal of comprehensiveness , but despite it each of israel s adversaries , impressed at last with the imperishability of the jewish state , made its peace in its time and in its way , and none of them succeeded in blocking any of their journeys to reason by the standard of a comprehensive peace , the new dispensation between israel and its region disappoints but there is something wrong , surely , with such a standard it makes work for diplomats , but it also insults the work that they have already completed the orthodox conception of comprehensiveness , moreover , is misleading if a comprehensive peace means a peace that is not likely to be shattered by armies in the night , a peace that turns the energies of states and peoples toward what king hussein \( grandly reproducing the finest slogan of classical zionism \) called what is normal , then there is a comprehensive peace and it has been shown not to have need of syria \( syria , of course , will eventually have need of it \) it is the professional peace processors , led by secretary of state warren christopher , who now pack their bags and race to the syrian track in fact , they are proposing to restore to syria the importance of which they have recently , and rightly , robbed it there is another reason to let the syrian track lie the nervousness of israel there is nothing that syria can give israel that would be worth rattling the israelis for the accommodation with the plo , a good accommodation that will have a troubled history , is rattling the israelis quite enough from the standpoint of security , and from the standpoint of morality , the palestinian question is the urgent question it requires all of israel s attention asking the israelis to surrender all or part of the golan heights in this great and dizzying season might be asking too much the smart man of syria has been outsmarted his cruelty , which will not be forgotten , has profited him nothing he sits churlishly in his capital , expecting the world to get excited that he permitted syrian television to show the syrian people a few minutes of coverage from washington , a few minutes of truth about the rest of the world his only allies are the mullahs in teheran and the diplomats in washington who needs him \? anyway , he 'll call

jim quinn , a players lawyer who has been involved in landmark litigation in football and basketball , sees it as the ultimate dream we could sue them all at once , he said , fantasizing about the idea of mounting a mammoth antitrust case against professional sports shaking himself out of his courtroom reverie , quinn added , it may or may not be the seeds of a great lawsuit , but it s interesting that people who purport to be competitors are cooperating with more professional leagues shut down than operating , players and their lawyers cast a suspicious eye at the officials and some club owners and executives of major league baseball , the national hockey league and the national basketball association they see , as one lawyer put it , a crossfertilization , men who own or operate teams in more than one sport , and they talk of meetings attended by representatives of the three leagues they do not charge a conspiracy , but some question the propriety of what they suspect is joint planning by officials of leagues that are supposed to be competing for the fans' dollars at the same time , members of management talk of joint efforts of the heads of the three unions , pointing to the similarity of player proposals in baseball and hockey in current negotiations as evidence they do n't accuse the union chiefs of illegal acts either , but the suggestions of crosspollination on both sides add spice to the unique development that has enveloped sports these days the national football league played its full complement of games yesterday , but major league baseball neither played its final day of games nor planned for the start of its playoffs tomorrow , and the national hockey league did not play its two scheduled games the national basketball association does n't have any games scheduled for another month , but they might not be played either strikes , lockouts , postponements , shutdowns they have replaced the game of summer , autumn and winter even the man who runs bud selig s delicatessen in milwaukee asked the question why now \? why are all of these professional sports leagues mired in labor problems at the same time \? one reason is that the collective bargaining agreements in the three sports ended at about the same time another is money the battle for the billions of dollars in revenue generated by professional sports the players want their salaries to be determined in a free market while the owners want to gain control over the escalation of those salaries salary cap or luxury tax , the owners' system of choice is aimed at producing less income for labor and more for management baseball and hockey owners see the cap at work in the other leagues , and they want their new system it clearly is not by accident , said selig , baseball s acting commissioner it is clearly taken from our experience this has been coming for a long time the systems that used to work so well economically do n't work anymore tragically , i think we were all guilty of not facing up to that the timing is all too bad , but it should not be misunderstood no matter what the explanation , it is not a historical accident that the only sport playing has revenue sharing and a salary cap as the battle rages , though , the players and their lawyers wonder if the owners said , me , too , or if the movement has been orchestrated i do n't know if it s a grand conspiracy , but my information is they 've been in regular contact and consultation , donald fehr , executive director of the major league baseball players association , said they 've had some meetings in bettman s and stern s offices gary bettman is the commissioner of the national hockey league david stern , bettman s former boss , is commissioner of the national basketball association selig has not been identified as having been a participant in any meetings , but richard ravitch , the baseball owners' chief labor executive , has richard moss , a wellplaced players lawyer , said he has heard about lots of meetings , and another person associated with players , who spoke on the condition he not be identified , said that when jerry reinsdorf , principal owner of the white sox and bulls of chicago , was in new york for baseball labor meetings last month , he met with bettman reports of interleague meetings or telephone conversations come not only from people on the players' side one owner with friends in more than one league said he is aware that ravitch has spoken to the others a baseball owner said he , too , knows that ravitch has seen bettman and stern on occasion another baseball person said i know they talk a lot i'm sure they 've gotten together at lunch or meetings dick often says , 'gary said this david said this' but none of the principals acknowledges any such widespread communications stern said yesterday that he could recall having had lunch with bettman and ravitch once in the last six months he denied that they have undertaken any joint efforts or bargaining strategies we rail against economic reality and owners , the nba commissioner said those tend to be a unifying thing bettman said that he could recall only one meeting among the three men many , many , many months ago
portland , ore , jan 19 federal authorities today arrested jeff gillooly , the former husband of tonya harding , and said they had grounds to believe he has implicated her in planning the jan 6 assault on her figureskating rival , nancy kerrigan mr gillooly , a 26yearold unemployed former warehouse worker , was the fourth person to be arrested in the case but not necessarily the last norman w frink , a deputy district attorney , said that the investigation was continuing and more arrests were possible before the authorities announced the arrest , miss harding , who is already in danger of losing her place on the olympic team because of the spreading investigation , said that she had separated from mr gillooly although they were divorced five months ago after more than three years of marriage , they had reconciled and were living together during the time the authorities say the attack was being planned first account given in a statement from her lawyer today after mr gillooly surrendered , miss harding categorically denied any involvement in a conspiracy , echoing statements she has made throughout the investigation mr gillooly has also maintained his innocence an 11page affidavit that accompanied the arrest warrant presents the first account by officials of how they say the attack was planned and executed in it , officials say that one of the three men previously charged in the case , shawn e eckardt , told federal agents that mr gillooly had implicated his former wife mr eckardt worked briefly as a bodyguard for miss harding according to mr eckardt s account in the affidavit , in furtherance of the scheme to injure miss kerrigan , mr gillooly said that miss harding had twice telephoned a skating rink on cape cod , where the attack was initially intended , to learn when miss kerrigan was practicing telephone company records show four calls from the gilloolyharding residence to the tony kent arena in south dennis , mass , where miss kerrigan practiced , the affidavit said calls reported to rink a woman who identified herself as a manager at the rink but would not give her name said that some employees had received telephone calls from a woman asking when miss kerrigan would practice during the time in question , but , she said , we have no idea who they came from mr gillooly added , according to the eckardt account , that miss harding was so concerned about the calls that she said that if she were ever asked about them , she would say she was trying to get miss kerrigan to sign a poster that was the only part of the affidavit concerning any link between miss harding , who met with investigators for more than 10 hours on tuesday , and the plan for the attack , which was eventually carried out at the national championships in detroit the affidavit reflects evidence collected by the federal bureau of investigation from the confessions of mr eckardt and two other men , a statement by mr eckardt s mother , bank records , money transfers , telephone logs and hotel records it includes no information or allegations from miss harding , whose interview on tuesday concluded around 11 30 pm the warrant was signed before , mr frink said looking somber , mr gillooly surrendered to the fbi at 11 25 this morning he was arraigned this afternoon in a state district court on a charge of criminal conspiracy to commit assault , a felony offense by the time of his surrender , he had not been interviewed by investigators afterward , he was interviewed briefly but was not forthcoming , said one investigator asked if mr gillooly was the mastermind of the group , mr frink said , if they were smart , we would not have caught them shane m stant , who the authorities say has confessed to committing the assault on miss kerrigan and was arrested last week in phoenix , was also arraigned here today on the same charge as mr gillooly mr eckardt and the other man charged in the case , derrick b smith , were arraigned last week mr gillooly was released on 2 , 000 bail after his arraignment mr stant , who could not immediately raise the money , was being held until a hearing could determine whether the court would allow him to live with a relative under a form of house arrest the affidavit is the first document made public that outlines the multnomah county case against those charged in the assault , which left miss kerrigan unable to perform in the national championships miss harding went on to win the event and earn a place on the united states olympic team the affidavit presented this version of the plan and the assault the plan to injure miss kerrigan was set in motion at a late december meeting at the home of mr eckardt s parents in portland attended by the four men eventually charged mr eckardt s parents , agnes and ron eckardt , were at home and were aware of the meeting but did not participate , a contention mrs eckardt confirmed in her interview with a federal agent at the meeting , the four men discussed attacking miss kerrigan s right knee this was decided in oregon , the document said , because as it was explained to stant , by gillooly , this was kerrigan s landing leg , and that by injuring it , she would be unable to compete
vancouver , british columbia , june 8 like most good national hockey league teams of the 1990 s , the rangers are a roaring confluence that flows as one river blended from many talent streams as they prepare for a possible clinching of the stanley cup thursday night at a festive madison square garden , their primary identity remains that of the olde oilers , a group of veterans led by mark messier there are seven of them who played during the edmonton dynasty of five championships in seven seasons from 1984 through 1990 all came to the major league through the junior leagues of canada most of them were born and raised there as well but when the rangers defeated vancouver by 42 on tuesday night to come to the brink of their first stanley cup since 1940 , it was the members of two other subgroups of the roster who gave the team its third victory in four games in the fourofsevengame championship round the first were the young americans , brian leetch and mike richter , the 1988 united states olympians who provided the sparks on offense and defense leetch , the attacking defenseman , scored one goal and assisted on the other three he is very likely to become the first american to win the conn smythe trophy , which goes to the most valuable player in the postseason he s on his own game plan now , richter said of leetch , who was first leetch s teammate as a teenager when they played on the national junior team he jumps through the middle and rushes the net , and i think , 'what the heck is he doing \? ' and a second later , he s got his hands up in the air after a goal , and i think , 'he saw that better than i did' he plays so much i do n't know how he has the energy he steps up his game richter did the same after falling behind by 20 in the first period in all , he stopped 28 of 30 shots , including a penalty shot by pavel bure some of his saves were better than others , but it was the timing of them that was most important richter was at his best when the rangers were struggling to find their stride by not giving up any easy goals at critical moments , he allowed his teammates to find their sea legs and gradually come back of the save on the penalty shot , coach mike keenan said it was a classic confrontation and michael was successful it was maybe the turnaround point of the game that was the biggest stop he s ever made in his career , i'm sure the other subgroup that excelled was the young russians , particularly aleksei kovalev and sergei zubov , both of whom are secondyear players who had olympic experience with the unified team of the former soviet union , which won the gold medal in 1992 kovalev scored the winning goal , with 4 minutes 55 seconds remaining , beating kirk mclean on the power play after a setup pass from leetch , who carried the puck up over the vancouver blue line and drew a crowd before passing four guys tried to stop him on the blue line , kovalev said i tried to help him said leetch i saw kovalev break to the net i tried to make it like i was going to shoot , and i just slid an easy pass through , and it got under the guy s stick and alex made a great shot kovalev said he felt bad about getting caught up ice earlier in the game when cliff ronning scored off bure s rush to give the canucks a 20 lead at 16 minutes 19 seconds of the first period i made a mistake , he said jay wells told me 'alex , score a goal alex , we need you we are behind you 100 per cent' zubov , who missed the previous game with a bruised chest , started slowly but got better as the night wore on , scoring one goal on a power play to tie the game and assisting on another rangers all the way as the former oilers age and eventually leave the rangers , the nucleus that will remain is most likely to include leetch , richter , kovalev and zubov none of them have worn any other nhl jersey they are an excellent core group , said keenan brian leetch and mike richter are in their mid20 s zubov and kovalev are just kids and the most honored of this bunch thus far is leetch , who soon may need another shelf in his trophy case in 1989 ,

by the comparisons he said the smythe candidacy is n't of any concern that really does n't matter to me , he said i have never won the stanley cup before or been to the finals , and this is awful

sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , nov 10 releasing a crater analysis of a shell that exploded here on tuesday , wounding a child , united nations military officials today gave what appeared to be the first compelling evidence that the mostly muslim bosnian army carried out a mortar attack on a sarajevo neighborhood under its control a united nations crater analysis of another mortar shell that killed two children about two hours earlier on tuesday , however , showed it was fired from a position under the control of the bosnian serbs , who have renewed artillery attacks on densely populated city neighborhoods in response to bosnian army offensives elsewhere united nations officials here also said today that a jet fighter , flying out of a serbheld swath of croatia in support of a bosnian serb counteroffensive , probably violated a noflights zone over bosnia when it rocketed the northwestern town of bihac on wednesday the ban on flights was imposed by the united nations and is enforced by nato after renewed artillery attacks on sarajevo and the air raid on bihac , bosnia s president , alija izetbegovic , announced that his government would call on the united nations security council to examine what he implied were the international military force s failure to protect the united nationsdesignated safe areas in bosnia but the evidence that at least one of the bosnians' recent wounds was selfinflicted seemed certain to harden the resistance of united nations military officials here , who have been complaining for months that the bosnian government is trying to draw the peacekeeping force and nato into what would amount to a support role for the government we 're not going to get sucked into fighting their war for them , said a senior united nations military officer we 're here as peacekeepers united nations and nato officials today practically ruled out any military response to the shelling incidents or the air attack at this stage , i do n't think there is going to be any direct military action , said lieut col tim spicer , a united nations military spokesman while there is no doubt that the vast majority of shells that have fallen on sarajevo in the last 31 months have come from bosnian serb artillery , the question has been raised repeatedly whether the bosnian government has occasionally fired on its own people and tried to blame the bosnian serbs the united nations has provided details of earlier crater analyses , including one that showed the bosnian army had shelled sarajevo s airport , which is controlled by the united nations but none of the analyses disclosed before today have ever implicated the bosnians in shelling their own territory without providing convincing evidence , and even when it was clearly an untruth , bosnian serb leaders have asserted since the first days of the war here that bosnia s army has repeatedly fired on its own people to win support and prompt the united nations security council to lift an arms embargo that , until only recently , kept government troops badly outgunned some united nations military officials , insisting that their names not be used , have also told journalists and diplomats that the bosnians have shelled themselves before their accounts include a story of a secret , neverreleased crater analysis that supposedly proved that the bosnian government was responsible for the explosion in a sarajevo openair market that left 68 people dead on feb 5 but today the united nations military force here produced what appeared to be the most conclusive proofs ever of such an incident using photographs , charts and maps , a french artillery specialist , lieut col jacques lechevallier , demonstrated at a press briefing that two shells that fell on the sarajevo neighborhood of kosevsko brdo on tuesday afternoon had to have been fired from territory controlled by the bosnian army these two shells could not have come from the other side of the confrontation line , said colonel lechevallier , arguing that they were fired from a position somewhere east of the point of impact , well within bosnian army lines colonel lechevallier did not state explicitly that the bosnians intended to shell themselves but he said it was his opinion that it was not possible that the shells landed on bosnian government territory only because they were mistakenly fired short of their intended target we 've reported the scientific facts , colonel spicer said you can draw your own inference colonel lechevallier said the mortar shell that killed two children in the same neighborhood earlier on tuesday was fired from a serbian position near the confrontation line on the northern edge of the city we have indicated to both sides that we wish to address the question of deterioration of the situation , colonel spicer said , referring to a call for a facetoface meeting between top bosnian serb and bosnian army commanders by the united nations military commander in bosnia , lieut gen sir michael rose serb seeks more power pale , bosnia and herzegovina , nov 10 \( ap \) the bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , demanded greatly expanded powers today to wage war against government forces and their croatian allies but bosnian serb politicians appeared fearful of granting too much authority to dr karadzic , a hawk who has rejected international pressures to make peace the bosnian serb assembly reconvened this morning at its stronghold in pale , just east of sarajevo , to debate declaring a formal state of war against the muslimled bosnian government and allied bosnian croats such a declaration would empower dr karadzic to act without approval from the assembly it s a serious decision , said alexa buha , the bosnian serbs' selfstyled foreign minister we do n't want to do it too fast we are concerned with the response and the mood of the people and the international community map shows current areas of control in bosnian and herzegovia , along with those in the area of sarajevo map also shows the location of kosevsko brdo
miami , may 6 showing an unexpected preference for more lenient treatment of haitian refugees who reach shore here , the immigration and naturalization service is preparing to release a group of more than 400 haitians who have been detained since the coast guard rescued them from an overcrowded boat late last month the release promised today , plus another one promised soon , is the latest sign that the clinton administration has begun modifying the haitian and refugee policy it inherited from the bush administration and left largely unchanged immigration officials , however , say there has been no formal policy change immigration officials said that on saturday they would release 30 to 40 of the haitians from the krome detention center , the main receiving point for refugees and illegal immigrants in florida , and that the rest would be freed gradually during the next week though the refugees can remain free while they pursue claims for political asylum , they are not being given the right to remain permanently in the united states the officials also said that another large group of haitians that reached south florida this week would be paroled from the detention center after processing and medical examinations on tuesday , that group of 97 docked a sailboat at the ocean reef club , a luxury resort in key largo policy allows wide discretion steven forester , a lawyer for the haitian refugee center , an advocacy group here , termed the releases the right thing and the humane thing to do he said the clinton administration was taking a lot of heat because of the stark reality that the united states had been handing people over to a regime we call butchers and could be seeking to placate the increasing opposition to that policy under the immigration service s policy , local officials are given wide discretion to determine where , and for how long , to hold political asylum claimants who have reached the united states in the past , haitians arriving here have often been shipped off to detention centers in texas and louisiana or transferred to county jails in central and northern florida and louisiana , and some have been imprisoned a year pending resolution of their claims that punitive attitude has been taken toward haitians , said the rev thomas wenski , director of the haitian catholic center here , because those responsible for not releasing them argued it would serve as a deterrent to other wouldbe refugees but , he said , that logic does not hold in the case of the 411 haitians who have been held at krome since april 22 , because they were in fact brought here by the coast guard as a humanitarian gesture in addition , the immigration service knows that if they do send haitians out of state , they will be criticized for treating them discriminatorily , mr forester said a matter of overcrowding lemar c wooley , an immigration service spokesman here , said the recently arrived haitians were being released because of overcrowding in the krome center , not because of the rising controversy over the clinton administration s policy toward haiti and its treatment of refugees fleeing political strife in that caribbean nation in the last month , critics of the administration s haiti policy have staged hunger strikes and sitins outside the white house in protest there has been no official change in our policy , mr wooley said all i can note is that it is not unusual for us to do it this way immigration service officials and others in the clinton administration said the same thing last month , when the wooden freighter carrying the 411 haitians was allowed to drift into american territorial waters and its passengers rescued because of what was described as the extraordinary circumstances of their situation refugees aboard vessels interdicted on the high seas , however , continue to be repatriated against their will to haiti , where in many instances they are arrested on their arrival nevertheless , the promised release virtually guarantees that none of the recently arrived refugees will be forced to return to haiti at a time when repression by the military government there has reached new heights of violence no haitian seeking political asylum here has been deported since october 1993 , and although immigration officials have declined to formally announce a nondeportation policy , walter cadman , miami district director of the immigration and naturalization service , has acknowledged that his district has held such removals in abeyance since last year many have relatives in us mr wooley said that all of the 411 people on board the vessel when it was rescued on april 22 would eventually be released , except for nine crew members , who he said could face criminal charges for smuggling their passengers of the original group , 59 people , including pregnant women and small children traveling on their own , have already been released for humanitarian reasons immigration officials said that about 60 percent of the remaining haitians who will be released have relatives in florida and are expected to remain in the state an additional 20 percent have family in other parts of the united states those with no relatives will be released to private refugee resettlement agencies , which will be responsible for their care among those scheduled to be released are 13 refugees who tested positive for hiv , the virus that causes aids that represents a marked contrast to the treatment accorded nearly 200 haitians infected with the virus who were segregated at a special camp at the guantanamo bay naval base in cuba until a federal judge intervened last year the reason for the difference in treatment is that the current group of hivpositive haitians has already made entry in the united states , mr wooley said we ca n't very well hold them or jail them just because they tested positive for hiv , he said , and we ca n't summarily throw them out gov lawton chiles of florida , who last month filed a suit against the federal government seeking reimbursement for the state s expenses in harboring immigrants , said he was not opposed to the release of detained haitians , so long as washington agreed to foot the bill

ethete , wyo when patrick goggles sees tourists streaming through the wind river indian reservation to yellowstone national park , he sees money money that is n't flowing to his northern arapaho tribe tourists spend 16 billion a year in wyoming , and the arapaho are moving only belatedly to extract the tourist gold that anglo businesses just outside the reservation have mined for generations as general manager of the northern arapaho trust , which manages the tribe s investments , mr goggles oversees a venture that includes a small group of retail and service businesses that serve tourists and tribal members alike these enterprises sometimes lure tourists traveling to and from wyoming s biggest draws yellowstone and grand teton national parks but not often enough , and mr goggles wants to lure more one familiar route is probably not open to the arapaho tribes in more populous states , like connecticut , florida and california , have cashed in on bigtime casino gambling the odds always favor the house , observed mr goggles it would be pretty hard to screw up gaming but in wyoming , the nation s least populous state , the arapaho would have a tough time attracting enough customers to make it work while wyoming gets plenty of visitors , they are often families on their way to national parks , not high rollers with money to burn so while the arapaho have some small gaming operations , they have settled on tourism as the most likely vehicle to generate jobs and that is the crying need despite publicity that might indicate otherwise , gambling has not proved a cureall for most tribes a majority of the tribes are not getting wealthy because of gaming , said manley begay , executive director for the project on indian economic development at harvard university most tribes are very poor , with unemployment reaching in some areas to 90 percent the big obstacle is the lack of a capitalist tradition in other communities , budding capitalists can tap the experience of many business managers but on a reservation with few college graduates and few tribal members with experience running a business , there is often no one to ask for advice our problems are worse because we do n't have this business tradition , said anne mcintosh , chairwoman of the trust mr goggles , whose arapaho name is strong bear , is trying to build that tradition he is part of an emerging class of indian executives whose job is to speed the creation of indianowned businesses , while helping to educate their tribes in the ways of market capitalism and the arapaho have certainly made some missteps and had some growing pains along the way mr goggles is largely selftaught , having earlier held positions at tribal businesses and in the tribal political structure at 42 , when many managers have mba s , mr goggles is completing work at the university of wyoming for a bachelor s degree in political science , with a minor in business twentyfive years ago , there were only a handful of indian business managers , mr begay said today , indian businesses bring in billions of dollars annually , and though the number of indian managers is growing , he said there is still a long way to go in being able to have a crop of indian managers you can dip into any time you feel like it as a result , tribes must still turn to outsiders , although they prefer indian managers , because , mr begay said , it promotes sovereignty and it s part of nationbuilding strong managers also increase the odds that indianowned ventures will succeed success is essential because tribes like the northern arapaho have little capital to play with a serious misstep could prove disastrous the neighbors of the arapaho on the reservation , the eastern shoshone tribe , invested roughly 5 million in highrisk derivatives and took a multimilliondollar loss as a result , shoshone tribal leaders had to tap savings accounts to cover tribal operating expenses this year depending on the assets of a region , the best fit may be manufacturing , farming , ranching , tourism , mining , service industries , gambling or something else so tribal leaders must select the right businesses , then make them work and the arapaho believe much of their future lies in tourism mr goggles says his tribe can cash in on outsiders' fascination for indian art , souvenirs and traditions they want to see , they want to buy , they want to touch arapaho , he said they want tshirts and caps we can market our culture at the wind river reservation , mr goggles' job is to help build enterprises that will slice the tribe s 70 percent unemployment rate , and cut deeply into their dependence on public assistance what we 're talking about for the northern arapaho nation is economic independence and selfsufficiency , he said the tribe has a sizable asset in the reservation itself , which it shares with the eastern shoshone tribe the reservation covers some two million acres , an area larger than rhode island and delaware combined it stretches across highplains ranch and farm land until it disappears into the cloudcovered wind river mountains at the continental divide , which forms part of the reservation s western boundary the area s beauty has long been appreciated by tribal members and visitors alike , but now the arapaho want to turn this beauty into jobs the goal is an economic infrastructure that will serve tourists and residents of nearby towns as well as the tribe s 6 , 200 members

with two seconds left in the first quarter , james blackwell launched a 3point shot from about 25 feet out that swished cleanly through the net , and the crowd at the hartford civic center went wild the shot merely tied the score at 3030 , but it had earned the home team , the hartford hellcats , a half point and in the continental basketball association such points \( one point is awarded to the winner of each quarter and a half point for a tie \) are important , since they can ultimately determine the champions in the league s four divisions as it turned out , the hellcats , after losing the second period to the opposition , the wichita falls texans , went on to win the third and fourth quarters and the game before a crowd of 3 , 526 the victory earned the team 3 more points to give them 5 1 2 points for the night when a hartford group was awarded a cba franchise in may , skeptics expressed doubt that minor league basketball could succeed in the state capital , where it had failed several times years before after all , the hartford civic center is the home of the whalers of the majorleague national hockey league , and both the boston celtics of the national basketball association and the university of connecticut men s team play some games there but so far the hellcats appear to have been a success at the box office , if not entirely on the court , averaging more than 4 , 000 spectators a game at the civic center coliseum family entertainment as the top minor league for the national basketball association , the cba offers a caliber of play that is generally regarded as superior to even the best level of college basketball scores of the league s players have gone on to play in the nba , including john starks and anthony mason of the new york knicks and chris corchiani of the celtics and a large number of current cba players , including chuck nevitt , a 7foot5inch backup center , and four other hellcats have played in the nba but though the level of play is high in the cba , there are vast differences in the overall atmosphere at the games we 're selling family entertainment , the hellcats' general manager , richard coffey , said in an interview during the game against wichita falls there s something happening all the time if music is n't blaring from the loudspeaker system , the hellcats' pep band is playing while the city street jammers , the 15member hellcat dance team , performs exuberantly there are the antics of the team mascot , jack the cat , and halftime shows , which have featured the amazing tom carter , who keeps a basketball spinning on top of a 20footlong pole before deftly dropping it into a basket even timeouts are filled with activity , with a constant procession of fans going onto the floor usually for no more than 30 seconds at a time to take their shots , literally , as they try to win prizes that , during the wichita falls game , ranged from a typewriter to a truck to win the truck , the contestant , in 30 seconds , had to make a layup , a free throw , a 3point shot from 23 feet out and a shot from half court a task that would daunt an nba player the evening s only winner was ken yandon of hartford who in 35 seconds sank a layup , a free throw and a 3point shot from college range \( 19 feet 9 inches \) to win a laser jet printer worth about 500 spectators who really want to get involved can sign up to be fantasy fans , who suit up and warm up with the hellcats and sit with them on the bench basketball s the main lure still , in the long run the basketball itself will be the main lure , mr coffey said the nba sells stars , he said , but we ca n't do that because one of our stars might be called up to the nba any day we 've got to stress the overall team and the fun aspect of coming to our games also , the prices tickets to hellcat games range from 6 \( 1 cheaper than the parking fee in the civic center garage \) to 16 , and all of the seats are on the coliseum s lower level the average ticket price of 11 is far lower than the 27 average in the nba , where courtside prices can run as high as 65 they are also lower than the whalers' tickets , which range from 20 to 35 , and the top price is 1 less than tickets to uconn games at the civic center player salaries are also far lower in the cba , averaging about 16 , 000 for the 18week season , less than what some nba stars make for a single game but then this is the league of opportunity , the road to the big show the nba attendance so far has been good mr coffey , who was the general manager of the fort wayne , ind , franchise before coming to hartford , said that 2 , 384 season tickets had been sold , about 900 more than the league average in addition , he said , the team has collected about 300 , 000 from its 60 or so sponsors and raised 375 , 000 through a public stock offering , in which investors must put up a mimimum of 2 , 500 for one unit of 250 shares for their investment , stockholders also get two season tickets for two years , which are worth about 1 , 600 in all , 100 , 000 shares worth 1 million have been made available in what mr coffey says is the only public stock offering in the cba different sets of fans

portland , ore , nov 20 term limits , a balanced budget amendment , school prayer these are phony solutions to the nation s problems the military budget needs to be cut the death penalty violates christian principles and there is nothing wrong with being a liberal senator mark o hatfield of oregon , the man espousing those postelection heresies , is a lifelong republican who is nearing the end of his third full decade in the senate he says , proudly , that he spent most of the years under president reagan trying to undermine his program , and that he is the only active senator who has never voted for a military authorization bill i 've been out of step most of my political life , said mr hatfield , looking down at the sweep of the willamette river from his office here what else is new \? what s new is that the senate appropriations committee will once again be in the hands of mr hatfield , who is perhaps the closest thing in congress to a pacifist or a mcgovernnik , to use the words of house speakertobe newt gingrich of georgia in fact , george mcgovern was once senator hatfield s closest ally on military matters , joining forces with him long ago to propose a legislative amendment to end the vietnam war as a young navy officer in world war ii , mr hatfield was one of the first americans to see hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped on it in 1945 the horror lives with him , he said , and resonates in such actions as his lone vote in the senate against both military action and economic sanctions in the persian gulf war of 1991 at age 72 , mr hatfield has long been known as the politician of peace and pork from faraway oregon , a state where there is no better compliment than being called a maverick it seems 1995 may just be oregon s year the ducks , from the university of oregon , will start the new year in the rose bowl , a west coast football champion for the first time since 1958 and every penny that will be spent by the federal government , outside of social security and other socalled entitlements , will have to pass through the committee led by a man from a state with less than 2 percent of the nation s population oregon s other republican senator , bob packwood , weakened two years ago by accusations of sexual misconduct , will be back in charge of rewriting the nation s tax laws as chairman of the finance committee , which he headed in the early 1980 s while the galloping elephants of the new republicancontrolled congress have been hailing the dawn of a conservative era , mr hatfield has been sitting back in oregon , newly energized , a large grin on his face the clinton administration has certainly noticed a day after the election , six cabinet members called him i'm prepared to work with the white house , he said i ca n't afford to be a partisan guerrilla thwarting the expected attack on domestic programs and attempt to raise military spending will require bridgebuilding with a lot of democrats , he said from 1981 to 1987 , the last time mr hatfield served as chairman of the appropriations panel , he was able to divert 100 billion that president reagan wanted for the pentagon into social programs instead he fought the proposed stars wars missile defense system with passion , urging democrats to join him in opposing this madness , as he called it this time around it will be much harder to accomplish such changes in spending these republicans are talking about building a fire wall between discretionary defense and discretionary nondefense programs , meaning that if we had the votes , we could n't turn it over like we did in the 1980 s , he said but that does not mean mr hatfield will not try to shrink the military budget with the cold war over , there is no reason for spending billions on elaborate weapons systems , he said the way to do this is to point out all the redundancies in our arsenal , he said they used to say , 'what about the russians \? ' well , who are the russians this time \? when iraq was mentioned , he laughed i do n't look at saddam hussein as a threat , he said i see diminishing oil supply as a threat , and saddam is a symbol of that he said the military budget could be cut by reducing the pentagon s civilian work force by 15 , 000 employees and by turning down new weapons systems mr hatfield s staunchest opponents are likely to be from his own party the appropriations defense subcommittee includes republicans like alfonse m d'amato of new york , phil gramm of texas and pete v domenici of new mexico , none of them wallflowers when it comes to advocating military might senator ted stevens of alaska will be the chairman we have voted against each other in the past , said senator stevens , when asked about how he would try to steer the subcommittee around senator hatfield but we have never had an open fight mr stevens added i respect his position it is deeply felt but he knows how i feel about the defense structure on other matters , mr hatfield seems to relish being the spoiler at the republican garden party he rolled his eyes when asked about mr gingrich s contract with america , the blueprint for the republican congress
orlando , fla , july 4 in the postgame s early moments , jason mcateer paused with hands on knees to absorb the pain of it all then , undaunted at finding no dutch player to swap jerseys with , the irish midfielder walked to one side of the citrus bowl and , pointing to a large block of irish fans , began clapping then he walked to the stadium s other side and repeated the gesture ireland was eliminated from the world cup today by the netherlands , 20 , but the irish are n't going home because of lack of fan support their fans and the citrus bowl was heavily dotted with them have been among the most rabid and enthusiastic of the world cup , and mcateer s appreciative move recognized as much we have the greatest fans in the world , bar none , said andy townsend , the irish captain they 've done themselves very proud irish offense stalls if only jack s lads , as this team is dubbed because of manager jack charlton , had given them something to cheer about today ireland had precious few offensive opportunities until late in the second half , when the dutch were content to shut down their offense we might have gone out in a little bit of a different way , charlton said when you give away two silly goals like we did , it leaves a bad feeling in the mouth of a couple of the people charlton referred to a botched backward pass by defender terry phelan that set up the first dutch goal , and then wim jonk s shot in the 41st minute that slipped off the fingers of goalie packie bonner and went into the net the bonner flub was backbreaking for charlton s largely punchless side , which wound up scoring just two goals in four games in the tournament that definitely was a blow , townsend said the irish looked for a silver lining at halftime , but it was not there there was a feeling of frustration that if holland had scored two goals from 10 pass movements or blinding shots , that would be one thing , bonner said but to be behind when you shoot yourself in each foot , it s very , very frustrating in the game s 74th minute , charlton inserted the 31yearold forward tony cascarino , who was coming off injury his ability to outmaneuver the dutch for headers a glaring missing ingredient in the irish attack created more scoring chances goal by ireland nullified ireland thought it had a goal near game s end , by sweeper paul mcgrath , but referee peter mikkelsen called him for a dangerous play on the shot a high kick that hit frank rijkaard in the head i thought it was a perfectly good goal , mcgrath said but then he added , to be honest , my foot was a little high charlton expressed some exasperation about the call , but then , smiling suddenly at the news media assemblage , said now , i'm not complaining it was too late in the game to affect it anyway we would have liked the goal just to show that we can score one now and again charlton surprised some by starting the 19yearold gary kelly at defender over denis irwin , 29 kelly had trouble early dealing with dennis bergkamp and peter van vossen , but played better as the game wore on charlton thought kelly was brilliant after the first 15 minutes charlton also considered starting mcateer , 23 , but shied off because of mcateer s inexperience still , he played the game s final 28 minutes if it had been nilnil with 20 minutes to go , jason is the sort of lad you would put in , charlton said he s got a great pair of legs and he is a good runner at people as reporters began to run out of questions for charlton , it was as though he did n't want to leave , struck by sentiment nice to meet you lads , the charismatic coach said finally , waving goodbye see you all again some time thanks very much he got an unusual , rousing round of applause photo frank rijkaard \( no 3 \) of the netherlands and andy townsend of ireland trying to head ball in 20 dutch victory in orlando , fla \( associated press \)
'passion' and the beast broadway s season did n't exactly roar to a close this week three musicals opened , but two , grease ! and the best little whorehouse goes public , were more or less clobbered by the critics and disdained by many of the openingnight invited guests passion , stephen sondheim s muchrevised operettalike show , fared better , but the reviews were , for the most part , measured and respectful rather than ebullient , and the blancheesque talk afterward among many on broadway was of the kindness of critics indeed , several people said this week that the reviews legitimized the show as a bestmusical candidate , which was needed , they said , because the only other real choice is disney s beauty and the beast , whose presence is still resented among broadway veterans one producer , promised anonymity , even admitted this week that although he liked beauty very much , he would n't vote for it at yesterday s tony administration committee meeting , the beauty score was deemed eligible for a nomination , on the ground that half of it was written specifically for the theater would n't it be amazing if mr sondheim won for best musical and disney for best score \? it s possible in any case , the 12member tony nominating committee , which is to announce its selections on monday , is facing a povertystricken field of musicals if the committee decides to select the usual menu of four nominees , two will have to be chosen from a dutch import that overstayed its welcome and lost 8 million \( cyrano \) a rodgers and hammerstein revue whose score is not eligible for best score \( a grand night for singing \) and the most universally reviled broadway show in memory \( whorehouse \) on the nonmusical side , the prevailing wisdom goes , of course , that this was a rotten season and broadway is no longer hospitable to drama nonetheless , this year the tony races are better than they were last year , when millennium approaches , part 1 of tony kushner s angels in america , was favored in almost every category this year , the competition for best play looms rather lively broken glass , the kentucky cycle , laughter on the 23d floor , any given day and twilight of the golds seem the likeliest competitors for the final two slots , and none of these would be as outlandish as nominees as , say , cyrano or grease ! perestroika \( part 2 of angels \) , and anna deavere smith s twilight los angeles , 1992 are the sure shots they were edged out of pulitzer prize consideration by judges who deemed the one not new enough and the other not a work of fiction , but that should not be the case with the tonys among performers , there is enough competition that even setting aside seven leading men \( sam waterston , brian bedford , christopher plummer , stacy keach , stephen spinella , ron rifkin and nathan lane \) and five leading women \( ms smith , diana rigg , joan rivers , amy irving and rosemary harris \) as potential nominees , there still is a formidable list of actors whose work , though eligible , is not likely to be nominated this year they include eli wallach , peter macnichol , sada thompson , jason robards , anne jackson , philip bosco so maybe the season was n't such a washout \? 'inbetweens' is off bryan goluboff s play , inbetweens , scheduled to open this month at the westside theater , is history last friday , after several weeks of spats , the producers , evangeline morphos and nancy richards , dismissed the director , kevin conway , and canceled the first preview , scheduled for that evening george ferencz was hired to replace mr conway , but then two actors , bruno kirby and d b sweeney , quit the show unable to replace them , yesterday the producers canceled the production , costing investors close to 400 , 000 mr conway and his lawyer , seth gelblom , attributed the show s failure to unnecessary interference in the creative process by inexperienced producers they 're not bad people , but they did n't know what they were doing and they got in over their heads , said mr gelblom he said the producers were unaware that they were required , by union contract , to pay mr conway even after he was dismissed it was a different way of looking at how a play was put together , said mr conway , who spoke of producers giving notes to designers and actors , and of investors he had n't met taking notes during rehearsals i looked out one day , and there was a woman in a mink coat with a yellow pad , he said things were going slowly but i thought we had two weeks of previews , during which we could rehearse in the daytime ms morphos , who was serving as the lead producer on a commercial production for the first time , said the change in directors was made with the approval of the investors and the playwright it was going in a direction i was n't comfortable with , mr goluboff conceded ms morphos said that it was a growing dissatisfaction with what she was seeing onstage that led to mr conway s dismissal , and that as mr conway had staged it , the show was a very sentimental , flaccid , nonrisky production there was a runthrough last tuesday , and it was appalling , she said we had a meeting , and we told him a lot of changes needed to be made to put the play back where the author intended it he slammed his fist on my glass desk , and he said 'if you want the changes made , you 're going to have to fire me' footlights there s probably some relationship between the heartstringthrumming sentimentality of blood brothers and nostalgia for the age of bubblegum rock petula clark , who plays the luckless mother of separated twins who meet a tragic fate , is to leave the show on june 5 not to worry , pop icon fans her replacement is carole king the cassidy brothers , david and shaun , who play the show s illfated siblings , are also leaving their replacements have n't been named as most critics have noted , the vulgarity in the best little whorehouse goes public is cheerfully out in the open one bit of it that has gone unremarked is what may be the most egregious instance ever of product placement on broadway the clear plastic television set that spends several minutes of the show front and center has , for no easily discernible reason , a recognizable brand name on it the reason is this the brand is made by matsushita , the japanese megamanufacturer , which in 1990 bought mca inc , the hollywood film company that owns universal studios the entire capitalization for the 7 million show came from mca universal photo no more mr nice guy richard thomas , the shakespearean walton , is to play richard iii in a hartford stage company production opening on sept 24 also on the company s 199495 schedule tennessee williams s suddenly last summer shaw s arms and the man the dybbuk , in an adaptation by tony kushner , and clean , a play by a yale drama school student , edwin sanchez
new york , first in the american league , second in apple production , has slipped to third in population , behind not only california but now texas texans have already laid claim to unofficial bragging rights as the nation s second most populous state and yesterday , the census bureau disclosed population projections indicating that texas had indeed overtaken new york sometime in january i do n't know what difference it makes , frankly , said gov mario m cuomo , not entirely a good sport i think we 're regularly undercounted , so i do n't believe the census bureau of course , the other biggies california , texas , florida have some problems with undercounting as well other new yorkers conceded it was inevitable that the empire state , which ranked first in population from 1810 to 1970 , was being bumped to third a status it last held in 1800 , when it was poised to leapfrog over massachusetts and pennsylvania once you 're not no 1 , it does n't matter where you are , said jerry della femina , the new york advertising executive and reputedly the fastest quote in the east nobody ever shouted they were no 2 except for avis texas s edge the census bureau had figured that texas would not overtake new york for another six weeks or so , but , responding to a request , it produced a revised projection yesterday to reflect the latest trends between jan 1 and feb 1 , paul r campbell of the census bureau estimated , new york s population edged up by a mere 1 , 000 to 18 , 151 , 000 by contrast , mr campbell said , texas swelled by 26 , 000 in january to 18 , 163 , 000 by feb 1 a relative loss in population hurts a state s standing in congress , but texas s expected gain of two more congressional seats at new york s expense will not occur until the reapportionment after the next decennial census in 2000 federal aid is typically disbursed according to a state s population , rather than its rank the most immediate impact of the shift may be on states of mind in the two states , where superlatives are taken for granted egos in both may be too large either to be deflated by a statistical demotion to new york , which remains home to the nation s biggest city , or to be enhanced by the government s validation of what texans already consider gospel in texas , which , with less than half the land area of alaska , remains the biggest of the 48 contiguous states a new yorker was churlish enough to point out that texas also ranks first among the states in the number of homes without complete plumbing \( 85 , 000 \) and in cattle population \( nearly 14 million \) that prompted mr della femina to suggest that perhaps census takers had counted hooves and divided by four until the last decade or two , texans considered growth synonymous with progress it s still the dominant view , but it is no longer the only view , said t r fehrenbach , second to none as a texas historian there is a strong feeling today that untrammeled growth brings problems still , the lone star state has plenty of space for new texans as the nation s population continues to shift to the south and the west , which , since 1980 , have been home to a majority of americans its population density averages 67 texans a square mile new york crowds 384 people in the like space \( and new jersey has the nation s greatest population density , at 1 , 050 souls a square mile \) i have no doubt that texans will burst with pride that they 've passed new york , although new york is no longer the bete noire it was , mr fehrenback said but to assume a mantle of superiority from this , i think , is quite dubious no way either of us is going to surpass california new yorkers , who still smart from chicago s claim to having the world s tallest building and from california s primacy in population , struggled , with varying success , not to sound like sore losers there s almost no connection between numbers and spirit , said bobby zarem , the publicist , who helped conceive the i love new york promotional campaign and who recently began another , more defensive slogan new york it ai n't over no less congestion mr cuomo expressed no envy of texas s gains they have a whole lot of people pouring over the border , he said , so i do n't take this to be a sign of economic growth or of added confidence by couples having larger families what i think is significant , he added , changing the subject , is how new york is situated to compete in the global economy in the years ahead i would n't trade places with texas or california , for that matter , mr cuomo declared the shift in ranking does not mean less congestion in new york because the state is shrinking only relatively because of a continuing surge of immigrants from abroad , new york had defied earlier projections that it would slip to third by 1990 texas is growing faster , though , while new york has been hemmorhaging population to other states , including texas there the annual population increase is as much as 400 , 000 , or more than all of staten island demography is n't such an exact art that we can figure it to the day , said dr steven h murdock , chief demographer at the texas state data center of texas a m university texas grew by 21 percent or more than 300 , 000 from 1992 to 1993 , dr murdock said , absorbing more newcomers than any other state he said the growth reflected a net gain in immigration from other states , a net gain from overseas and a natural increase , or surplus , of births over deaths in the years between decennial counts , the census bureau resorts to what mr campbell described as a computerized cohort component projection model to estimate population life expectancy trends are applied by age , sex and race to the most recent population figures for each state births come from health records migration patterns are extrapolated from the 1990 census and from internal revenue service returns after projecting the nation s population , demographers refine the figures state by state and recalibrate them periodically in 1993 , the census bureau said , 7 of every 100 americans lived in new york that share is projected to shrink to fewer than 6 in 100 by 2020 , by which date florida is expected to pass new york as third in population , in the bureau s 30year projection new york is projected to add 34 million people from abroad during that period but lose nearly 500 , 000 to other states texans are expected to constitute nearly 8 in 100 americans by 2020 as a result of an influx of 22 million immigrants from overseas , 333 , 000 transplanted americans , and of about 6 million more births than deaths owing , in part , to higher fertility rates among the state s growing hispanic population david c huckabee , an analyst with the congressional research service , said if population projections pan out , new york s congressional delegation will shrink to 29 from 31 after the 2000 census the texas delegation will grow to 32 , adding two seats , and california s representation will expand to 55 from 52 unless , he said , the membership of the house of representatives is increased , which last happened in 1911 new york is not unique , said david r lamphere , an associate demographer with the new york state department of economic development even though we 've been gaining in population slowly , we still have considerable outmigration it s the entire northeast new york just gets more attention because we 're the biggest , mr lamphere said in the region , he meant graphs shifting population

western conference contenders fall into two disparate categories those with dominating centers and questionable supporting casts , and those with superior casts except for their lack of a center put denver s shotblocking dikembe mutombo with seattle , phoenix and golden state , perhaps even utah , and there really would n't be much left to discuss if houston had cactus and low humidity , maybe danny manning would have taken 1 million to help hakeem olajuwon win his second title , instead of signing on to help charles barkley get his first not only is there little sentiment for the rockets' chances to repeat , few even want to refer to them as defending champions what did olajuwon and co do to deserve being promised a visit to the white house by president clinton moments after they defeated the knicks in game 7 , only to be ignored the rest of the summer \?

seven years after immigrating to new york from moscow , the concert pianist vladimir feltsman is spearheading plans to open a public elementary school in manhattan for musically gifted children based on the soviet model , it would be what educators describe as the first school of its kind in the united states the special music school of america , which appears to have been catapulted from possibility to probability by a recent 500 , 000 grant from the philanthropist walter h annenberg , has a projected opening date of september 1995 with 45 children attending kindergarten through second grade at the elaine kaufman cultural center , a private , nonprofit jewish music and arts center on west 67th street , near lincoln center it is believed to be the first public school in this country to combine early , rigorous instruction in music with a standard academic program in spite of all the political difficulties , the soviets knew very well how to train students in musical and dance education , said mr feltsman , who has known both the virtues and the abuses of the soviet system he began his career as a celebrated soloist at the age of 12 , performing beethoven s piano concerto no 1 with the moscow philharmonic he left moscow 23 years later , a musical pariah , shut out of concert halls after he had applied for permission to emigrate we were trained two times a week from the age of 6 by the most exquisite teachers everywhere , the pianist recalled i would love to see it happen in this country a west side constituency the school would be unusual not only in terms of the children admitted , but in its plan to integrate new york s wealth of top musicians into its musical curriculum for very young students the conductor michael tilson thomas is on its advisory board , and mr feltsman , who is developing the music curriculum , said several fellow performers had agreed to be visiting instructors mr feltsman , who appears to have grown more diplomatic since he developed a reputation for being abrasive in his early days in america , is advancing the academy as a possible model for other elementary schools around the country the proposal has won the support of the local school district , whose superintendent , james e mazza , called it an idea we could not ignore from the feltsman point of view , you have too many highcaliber musicians being foreign born , said mr mazza , whose district , no 3 , covers the west side from 59th to 122d street usually , those folks end up living on the west side we 'd like them to become people who grew up on the west side mr mazza said the district , which heavily emphasizes arts programs in its 15 alternative schools and 20 traditional schools , saw the feltsman proposal as an innovative approach to education and a way to attract back to the public schools those folks from the upper west side who might not otherwise use the public schools other city schools built around the arts include the fiorello h la guardia high school of music and the arts , also in district 3 , and the high school of art and design on the east side none of the schools or programs , however , offer personal lessons on an instrument as part of the school day the superintendent acknowledged that it would take some ingenuity to work around the nonprofit school s schedule of closing on jewish holidays , as the center demands , and still meet the state requirements for 180 school days a year all that is a challenge , and we 'll deal with it , he said we believe that once people understand the nature of what we 're trying to do here and the value of this for the kids , they 'll help us make it a reality the school would use the center s instruments , equipment , classrooms and private practice rooms , valued at 10 million , as the core of its program without them , the startup costs would be so high that mr feltsman said he would never have embarked on the project before it s too late plans to open the school grew out of a column mr feltsman wrote in newsday in april 1990 decrying the dearth of early training for musicians in this country among students attending his master classes , he said , the lack of early education becomes a handicap that cannot be remedied by then , it s too late , he said if you have n't got it by then , you never get it music is cruel that way lydia kontos , reading the column , was intrigued mrs kontos , the director of the kaufman center , wrote mr feltsman a letter , the only intelligent response he recalled receiving some people called me from texas , but they were not serious it was , like , 'vlaaad , baaaby ' he said , his voice trailing off on a recent tour of the building , mrs kontos swung open the door to 1 of the 10 empty classrooms , currently used largely for afterschool courses in music and art music stands leaned against a wall the notations of another day covered the chalkboard we could be using this , she said i want to hear children here another door opened to a large room that could be used for recitals , which mr feltsman foresees as playing a large part of the children s musical training the center would use its air rights to add two additional floors to the building as the school grows , mrs kontos said undoing past cuts

washington , oct 16 two studies to find the most effective dose of a widely used drug for treating heart attack patients have found that a high dose can unexpectedly prove unacceptably dangerous the trials , sponsored by drug companies , were halted in april because of an unexpectedly high risk of paralyzing and fatal strokes , but doctors are to be publicly warned of the danger only on monday the drug is heparin , a powerful agent that interferes with the body s normal clotting process heparin , along with other drugs , is recommended for heart attack patients because it inhibits the formation of blood clots that can lead to a second heart attack doctors use a range of doses on hundreds of thousands of heart attack patients , the study leaders said a large study established last year that a low dose of intravenous heparin was reasonably safe and effective when given with clotdissolving drugs two large followup trials involving patients in more than 365 hospitals in the united states and 12 other countries were then begun , testing a high dose of heparin and a similar but experimental drug by this april the answer was clear the high dose of heparin wrought too much havoc with the clotting process and could cause lethal bleeding in some patients the trials were resumed in may with lower doses of both heparin and the experimental drug , hirudin , with approval from federal officials a third study conducted in germany was halted in june after researchers there , alerted to results of the two americanbased studies , found a similar risk of strokes among individuals receiving hirudin the german study used a low dose of heparin there are no clear standards for how quickly the results of clinical trials should be publicly reported in recent years federal health officials have taken to issuing clinical alerts , informing doctors within days of important new therapeutic advances or dangers from federally sponsored research this is a departure from the academic tradition of allowing all but the most exceptional results to wend a leisurely route through the review and publication schedule of journals findings from the three studies are being reported on monday in the october issue of circulation , a medical journal published by the american heart association in dallas dr eric j topol , chief cardiologist at the cleveland clinic foundation and the head of the largest study , said in an interview that there were many reasons for the sixmonth delay in disclosing the findings , chiefly the need to avoid causing a panic among doctors who were using heparin at low doses an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal advised them to continue the studies are part of a massive international effort to find the most effective treatment for heart disease , a leading killer , and to finetune the doses of the leading drugs and the way some are administered to save more lives , federal health officials earlier this year recommended that people suffering heart attacks should receive clotdissolving drugs , often including heparin , within 30 minutes of arrival at an emergency room the three studies aimed in part at comparing heparin , which was discovered in 1916 , and hirudin hirudin is made by genetic engineering from the anticoagulant in the saliva of leeches , and it is being intensively studied in the hope that it will prove more effective than heparin participants received either heparin or hirudin along with drugs that can break up blood clots after they form , including streptokinase and tpa , and aspirin , which is also used to prevent clots the three studies found that among those receiving either heparin or hirudin with streptokinase or tpa there was definitive evidence of a catastrophic bleeding complication that was about twice the expected rate , the heart association said in a news release strokes result from the death of brain cells and can be caused by blood clots or bleeding the ones in these studies resulted for unknown reasons from bleeding due to a complication of therapy in dr topol s study , 26 of 2 , 564 heart attack patients who received either hirudin or heparin suffered a stroke from bleeding in the brain , a rate of about 1 percent in the study headed by dr eugene braunwald and dr elliott m antman of harvard medical school in boston , 6 of 345 , or 17 percent of those receiving hirudin and 7 of 368 , or 19 percent of patients receiving heparin , suffered strokes from bleeding more than half of those with strokes died , and others among the survivors were paralyzed or otherwise disabled and face years of rehabilitation , the association said these are intolerable rates of stroke from bleeding , said dr topol , who is chairman of cardiology at the cleveland clinic foundation it has been a nightmare for us doctors have generally been careful in prescribing heparin because of the wellknown bleeding risks the new findings document the narrow window that exists in prescribing a safe , effective dose because the amount in the americanbased studies was only 20 percent higher than that used in an earlier study that had showed the benefit of combined intravenous heparin and therapy using the clot buster drugs , thrombolytics

because the computer can store an almost infinite number of titles without turning them into physical inventory until requested , downloading is seen by some analysts as the video store s answer to video on demand for now , though , blockbuster s downloading tests will offer only sega video games the company also plans to download audio cd s , but disagreements over royalties have delayed that application eventually , blockbuster would like to download movies , but films still take too long to generate while a customer waits and there are problems with quality at present , the company seeks to make movies from scratch as a coproducer with major studios blockbuster has its own ideas about what kinds of movies to produce , and will offer film makers suggestions based on information drawn from its customer data base we have 40 million accounts on a computer , so we know consumer preferences by zip code , said ron castell , blockbuster s senior vice president for programming and

in the first innercity project of its type in the nation , one of the country s leading environmental organizations , two paper companies and a community development group are expected to announce a proposal today for a 100 million plant in the south bronx to produce recycled paper from new york city s trash proponents say the project is intended to take advantage of what environmentalists call the urban forest the vast amounts of paper discarded by offices every day but for residents of the south bronx , the plant would also be intended to create perhaps 300 new jobs and bring other economic benefits , including housing , training , day care and health care services for the workers the planners , who have been quietly discussing the project for two years , say they expect to raise 2 million from the paper companies and state and local governments to pay for detailed engineering and economic studies , which they hope to present to investors this fall to raise money for the plant the recycling operation , which would be run as a forprofit company called the bronx community paper company , would be on a 19acre site in the old harlem rail yard just north of randalls island and could be operating by fall 1996 , planners said john adams , executive director of the environmental group behind the plan , the natural resources defense council , said the project would also promote social values we get everything we want jobs , recycling , a process we like and social equity , he said we save lots of trees and end the waste of putting a valuable resource into landfills clay lifflander , president of the new york city economic development corporation , which seeks to attract businesses to the city , said the guiliani administration supported the plan we will do what we can to help see this vision brought to reality , mr lifflander said the white house , which last year issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to increase their use of recycled paper , also praised the south bronx plan this initiative shows that economic development , job creation and environmental protection can work together for the benefit of us all , vice president al gore said in a statement the real test of the project s viability will be whether a business payoff can be seen by the paper companies and outside investors who will be asked to pay for the plant this is not a social project for us we need the pulp , said james d black , a vice president of s d warren , a bostonbased unit of the scott paper company that has contributed 250 , 000 to the effort the other paper company involved is the modo paper company of stockholm , which operates recycling plants in europe and has contributed 300 , 000 so far to the south bronx project we need highquality pulp to make printing and writing papers , mr black said and our customers increasingly want recycled content even for the businessminded , there may be pragmatic value in the perceived social benefits because of the participation of a community group , the banana kelly community improvement association , project organizers expect the active support of local residents , rather than the community opposition that can severely delay development proposals partnership with residents the residents of the south bronx appreciate being included as partners from the outset , rather than being cornered into the role of adversaries , said yolanda rivera , chairwoman of banana kelly , which is named for the curve of kelly street in the south bronx of the approximately 100 million it will cost to build and equip the plant , 62 million will be earmarked in advance for day care and health facilities , housing and education these social services will help people move out of unemployment to train for real jobs , ms rivera said the plant is expected to employ 180 to 200 people , with approximately 100 more jobs coming from the related social services most of the people hired are expected to be from the south bronx and would be trained by banana kelly if the money is in place , construction could begin in february , said allen hershkowitz , a senior scientist with the natural resources defense council although other companies in the city call themselves recyclers , their work involves only the collection of trash , which they sort to remove the recyclable materials , which are then bundled and sent outside new york city to be processed the bronx mill would be the first in the city to render used paper into clean pulp that paper companies could then make into highgrade printing and writing papers in recent years the number of paperrecycling plants has increased throughout the nation but most have been in old paper mills in rural areas or in industrial parks in the midwest , where land and labor are cheaper than in urban areas and where there tend to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles but with enough local support , the south bronx could have certain advantages , mr hershkowitz said the economics of transportation work in our favor , he said most mills are hundreds of miles from cities , so we will have a 15aton cost advantage

washington , feb 19 a recent federal appeals court ruling that a virginia hospital must provide lifesustaining treatment for a baby born missing most of her brain has alarmed hospital administrators and specialists in medical ethics they say there is little hope for holding down health care costs if family members have a legal right to insist on treatments that doctors consider inappropriate fairfax hospital , a regional medical center in falls church , va , is appealing the decision , which was issued earlier this month by a panel of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond the panel ruled , 2 to 1 , that a federal law enacted eight years ago to prevent hospitals from turning indigent patients away from emergency rooms applies much more broadly , requiring hospitals to treat or stabilize all emergency conditions , even when doctors believe that no treatment is warranted the ruling came in the case of a 16monthold girl , identified in court records only as baby k , who was born at the hospital with a catastrophic birth defect , anencephaly , the absence of all brain structures except a rudimentary brain stem she has been kept alive much longer than most anencephalic babies normally survive because the mother insisted that the hospital provide mechanical breathing support during the baby s periodic respiratory crises the mother , who is not identified , is acting out of a firm christian faith that all life should be protected , according to an earlier court opinion in the case ever since the hospital was rebuffed by a federal district judge last summer in an initial effort to avoid further treatment , the case has been closely watched as the latest symbol of the uphill effort to harness professional judgment , technology and human emotion in the service of rational medical care money not at issue the appeals court s legal interpretation has added an unexpected and weighty element to this painful mix the court applied a 1986 law , the emergency medical treatment and active labor act , often referred to as the antidumping act because it was principally intended to prohibit private hospitals from turning away uninsured patients needing emergency care but the law is not limited to indigent patients , and in any event , money is not directly at issue in this case because the baby and her mother are fully insured members of the kaiser permanente health maintenance organization , which is covering costs that are now well into six figures rather , the issue is medical judgment anencephalic babies are permanently unconscious and lack all sensation and cognitive ability but they are not brain dead and so do not meet the legal definition of death that would give hospitals the clear right to stop lifesupport the standard treatment is to keep anencephalic babies warm and feed them as their organs fail death usually comes from respiratory failure , because the brain stem is not adequate for regulating breathing there is not a physician in the country who thinks you ought to treat anencephalics , dr arthur f kohrman , chairman of the committee on bioethics at the american academy of pediatrics , said in an interview this is a profoundly important case , because it strips away the ability of physicians to act as moral agents and turns them into instruments of technology these babies are born dying , and the issue is not prolonging their death but supporting it in a humane and dignified way in applying the antidumping law , the court of appeals majority identified the baby s emergency medical condition not as anencephaly , for which there is no treatment , but as apnea , a periodic inability to breathe , which can be treated with a ventilator because patients with apnea from other causes would be treated in an emergency , fairfax hospital must treat the baby , the court said , adding that the law made no exception for situations in which the required treatment would exceed the prevailing standard of medical care in the majority opinion , judges william w wilkins jr and karen j williams said that congress could write such an exception into the law but that it was beyond their purview as judges the court acknowledged that a virginia law exempted doctors from having to provide care they regarded as medically or ethically inappropriate but it held that the state law was preempted by the federal statute and so could not provide a basis for refusing respiratory treatment the dissenting judge , james m sprouse , said that congress even in its weakest moments would not have meant to require doctors to disregard their medical judgment and treat baby k the statute should not be seen as applying at all to this case , he said , adding that anencephaly , while an unspeakably tragic illness , should not be viewed as a series of discrete emergency medical conditions to be considered in isolation review by full court the hospital decided this week to ask the

william klein is one of the most important photographers of his generation , but there s little evidence of this in william klein in and out of fashion , the limp show at the international center of photography s uptown space mr klein is famous for his dynamic books about new york city , tokyo , rome and other cities , published in the 1950 s and 60 s none of the photographs from those volumes are in this show , which focuses on the fashion work he has done over the last four decades , and throws in some of the paintedover photographic pieces he has produced in recent years that mr klein , who is 66 , should be represented by such an undistinguished show is especially unfortunate because his reputation has never been as secure in this country as it should be the frenetic , selfconsciously graphic quality of the photographs from his most important project , the study of new york city that was published in 1956 , did n't sit well with american photographic tastes of the period moreover , mr klein has spent much of the last 40 years in france , out of the orbit of the new york photo scene , and for much of that period he has devoted his energies to making films not that a survey of his fashion photography is unwelcome he was a photographer for vogue magazine from 1954 to 1965 , and over the years has worked for a host of other fashion magazines more recently , he has taken his camera behind the scenes at fashion shows to create blurry , impressionistic views of backstage doings in the course of his long involvement with fashion , mr klein has made some remarkable pictures for a magical group of images taken in 1960 and 1961 , he photographed a model who appeared to float in front of parisian buildings in reality , she was posed on a small table in front of huge blowups of the buildings' facades for another memorable series , taken in new york city in 1962 , he posed models in the streets or on rooftops holding fulllength mirrors in one image , a model in an elegant scoopnecked black dress stands on the williamsburg bridge , holding a mirror that reflects another model , who also appears in the foreground this sophisticated shot , which reflects mr klein s training and interest in geometric painting , provides a rich metaphor for both the fragmentation of urban life and the essential fashion exchange of seeing and being seen in another wellknown image , taken in rome in 1960 , two models dressed in minimal blackandwhite dresses pass each other while crossing the street taken from a high angle , the photograph emphasizes the link between the stark contrast and pared design of their dresses and the stripes of the crosswalk human touches soften the severe geometry of the image one model gazes over her shoulder at the other in surprise as a man on a motor scooter speeds between them but too many of mr klein s other fashion pictures lack distinction for all their graphic elegance , many of the images betray an ambivalence about fashion that renders them cold and distanced in picture after picture , mr klein restates the theme that fashion models are really only mannequins they appear posed with figures in a wax museum , or with cutout images of movie stars and politicians in one picture from 1963 , a model appears in front of the paris opera surrounded by people whose faces have been painted out in the photograph since returning to photography in the 1980 s , after 20 years in film , mr klein has photographed backstage at fashion shows , producing images that are collagelike in their quick , disjointed compositions models are seen adjusting stockings or makeup , hurriedly shimmying into the next gown , checking themselves in the mirrors energized with blur and the harsh light of a flash unit , these images are the antithesis of his earlier formal shots mr klein has also taken to marking enlarged strips of these shots with slashes and x s of paint , as if presenting contact sheets with images picked out with grease pencil these composite works bring mr klein back to his roots in painting but they say little of interest about the world of fashion , or the life of a fashion photographer instead they seem stylized and selfconscious , an arty celebration of the nittygritty of the glamour biz diehard fans of fashion will no doubt be fascinated by these behindthescenes glimpses of models , many in various stages of undress , but all this has the unfortunate effect of further delaying a full appreciation of mr klein s city books those astonishing photographs , which capture and reflect the violence and beauty of urban life , will have to wait for another occasion to receive their due william klein in and out of fashion is to remain at the international center of photography , 1130

washington rompers and drawstrings , paint cans and fruitscented crayons lyrics to a spoof of my favorite things \? possibly , but julie andrews would n't be singing the voice might belong , however , to ann brown , head of the consumer product safety commission and if she were singing the song , she 'd be lying those items , far from being her favorite things , have all come under the commission s scrutiny recently for a variety of hazards they pose when mrs brown announced a huge government recall of a popular but flammable twolayer chiffon and rayon skirt on aug 12 even though there had been no known cases of injuries the commission s consumer hotline received more than 20 , 000 calls and that was only the latest in a series of very public , and mediasavvy , commission actions in just a few months , mrs brown has put the commission in the spotlight , with frequent press conferences , a new award singling out companies with consumerfriendly products , and james earl jones' voice on the consumer hotline she puts in an appearance on good morning america every three weeks or so , and usa today s life section keeps tabs on her announcements suddenly , it seems , the commission has been transformed once called moribund by consumer advocates , it now sends ripples throughout pop culture it was the commission , after all , that brought to public consciousness the fact that inline skates can be hazardous when used improperly or without the right safety equipment with one warning , a hip pastime became a health risk to be sure , there are those who raise questions about her motives and her style she has her own agenda , said jan amundson , general counsel for the national association of manufacturers , and we want to know what it is and david a miller , president of the toy manufacturers of america , said of her flair for publicity this is her style our concerns are that this is not a way a regulator should be making regulations but critics ca n't deny that she wields a power that is a distinct novelty at the consumer product safety commission the reagan administration tried to weaken it in 1981 , to keep it out of industry s hair , and budget and staffing levels decreased by the year mrs brown , who became chairwoman in march , is being hailed by consumer advocates like ralph nader as a fresh breeze she s resuscitating it , said mr nader the cspc has been dormant for 15 years mrs brown showed this new attitude clearly at some recent meetings an admitted cheerleader with more energy than one might think could reside in her diminutive body , she demands action even while simply hearing reports , she urges advisers to make points quickly , and she constantly asks how the commission can best get results at meetings , she darts from topic to topic calling for a new warning to be issued , pushing for a press conference on the dangers of products like mace and pepper gas containers , giving pep talks about the commission being an activist agency mrs brown speaks in upbeat sound bites we are a voice for the voiceless or i hate those blanketyblank bath seats ! \( and often , in fact , recycles those same sound bites in appearance after appearance \) she likes to avoid dead ends and delays , radiating an image normally alien to government officials a guerrilla , although one very much aware of the rules of the game the drive for consumer action despite obstacles and red tape is nothing new for ann winkleman brown born in philadelphia in 1937 , she moved to washington when she was 2 her father owned a women s clothing store , where she would do her homework in the evenings after taking three different buses from school her father , she said , believed in treating the consumer with utmost fairness , even having his salespeople pretend to be customers returning purchases treat them as if they were buying the dress , her father urged i was fascinated with the process of people buying and selling things , the consumer transaction , she recalled 'it was always a major interest of mine , maintaining a sense of indignation at consumer injustice she graduated from george washington university in 1959 , but her move to consumer activism did not come immediately a stint for the new york post , first as a gal friday , then as a washington correspondent , helped her with writing and learning the way of washington she had married while in college , and now had two daughters her husband , donald , a former professor at harvard business school , is now a lawyer and developer in washington and also teaches real estate mrs brown soon decided to start a grassroots consumer group serving washington she said she did the gamut of consumer activism in the 1970 s , boycotting iceberg lettuce , doing a price survey of toys , helping found the consumer protection office her daughters , now 29 and 32 , recall that this activist life once led them to a nearmelee at a boycott held in front of a washington supermarket to protest high meat prices a bus full of farmers' wives arrived to counterprotest just as mrs brown began to make a speech , and they tried to drown her out

the death of a long island man on friday may be the first fatality from the outbreak of legionnaires' disease among passengers who traveled on the cruise ship horizon , health officials said yesterday the results of an autopsy on pasquale cantone , 68 , of west babylon , will not be available for two weeks , said officials at good samaritan hospital in islip , li but one of mr cantone s doctors , who is a specialist in infectious diseases , said it appeared likely that mr cantone died of legionnaires' disease , a virulent form of pneumonia mr cantone , a bus driver for the west babylon school district , had returned from bermuda on the horizon , a celebrity cruise line vessel , on july 9 he was admitted to good samaritan six days later , and died at 3 28 am friday robert howard , a spokesman for the federal centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , said the agency had not yet been officially informed by the new york state health department that there had been a laboratoryconfirmed legionnaires' death , but that may well have occurred 6 confirmed cases as of noon yesterday , mr howard said , there were six confirmed legionnaires' cases , five in new jersey and one in new york city , and 24 suspected cases , 11 in new jersey , 7 in new york city and 6 in other parts of new york state we are still in the midst of conducting epidemiologic surveys , laboratory testing , culturing of the legionella bacteria and consulting with the states and the cruise line , mr howard said it could not be learned yesterday whether any of the patients with confirmed legionnaires' cases were in critical condition on thursday , 1 , 243 passengers who had cruised to bermuda aboard the horizon were returned to new york on chartered flights or on another ship after the centers for disease control confirmed the presence of the dna of legionella bacteria in several places on the 12deck horizon , primarily in the 1 , 800ton water system the legionnaires' dna was found in an investigation begun on july 16 by the cdc after three passengers from a previous cruise were admitted to a new jersey hospital with symptoms of the disease the disease produces headaches , fever , coughs , chest pain , diarrhea and delirium it is readily treatable with the antibiotic erythromycin , but death rates for patients whose cases require hospitalization can reach 15 percent the returned passengers face a wait of 2 to 10 days , the incubation period for the disease , to see if they fall ill , and even then a blood test is needed to determine whether they have legionnaires' rather than another form of pneumonia cdc officials have advised passengers who show no symptoms that it is not necessary for them to be tested , but that as soon as symptoms appear they must seek medical attention and be sure to inform the doctor that they were aboard the horizon the preliminary diagnosis for mr cantone had been pneumonia , said ted shiebler , a spokesman for good samaritan hospital he had been treated by his family physician with erythromycin before going to the hospital , but i do n't think the doctor associated that cantone had been on the ship , mr shiebler said dr bernard nash , mr cantone s physician at good samaritan , said that any underlying acute , chronic medical condition heart disease or a condition , like cancer , in which the immune system is compromised could make it more likely that a patient would die from legionnaires' disease mr cantone was a diabetic and was being treated by a cardiologist dr nash said mr cantone s initial blood tests for legionnaires' had been negative , but based on the epidemic of the cruise and how mr cantone s pneumonia presented itself , the likelihood of him having legionnaire s is high autopsy performed mr shiebler said the cantone family asked the hospital to perform an autopsy , which was completed late friday afternoon with postmortem cultures sent to several outside laboratories it will be two weeks from monday , mr shiebler said , before we 'll know whether or not mr cantone had legionnaires' disease none of the passengers who were ordered off the horizon in bermuda last week are among those with either confirmed or suspected cases many passengers were bitter about the way the ship s officers and celebrity cruise officials handled the situation some said they were lied to , told that the ship had been cleared by public health officials before boarding on thursday , the company s senior vice president , al wallack , issued a statement acknowledging that the passengers were sorely disappointed , and saying , we understand their bitterness and frustration company officials said they had acted in good faith and that federal health authorities had not recommended last weekend that the cruise be canceled although the line is refunding all of the fares , which ranged from 1 , 000 to 3 , 000 , a classaction suit seeking 150 million in damages has been filed in federal district court in manhattan
on sept 21 , 1989 , a softdrink delivery truck slammed into a school bus in alton , tex , killing 21 children and injuring dozens of others insurers for the bottling company and the bus manufacturer settled the claims of the victims' families quickly , for an estimated 122 million notwithstanding that early resolution of a case that was never really in doubt , the families' lawyers received at least a third of the settlement in contingency fees by the calculation of prof lester brickman of benjamin cardozo law school , that sum was equal to at least 25 , 000 an hour to each plaintiff lawyer involved in the case , in exchange for what amounted to nothing more than routine legal services such windfalls part of the 13 billion to 15 billion paid annually to american lawyers contingent on their winning a favorable verdict or , more frequently , a settlement have long been tolerated as the price of assuring access to court by those who cannot afford lawyers' hourly fees but perhaps not much longer , given a new attack by a large group of legal scholars ranging along the philosophical spectrum from erwin n griswold to robert h bork simple , ingenious' innovation professor brickman and two other legal experts sponsored by the manhattan institute in washington have devised a system of incentive for early settlements that derek bok , former president of harvard university and onetime harvard law school dean , calls a simple , ingenious way to link fees to the degree of risk actually borne by injury lawyers and the manhattan institute group is asking both the states' highest courts , through petitions filed by the authors' allies across the country , and the american bar association to give the proposal the force of authority barry nace , president of the association of trial lawyers of america , dismisses the proposal as something on the fringe but it has won support in important quarters , and not just from backers of former vice president dan quayle s longtime demand for broad tort reform more than two dozen of the nation s leading lawyers including mr griswold , solicitor general in the johnson administration and himself a former harvard law dean mr bork , whose tenure as a federal appeals judge made him a darling of conservatives , and william p barr , attorney general under president george bush plan to issue a letter today endorsing the approach the letter will ask the bar association s ethics committee to declare it unethical for lawyers to charge contingency fees on settlements that are virtually certain from the start request to courts as well it s no stretch to go from the current ethics code to more precise limits on contingency fees , said one lawyer who follows the work of the ethics committee closely and knows the current members well there s a good chance they 'll accept the idea a nod from the committee would put great pressure on states to adopt the system as their own the ruling would n't be binding , mr griswold said , but i think it would be influential in many courts meanwhile , the authors of the proposal are not waiting for the blessing of the bar association they are going directly to state supreme courts , asking them to adopt the plan as a means of expediting justice and lowering its cost workings of the proposal the system would work this way defendants in civil suits would be guaranteed a chance to make an early settlement offer say , within 60 days if no offer was made , the plaintiffs' lawyers would be free to negotiate fees but if an offer was made and accepted , the compensation to those lawyers would be limited to a reasonable hourly rate or a very modest share of the gross say , 10 percent and if an early settlement offer was made and refused , the offer would become the rock on which contingency fees would be based the elegance of the approach , suggests prof thomas morgan , former dean of emory university law school and now an ethics specialist at george washington university , is that the adversaries themselves would decide where routine accident claims processing ends and highrisk legal battles begin suppose the defense offered 90 , 000 , and the plaintiff declined suppose , too , that the case was later settled for 100 , 000 then the most that the plaintiff s lawyer could charge would be a reasonable hourly fee for work done to the time of the first offer , plus a contingent percentage of the 10 , 000 the difference between the 90 , 000 offer and the 100 , 000 that the lawyer later won in the texas bus accident , the lawyers' cut would have been a small fraction of the 40 million they received huge cut in injury fees the team from the manhattan institute , a conservative policy research organization , argues that by the same token , the earlyoffer dividing line would reduce defendants' incentive to wear down plaintiffs by stalling an early offer of , say , 10 , 000 would yield perhaps 9 , 000 for the plaintiff , after attorney s fees in the absence of an early offer , delivering the same 9 , 000 to the plaintiff later on , when his lawyer typically claims 40 percent of the payout , would cost the defense 15 , 000
washington , april 30 the sierra club , one of the nation s most prominent environmental organizations , is being torn by dissension over legislation that would protect millions of acres of montana s untouched back country but would leave millions of acres more open to logging and other development the club s leaders have guardedly endorsed the proposal , but a significant number of members have criticized the action , accusing the leadership of going too far to compromise in response , the leadership calls the dissidents idealists we have all been having a lot of disagreement over the question , will the real sierra club please stand up \? said margaret hays young , the conservation chairwoman of the club s new york city branch and the wildlife and wilderness chairwoman of its atlantic chapter she is among those who oppose the montana bill on the ground that it would allow logging in pristine , roadless forests but sherm janke , chairman of the club s montana chapter , whose executive committee voted by a narrow margin to support the national leadership , said that to ask that question makes us look like fools mr janke went on we ca n't police ourselves and we ca n't keep our act together , and we look very poorly , at least in the eyes of congress and that is a really high price to pay for this fundamentalism facing a dilemma the dispute exemplifies the kind of dilemma faced by environmental groups during the clinton administration as the avowedly proenvironment administration gropes for new environmental policies founded on consensus , the halfmillionmember sierra club and its allies are having trouble deciding how much to demand of government the sierra club has always been remarkable among large advocacy groups for running itself as a participatory democracy with strong local roots that has also made it among the least likely of environmental groups to accept political compromise for example , it was among those that stubbornly opposed the administration s successful drive to put in place the north american free trade agreement , which many other environmental groups supported the sierra club s committee on public lands did engage in intensive lobbying that resulted in changes to the montana bill before deciding last month that while the bill was imperfect , it was better than none at all scornful dissidents then publicly accused the club s national leaders of putting politics before principle the club s management responded by prohibiting local sierra club leaders from advertising their opposition to the bill , an edict they have flouted , and by warning them to stop using the club s internal electronic mail system to stir up opposition to the bill among the club s most active members some want stronger stand but now , the dissidents in the club say the organization is not taking a strong enough stand against logging and other development in the northern rockies and elsewhere aside from opposing the montana wilderness bill , which has been approved by committees in the house and is awaiting house action , they also recently tried to pass a ballot resolution calling for a total ban on logging on public lands this debate , as well , turned into a nasty split among factions arguing over the club s procedures as well as its policies the dispute over the montana wilderness might not have drawn much public attention had the dissidents not escalated it by posting their objections electronically over the internet computer network , which many environmentalists use to communicate and conduct research other environmental organizations , less well known than the sierra club , have also split over the legislation for example , the greater yellowstone coalition and the montana wilderness association support the bill , but the native forest council and the alliance for the wild rockies reject it some land protected the national forests of montana contain about six million acres without roads the bill would protect more than two million acres , but would leave the rest available for logging , including about a million acres where logging plans have already been prepared by the united states forest service melanie griffin , a sierra club lobbyist in washington , said that if nothing was done to protect the land , developers would continue to encroach on it she cited permit applications by two energy companies to drill for oil and gas near glacier national park , in an area known as badgertwo medicine that the legislation would protect ms griffin and other sierra club staff members said that in approving the legislation , which is sponsored by representative pat williams , a montana democrat , house committees had deleted provisions that were opposed by the sierra club because they would have reduced conservation groups' rights to appeal logging decisions our view is that it is inadequate , but worth passing , said carl pope , the club s executive director 'multiple abuse' but many of the club s local leaders in montana continue to vigorously oppose it as far as i am concerned , the intent of the bill is to release these lands to multiple use , or multiple abuse , as we call it , complained brooks martin , the chairman of the club s headwaters group , one of five groups that make up the montana chapter the sierra club used to oppose bad legislation , not just acquiesce , he said i think that was a good policy then and is a good one now the bill s opponents want to hold out for a broader wilderness bill affecting five states in the northern rocky mountains the sierra club , adopting a twotrack strategy , supports that legislation as well as the montana bill politicians say the broader rockies bill has little chance of passing soon in a decade or so , you might get it done , said representative bruce f vento , the minnesota democrat who heads the house natural resources committee s subcommittee on forests and public lands asked what advice he would give environmentalists who oppose the montana bill , mr vento answered , get real dissent , via computer after the club s leadership endorsed the bill in march , 12 prominent members used the club s computerized mail system to widely distribute a long message castigating the club s leadership the message cited the sierra club s formal policy , adopted by the board last november , of opposing all logging in remaining oldgrowth forests or roadless areas all sierra club entities have a duty and responsibility to aggressively oppose the montana logging bill , which is the antithesis of sierra club forest policy and is an affront to the purposes for which john muir founded the sierra club , said the memorandum , which was signed by david brower , a former executive director brooks martin and woody beardsley , who head the two most active local montana branches of the club , and by several other club leaders , including laura hoehn , a newly elected member of the board ms hoehn said the board might reconsider the montana matter when it meets on may 6 and 7 the decision making entities within the club are not necessarily representing the full

new evidence strongly suggests that the human race migrated from its african cradle to asia nearly one million years earlier than most scientists believed the discovery will force anthropologists to reexamine some longheld beliefs about how and where evolutionary turning points made mankind master of the world in a paper presented yesterday at a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science in san francisco , dr carl c swisher 3d of the institute of human origins in berkeley , calif , reported that skull fragments of homo erectus found some time ago on the indonesian island of java are up to 18 million years old as old as the oldest homo erectus fossils ever found in africa this may mean , he said in an interview , that the early human beings commonly lumped together under the species name homo erectus may have belonged to two or more separate species that evolved independently from a common ancestor details of the evolutionary pathways that led from the earliest hominids of africa to modern homo sapiens sapiens have been enigmas and the source of controversy although most anthropologists believe that the human race originated in africa , the new measurements open the possibility that although man s prehuman ancestors began in africa , different variants of the primate genus homo may have independently evolved in africa , europe and asia homo erectus is the name commonly given to a group of primates many anthropologists believe to be the first entitled to be called human beings from homo erectus evolved homo sapiens and its presentday subspecies , homo sapiens sapiens somewhere along the way , either as an intermediate or an offshoot of the evolutionary line , neanderthals arose , flourished and died out about 35 , 000 years ago but none of the evolutionary connections among human ancestors are clear this is certainly going to prompt a lot of discussion and theorizing , dr swisher said but the disagreements will have to do with interpretation , not the methods by which we determined the new dates they are well established dr swisher and his american and indonesian colleagues , specialists in measuring the ages of rocks , used a new method to date the indonesian fossils the skull fragments came from two sites in central java the first , the skull cap of a child , named the mojokerto child , was found in 1936 near the village of perning two other sets of skull fragments , called meganthropus , were found near sangiran in the late 1970 s anthropologists tentatively assigned all three fossils to the species homo erectus , previously known as pithecanthropus erectus previous rough estimates of the ages of the fossils were mainly based on the geology of the rocks in which they were found this included the presence or absence of fossil species that lived in certain periods of geological history until now , the oldest human remains in asia were believed to be about one million years old by comparison , the oldest human remains in africa were estimated at 18 million years many anthropologists believed that the age difference between the earliest african and earliest asian homo erectus fossils implied that the species got its start in africa and then radiated much later to other continents troublesome theory but this theory has always troubled some scientists for example , homo erectus in africa devised specialized , twofaced stone cleavers and hand axes , collectively known as the acheulean tool kit , that are frequently found at homo erectus sites in africa but not in asia if homo erectus developed in africa , invented these useful tools and then set out to colonize asia , why did he not take his tools along \? if , on the other hand , separate branches of the homo erectus tree evolved simultaneously in africa and asia , as the new fossil dates seem to suggest , this problem would be explained the founders of the asian branch left home before their african cousins had had time to invent acheulean tools the new date of the mojokerto child , dr swisher s group has determined , is about 181 million years , and the sangiran fossils are about 166 million years old the oldest african homo erectus fossils , found at koobi fora in kenya , has been dated at about the same age as the mojokerto child dr swisher and his colleagues did not analyze the fossils themselves but determined the ages of the pumice and other volcanic rock in which the fossils were embedded when they were excavated they used an extremely sensitive argonargon method , by which they measured the ratio of stable argon gas to a slightly radioactive , unstable form of argon in the rock because of the gradual radioactive decay of elements in the rock , the ratio of argon isotopes , or forms , changes very slowly with time , and the degrees of change can be interpreted as ages the method , dr swisher says , yields dates accurate to within about 70 , 000 years , a small margin of error considering the great age of the rock the journal science , which will publish the report on the java fossils tomorrow , is also publishing comments from other scientists on the achievement dr francis brown , a geologist at the university of utah , said that he was sure the date of the rock was accurate but that there was always a possibility that old rock could have been mixed with younger rock embedding the fossils , yielding a false age dr garniss curtis , a member of the research group and dr swisher s former professor , said he had believed for nearly three decades that the java fossils were much older than most scientists at the time believed in the 1960 s , dr curtis applied a dating method called potassiumargon \( based on the slow radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium to argon \) to rock that had contained the child s skull cap and had found an age of 19 million years but because the method was much less accurate than the new argonargon method , his result was generally dismissed science also quoted dr curtis as saying , anthropologists did n't want to see anything that old from java , because it would conflict with the theory that homo erectus radiated from africa nearly one million years after the species appeared since the first fossil hominid was discovered in java in 1891 , a profusion of scientific names has been assigned to various human remains that may or may not all belong to the species homo erectus the first java fossil was initially named anthropopithecus erectus , or upright manape , and then renamed pithecanthropus erectus , or upright apeman similar human remains found in java have been given such names as pithecanthropus dubius , pithecanthropus robustus , meganthropus , which was renamed australopithecus palaeojavanicus and homo erectus ngandongensis \( soloensis \) fossils found in china of a species once popularly known as peking man are also believed to have represented the homo erectus line , as do some fossils found in europe the peking bones disappeared in world war ii asked whether it would be possible to date the soil from which the chinese homo erectus fossils were taken , dr swisher said it was doubtful the argonargon method requires volcanic rock , he said , and the sites where homo erectus has been found in china do not contain volcanic rock photo dr carl c swisher 3d with a model of homo erectus found on the indonesian island of java \( associated press \) \( pg a18 \) map of indonesia showing locations of sangiran and mojokerto sites \( pg a18 \)
the alvin ailey american dance theater , whose new season runs through jan 1 , never fails to make its openingnight gala a special celebration other benefit audiences will offer a round of applause , polite or otherwise , but ailey viewers , always made to feel part of a family , cheer the dancers on more than loudly the company s opening on wednesday night at city center \( 131 west 55th street , manhattan \) was no exception and there was even a rousing revival devoted to the idea of celebration carmina burana in john butler s choreographed version of carl orff s familiar choral paean to earthly delights unfortunately , only the benefit audience will have had the thrill of hearing the stunning performance that came from the soprano harolyn blackwell , as well as the outstanding work of the baritone donnie ray albert and the tenor gregory hopkins here was drama and technique combined and personified all three singers seemed to spur the dancers' own rhythmic vitality in a work that is nearly all pounding rhythm like the singers , who stood at the edge of the proscenium frame , the vocal chorus at the rear of the stage and the pit orchestra , spiritedly conducted by carmen deleone , will be replaced by tape at future performances such are the ways of arts financing , a topic that inevitably found its place in the evening s introductory remarks by patricia and philip laskawy , the benefit chairmen mr laskawy , the chairman of the ailey board , went out of his way to thank philip morris for its support and noted that judith jamison , who succeeded ailey after his death , was celebrating her fifth year as artistic director ms jamison , resplendent in a long gold tail coat designed by geoffrey holder , dedicated the season to lula e cooper , ailey s mother , who died earlier this year , and to the female dancers and choreographers associated with the company she also paid tribute to mr butler , who died in 1993 and whose works \( especially portrait of billie \) have been staples of the ailey repertory carmina burana is nonetheless one of his most problematic orff s 1937 setting of poems and songs by carousing 13thcentury monks is no longer derided as the musical equivalent of purple prose or perhaps its purpleprose aspect accounts for its current popularity it is rather that the superheated rhythms overwhelm the dancing , although the ailey casts , both now and from 197375 , have never held back on energy butler s approach in 1959 \( the ballet was created for the new york city opera \) was to stylize the action rather than to illustrate the latin words he did so through a mixture of ballet and modern dance it is rare to find dancers who have the right combination of classical line and the seamlessness of modern dance modern dancers executing ballet badly can do in a work like carmina burana , and the current group of men do not look very happy in the adagio partnering but the two female soloists , toni pierce and elizabeth roxas , show off the fine centered classical silhouette that butler demands their partners , leonard meek and don bellamy , shine differently through the fierce intensity of their solos this quartet of dancers , placed in relief against six couples , is given the work s central dramatic episode , a scene of nasty wifeswapping the remainder of the piece is plotless , although butler strikingly captures the underlying idea of orff s secular cantata from the start the dancers rush on in monk s robes , which they promptly shed orff s inspiration , in fact , was the rejection of asceticism by wandering students and monks called goliards the poems from a bavarian monastery that were his source speak rather of the pleasures of the flesh butler s structure is that of the score symbolic slide projections signal the theme of each section , spring , tavern , and court of love none of this runs very deep although offer zaks and maria barrios , whose contemporary chamber ballet of caracas was associated with butler , have produced a vibrant staging the ailey dancers , in their power , give it a spectacular tinge credit must also go to tony tucci s lighting and the striking reds and yellows of the costumes , supervised by barbara forbes what does run deep is revelations , ailey s masterpiece set to spirituals even a foolproof work can receive an exceptional performance desiree vlad ,

washington , feb 10 the senate tonight approved spending 10 billion , mostly for los angeles earthquake victims and military operations abroad , but only after california s agitated lawmakers and a looming snowstorm induced the senators to end a twoday feud over whether to cut other spending to pay for it after a string of attacks on parts of the bill that do not deal with disasters highway grants , world bank contributions , military spending and obscure federal programs the senate voted 85 to 10 to add the measure s costs to the federal deficit , as had been proposed in the first place the bill now goes to a housesenate conference to resolve a 300 million difference between the senate bill and the house version , passed last week the two versions are almost identical both declare an emergency , allowing the government to increase the deficit by 77 billion to aid victims of the los angeles earthquake and 12 billion for pentagon operations in bosnia , iraq , somalia and haiti past disaster an issue the house version grants an additional 750 million for past disasters the los angeles fires and midwest floods of last summer and for relocating a freeway damaged in the 1989 earthquake in the san francisco area the senate bill would spend about 105 billion on those disasters also tucked away in the senate bill is another emergency expense 1 million to hire lawyers to defend senators who are accused by their staff members of civil rights violations or other types of violations as was true on wednesday , the first day of debate on the relief bill , practically none of those expenses were debated today in fact , save a debate on the pentagon allotment and a gentlemanly protest by senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa , of the lawyers' expenses , everyone agreed that the measure should be passed intact as soon as possible what spurred disagreement , between a solid majority of the senate and a small bloc of dissidents , was whether all the expenses in the bill were genuine emergencies and whether they should be financed by increasing the deficit in any case there is no question these emergencies are legitimate and the need of relief is real , the republican leader , senator bob dole of kansas , said of the disaster provisions in the bill the question is simple are we going to ring up another 10 billion on uncle sam s credit card \? mr dole and several other senators john mccain , republican of arizona , and john kerry of massachusetts and russell d feingold of wisconsin , both democrats tried to persuade the senate to cut back the deficit expense , either by paring the bill itself or by making other cuts in the budget senator bob kerrey , a nebraska democrat , had taken the same tack on wednesday , without success the efforts today efforts were beaten back mostly through the acid oratory and parliamentary skills of the democratic chairman of the appropriations committee , robert c byrd of west virginia mr byrd , whose mastery of the senate rules is well known , raised a procedural point to derail mr dole s attempt to approve about 50 billion in cuts in spending over five years and when mr mccain proposed to kill socalled highway demonstration projects with a price tag of 203 million widely derided , even within congress , as political pork mr byrd had another tactic he produced two letters that mr mccain had sent to the appropriations committee in 1991 , seeking highway grants for his home state mr mccain s amendment failed , 72 to 23 i thought it would be good for the senate to have this matter called to the attention of the senate , mr byrd said then addressing mr mccain , he added he is very considerate of the taxpayers when it comes to financing projects in other states , but he supports such projects in his own state that led senator phil gramm , republican of texas , to leap to mr mccain s defense , noting that the demonstration projects that mr mccain wanted to cut included 26 million in arizona if the senate voted this afternoon for building a cheese plant on the moon , i would no doubt vote against it , he said but if the senate decided , in its collective lack of wisdom , to build a cheese factory on the moon , i would want a texan to design that cheese factory mr mccain , he argued , could rightly seek to eliminate a wasteful program even as he tried to snare some of its benefits for his constituents that was too much for senator barbara boxer , democrat of california , who had urged lawmakers with increasing urgency to stop debating and approve the earthquake aid for her state pointing to poignant photographs of quake devastation on an easel beside her desk , she said we 're now talking about cheese factories on the moon i want to bring this back to the ground

portland , ore in trying to deport lydia oluloro , the federal government has presented a simple case a native of a tiny nigerian village , mrs oluloro came to oregon in 1986 and lied when she said she would stay no longer than her oneyear tourist visa allowed mrs oluloro , who works as a janitor for 625 an hour and says she loves the oregon rain , concedes the government its basic point but she has raised a defense that seizes on a growing international human rights issue and , if successful , could set a precedent for other asylum seekers a mother of two americanborn girls , ages 5 and 6 , mrs oluloro says they face the certainty of genital mutilation by her relatives in nigeria if she is deported the ancient ritual , frequently referred to as female circumcision and widely practiced in many african countries and parts of the middle east , has been condemned by human rights advocates and health professionals in the west as barbaric and unsafe it entails cutting away some part of a girl s genitalia before the onset of puberty to thwart sexual appetite and so maintain her virginity and enhance her appeal as a marital partner 'these are american girls' federal immigration officials say this is the first time that the prospect of genital mutilation has been raised as a ground for asylum , which by law is generally granted only if the applicant can prove a wellfounded fear of persecution based on race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership in a particular social club i do n't want them to get cut , mrs oluloro said of her daughters , shade , 6 , and lara , 5 , because these girls are american girls they are not like african girls it would be a horrible thing for them mrs oluloro s unusual argument in support of her bid for asylum has been advanced against a backdrop of an ever increasing number of asylum requests 150 , 000 in the last year alone there is now a backlog of 330 , 000 people trying to win american asylum , and advocates of a tight immigration policy in particular fear that creating precedents like the one sought by mrs oluloro would add many thousands to the list lifetime of pain mrs oluloro , who is now 32 and lives in portland , says she herself was required by her relatives in ilobu , the little nigerian village where she lived as a girl , to submit to the ritual when she was about 4 years old the result , she says , has been a lifetime of intermittent pain , particularly during birth of her two daughters she says her relatives in nigeria have already told her that if her girls are to avoid being shunned , they too must undergo the ritual , which in most cases entails removal of the clitoris and the labia minora with a knife or a razor blade , generally without anesthetic the procedure is often performed by female elders , who in the most extreme cases also stitch together the external labia , leaving only a tiny opening for urination and menstrual discharge before a woman s wedding night , the stitching is removed many women who endure the procedure later experience not only an absence of sexual sensation but also infections , recurring pain , particularly during intercouse , and painful , dangerous childbirth report by state department nigerian government officials , who have expressed opposition to the practice , say their country s culture is not such that mrs oluloro should fear her daughters' being required to submit to the ritual if she returns with them a report issued last month by the state department , however , suggests otherwise the report , on human rights abuses against women around the world , said that in predominantly christian southern nigeria , mrs oluloro s native region , virtually all young girls were still subjected to genital mutilation , as were about half the girls in the muslimmajority north in all , the report estimated , there are now as many as 110 million women in the world whose genitalia have been mutilated mrs oluloro has won support from feminists and human rights advocates across the the united states , but none from her former husband , emanuel oluloro they divorced last year mrs oluloro arrived from nigeria eight years ago to join him here but mr oluloro , in the united states on an extended work visa , or green card , never completed the paperwork that would have made her residency legal in court papers filed before their divorce , she said her life with him in portland had been torment , accusing him of spousal rape and of frequently abusing her in other ways she has been awarded custody of the children , although he has said he would still like to have them mr oluloro did not respond to requests for an interview but he has denied abusing his wife and during a hearing in february before the immigration judge who is considering the deportation case against her , he said that she had previously supported ritualized mutilation and that her change of heart had coincided with the government s move to deport her she denies that excruciating alternatives by mrs oluloro s account , a deportation order would pose an anguishing choice either take her children with her to nigeria , where she says they face mutiliation , or leave them with her former husband , who she says is abusive i will take my kids if i am forced to go , she said they are my life , my best friends
bonn , feb 10 nato s threat to use air strikes to stop the strangulation of sarajevo has stood since august but with its ultimatum on wednesday , which gave serbian forces 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons from around the bosnian capital or face nato bombing , all members of the alliance now seem ready , for the first time , to make good on the threat if the serbs disregard it nato has finally made a credible threat to use bombs to stop the violence in sarajevo , one german official in chancellor helmut kohl s office said the remark spoke volumes about the earlier policy and about the shift that has taken place on both sides of the atlantic about the need for united states involvement last may , france , britain , and most of the other european allies rebuffed an american plan to use air strikes against serbian military targets and lift the weapons embargo against the muslimdominated bosnian government , which was suffering the most from the war there a warning in august but the fighting went on , and last august the allies came around to issuing a threat to use air power if attacks against civilians continued now , they say , they really mean it what brought them to this point , european and american officials say , were two things the europeans were tired of keeping thousands of troops in the united nations peacekeeping force in bosnia when they could only look on helplessly at almost daily atrocities , trying to get food and medicine through to civilians trapped , like them , in a war that none of the combatants yet wanted to end europeans and americans were aware that letting the serbs go unpunished for ignoring earlier threats could have fatal consequences for the credibility of an alliance they all still believe is the best security framework to insure a safe transition from cold war to cooperation with the new democracies to their east a more careful approach this time , the clinton administration carefully prepared the ground for the strategy it urged on its allies , instead of coming to them as secretary of state warren christopher did last may with a proposal for which they were not ready mr clinton worked the telephones with president francois mitterrand of france , prime minister john major of britain and chancellor kohl peter tarnoff , the under secretary of state for political affairs , and charles redman , the american envoy to the balkan peace talks , met with european officials on wednesday to talk not only about military moves but also about diplomatic steps that are to follow to try to bring about a peace settlement the shift in the european attitude began with nato meetings last aug 2 and 9 , when the united states persuaded its allies that threatening the serbs with action might have some effect on the battlefield in fact , a serbian offensive in the mountains southwest of the city was halted , and attacks on sarajevo did diminish , for a while brussels summit meeting but by the end of the year , it was clear that mere words were not enough , as mr clinton told other nato leaders at the alliance summit meeting in brussels on jan 10 and 11 it was then , according to senior german officials , that the british and french , who together provide about 10 , 000 of the troops in the united nations force in bosnia , began to indicate a growing conviction that the mission was a mockery and that it was pointless to continue unless something drastic happened to change things after unsuccessfully trying to persuade the united states to put pressure on bosnia to accept partition , the french decided that the european union could not deal with the bosnian problem alone and that they could work with the united states to use nato leverage on it massacre in sarajevo market it was a frenchamerican proposal that carried the day in brussels on wednesday what tipped the balance was the killing of 68 people by a mortar shell fired at the sarajevo market over the weekend the massacre revived public revulsion all over europe it still took the allies 14 hours to agree to the proposal , and clearly most of them hope that they do not ever have to drop a single bomb if the serbs comply with the nato ultimatum and withdraw their guns 124 miles from sarajevo within 10 days , and no further shots are fired into the city , the allies may not have to act if they do , european officials say , they may yet regret it bombing could be the first step to direct involvement in the war britain and canada , in particular , fear retaliation against the united nations forces and the greatest casualty could be the relationship the united states and its allies are trying to build with a democratic russia mr kohl was among western leaders who spoke with president boris n yeltsin to try to explain the nato decision before it was made , officials here said , but russia went ahead and called a meeting of the united nations security council today in displeasure we do n't want to lose the russians over bosnia , one european official here said but many officials on this side of the atlantic believe nato has taken a step toward success by making clear to aggressors that they thumb their noses at the western allies at their own peril

weeds enclosing it but in mcnair s childhood it was where makebelieve super bowls were won and where the neighborhood youth would gather and play football long into the evening , strolling home afterward , kicking robustcolored fall leaves as the sun would turn copper and less than a mile from the arena , around the curve , is mcnair s home where his mother , lucille , the single greatest inspiration in his life , his role model and best friend , still lives lucille mcnair is 45 years old she has eyes full of wisdom and her smile is warm and inviting she is proud of her five sons she

a month before the celebratory 25th new york city marathon , the celebration of the city s improbable success story got under way yesterday , with , among other things , the formal unveiling of the official marathon tshirt for a race that depends on 10 , 000 volunteers , this is no small matter as the marathon s founder , fred lebow , once put it in explaining how the new york road runners club was able to attract such a corps of volunteers never underestimate the power of a free tshirt mindful that the 25th milestone would be lure aplenty , the organizers pulled out none of the designer stops this year indeed , compared with with recent eyecatching versions emblazoned with bright multicolored art , the 1994 shirts are decidedly bland a simple blueonwhite logo relieved by a single small splash of big apple red still , the logo includes the magic words , 25th anniversary , and never mind that the 25th anniversary \( and the opportunity for renewed celebration \) will not come until 1995 , 25 years after the first race , in 1970 alan steinfeld , the club s president , defended the apparent discrepancy at a news conference at chemical bank headquarters the actual anniversary of the first race was in september , so we 're in our 25th year whatever the anniversary , steinfeld and his fellow organizers seem determined to make the 25th new york city marathon a truly remarkable event pretty much what it has been for the past several years there will be the usual 27 , 000 or so runners from dozens of countries on nov 6 led by the usual international raft of worldclass marathoners , among them the last three men s winners , andres espinosa of mexico , willie mtolo of south africa and salvador garcia of mexico the women s field has five of last year s first six finishers , and there are still hopes for a dream matchup between last year s winner , uta pippig of germany , and lisa ondiecki , who set the course record in 1992 so far neither has said no greta waitz , the ninetime winner , has said maybe , and bill rodgers , a fourtime winner , said not for a while maybe i 'll run in the 50th farfetched \? so is the marathon in her inspirational talks to school children , zoe koplowitz , the 47yearold woman with multiple sclerosis who is known for finishing the marathon last , said she describes herself and other members of the achilles track club for disabled athletes as visual reminders of the marathon principle nothing in life is impossible
