most restaurants intent on improvement make do with makeovers , repainting walls , rethinking menus and , by the current fiats of fine dining , unveiling arrays of small plates they seldom relocate , at least not unless there s a feud with landlords or a plumbing crisis on a par with the poseidon adventure a change of address is too potentially unsettling to regulars , too potentially ruinous to the delicate chemistry that makes a place work tocqueville and the tasting room , two downtown favorites with devoted followings and menus that emphasize the greenmarket , took the risk anyway like lawyers who have just made partner or winners on america s next top pharmaceutical researcher , they converted good fortune into roomier real estate and they wagered that whatever part of their charm they owed to their intimate settings paled beside virtues that would be served by or at least survive newer , bigger stages they were n't wrong then again , they were n't entirely right tocqueville did n't go far from one end of the block of 15th street east of fifth avenue to the other the short distance , however , belies the extent of the effect in its original location , tocqueville s artfully composed dishes came as impressive surprises given the cramped , trapezoidshape room , whose big windows gave it the slightest inflection of a sidewalk cafe tocqueville now has a proper vestibule , beyond which lies a proper lounge area , beyond which lies a proper dining room with yards of wavy silk hanging dramatically , like stage curtains , over a passageway to the kitchen in other words , tocqueville screams serious restaurant where it once only whispered those words the adjustment of volume leads to a readjustment of expectations , and the pricey food seems only as good as it should be , given the refinement of the air around it the uneven caliber of servers stands out some of them struggle through recitations of a dish s ingredients or , when pouring sauce at the table , dribble it over the edge of a plate why attempt such fussiness if you ca n't ace it \? tocqueville , which received two stars from william grimes in the new york times shortly after it opened in 2000 , remains a haven of considerable pleasures , thanks to the high standards and palpably committed efforts of its chef , marco moreira , who owns the restaurant with his wife , joann makovitzky whether the dish is wild salmon wrapped in savoy cabbage , lobster with spaghetti squash and a saffron emulsion , or roasted chicken with morels and a parsnip pur \? mr moreira s kitchen can be counted on to make the meat or seafood as tender as can be and to give it lively company in a city too enamored of pork three ways or multiple meditations upon lamb , tocqueville s beef twofer nonetheless proved delightful poetic in name and approach , it comprised a small 60second sirloin seared on one side , nearly bloody on the other and a 24hour rib pot roast with a contrasting , decadently spongy texture the sauce on the rib meat had a hint of bitter chocolate , while parsnips on the plate carried currents of vanilla tocqueville s eurocentric wine list has interesting selections its desserts , though , can be precious a toasted sesame pudding with an elderflower and shiso consomm \? omes to mind and it did n't have its act together at lunch , when the front door went unattended , cod was mushy and an ostensibly trufflebedecked risotto lacked flavor in terms of service , the relocated version of the tasting room , which more than tripled in size by moving from its 25seat east village nook to a hodgepodge of casual rooms in nolita , almost never had its act together during recent visits there was waiting and more waiting for bottles of white wine to be chilled on the spot for dishes to be cleared for more food to arrive maybe the restaurant was n't ready to grow this much larger the new space is a drag , but lost coziness is n't the culprit found ugliness is in the rear room , the whiteness of the walls and shape of the ceiling suggest a hastily erected tent , and the clunky artwork could easily be on loan from an elementary school when crowded , the room is noisy to boot and it s frequently crowded , because many new yorkers rightly appreciate that no restaurant burrows more joyously into the earth or delves more deeply into the forest than the tasting room , which received one star from mr grimes in 2001 its mushroom mania and exaltation of esoteric , exactly identified plants are arguably unrivaled ovoli mushrooms , mousseron mushrooms , tepary beans , tatsoi they were all here and all handled with utmost care , emerging as the most generous and best parts of appetizers and entrees , which can be ordered in small tasting portions or larger sizes but whatever they burnished montauk blackfish in one dish , montauk tilefish in another often had the feel and appeal of afterthoughts the tasting room is like a vegetarian restaurant that wo n't come out of the closet responding to what s available from local producers and to his own formidable energy , the chef and coowner colin alevras changes the menu constantly , hitting highs and lows his crunchy , salty conch fritters were kookily good the tater tots of the sea his heirloom pear and whey soup was gerber s by a different name

or will angola hang on \? 77 danger ! a ball at the feet of mendez as he enters the angola area , but three defenders close on him as well as joao , and he s not able to get the shot off , though it was tantalizingly in his wheelhouse for what seemed like an eternity ! 76 joao reaches high to cut off another corner kick 74 sub forward franco comes out , and forward jose fonseca replaces him for mexico 72 sub rui marques in on defense for the midfielder figueiredo there i spelled it right , just as he s leaving the game 70 rafa fouled , and now a free kick five in the angola wall but marquez lofts it too far for his charging teammate cabrito arellano angola ball ! 69 pardo s corner kick headed over the bar by a defender ! another corner for mexico ! it comes out to edge of the box served up by marquez but joao comes charging out to take the ball out of the air ! what authority he s imposing in his box ! 68 sub for angola , forward mantorras comes on for midfielder mateus a more standard 442 for angola \? are they going for a goal \? 67 bravo , wide open on the left , shoots it right into joao ! a golden chance for mexico , squandered ! 66 i believe that joao ricardo does not presently play for a club team ! how is that possible \? 65 joao ricardo ! joao ricardo ! he leaps to catch a dangerous cross and catches it with one hand as he tumbles to earth ! 63 these angolans can play ! they re controlling the pace now ! multiple tocatoca passes , all connecting in tight space ! 61 akwa just missed ! a long ball over the top , and awka had a step on two defenders in the area chica , the sixyard box but it just went over his head ! 58 free kick by pardo into the mixer ! headed away the last few minutes have been great angola put together a tremendous dozentouch movement that came close to breaking through a little while ago and just now figueiredo shot a screamer over the bar the fans are chanting si se puede ! we ve got a game ! 56 great save joao ricardo ! a breakaway leaves franco open in front , but joao comes charging out to tip the ball away another mexican pounces on the loose ball to shoot , but defender jamba clears it off the line and then joao dives onto another loose ball to end the play 53 sub zinha out for mexico at midfield , replaced by forward jesus arellano 53 this is way too early to be asking this , but at what point does angola start thinking about playing for a draw \? they must believe they have a chance to beat iran and get to 4 points that way but surely it d be a mistake for them to play for a draw unless it s still 00 with like 10 minutes left 50 yellow ze kalanga , running diagonally , slams right into rafa marquez and is booked for his efforts 49 pardo gets a corner in that franco just misses he wants a penalty for being pulled down , but no ! corner goes for nothing 46 no changes as we start the second half but a correction both i and the univision announcers were wrong to say that jamba had received a yellow before it was andre who got it so jamba is still available for angola s last group game more halftime note to tom i was going for spanish , not portuguese just before this gives me a chance to say how much i miss tony tirado he was the announcer on univision in the 70s and 80s he was brilliant his descriptions of mexico 86 are seared in my mind forever he loved synonyms a ball wasn t merely a pelota , it was also an esferico , a ballon soccer was both futbol and balompie teams were equipos and conjuntos and selecciones and arrancas and so on and so on it was an absolute joy to listen to his play by play , as little of it as i may have actually understood halftime time to check the comments yes , asher in new york , we are expecting a game of this ! collette , also in new york , writes in to suggest that it might be interesting to compare the socioeconomic differences between the fan bases for the world cup and the us open which us open \?

42 angola come pretty close ! an innocent header is sent just wide of the post by akwa , who was in the midst of three defenders marquez looks distraught angola are playing about as well as mexico , and the 00 score is a fair barometer of what s happening on the field 40 yesterday lavolpe called for his players to play today for a full 90 minutes the way they played in the second 45 minutes against iran well , they ve played pretty well today so far , but they ve been less than deadly in the offensive zone they ve had their chances , but joao ricardo has been equal to the task they ll have to do better if they want to get 3 points today 38 sanchez misplays the ball , passing it over the head of salcido and out of bounds and then he has the nerve to ask his teammates to calm down ! 36 zinha being tackled after taking on three angolans , and as he goes down he grabs loco in what seems like a judo hold falta si , senor ! 35 corner angola punched out by sanchez ! still no really threatening chances for angola 33 great save by joao ricardo ! he dives to break up a dangerous cross , then has it cleared at the last moment by kali ! joao man of the match so far \? 32 free kick angola ! from 25 yards out five in the wall but it s headed out by akwa , who was cutting across the middle 31 not to be confused with taco de ojo , the mexican term for eye candy , as in a pretty girl it refers to the kind of taco you can order in a few places on either side of the border , where they make tacos out of , you guessed it an acquired taste 30 some pretty taquitos by mexico that s their term for heel passes they ve done a number of them today 25 oops my bad the comments are working fine 24 seems there s some kind of snag in the comments section that makes it impossible to post we ll work on it in the meantime , use the email address 22 corner for angola ! they ve had the ball 48 percent of the time , the stats say , and they are indeed holding their own but none of their chances are at all dangerous this corner goes for naught as well but wait ! figuereido takes a long shot that goes only five or six feet over the bar 20 the mexicans in the stadium are singing cielito lindo now figuereido is on the floor he was knocked over by franco , but honestly , it does not look like it should hurt maybe figuereido fell awkwardly now he walks off he ll be all right 16 unfancied angola , playing well , but still back on their heels most of the angola players perform in the extremely modest domestic league and now they ve given up another free kick in a dangerous spot mendez took a dive , seems to me , and now the angolans must put four in the wall pardo to take far post great play by joao ricardo to dive over his own player and knock it away from the far post with one hand as he went sprawling ! how long can the black impalas hold out \? 13 yellow to delgado of angola for bowling over his man 28 yards from the goal free kick mexico it hit the goalpost ! rafa marquez , the captain , the central defender , el kaiser de michoacan , hit a bouncer that struck the post past the diving joao ricardo ! 12 angola moving skillfully in tight spaces through the midfield nothing comes of it , but an impressive display of sangfroid 10 jamba takes down franco in a dangerous spot just outside the area free kick , mexico ! five in the wall ! pardo shoots but joao ricardo moves over and handles it calmly angola dodge a bullet ! 8 joao ricardo takes a goal kick , accompanied by the sound of thousands of fans shouting the customary vulgar cry used against visiting keepers taking goal kicks at mexican league games this is like being at a cruz azul game ! vamanos los cementeros ! 6 angola get the ball downfield nicely figuereido bounces a week shot to keeper sanchez , but not bad for the africans so far 3 ze kalanga goes down he was in a collision with a mexican player , didn t see who , and seemed to get a stray shoulder in the groin but he s up and ok now play resumes 2nd minute salcido ! ! ! ! ! he shoots from 25 yards away and puts it just over the bar ! ! ! ! muy cerca para mexico ! ! ! a clarification on the mexican formation it seems zinha and franco will be playing in forward positions , just behind bravo so it is a more attackminded setup than it seems to be on paper mexico , in white , to kick off angola , in red , to defend it s on !  we are back ! mexico in the tunnel they re wearing white shirts with a green horizontal stripe across the chest , and green shorts angola are in red shirts with horizontal yellow and black bars , and black shorts both teams look relaxed for as they emerge for the procession onto the field now they stand for the anthems the mexican national hymn , and everyone in the stadium seems to be singing ! the players stand as always in that distinctive mexican way holding their arms out and their hand saluted over their heart in the stands , fans wear aztec headdresses , wrestling masks , serapes , sombreros they re having the time of their lives ! and now the angolan anthem the players sing a surprising number of people are singing along in the stadium as well it s a pretty song in the stands , their fans wave the red and black national flag  all right , back to this game the referee will be shamsul maidin of singapore the temperature as night falls in cloudy hanover is 15 degrees , about 60 fahrenheit good footballing weather the lineups ! lavolpe s mexico will be without their venerable star striker jared borgetti , who has a pulled thigh muscle he may or may not be ready for the portugal match on wednesday they come out in what looks like a 532 surely one of those players listed as a defender will play as a midfielder g sanchez oswaldo d salcido carlos \( carrying a yellow \) d marquez rafael \( c \) d osorio ricardo d pineda gonzalo d mendez mario m torrado gerardo \( carrying a yellow \) m zinha m pardo pavel f franco guillermo f bravo omar for the angola of luis oliveira goncalves , a cautious 451 g joao ricardo d jamba \( carrying a yellow \) d kali d loco \( carrying a yellow \) d delgado m figueiredo m andre \( carrying a yellow \) m mateus m mendonca m ze kalanga f akwa \( c \)  hello again , soccer fans around the world ! a big game today in hanover mexico debuted with a 31 victory over iran , and angola started off with a respectable 10 loss to portugal so now the situation is this if mexico win today , they would clinch a spot in the octavofinals \( or round of 16 , if you prefer \) angola , for their part , must win to have a chance of advancing , although a draw would keep them alive as well the mexican team is a fascinating one coach ricardo lavolpe angered many in mexico when he left the highscoring but volatile striker cuauhtemoc blanco off the world cup squad and selected instead a couple of relatively recently naturalized citizens , zinha naelson , originally from brazil , and guillermo franco , originally from argentina zinha especially has felt the sting of many mexican fans disdain for using such players , but he scored a key goal in the victory over iran also starring in that game , goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez , whose father had died suddenly just three days earlier and whose teammates rallied to support him in very stirring fashion before , during and after the match the sight of sanchez s teammates mobbing him after the final whistle , as well as that of ecuador s ivan kaviedes celebrating a goal by donning a spiderman mask to pay tribute to a teammate who died last year , are two of the most memorable emotional moments of the tournament so far but now , permit me to address the question that victor mather raised duing his play by play of the hollandivory coast match earlier this afternoon what s the best soccer commercial \?

people almost always think they are too smart for prof brian wansink s quirky experiments in the psychology of overindulgence when it comes to the slippery issues of snacking and portion control , no one thinks he or she is the schmo who digs deep into the snack bowl without thinking , or orders dessert just because a restaurant plays a certain kind of music to a person , people will swear they are n't influenced by the size of a package or how much variety there is on a buffet or the fancy name on a can of beans , but they are , dr wansink said every time he has the data to prove it dr wansink , who holds a doctorate in marketing from stanford university and directs the cornell university food and brand lab , probably knows more about why we put things in our mouths than anybody else his experiments examine the cues that make us eat the way we do the size of an ice cream scoop , the way something is packaged and whom we sit next to all influence how much we eat his research does n't pave a clear path out of the obesity epidemic , but it does show the significant effect one s eating environment has on slow and steady weight gain in an eightseat lab designed to look like a cozy kitchen , dr wansink offers free lunches in exchange for hard data he opened the lab at cornell in april , after he moved it from the university of illinois at urbanachampaign , where he spent eight years conducting experiments in cafeterias , grocery stores and movie theaters dr wansink presents his work to dieticians , food executives and medical professionals they use it to get people to eat differently his research on how package size accelerates consumption led , in a roundabout way , to the popular 100calorie bags of versions of wheat thins and oreos , which are promoted for weight management although food companies have long used packaging and marketing techniques to get people to buy more food , dr wansink predicts companies will increasingly use some of his research to help people eat less or eat better , even if it means not selling as much food he reasons that companies will make up the difference by charging more for new packaging that might slow down consumption or that put seemingly healthful twists on existing brands and they get to wear a halo for appearing to do their part to prevent obesity to his mind , the 65 percent of americans who are overweight or obese got that way , in part , because they did n't realize how much they were eating we do n't have any idea what the normal amount to eat is , so we look around for clues or signals , he said when all you see is that big portions of food cost less than small ones , it can be confusing although people think they make 15 food decisions a day on average , his research shows the number is well over 200 some are obvious , some are subtle the bigger the plate , the larger the spoon , the deeper the bag , the more we eat but sometimes we decide how much to eat based on how much the person next to us is eating , sometimes moderating our intake by more than 20 percent up or down to match our dining companion much of his work is outlined in the book mindless eating why we eat more than we think \( bantam \) , which will be published on tuesday the book is his fourth over all , but his first directed at a general audience it is peppered with his goofy , appealing midwestern humor and practical diet tips but the most fascinating material is directly from his studies on university campuses and in test kitchens for institutions like the united states army an appalling example of our mindless approach to eating involved an experiment with tubs of fivedayold popcorn moviegoers in a chicago suburb were given free stale popcorn , some in mediumsize buckets , some in large buckets what was left in the buckets was weighed at the end of the movie the people with larger buckets ate 53 percent more than people with smaller buckets and people did n't eat the popcorn because they liked it , he said they were driven by hidden persuaders the distraction of the movie , the sound of other people eating popcorn and the pavlovian popcorn trigger that is activated when we step into a movie theater dr wansink is particularly proud of his bottomless soup bowl , which he and some undergraduates devised with insulated tubing , plastic dinnerware and a pot of hot tomato soup rigged to keep the bowl about half full the idea was to test which would make people stop eating visual cues , or a feeling of fullness people using normal soup bowls ate about nine ounces the typical bottomless soup bowl diner ate 15 ounces some of those ate more than a quart , and did n't stop until the 20minute experiment was over when asked to estimate how many calories they had consumed , both groups thought they had eaten about the same amount , and 113 fewer calories on average than they actually had last week in his lab seven people were finishing lunch while watching a bigscreen tv cartoons on the tv served as a distraction so participants would not be influenced by what and how much those nearby ate
upward trend after starting the season with an unimpressive 30yard effort , dolphins running back ronnie brown , above , has improved each week , gaining 90 yards last week against the titans today s game against the texans should be the first chance for the miami offense to break out , and brown , with wide receiver chris chambers , should be the biggest beneficiaries lone star cowboys wide receiver terry glenn was expected to have a drop in production this season , but he has stood out as the team s top option despite the addition of terrell owens with owens nursing a broken hand and fending off reporters curious about his recent overdose , glenn may be asked to shoulder more of the load against an awful titans defense , ranked 29th in the league smash mouth the vikings' chester taylor has brought a powerrunning game to the team , with coach brad childress embracing his straightahead running style averaging 25 carries a game through three weeks , taylor will try to be the first back to rush for more than 100 yards against the bills this season running and gunning lost amid a season that has started 03 , browns quarterback charlie frye , above , has rushed for three touchdowns and has increased his passing yardage each week , topping out last week at 298 yards against a tough ravens defense frye should be able to use the secondyear wide receiver braylon edwards as a deep threat against the raiders , a team that has the same record as the browns , but none of the upside photos \( photo by marc serota reuters \) \( photo by andy lyons getty images \)
kerry wood , one of the chicago cubs' top two starting pitchers , and mark redman , scheduled to be a member of the kansas city royals' rotation , have had knee operations ben sheets of the milwaukee brewers left a game in the first inning the other day with an irritated shoulder jerry hairston of the cubs and sean casey of the pittsburgh pirates were hit in the head by pitches none of those players played in a world baseball classic game in developments that critics of the classic would find difficult to believe , those players were actually hurt in spring training through the first round of the inaugural international tournament , no players have been known to be injured the risk of injury was one of the primary arguments made by the critics in baseball and the news media who sought to denigrate the classic some predicted dire consequences for major league teams that contributed players to the tournament division races would be lost so would millions of dollars in salaries some baseball people , however , have taken a more positive view i think that stuff about being injured at the classic is a bunch of hogwash you can get injured anywhere , said doug melvin , general manager of the brewers , a native of canada who rooted for the departed canadian team melvin knows whereof he speaks last week , sheets , the brewers' staff leader and highestpaid player , had to leave a game against the oakland a s , feeling discomfort behind his right shoulder in the same area where a torn muscle ended his season five weeks early last year we 're not thinking it s anything serious , melvin said he did n't feel comfortable enough to continue we 're not so concerned at this point , but you 're always guarded until a doctor looks at him i never feel you 're out of the woods on these things until the guy is back in there pitching sheets was scheduled to see the doctor at the brewers' camp in phoenix yesterday if sheets , the winning pitcher in the goldmedal victory over cuba in the 2000 olympics , had been a member of the united states team in the world baseball classic and sustained the same injury , the critics would have immediately begun crying , i told you so , just as they would have if the other spring training injuries had occurred in the classic but no one seems to be making an issue of the other spring training injuries you ca n't live in fear of an injury when you 're playing the game , melvin said i think the world baseball classic is good for the game melvin said he spoke about it with brewers third baseman corey koskie , who played for canada he said it was exciting , melvin said koskie escaped the classic unscathed , as have all the other players to date carlos delgado , the mets' first baseman , was an ailing member of the puerto rican team , but his elbow tendinitis preceded his trip to puerto rico the team hopes he recovers in time to play in the second round delgado s mets teammate cliff floyd might have a kidney problem , but it has nothing to do with the classic another teammate , kazuo matsui , sustained a minor knee injury the knee injuries to wood and redman were not so minor they required surgery robert fick of the washington nationals needed elbow surgery kip wells of pittsburgh was operated on for a blood clot none of the major leaguers playing in the classic have been hit in the head by a pitch , as hairston and casey were casey had minor swelling above his right eye from the pitch kenny lofton , the los angeles dodgers' new center fielder , was hit on his right knee by a pitch and had to leave the game lofton plays next to j d drew , whose brother stephen , an arizona diamondbacks rookie , hurt his left shoulder sliding headfirst jay gibbons , the baltimore orioles' right fielder , has a sore right hamstring none of these injuries are careerthreatening , but they are serious enough to demonstrate that injuries happen , though not yet in the world baseball classic leiter may be looking for work the eight teams expected to advance to the second round of the world baseball classic have done so , although the united states team made it only after canada shoved it to the brink of elimination buck martinez , the american manager , indicated that he would let game circumstances dictate lineup moves and pitching changes , as opposed to giving everyone playing time that plan probably does not bode well for al leiter , the veteran lefthanded pitcher , who was ineffective against canada after the san francisco giants beat him up in an exhibition game we 'll let the game dictate that more in the second round , martinez said we have an obligation to get these players ready for their respective teams when they go back that was a concern early on now that we 've all been through this first round , we know our goal is to win this tournament i will use the players according to the game situation the second round begins today , with the united states playing japan and mexico playing south korea in anaheim , calif , and cuba playing venezuela and puerto rico playing the dominican republic in san juan , pr giants' competitive bunting on the left side of the plate batting righthanded , noah lowry on the right side , batting lefthanded , steve finley youth \( lowry , 25 \) vs age \( finley , 41 \) , pitcher versus hitter this was the san francisco giants' great bunting contest , and lowry and finley were the finalists , lowry beating all the other pitchers , finley defeating the other hitters they ca n't wait to have the final , manager felipe alou said a week ago you can see those guys and the pressure on them three boxes were placed on the infield , one to the thirdbase side of the pitcher s mound , one to the firstbase side and one up the middle at the cut of the grass contestants , facing a pitching machine , called their shots and bunted 10 to each box whoever gets the most gets the bragging rights , lowry said three days before the final alou said players were backing the finalists with cash they have a benefit , he said the winner is going to present the money to i do n't know what organization besides having fun , what was the purpose of the contest \? to impress guys on the importance of bunting , alou said bunting is a very important offensive weapon it s not defensive lowry looked forward to the final it s going to be fun , he said as a pitcher , you better be able to bunt hopefully , i 'll be up for him i do n't know , though obviously he s a veteran guy , an allaround good player it will be interesting but the final turned out to be anticlimactic poor showing by me , lowry said the veteran got the young guy finley said i only needed 23 bunts to get him he got 4 and it took me 23 to get 5 braves' winning tradition john schuerholz of the atlanta braves , senior general manager in the major leagues , has written a book , built to win a careful , conservative executive , schuerholz takes on the concept of building a team through statistical analysis , as heralded in the popular book moneyball , rather than through traditional judgment and instinctive evaluation as portrayed in that book , schuerholz writes , it is a bogus concept because i know you ca n't make baseball judgments entirely on statistical analysis to build a team although the oakland athletics were the star of michael lewis s book , they have not gone beyond the first round of the playoffs in recent years that s why moneyball proponents point to the 2004 red sox but , schuerholz points out , they became world champions only when they acquired a true closer and bolstered their defense which is not a big part of the 'moneyball' blueprint finally , schuerholz criticizes lewis for suggesting that those in baseball who do n't understand and do n't use the new statistical concepts are , in schuerholz s words , a bunch of dolts photos ben sheets left a brewers game thursday with discomfort behind his right shoulder in the

for another day , herman edwards remained a man in limbo he was not the coach of the kansas city chiefs and was not certain to return to the jets after a week of unrest in the franchise he has coached for five seasons one day after the teams negotiated a compensation package to make edwards the new head coach of the chiefs , discussions between the teams continued late yesterday without a conclusion a chiefs spokesman said that carl peterson , the team s president and general manager , had left kansas city to begin speaking with other coaching candidates to replace dick vermeil , who retired after the regular season carl is on the road and has multiple interviews set this week and into next week , bob moore , the chiefs' director for public relations , said in a telephone interview a lot of guys are involved asked if edwards , a longtime friend of peterson s and a vermeil prot \? , was among the candidates for an interview , moore said no he s not referring to the interviews themselves , moore said , to my knowledge , none of them that i'm aware of are slated in the new york area peterson would hardly need to interview edwards anew he signed edwards as a rookie free agent with the philadelphia eagles in 1977 , hired him as a scout for the chiefs in 1990 and interviewed him for the chiefs' coaching job in 1999 while edwards was an assistant with tampa bay prying away edwards , who has two years left on his deal with the jets , would probably cost the chiefs two draft picks , and peterson could be prolonging negotiations to force the jets to part cheaply with edwards peterson also has a long relationship with terry bradway , the jets' general manager , who worked for the chiefs for nine years , including as the team s vice president for player personnel under peterson if the chiefs pull out of the negotiations , it is unclear whether the jets would want edwards back , despite having him under contract bradway and the jets' owner , woody johnson , have been quiet publicly in recent days while rumors have swirled about edwards s future the team scuttled an 11 am news conference yesterday just two hours before edwards and bradway were scheduled to appear to discuss the team s justcompleted 412 season edwards maintained as recently as tuesday that he intended to return to coach the jets but he is also among the lowestpaid coaches in the nfl , at around 2 million a season neither edwards nor bradway returned telephone calls seeking comment yesterday gary o'hagan , edwards s agent , said yesterday that edwards had been consistent in his desire to coach the jets herman would never quit on the jets he would never do it , o'hagan said in a telephone interview he s under contract he understands that kansas city has spoken to jim fassel , the baltimore ravens' offensive coordinator and the former giants coach and al saunders , who was vermeil s assistant head coach and offensive coordinator fassel , reached by telephone yesterday , would not comment on whether he had spoken with the jets i 've had conversations with several teams , he said my goal is to return as a head coach and go back and win a super bowl saunders spent yesterday interviewing for the coaching job with the houston texans he spent monday in kansas city with peterson and spent tuesday and wednesday with the minnesota vikings , who are looking for a replacement for mike tice the longer the jets and the chiefs are unable to reach a conclusion , the more opportunities other teams have to sign coaches donnie henderson , the jets' defensive coordinator and a possible candidate to replace edwards , is scheduled to interview today with the new orleans saints the jets , meanwhile , continue to drift into an uncertain offseason

when the lobsters were wiped out in the western long island sound almost overnight in september 1999 , it was a devastating bolt from the blue for a 100million industry on the island and in connecticut now the lobstermen have achieved something almost as unlikely winning millions of dollars in compensation for their losses from chemical companies last week , just before the case was to go to trial , the lobstermen reached a tentative settlement in a classaction suit against cheminova , the maker of a pesticide called fyfanon based in wayne , nj the company agreed to pay 125 million the settlement will be taken before judge thomas platt of the united states district court in central islip on monday two manufacturers of a different pesticide that were also named in the suit settled with the lobstermen in december 2004 , agreeing to pay a total of 375 million fyfanon was sprayed widely in new york city and on long island in september 1999 to kill adult mosquitoes and combat a newly emerging public health threat , the west nile virus fyfanon s active ingredient , malathion , is highly toxic to lobsters according to the lawsuit , heavy rains from the remnants of hurricane floyd then washed fyfanon into the sound over a period of a few days , killing off the lobsters and idling several hundred commercial lobstermen since then the lobster population has only slowly recovered , and remains much smaller than before 1999 the tentative settlement relieves gladstone n jones iii , the lobstermen s lawyer , of the need to prove in court that the dieoff was linked to the pesticide lawyers familiar with environmental cases say that establishing such a link is very hard mr jones called the settlement with cheminova a compromise to end a hardfought battle anywhere in the country , these cases are very difficult , and it was unpredictable what the outcome would be , he said a compromise is sometimes better than taking a case like this the final yard the lobster case was further complicated by conflicting scientific opinion at a symposium on the lobster dieoff held at stony brook university in october 2004 , scientists cited high water temperatures , low levels of dissolved oxygen and other pollutants like ammonia and sulfides as possible contributing factors none named malathion as a clear culprit , though several researchers said more study of the chemical s role was needed mr jones , a partner in the law firm jones , verras freiberg in new orleans , said that the research presented at the symposium was flawed and that he had experts ready to testify at the trial that malathion was to blame cheminova denied that its pesticide was responsible for the lobster dieoff a lawyer for the company , christopher kelly of haight , gardner , holland knight in manhattan , said it agreed to settle the suit to avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial and possible appeals he said cheminova had made no admission of liability whatsoever lawyers with experience in the field said that environmental contamination cases present enormous hurdles for plaintiffs , especially when they turn on injuries to people rather than to animals or crops james p rigano , a partner at certilman , balin , adler hyman in hauppauge , said it was extraordinarily rare for such claims to even reach court , much less succeed there proving the connection between exposure to a chemical and a real effect is very , very difficult , given the state of science , mr rigano said the only successful bodily injury actions i have seen were in the movies victor j yannacone jr , of yannacone yannacone in patchogue , said the rigors of assembling and presenting scientific evidence of injuries dissuaded many lawyers from taking such cases you have to have wellorganized evidence , solid scientific data and vigorous advocacy by attorneys who are capable of dealing with both the science and the law , said mr yannacone , a pioneer in environmental law who represented vietnam war veterans exposed to the defoliant agent orange a classaction suit against the makers , including dow chemical and monsanto , was settled for 180 million in 1984 the financial risks of pressing such suits can be large for both the plaintiffs and the lawyers , who must shoulder court costs and get nothing unless they eventually win a settlement mr yannacone said that a groundbreaking 1966 suit he brought against the use of ddt for mosquito control in suffolk county cost me everything i had , 585 , 000 out of pocket most environmental groups cannot afford to sue that way going to court is way beyond our budget , said adrienne esposito , executive director of citizens campaign for the environment in farmingdale when you look at the history , these kinds of cases take years and years , and cost multimillions she added , it has nothing to do with the merit of the cases it is rare for a government agency to positively identify one property as the source of contamination affecting another more often , the evidence is suggestive rather than definitive , making a successful suit unlikely sometimes , though , the evidence is overwhelming in 1994 , northville industries of melville agreed in a consent order to pay 15 million to the state and 10 million to the suffolk county water authority for a huge leak of more than a million gallons of gasoline from a storagetank terminal in east setauket the company , which found and reported the leak in 1987 , also settled for an undisclosed amount with nearby homeowners who sued over vapors entering their homes richard j lippes , a buffalo lawyer who represented homeowners in that case , is now pursuing brookhaven national laboratory on behalf of homeowners in north shirley who say that contamination of soil , air and water from the lab caused elevated rates of rare childhood cancers in their neighborhood their suit was dismissed last year by state supreme court justice mary m warner , who found that contamination from the lab was either too weak or too deep underground to be harmful the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and are awaiting a ruling there is no question that they polluted the community , mr lippes said of the laboratory in a telephone interview that s been documented it s a superfund site , and the place is a mess the question was whether there was any harm to property and health in the neighboring community mr lippes , who represented homeowners in the infamous love canal case in the 1970 s , said he knew of few lawyers who were willing to take on protracted environmental cases our average case takes about six years , he said our longest case was probably as lead counsel for love canal that went 20 years photo equipment stored in huntington by

this may be tuesday afternoon quarterbacking , but we can t resist at the very least , the television station might get a journalism dart for its role in this deal on sunday , the television station kmov in st louis was , near the last minute , able to broadcast the rams seasonopener game , possibly because of none other than claire mccaskill , the democratic opponent of senator jim talent she bought the remaining 100 tickets to last sunday s game , which resulted in the lifting of the nfl blackout rule for the local station for its part , the station broadcast news footage of a press conference where she passed out the tickets to students and a charity she got publicity , thousands of fans saw the game on television live instead of via reruns , the station probably reaped extra ad revenue during the show and the rams won , 1810 but conservative blogs called a foul on what they viewed as the sale of news coverage , with thomas lifson of the american thinker calling for the federal communications commission and the federal election commission to immediately open investigations of this troubling incident
at the village bookstore in pleasantville , the owner , roy solomon , has decided to keep track of the store s frequentbuyer program by stamping cards he gives out , rather than by using a computer database that is because all the software packages he looked at would also automatically keep track of his customers' purchase histories i do n't want to use it , because it will give me a record of every single thing that everybody bought , he said i do n't want to have the records at good yarns bookstore in hastingsonhudson , the manager , amanda lydon , advises new members of the store s frequentbuyer program that it is based strictly on the amount of money they spend , rather than what they buy that s a very important distinction to me , and to our readers , she said it s just a matter of numbers so that we can give them a reward for spending money it s not a way to track what people are reading the stores belong to the american booksellers association , a national network of independent bookstores whose headquarters are in tarrytown besides providing knowledge about the industry and a network of business support , the association is dedicated to protecting the privacy of customers' reading habits from government surveillance that it sees as overly intrusive in response to provisions of the usa patriot act , antiterrorism legislation that congress passed after the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks that could require the disclosure of book purchases , the booksellers association and other bookindustry trade groups joined forces to form the campaign for reader privacy through its member bookstores and other groups , the campaign collected 380 , 000 signatures in two petition drives seeking the amendment of the patriot act s section 215 the most recent petition was presented on capitol hill in september that provision allows the federal bureau of investigation to have access to any business records it needs to protect the country against international terrorism if its request is approved by a judge sitting in the foreign intelligence surveillance court , the fbi could require that a bookstore turn over its records of customers' purchases the proceedings of the court are secret , and the bookstore would be forbidden from revealing that its files had been given to the fbi the number of records sought by the fbi under section 215 is secret william carter , a spokesman for the bureau , said that the statistics are confidential , but that he was not personally aware of any instance in which the provision has been used to obtain bookstore or library records we do n't care about people s reading habits , he said we 're not launching fishing expeditions in libraries the fbi has demanded records from at least one library , in connecticut , under another section of the patriot act independent bookstores exist to provide readers with a range of different ideas , said oren teicher , the booksellers' association chief operating officer , but the specter of hidden government oversight could dampen that debate booksellers are in the business of disseminating information , he said they want to be absolutely certain that they can disseminate as wide a range of information as possible , and want to do absolutely everything to ensure that their customer feels comfortable that that information about whatever titles they may buy is confidential , and is n't necessarily public in forming the reader privacy campaign about two years ago , the booksellers' group joined forces with the american library association , the association of american publishers and the pen american center , a group of writers and editors interested in advancing free expression the four groups together have met with congressional leaders and confer at least every two weeks , said larry siems , director of the freedomtowrite program at pen american judith platt , director of the freedomtoread program at the publishers' association , said the interests of publishers are not always the same as the interests of booksellers or librarians or authors , but in this area i have to say that they are none of us consider reader privacy and other rights protected by the first amendment to be abstract this association represents an industry that could not exist without a free marketplace of ideas it s not an abstract legal concept nor is the issue new to booksellers law enforcement agencies have also sought readers' records from bookstores as part of criminal investigations in 2000 , police officers in thornton , colo , obtained a search warrant under state law to find out the titles of all books that a suspected drug manufacturer bought at the tattered cover bookstore in denver over a month joyce meskis , the store s owner , refused to turn over the records two years later , the colorado supreme court invalidated the warrant , because it thought the potential harm to the bookstore outweighed the police officers' need for the store records while she was fighting the warrant , ms meskis said , the booksellers' association held fundraisers and offered legal advice and moral support we are a reputable business , and law abiding , and to have that happen is disquieting at best , she said it s a situation that few booksellers , fortunately , find themselves in congress was expected to vote to reauthorize section 215 and other patriot act provisions last fall the legislation had been temporarily extended after a senate filibuster in december the house of representatives voted on wednesday to extend the status quo until early march the provisions were set to expire on friday the booksellers' group and the campaign for reader privacy have endorsed a senate version that would limit searches to records pertaining to suspected terrorists and their contacts , but not third parties , and would require the fbi to explain in more detail why it is it is seeking the information on a much simpler , more human level , buying books can be very personal , said ms lydon , the manager at good yarns when you think of books , you think of current events and fiction , but so much of what we sell is in the health category , or the selfhelp category , the teaching categories those things should be private no one needs to know about that photos the good yarns bookstore has a rewards program that tracks how much buyers spend ,

making wine , for many , seems like an art best left to professionals at commercial wineries but two businesses in the county are encouraging oenophiles in the region to experiment with varietals and produce their own blends and while the aspiring vintners may not yet be producing vintage wines , they are revitalizing family traditions that many say had fallen out of favor i used to make wine with my father years ago in the basement , said john dubbioso of thornwood , a customer of myo wine in elmsford , one of two westchester businesses that let customers make wine i had his stuff , but never had the time now , he says , he can once again create his own wine , along with his children and grandchildren it s a family event at myo wine , as well as at the westchester homemade wine center , in yorktown heights , the customers channel their inner mondavis and literally get their hands wet working through the steps of creating wine the sessions at both centers begin in the fall , with the crushing and destemming of california grapes , purchased by the businesses at local wholesale markets customers choose which type of wine they wish to make the only catch is that it has to be red yeast is added to begin fermentation a week later , customers return to press the grapes the wine is then placed into oak barrels to begin aging for several months the third visit , which occurred at both facilities last weekend , is for what is known as racking , in which the fermenting wine is separated from the grape sediment , known as lees , then returned to clean oak barrels for further aging at the homemade wine center , customers were taking part in the process at myo wine the myo stands for make your own the owner , richard mattina , demonstrated the procedure , but he performed the actual racking with staff help these two businesses reflect a growing nationwide interest in making wine , said linda bisson , a professor at the university of california , davis , which has a viticulture and oenology department it gives the illusion of making the wine but with none of the mess , she said frank parisi , a scarsdale resident and customer of myo wine , whose grandparents used to make wine , added that as wine fermented at home , the smell wafted through the house but when you make it here , it stays here , he said carmine corelli , an advertising salesman for tristate media , who owns the homemade wine center , began making wine seven years ago in his garage in yonkers he had had no formal training , but had learned from family members eventually , he said , my friends got interested and their friends got interested , and he began his business there in 2003 , as his customer list grew , he leased a larger space and acquired a license from the new york state liquor authority \( under state law , individuals can make wine for personal use but cannot produce wine for commercial resale and need to obtain bottling permits , mr mattina said \) mr mattina opened his center in 2004 , after years of working as a colorcopying consultant he had what he described as the wine bug and tried some homemade wine with a friend who told me about the warehouse concept after visiting a doityourself winery in new jersey , he said , he studied the idea for three years i created a business plan , looked into financing , learned the winemaking trade and looked into the feasibility of doing it in westchester , he said he leased a 5 , 100squarefoot building in elmsford the costs at the homemade wine center vary , depending on the type and quantity of wine a full barrel , which can yield about 250 bottles , can go as high as 2 , 335 for merlot myo wine charges 2 , 485 per barrel regardless of varietal but at both businesses , barrels can be divided among groups of customers at no extra cost for example , a group of women from across the county is splitting a barrel at myo wine inspired by the movie calendar girls , about older women \( who pose nude on a calendar for charity \) , one of the group , pat roth , an artist from somers , has designed a label with their likenesses without the nudity they are calling their wine donna dieci , italian for 10 women both centers allow customers to experiment with their own mixtures because winemaking is subject to natural variations , there is some risk , especially if the customer has created an untested blend winemaking is an art , mr corelli said if one barrel goes bad , i will try to offer either a discount or a free barrel the next year it is , however , subjective it wo n't necessarily be perfect , especially if you come up with some crazy blend but if it s a straight grape , like merlot or cab , it usually comes out mr mattina said his customers , too , can make any mix , although he creates the actual recipes based on acid and sugar levels and the varietals people have tried things i have n't seen commercially , he said , like blends of zinfandel and syrah with cabernet grapes mr corelli s wine won a silver medal in a new jersey amateur competition , and mr mattina plans to submit his wines for competition but both men emphasize that winemaking is primarily about the experience or , as dan gisolfi , who makes wine at the homemade wine center , said , it s about culture , camaraderie and quality photos carmine corelli owns westchester homemade wine center , in yorktown heights , where customers make their own wine and store it in barrels for aging \( photographs by alan zale for the new york times \)

um , that didn t work if the collapse in president bush s poll numbers is due to a drop in support by conservatives \( which is pretty much unarguable \) and if the conservative blogosphere is representative of bush s conservative base as a whole \( a much more debatable proposition \) , then bush s monday night speech on immigration may have the seemingly impossible effect of making him even more unpopular than he is already bush s staunchest supporters , who are also the fiercest opponents of illegal immigration , are predicting calamity national review editor rich lowry uses the conservatives vilest slur \( clintonian \) to describe bush s immigration policy , which he describes as a proposal that essentially legalizes all the population influx from latin america that has occurred in the past 10 years and any that might occur in the future lowry suggests that the bush presidency is over , if it wasn t already bush has wrecked his political standing , kicking out from under himself the support of his conservative base bush s national guard feint is a sign that the white house thinks conservatives are not just disaffected , but credulous david frum , at his national review blog , agrees that the speech will drive down bush s poll numbers , and in a second post he argues that bush may have just cost republicans the house of representatives with last night s speech , president bush severely worsened the schism in the party over immigration , writes frum , predicting that bush s immigration policy will disillusion conservatives and dampen their turnout in the fall elections the contributors to national review are more frequent critics of bush and his administration than some corners of the conservative blogosphere are , but now it appears that bush has lost even his most loyal blogs ed morrissey of captain s quarters writes , either bush doesn t care about border security , or the white house couldn t coordinate its policy spokespeople to stay on

chances left to salvage his second term after tonight , he might not have any some conservatives are more sympathetic to bush daniel mckivergan , who blogs for the weekly standard , says immigration opponents are the ones committing political suicide a t the end of the day republicans will have to decide whether they want to be the party of patrick mchenry an antiimmigration congressman from north carolina or president bush in other words , a minority party or a majority party in the years ahead in a similar vein , the wall street journal editorial page reminds conservatives that ronald reagan supported amnesty for illegal immigrants  in a post at national review s the corner , john podhoretz pleads with his conservatives to tolerate intraparty disagreement on immigration podhoretz cites the example of polipundit , a prominent conservative blog that has banished dissent on immigration policy \( at the american spectator , john tabin agrees that the tone of the debate has gotten out of hand \) but podhoretz s fellow corner posters sound like the sclerotic emailers that podhoretz says are killing the conservative movement national review online editor kathryn jean lopez refers to bush as el presidente jorge arbusto , and john derbyshire writes of bush s speech , total blather , and insincere and dishonest to boot demand a wall anything less is smoke and fudge dale franks , writing at qando , implies that conservatives so distrust bush on immigration that nothing he says can spare him from criticism the american people in general , and the republican base in particular , simply don t trust the president on this issue some antiimmigration conservatives actually liked bush s speech , only turning on it after hearing the administration s postdebate spin carol platt liebau goes from judging it not bad to calling it disaster from both a political and policy standpoint after hearing hugh hewitt interview assistant secretary of homeland security julie myers , who was backing away from the concept of any kind of physical fencing hewitt himself thought bush s speech was a good start then found myers undoing in a handful of minutes my confidence in the president s commitment to border security first hewitt concludes the blogosphere talk radio callers emailers are turning against this speech in a decisive fashion they simply do not believe the administration is really committed to border enforcement , and the spokespeople sent out to back up the president s message aren t doing that job period it is all about the fence the real fence tom maguire , who blogs at justoneminute , has an idea for how bush can salvage things with his base t he white house needs rove to get busted for dui , or cheney to shoot someone , or something anything ! to move people off of the immigration story

to the editor re breaking through adoption s racial barriers \( front page , aug 17 \) it is good to know that transracial adoptions are increasing in this country , particularly since there are many children with africanamerican backgrounds who need homes in 1970 , unwilling to seek a child from abroad , we adopted a 3monthold baby through catholic charities of rochester it was our second adoption , the baby joining an older brother and sister unlike the first baby we adopted , the second one s birth father was black and the birth mother white at the time , a close friend broke into tears when we told her of our plans , crying , what kind of egos do you have \? thirtysix years later , our younger daughter is as bright and affectionate as she is beautiful love , however , is not enough couples \( or singles \) adopting today would be wise to seek family counseling , starting when the children are old enough to understand that being given up for adoption is not a reflection of their worthiness , but in most cases , an attempt by birth parents to secure a stable life for their children patricia costa viglucci penfield , ny , aug 17 , 2006 to the editor as an adoptive mother of an ethiopian child , i can shed light on choosing to adopt from ethiopia rather than domestically we went through training to become foster parents before we chose to adopt , and we decided that as much as children in the foster system needed homes , we were not willing to take on a child who may want nothing more than to return to her abusive parents we wanted desperately to help those children , but after much selfexamination , we determined we were not up to the task the orphaned children of ethiopia are equally deserving of loving homes , and most come with the core knowledge that they are lovable because they started out life with an abundance of love and an absence of drugs after eight months home , our 6yearold ethiopian daughter has already abandoned her fear of loving her new mommy , and i have never been happier jennifer zilliac palo alto , calif , aug 17 , 2006 to the editor by the time i was freed for adoption , i was known as hard to place i was an older black child at the time , black children were available only to black families , yet none wanted me i would have been thrilled to live with a loving family of any color i applaud recent changes that give black children the chance to live with white families , rather than having them linger in foster care theresa cameron tempe , ariz , aug 17 , 2006 the writer is the author of a book about foster care to the editor your article raised bittersweet memories in 1970 , we adopted our black son , who was 2 1 2 years old he joined our family , including two girls whom i had given birth to , with almost seamless ease our family mythology holds that his younger sister believed he was a gift we brought home from a heavenly sears , roebuck the two youngest were inseparable from his arrival , while the oldest alternatively enjoyed , abused or ignored them both in other words , we are a typical family , perhaps happier than most yet when ari first arrived , the controversy over interracial adoption was growing more acrimonious a year after his adoption , i think it would no longer have been possible for us to have been his parents indeed , we were told we were participants in genocide by removing him from the black community he was 2 when we met him and in his second foster home we knew we could n't predict what we would know about being the white parents of a black son , but we also knew , in however many ways we might fail him , that we had a better chance of success than a future of foster homes would provide in the end , it is always about making a family and never about making a political statement tama zorn brookline , mass , aug 17 , 2006 to the editor when we , a white couple , adopted our biracial daughter in florida when she was a day old , we saw countless other white couples adopting in other countries , at great expense and inconvenience , rather than choosing a mixedrace child born in the united states , where parentage and medical history are often known the reason became clear at a meeting of potential adoptive parents , when a white woman asked the expert panel , how can we be sure that our adopted child will look like us \? racism , pure and simple , keeps more couples from doing what we did to honor our daughter , who is now 13 , we moved from new york state to atlanta , which has a robust africanamerican middle class i learned how important it was to care properly for our daughter s hair these are big steps that should be considered when contemplating a transracial adoption a core cause of racism is not wanting to inconvenience oneself now i call it education , not inconvenience linda logdberg atlanta , aug 17 , 2006 to the editor americans have been adopting asian and south american children for decades , so why are black children considered any different \? surely adopting a child from vietnam would have a greater sociocultural adjustment than a child from alabama and would africanamericans have equal rights adopting white children \? it never ceases to amaze me that educated americans continue practicing subtle racism as long as they insist on distinguishing the skin color of mankind lee strasburger belmont , mass , aug 17 , 2006 drawing \( drawing by katherine streeter \)

abc , which is hosting the oscars , commissioned a fairly extensive poll about this year s best picture nominees and found out there is a clear winner none of the above twentytwo percent in this abc news poll pick crash for the best picture statuette , with brokeback mountain in second place at 15 percent but unusually the biggest group , 34 percent , has no opinion on which flick should win in other words , abc won t be surprised if people who didn t see the movies don t tune into the show either and last night , the network previewed a story for world news tonight , asking the question , are the oscars out of touch \? perhaps the news division at abc is trying to teach the entertainment division , which paid dearly for the oscars , a little lesson in antisynergy in the poll , a random sample of 1001 adults , nonwhites were more likely to chose crash than whites , women preferred brokeback over men , and democrats and republicans felt pretty much the same way about most the films less than half the seniors had any preference , an indication that this year s nominees did not pull them off the recliner and into the movie house

to the editor re poll gives bush worst marks yet on major issues \( front page , 10 \) as president bush s approval rating sinks ever lower , i imagine that more and more voters who sought to vote him out of office in 2004 have the following question which of mr bush s failures this term could not have been predicted by his incompetence and arrogance in the first term \? i propose that the answer is none and wonder at the millions who apparently voted for him hoping for what his record all but proved would not happen we all knew mr bush well enough from his first term to know that his response to tragedy and adversity would be to promote and flatter the incompetent and ignore the advice of cooler heads those who disapprove now but who voted to reelect mr bush have gotten what they voted for and should be apologizing to those who knew better when it mattered most , a year and a half ago as for those who continue to support the president , at least they are consistent david kagle bronx , may 10 , 2006 drawing \( drawing by christoph niemann \)

as the mets charged into this year s postseason , their cityskyline logo suddenly appeared on magazine covers , on pencils displayed near grocery checkouts and on bumper stickers sold at gasoline stations but just a few months ago and for many years before that , through thick and mostly thin there was hardly a trace of mets gear to be found my son james and i would trudge from store to store in search of a mets backpack or even just a lunch box , deliberately ignoring the racks and rows of yankee tank tops , change purses and dog sweaters last year , the manager of a large , local sports warehouse truly trying to help asked , have you considered rooting for the yankees \? james , who was 6 at the time , and i had a long , silent , thoughtful ride home even then , of course , metsemblazoned tchotchkes and memorabilia proliferated online and a few clicks did bring us the coveted backpack but seeing that favorite team s logo out in the world , as yankee fans always do , validates that loyalty , makes it seem meaningful and widespread , which is important for a child this year , of course , meaningfulness does n't need a logo but it does need a perspective as both james and i know , this thrilling season would never be so truly , so characteristically amazing without the struggles that preceded it and i do n't mean the team s struggles before he started first grade , james had already learned that it s tough to be a mets fan , especially in yankeeland here in south orange , nj , trickortreaters often resemble the yankees' starting lineup yankeesthemed parties , with the birthday boy in the derek jeter role , are not unusual our daughter s american girl doll wears a yankee uniform \( a promotional giveaway from a game she attended \) even our local history looks toward the bronx babe ruth and lou gehrig played an exhibition game here in 1929 now the town team wears shirts that say , south orange where legends played in big letters across the back ambitious batters , from tball firsttimers to college varsity veterans , aim at an apartment building on a town thoroughfare , hoping to break a window as legend says gehrig did still , we never wavered even as children , the fans i know accepted the mets as their destiny like being lefthanded , it s occasionally inconvenient , but it s a way of life for me , it s a familial trait i was raised national league by a mets father and a phillies mother when the family landed in northern new jersey , my brother and i gravitated toward shea stadium , where i learned to count change at the concession stand and to score a game correctly , filling in the spaces with satisfying k s when the opposing team s batter struck out my father took us to several seasons' worth of mets games , enough to establish a lifetime loyalty to the team even as their fortunes waxed and waned , and i lived in many places , i answered questions about team preference with , mets , of course if i had carried a backpack , i would have wanted a mets logo on it , which is why i 've been willing to travel hopefully from store to store each year , much as the mets approach those first road games each season the peculiar pull of this team is the repeated disappointment that punctuates its bigleague credentials i 've always seen myself in the players the way they blow opportunities , make spectacular errors and sometimes , just barely , catch a break they either do n't deserve or deserve more than any other team in the world that s baseball s equivalent of missed deadlines , bills paid late , children s homework hastily done and the occasional glorious day when either none of that matters or all of it does on the best of good days , i'm willie randolph , my children are a welltrained team , and my suburb is a soldout night game at shea more often , my met life is a rainout followed by a grueling doubleheader on the road and bad news about the pitcher s throwing arm my high school buddy , a queens transplant , and i used to listen to mets games on a transistor radio in his yard when his mother sent us outside to weed the vegetable garden i remember lying in spring s damp grass , which dried to nothing in the heat of late summer and revived for the playoffs even then , back in the 1980 s , it was an apt metaphor for the mets' seasons this year , for the first time in recent memory , i look forward to reading the sports pages after the mets swept the division title , their logo swept the stores with equal bravado , often replacing large yankee displays entire windows of sportinggoods stores in new york city are now filled with mets gear mets tshirts are being advertised in south orange advertised ! at several stores , along with enough backpacks for every child in the tristate area i see myself less clearly in this success story , but that s ok if my mets have a golden season , there s reason to think that i 'll have the same so i'm feeling an unfamiliar exuberance in gleeful anticipation of dare i say it \? a world series title , i decide to buy some party clothes , a new tshirt for myself and a hat for james as a veteran fan , though , my exuberance is tempered , just slightly , by experience browsing through the array of mets gear , i choose a backpack that i hide from james it s for next year just in case we 're all disappointed and it s back to the same old and the mets logo vanishes from sight like a foul ball into a fan s mitt because being a mets fan means celebrating victories a stolen base , a favorable call at third or a division title when we can , and pragmatically planning for errors it s the lesson of the legacy it s the hardwon wisdom that distinguishes us from fans of that other new york team it sets us apart well , that and the backpacks drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
to the editor in paul berman s review of my book 'all governments lie' the life and times of rebel journalist i f stone \( oct 1 \) , comments and quotations regarding stone and russian official contacts are inaccurately and damagingly taken out of context in such a manner as to deeply distort stone s history berman refers to oleg kalugin continually as a kgb agent never once acknowledging , as the book repeatedly notes , that his cover was as the russian press attach \? this was the only capacity in which stone and other american reporters who also talked with him in the 1960 s knew him kalugin says as clear as day we had no clandestine relationship we had no secret arrangement i was the press officer quoting a kalugin comment that i cite in the book , berman asserts that i have accidentally hanged stone myself but berman does not accurately convey the entire passage kalugin told me that stone began his cooperation with the soviet intelligence long before me , based entirely on his view of the world but berman omits this following crucial sentence in the same paragraph did he kalugin have actual information that stone had ever cooperated with soviet intelligence \? 'no' kalugin also conceded that stone had no access to classified documents and that everything the outspoken stone knew about american foreign policy turned up in his writing for anyone to read for kalugin , who as press attach \? ought out important journalists , stone was merely on the fringe and just useful , like dozens of other media contacts i had in contrast , he told me i knew one guy from time magazine , for instance that was a big thing my book quotes kalugin saying that stone was a true liberal and not a communist he would not hurt or damage the united states none of these comments is in berman s review berman also makes much of the kalugin claim that stone would perform tasks which kalugin described as find out what the views of someone in the government were or some senator on such and such an issue berman takes this out of context to suggest that it refers to stone s earlier cooperation with the kgb \( which kalugin admitted he had no knowledge of \) and again omits relevant information kalugin was referring only to conversations that took place during their infrequent 1960 s lunches , adding that he could remember absolutely nothing of importance that stone ever said to him in repeating kalugin s many inconsistencies at length , i was trying to prove once and for all that posthumous neocon lies about stone are based on the thinnest of evidence the unsubstantiated words of a russian agentcumpressattach \? and fleeting mentions in russian files of an unnamed journalist that the kgb \( again in press attach \? over \) tried to contact in 1944 \( this was when russia and the united states were allies , a time when the sage of the establishment , walter lippmann , was cooperating far more with this russian official , if interpretations of the files can be believed \) berman also chooses to ignore my research in stone s 5 , 000page fbi file , which shows that in the four decades that the fbi director j edgar hoover hounded stone and the details of that pursuit are often comical his fbi uncovered not one piece of evidence connecting stone to the communist party or russian intelligence operations myra macpherson washington to the editor according to paul berman , i f stone must have worked for the kgb because he sometimes lunched with their washington agent izzy s close friend \( and my father \) bernard nossiter , when he was london bureau chief of the washington post , used not only to lunch but occasionally to play tennis with the local kgb man by berman s logic , that ought to have made him at least a commissar , but of course my father , like izzy , was nothing of the kind the very idea of doing favors for any vast bureaucracy , much less an outfit as sinister as the kgb , would have convulsed them both with laughter they viewed the information received at these encounters as highly suspect but not without interest , and gave as good as they got the tennis was far more challenging perhaps unsurprisingly , the london kgb man s game was all spin josh nossiter san francisco to the editor paul berman s review contains at least one serious error the victory of communism in vietnam led to many atrocities , but the massacre of huge portions of the population of cambodia was most certainly not one of them the khmer rouge were the perpetrators of that horrific event , and their rise to power became possible only because the massive bombings ordered by henry kissinger and richard nixon impoverished and destabilized cambodian society vietnam s invasion of cambodia in 1979 actually put an end to the genocide because of american hostility to vietnam , the united states under ronald reagan and george h w bush supported the remnants of the khmer rouge as the official government of cambodia a morally bankrupt policy if there ever was one eric d weitz st paul the writer is chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota

there is bipartisan opposition in blogdom to new york times columnist david brooks s \( implicit \) idea for a mccainlieberman unity ticket in 2008 , a notion that has also been put forward by washington times columnist and blogger austin bay  stephen bainbridge , a corporate law professor at the university of california , los angeles , attacks from the right at his personal blog support for a mccainlieberman party , he says , is an example of war myopia , the perception that the war on terror is the only thing that matters bainbridge writes campaigns against modern terrorism tend to be interminable look how long the troubles in northern ireland , the basque separatist movement in spain , the various forms of palestinian terror , the first israeli occupation of lebanon , the kashmir separatists and other terror movements lasted decades in each of these cases , the countries involved had to manage terror while also going forward with domestic policy a mccainlieberman ticket would be a disaster for conservative principles and policies it could be justified only if you think \( a \) the war is the only thing that matters \( which wasn t true even in ww ii \) and \( b \) you think military solutions are the way to win the war at tapped , the american prospect blog , matthew yglesias objects that mccain and lieberman do not represent the political center on issues of national security he writes are there any republicans whose national security views are clearly more hawkish than mccain s \? i can t think of any for that matter , are there any republicans whose national security views are clearly more hawkish than lieberman s \? i can t think of any either of the politicians who seem to have clear convictions on the topic , these are , i think , the two leading militarists in the united states senate b oth men s difference with bush almost exclusively amount to the \( frankly , absurd \) view that he s been unduly hesitant to unleash military force maybe politics has a creamy ned lamont center \? los angeles times columnist rosa brooks and new york times columnist paul krugman are pushing the angry antiwar center meme , as is crunchy con rod dreher at his beliefnet blog  but there s no need to push too hard , as the meme war has already been won by the antiwar moderates none other than david broder wrote thursday that being against the war or at least being against current policy in iraq is sensibly centrist the protests are coming from both the right and left , but the greatest frustration is among the broad swath of centrist voters who feel they have no voice
for the brokers who sold the town of brookhaven its insurance policies , the phrase nobid contract sounded a lot like the mooing of a cash cow for years , according to the new town administration but , that is about to change , they say according to town records , two brokerages one owned by the family of thomas m neppell jr , a former town and suffolk county republican chairman wrote policies costing the town more than 175 million in premiums over the last three years , including more than 55 million last year , and about 2 million in commissions the policies included general liability , workers' compensation and coverage for brookhaven s airport , cars and marinas but the town board , now controlled by democrats for the first time in 30 years and led by supervisor brian x foley , has extended the two brokers' contracts for only 90 days , to give officials time to analyze the town s insurance portfolio the board will solicit bids this spring from brokers regardless of political affiliation , said jack schnirman , the deputy supervisor democrats have said that the neppell agency had a sweetheart deal with previous republicandominated administrations but mr schnirman said in an email message tuesday that the analysis of the town s insurance would not be completed for another week , and that he could not whether the town was overcharged from 2003 through 2005 , thomas m neppell sons collected about 115 million in commissions , roughly 1075 percent of the premiums a c edwards , a sayville broker , collected more than 828 , 000 in commissions , at 12 percent democrats have not criticized the edwards agency by name nor made any accusations against it mr neppell s son , thomas m neppell iii , is now the firm s president he said that the selection of his agency was based on its expertise , not his father s political affiliation his grandfather brokered the firm s first contract with the town about 1962 , and since then the agency has served its client well , mr neppell said yes , my father was the town chairman for about four years and the county chair for about two years , but we 've had that account much longer , and during the time when my father was not the town or county chairman , mr neppell said we really care about brookhaven , whether it s democrat or republican he said that the town had twice hired outside auditors , in 1993 and 2003 , to evaluate the handling of its insurance and that both reports gave his company high marks but mr schnirman said a pricewaterhousecoopers report released in december criticized the previous town board s practice of awarding nobid contracts because the process has n't been open in the past , there s a learning curve for us and a lot of analysis as we go forward , he said what i can say for sure is that the past administration awarded a nobid contract to a political ally and the town board approved it year after year mr neppell said mr foley s transition team was pleased at his handdelivered proposal that would save about 15 million in premiums our question is , why then have we been overpaying in the past \? mr schnirman asked the answer , mr neppell said , is that the market for municipal insurance is more favorable now than it was after sept 11 and , he added , one company in particular recently moved into the municipal market and began offering competitive premiums mr neppell said that that company , which he declined to name , had agreed to hold its price until he could submit a bid this spring mr neppell said his proposal would bundle all the town s policies together , resulting in a volume savings as well the commissions that his agency and a c edwards have charged the town are below the 15 percent standard for general liability policies , mr neppell added we have never gouged the town of brookhaven and never charged a service fee , he said typically , a municipality solicits competitive bids for services like construction of a building , and the laws governing that process leave a town board little discretion beyond picking the lowest bidder , said richard hoffmann , a deputy town attorney in islip in the case of professional services , like those of an architect or insurance broker , towns issue a request for proposals , he said that process provides more leeway to consider a business s reputation and factors beyond price in september 2003 , investigators from the suffolk district attorney s office seized records from the neppell agency s office , as well as from town hall , the william floyd school district and the mastic beach fire district a grand jury has handed down 18 corruption indictments that , among others , named 11 town officials or contractors and one former county legislator none involve the neppell agency or the town s insurance portfolio the investigation is continuing , said robert clifford , the spokesman for thomas j spota , district attorney photo the neppell agency wrote policies for the town of brookhaven costing more than 175 million in premiums over the last three years \( photo by maxine hicks for the new york times \)
a pair of ducks sat on the muddy shore of the neck river in madison last tuesday , oblivious to the environmental destruction taking place just under their feet vegetation in the salty marshes near long island sound is dying off , putting plants and animals at risk and causing the shore to erode scientists call it sudden wetland dieback , but they are not sure how it started and what they can do to end it to be sure , the problem is still relatively small , and it takes an expert to notice it the marshes at the neck river looked perfectly serene last week a family of ospreys had built a nest on a wooden post in the middle of the grass seagulls rested on a dock birds called to each other there were at least a half dozen different songs in the air none sounded like complaints but there it was , on the far side of the river from an old boat dock the dieback stretching from the water s edge a few feet onto land , it looked like male pattern baldness in reverse the land near the shore was bare , but higher up it was filled with grass and other plants these are very important areas where we 're seeing vegetation lost , said ron rozsa , a coastal ecologist for the connecticut department of environmental protection the problem is that various marine organisms depend on the cordgrass near the shore for shelter and sustenance small shrimp and fish and certain kinds of insects live there bigger fish , in turn , eat them without the cordgrass , those animals go away or die meanwhile , where grasses have ceased to grow , the soil begins to collapse , putting even more of the marsh in danger mr rozsa said there are about 13 , 000 acres of salty and partly salty marshes in connecticut he has recorded dieback from old lyme to as far west as milford he said he thought the phenomenon began in 1999 and it is not just occurring in connecticut scientists have noticed bare wetlands throughout new england , and even near orient point , on long island a similar effect was recorded in a handful of southern states , including louisiana , georgia and texas scientists in louisiana have linked it to a fungus , but connecticut is still testing to determine what causes the grass by the shore to die , mr rozsa said so far , scientists have just been floating theories , including blaming flying dust from sudan susan c adamowicz , an estuary scientist with the united states fish and wildlife service in maine , has worked to pool information about dieback in different states , but she said it was still disparate and incomplete there is no money to fully document it by taking lowaltitude aerial photographs , for instance and there is no organized plan to track it , just a few scientists with increasing concerns they held a conference on the problem this past may and keep in touch through an email group but some worry that they are facing too big a danger for halfmeasures it s not thousands of acres yet , dr adamowicz said , but it s scary because we do n't know what it is or how to stop it photo danger alert bare shore at the neck river signals a phenomenon scientists consider a peril to salt marsh life \( photo by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)

in my last column i commented on the protest by muslim students against the invitation extended to \( and accepted by \) salman rushdie to be the commencement speaker at the graduation ceremony of nova southeastern university s farquahar college of arts and sciences , in davie , fla the invitation was defended by college administrators who said , first , that there was no thought of insulting anyone by inviting mr rushdie , and second , that the famous author , widely known as a strong proponent of freedom of expression , was the ideal person to conclude a yearlong discussion of the theme of good and evil i made three points \( 1 \) by identifying mr rushdie as a free speech hero , the university was implicitly putting him in the good slot and consigning those who valued pious speech more than free speech to the evil slot and if as a student you fell into the latter group , you were bound to be insulted \( 2 \) once delivered \( by the invitation itself \) the insult would only be compounded by reminding the students that freedom of expression is a core value of the university it s not their core value which is not to say that it s not a value for them , just that it s not a value that trumps everything all the time and that to invoke it is another way of saying you re wrong and you really don t belong here \( 3 \) claiming , as some faculty members did , that mr rushdie s presence would generate a lively exchange of ideas , was to confuse a graduation ceremony with a classroom or a public lecture the point of the latter two venues is to provoke thought and prompt a reexamination of one s views the point of a graduation ceremony is to recognize an accomplishment \( the students not mr rushdie s \) and put a gracious period on a long and arduous journey the ceremony itself should be neither long nor arduous , intellectually or otherwise some of those who disagreed with me responded to arguments i did not make i was not either affirming or defending the right to not be offended , as dave silverstone put it in the comment he posted to my column i was saying , rather , that the students were right to be offended they were right , that is , to conclude that inviting rushdie to be their commencement speaker was an affront to their faith , whether intended as such or not this does not mean \( nor was i asserting \) that the university was under an obligation , either legal or moral , to avoid giving offense not giving offense is not my standard it is the university s it is dean rosenblum who declared that he and his colleagues did not mean to insult anyone i was just pointing out that if insulting no one was their objective , they failed to achieve it and their insult was delivered again when they ran the doctrine of free speech up the flagpole and , in effect , dared the muslim students not to salute it now , it would have been perfectly within the university s rights to display no concern whatsoever for the sensibilities of its minority students indeed the university was free to affirmatively administer a rebuke in the xenophobic spirit of the comment jon posted if the intent of nova southeast is to declare that it is wrong to issue statements calling for the murder of one s ideological and or religious opponents , then bully for nova southeast but nova southeastern , according to its own statements , had no such intent they wanted to do something make a choice that would earn them universal applause and they ended up doing something else their failure , if it was one , was not moral but administrative and in fact there are far fewer moral or big issues in this little brouhaha than some of the commenters would have it there are , for example , no free speech issues here at all when empty palm paraphrases justice brandeis to the effect that freedom of speech is not there to protect the speech we love , but the speech we hate , he or she is saying nothing to the point justice brandeis was explicating the first amendment , which protects minority and dissenting voices from government disfavor and silencing southeastern nova university is not a government agency , and while it does have some first amendment obligations it cannot dismiss or discipline a faculty member because he or she espouses unpopular views it has no obligation to allow unpopular or controversial views \( or any kind of views \) to be heard at graduation it is free to do so , but nothing in the first amendment compels it to do so nor does anyone have a first amendment right to be chosen as a commencement speaker and no one has a constitutional cause of complaint because a certain speaker was or was not chosen complaints may of course arise , but they will have their source in the disappointment of personal preferences and not in any legal or moral principle nor am i suggesting as a legal or moral principle that an author of recognized brilliance should be barred from giving a commencement speech because one of his fictional works fell afoul of a dogmatic religious precept , as commenter jonathan dimarco says neither conformity with a religious precept nor opposition to it should be a reason for either barring or inviting a speaker speakers should be invited because they can be counted upon to say things appropriate to the occasion and refrain from saying things that risk turning the occasion into a political rally or , for that matter , into a celebration of the first amendment this deflationary argument could be criticized for many reasons it asks too little of the audience at a commencement it is too detached from the intellectual giveandtake that characterizes the undergraduate experience at its best but it cannot be criticized for being relativist , an accusation made in several comments that were posted to my column adam s chides me for championing the moral relativism that opposes freedom of expression but the doctrine of freedom of expression is not opposed to relativism it is relativism , for it insists that all forms of speech be equally tolerated independently of whether they are judged to be true and illuminating or false and pernicious it is not i but first amendment jurisprudence that has produced such oftquoted gems as one man s vulgarity is another man s lyric \( cohen v california , 1971 \) and , even worse , under the first amendment , there is no such thing as a false idea \( gertz v robert welch , inc , 1974 \) you ll never catch me saying anything like that nor do i claim that freedom of expression and muslim fundamentalism are equally valid ideologies , as gordy suggests in his comment i only claim that they are both ideologies systems of thought that foreground some values and are blind to others and that the ideology of free speech , like any other ideology , is incapable of taking the true measure of those who do not subscribe to it my point is made beautifully by laura , when she says of her fellow commenters , none of the people here seem to understand the difference between blasphemy and disagreement i would go further and say that for a strong freespeech advocate , blasphemy is a category without members a freespeech regime cannot accommodate the notion of blasphemous speech , of speech interdicted in advance , for the cardinal tenet of first amendment doctrine is that no concept or proposition \( even one critical of a deity \) should be either demonized or glorified before it is put to the test of rational deliberation in the context of this ideology , a proposition about god is no different from a proposition about a chemical reaction or a political policy in each instance , the proper and obligatory response is show me or prove it a proposition \( like god is good \) that refuses the challenge of disagreement forfeits the right to be taken seriously to put it another way , freespeech ideology cannot recognize assertions of the absolute this is so and there is nothing to be said against it as anything but error i do not mean this as a criticism i am not saying that this is what is wrong with free speech ideology i am saying that this is the way it is , and that this explains why the administrators at nova southeastern seem incapable of understanding why their muslim students might be upset so what s the moral \? there is none i m not telling anyone to do anything or refrain from doing anything on the basis of some suspect philosophical notion , whether it be multiculturalism or postmodernism or cultural relativism \( terms absent from my previous column about commencement \) i m just offering some conditional practical advice from the perspective of a former dean if you want everyone at your graduation ceremony to go home happy and filled with thoughts of future donations , choose a commencement speaker who is , in commenter jeff crisafulli s derisive words , warm and fuzzy if you don t care whether they go home happy or would even prefer that they leave shaken up , choose a speaker with sharp edges as with everything , you pay your money and take your chances that s all there is to my position nothing fancy , no rhetorical posturing , no grandiose pronouncements , no selfcongratulatory displays of virtue which is more than i can say of the majority of those who have posted their comments

connecticut and i go back a long way so long , in fact , that i could tell you the story of how yankee doodle got to be the state song connecticut was my first great political obsession , and i can still sing the words to the green hills of my connecticut , which yankee doodle replaced in 1978 though you really would n't want to encourage that beginning today , the times will be publishing a separate editorial page on connecticut issues every sunday we 'll now have editorial pages in all five of the paper s regional weeklies , but i suspect connecticut s is always going to have a special place in my affections you cannot possibly spend as much time in a state capitol as i did in hartford and not always feel the tug when i was in hartford way back when ella grasso and william o'neill were the governors the politicians had a terrible inferiority complex reformers in particular kept comparing the general assembly to the state legislature in new york , and talking about how great things were in albany things were so professional they took themselves so seriously they had offices , for heavens sake in hartford , the legislators had one little room that looked like a small study hall , for anybody who wanted to write a letter to a constituent other than that , the only place to hang out was a dingy basementlike barroom next to the cafeteria that was known as the hawaiian room , in honor of a limp paper lei that hung from a steam pipe it was , in truth , all a little pathetic , particularly when the lawmakers in albany were strutting around in an office building that looked like something charlton heston had built for the pharaoh in the ten commandments miraculously , this was also the time when connecticut was in what people now tell me was a golden age of politics people were actually interested in government , even young people joseph lieberman had started working on campaigns when he was in school and was already the senate majority leader in his early 30 s \( i wrote at the time that while senator lieberman looked as if he were about 45 , the good news was that he would still look about 45 when he was in his 60 s this is the single political observation of mine that he remembers and continues to quote to this very day \) forcing legislators to keep their paperwork in the trunk of their cars was obviously not a great plan but it did serve as a daily reminder that none of them were really a big deal unless they were gathered together at work on the people s business albany was more impressive , but the place was overwhelmed by delusions of grandeur and by debt connecticut was very , very careful about how it spent its money \( when we got bats in the pressroom and suggested hiring an exterminator , governor grasso suggested , obliquely , that we try throwing potatoes at them \) connecticut called itself the land of steady habits , which suggested both good behavior and selfsatisfaction neither quality really lasted into the new millennium for a while the ad people changed the slogan to connecticut we 're full of surprises , which was supposed to refer to , say , fun at the mystic aquarium to the outside world , however , it seemed more likely to suggest unexpected headlines about political indictments the state has changed a lot , sometimes for the better like the campaign finance reform law that was passed last year , or the fact that the legislature managed , without prodding from some court , to pass a bill legalizing civil unions for gay residents sometimes it s been for the worse connecticut has always forced its towns to rely too much on property taxes to finance local government but in recent years , the desperate scramble for cash has expressed itself in particularly dreadful ways , sending way too many communities in hot pursuit of any mall or box store whose developer seems capable of signing a check traffic is definitely worse there s a legend that when abe ribicoff was governor an era so long ago it was even before my time he became irritated about speeding on the highways and sent a bunch of state police to drive their cars three abreast up i95 at exactly the speed limit it was said to have created the biggest traffic jam in the history of connecticut , but it probably only managed to duplicate what i95 now looks like on a good day the big transportation package passed by the last session of the legislature is a start toward improvement , but really only a drop in the bucket as you may have noticed , we come to this new page with lots of preexisting opinions among them are that deer are wonderful , but not so wonderful that none should ever be shot that if moderate republicans are a vanishing breed , we are glad they are making their last stand here that the no child left behind act is really a good thing , particularly if it ever gets proper financing and , of course , that both the red sox and yankees are wonderful baseball teams gail collins
as we reach the midpoint of mad scientist week , i want to get into some madder , badder territory today s question is does the egg matter \? that is , genes aside , how much does the other stuff in an egg affect what sort of animal you get \? if , for instance , you remove the genes from a pigeon egg and put in chicken genes instead , what would you get \? a pigeon \? a chicken \? a weird mix \? nothing at all \? there are several reasons i m interested i d be fascinated to know if a chicken genome could direct a pigeon egg to make an animal that was indisputably a chicken that would tell us something fundamental about eggs that the other contents don t matter much the embryo s genome rules the roost but there are \( slightly \) more practical reasons to be interested , too transplanting the genome from one species to the eggs of another has been held up as a way to help save endangered species the idea is that you take genes from a panda , put them into the egg of some other mammal , and grow new pandas \( it would be much simpler not to endanger the animals in the first place , of course \) more speculatively still , suppose we managed to reconstruct and synthesize the genome of something extinct a dodo , say , or a woolly mammoth in order to perform an actual resurrection , we d need to put the synthetic genome into an egg of some sort could you use an elephant egg to grow a mammoth \? a chicken for a dodo \? or is the project dead as a dodo from the start \? putting one creature s genome into another creature s egg is a kind of hybridization it fuses material from two different species but it s unlike any hybrid i ve heard of in nature natural hybrids form when a sperm from one species succeeds in fertilizing an egg from another , as when a donkey and a horse get together and have a mule we ve learned a lot from studying hybrids of this sort they tell us how different genomes coordinate their activities , and what it is that keeps species separate sometimes , it s that the egg and sperm don t recognize each other sperm from one abalone species pay no attention to eggs from another , for example or there can be a problem with orchestrating growth if you cross a particular form of the female eastern grey treefrog with a male spring peeper \( another frog \) , they will produce offspring , and everything is fine while the animals are tadpoles but when it comes time to turn into a frog , the animals explode this result is nasty , but instructive it tells us where the two genomes don t work together \( interestingly , when the father is the grey treefrog , you don t even get a tadpole this kind of asymmetry is common in hybrids \) the experiment i m proposing is different instead of looking at the way genes interact with one another , it would look at the way genes interact with the rest of the cell when embryos are first forming , their genes don t start working right away they get a store of material from their mother , a kind of molecular maternal care gradients in different chemicals tell the growing embryo which way is up , for example but how much do these motherly molecules matter \? are they highly speciesspecific \? or are they generic , such that an embryo can launch itself into the world as long as a few basic requirements are met \? a mother can also make subtle alterations to an egg that affect which of an embryo s genes get switched on for instance , a duck adds more testosterone to her eggs when she mates with a supersexy drake than when she mates with a less impressive chap the extra testosterone improves the looks of her sons indeed , an expanding body of evidence suggests that at least within a species the contents of an egg can have subtle but profound effects on which genes get switched on in the child but perhaps in the grand scheme of things , the mother s effects don t matter perhaps a genome can sculpt a creature from the stuff in almost any egg or perhaps it can t we don t know yet though some people have begun to look into the matter a handful of genomes have been transplanted into eggs of a different species for example pig to rabbit , ibex to rabbit , yak to cow , human to cow , minke whale to pig , and chicken to rabbit so far , the results show that you can start an embryo growing but as far as i know , none has produced anything more than a small ball of cells all the same , the results are tantalizing i was amazed to learn that , apparently , a chicken genome can direct a rabbit egg to begin growing a bird genome bossing a mammal egg wow ! but these experiments are risky the techniques are derived from the techniques invented for animal cloning which are still horribly unreliable moreover , let s be frank like the exploding frogs , experiments of this sort have a high ick factor , and when done in mammals they raise serious ethical questions the chances of creating an animal that is sick or deformed seem huge so i propose if we decide to carry on at all that we start out with something else , such as bumblebees and flies or roses and petunias the results might not translate it may turn out be harder for a bumblebee genome to direct a fly s egg than for mammoth genes to direct an elephant egg but if the experiments worked , they would tell us that , at least in some cases , genes really are everything

who has n't heard saturday s overture the drone of a leaf blower , the pulse of a power washer , the echo of a distant hammer , the circular saw screaming through a board like an angry velociraptor \? this is the soundtrack of chores for some , it s a wonderful noise , an affirmation of the work ethic and a reassurance that property values are being maintained the formula is straightforward enough you get something done you stand back to admire your neatly stacked lumber or freshly painted fence and badda bing , badda bang your existence has been validated few tasks define the obligations of homeownership like this weekend ritual love it , hate it , none of that matters like gravity , it s the law people tend to fall into several confederacies when it comes to this designated labor those who reluctantly participate , those who attack the day with the zeal of a prussian general and those who avoid the situation altogether michael rothbard , my neighbor on long island , is a prime example of the last sort a child of the city , he grew up believing all chores could be solved by one simple activity you picked up the phone and called the building superintendent after moving to the suburbs and buying a home , he had trouble making the mental adjustment to the requirements of homeownership it was because of his condition , congenital laziness it s a disease there are few known cures for , he says he hires someone to do most of his saturday chores his philosophy is that he works so hard all week that he has already justified his existence michael s realization that saturday chores were not going to be a part of his life came one day two years ago , after his significant other suggested that he should mow the lawn \( she did n't actually ask , but rather only observed that the grass had grown so long that it was dying \) he grudgingly agreed an odyssey of frustration followed first , he wrenched his neck trying to start the mower then , he realized that since it had sat unused for several summers , it probably needed fresh gas while bringing home the fuel , he rounded a corner too fast , tipping the gas can onto the floor of the car , thereby turning it into a potential bomb he arrived home without exploding , but while filling the mower tank , added the wrong mixture of gas and oil after a few more pulls of the cord , the mower unexpectedly roared to life and began ripping up the lawn michael became apoplectic , experiencing a spasm of rage he had not felt since childhood he was not only making himself miserable , he was doing the same to his partner it was an epiphany the emotional cost was simply too great saturday chores , he realized , were meant to be done by others i have not flipped my lid like that since , he said personally , i fall into the first category the unenthusiastic choredoer much of this attitude has to do with my father , a ferocious saturdaychore man he was always up at dawn \( he complained that he could n't sleep because of the birds \) and attacked his tasks so enthusiastically that he often ran out of things to do he also required total family participation never was i allowed a leisurely saturday i 'd rather have you throwing rocks over a fence than sitting around doing nothing , he used to say years later , i reached an internal compromise between my own inclinations and my dad s standards as a result , i do respond to necessary tasks , but only when the situation has reached catastrophic proportions this is why my basement looks like an overstocked goodwill store and my yard has taken on the abused appearance of a jets practice field but i have learned two things to allow myself a relaxed saturday sometimes , and sitting on my backside actually is vastly preferable to throwing rocks over a fence the zealous category of choredoers probably is best exemplified by a second neighbor , pete costanzo pete is the type of guy whose tools are organized his garage is immaculate you can bet money that his lawn will be mowed and his leaves raked , with the bags stacked neatly beside the street i 'll never forget my shock one day when i discovered him scrubbing his garbage cans to me , such receptacles are made to accumulate a certain amount of grunge pete , apparently , was so far ahead in his requisite chores that he had moved on to optional ones i was also a bit stunned after learning that he came over one day when i was n't there and edged my lawn i took no offense this was n't a form of fastidious fascism , i realized , but merely a gesture of affection i chatted with him about the topic one evening he has always liked doing chores sometimes i lie in bed saturday morning and think of all the things i want to do , he said one reason may be his upbringing when he was a kid , he said , his father worked during the week , and doing chores was the only time they spent together now , he does the same with his son , james it s utterly relaxing to me , no matter how tired i am , he said , as crazy as that sounds it does n't sound that crazy to me anymore after our conversation , i realized that to him saturday chores are a way to push back the chaos that threatens to engulf us all they are a way to quantify our small universe a way of marking time in small , satisfying increments maybe that s what my father was trying to do in his own frenetic way this has been my own epiphany i'm trying to adjust my attitude about saturday chores these days i admire pete s faith in fact , i wish i had more of it needless to say , my yard also would look a whole lot better drawing \( drawing by dan page \)
making ice cream at home has gotten easier , thanks to the fact that new machines have builtin compressors the home machines that most people bought in the past 20 years had a downside no , it was n't eating too much homemade caramel fudge ripple the machines required the freezing usually overnight of a large , insulated coolantlined bowl that was then placed in the machine , taking the place of the crushed ice and salt that chilled the ingredients in older machines fanatics like me kept a couple of the inserts in the freezer all year long , taking up precious space by the time the ice cream was made , churned by hand or by a motorized crank , the liquid coolant in the insert had warmed and required more freezing that ended icecream making for the day with a compressor no insert is needed it keeps the inner walls cold enough to turn the custard and your favorite flavorings into ice cream you can make batches continually , experimenting with one combination of flavors after another first a batch of plain chocolate , then chocolate with crushed malted balls , then frozen yogurt or a fruity sorbet compressor machines have been used commercially for years , but they were inappropriate for home use , because they were too big , heavy , expensive and ugly but the new generation of makers fit on kitchen counters , and most make somewhat larger quantities of ice cream than older machines hard , highquality ice cream that is finished in only 40 minutes or so all can be used to make semifrozen beverages as well shakes , slushies and margaritas do not require the addition of crushed ice as in a blender , allowing for pure , strong flavors some new machines cost upward of 1 , 000 i tested six models selling for 150 to 250 most make one and a half quarts or more , though larger models are available i tried out cuisinart s supreme commercial quality ice cream maker , the deni compressor ice cream maker , the onequart gelato by lello , the nemox gelato chef 2200 , salton s big chill ice cream maker and whynter s sno ice cream maker i used the same recipes in every machine there s no getting around one thing these machines are heavy , 22 to 33 pounds the weight would be more manageable with handles , but only the cuisinart has them and the noise ! if your neighbors complain about your television , you might not want to whip up a latenight snack in one of these things while some make less noise than others , none are quiet all the machines made good ice cream , but some made the task more enjoyable than others my two favorites were the salton and the deni they won out because they have convenient timers and freezing systems that operate separately from the churning mechanism the second feature is important because ice cream goes through several stages first it is chilled and begins to thicken then it is aerated , increasing its volume the volume of custard may initially look skimpy , but it will fill the bowl by the time it is finished finally , when the ice cream is so thick it can no longer be churned , it may be hardened further by letting it continue to freeze a freezing system that operates separately from the churning motor or paddle allows the ice cream to remain in the machine after the churning has finished that way fans of both hard and soft ice cream can be happy for harder , just leave the ice cream in the machine after it s finished churning i particularly liked the salton s large aperture for pouring in the custard and dropping in ingredients like nuts or chocolate chips , because there s less mess the timer shows how much longer it will be until the ice cream is done , a nice feature for a busy cook but it has only two settings 40 minutes , or 50 if a shorter chilling time is desired for drinks , say the machine must be turned off manually the deni , in a white plastic case with clean rounded edges , was attractive for its price both it and the salton have lights that show the setting time and a buzzer that sounds at the end but it has only three settings 10 , 30 and 50 minutes my next favorite was the cuisinart , which has a nononsense look the timer can be set from 1 to 60 minutes , making it easy to whip up drinks the lid has an opening for adding ingredients while the machine is in use but it was the noisiest one i tested i found it impossible to have a conversation over its din the nemox has a few peculiarities that i came to overlook because i liked its compactness as with the others , the bowl can be removed for easy cleaning , but while the ice cream is being made , the bowl has to sit in a bit of alcohol or salted water , which then must be wiped out i found the machines by whynter and lello \( available at whyntercom and icecreamprofessionalcom , respectively \) the bulkiest and hardest to clean because their lids were screwed to the motors and could not be detached easily for washing i was looking for convenience , so although both worked quite well , they failed in the easytouse category cherry spumoni time 20 minutes , plus freezing 3 4 cup milk 3 4 cup sugar 1 8 teaspoon salt 3 4 cup half and half 1 1 2 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla

they have won almost 600 games over six regular seasons , spending nearly 1 billion on salaries they have imported some of the biggest stars in baseball , created their own cable network , set attendance records at their ballpark and broken ground on a new one but the one thing that used to define the yankees , the boast spelled out across the marquee at yankee stadium , has escaped them the yankees no longer win championships another year is over , and another chance is gone the yankees shuffled meekly from the postseason stage on saturday , falling to the detroit tigers , 83 , in game 4 of their american league division series at comerica park everyone in that locker room is disappointed , manager joe torre said they outplayed us they outpitched us there s not much else you can say one new york team is still alive in the postseason , but it is the mets , who completed a sweep of the dodgers with a 95 victory in los angeles on saturday night the mets' accomplishment only underscores the yankees' failure the teams had tied for the majors' best record , but only the mets have advanced the mets will face the winner of the st louissan diego series in the national league championship series , which starts on wednesday at shea stadium the tigers will meet the oakland athletics in the alcs the yankees , who have ruled october for much of baseball history , are a firstround casualty for the second season in a row , their season expiring when robinson can \? ounded to second base against jamie walker the yankees have not won the world series since 2000 two stars from that team , derek jeter and jorge posada , batted 500 in this series the rest of the yankees hit 173 with the yankees down to their final out on saturday , posada blasted a tworun homer it was meaningless to the outcome , yet significant for what it symbolized the old guard had come through again , but it was hardly enough to lift the whole to posada , it is easy to see what is missing from the glory years you hit in the clutch , and you pitch real well , he said they played really well , and that s it the yankees' pitchers had a 556 earned run average for the series the hitters went 2 for 21 with runners in scoring position over the three losses the tigers' major leaguebest pitching staff prevailed over a lineup that led baseball in runs it was a mismatch in detroit , where the tigers won twice by the combined score of 143 facing elimination on saturday , the yankees went down in order in each of the first five innings by the time they put their first runner on base , they were losing by seven runs their plight was personified by alex rodriguez , who batted eighth on saturday for the first time in more than 10 years he went 0 for 3 with an error and was 1 for 14 in the series rodriguez realized the fans' worst fears about him , folding in the very part of the season that mattered most since the yankees took a threegamestonone lead over boston in the 2004 alcs , he has 5 hits in 46 postseason atbats rodriguez has no runs batted in in his past 12 playoff games he was due up next when the season ended , and he watched from the ondeck circle as the tigers celebrated rodriguez tapped his cleats with his bat handle and slowly descended the dugout steps after the game , rodriguez was the last yankee to leave the clubhouse inevitably , the winter will be filled with talk that he should be the first yankee to leave the team i 've never run from problems , said rodriguez , who can veto any deal i'm part of the solution i do n't want to go anywhere , and when we do win , it will be much more gratifying the yankees could part ways with gary sheffield , who went 1 for 12 in the series sheffield will make 13 million next season if the yankees pick up his option the yankees faced a crisis early this season when sheffield and hideki matsui sustained serious wrist injuries but the team came together in their absence , and when the players returned in midseptember , the division was all but clinched that s what makes it harder than probably any other year , jason giambi said , the adversity we went through to get into the playoffs a loaded bench may be a good problem to have , but it is a problem just the same there seemed to be an intangible missing in this series , and torre sensed that quickly after losing game 2 , when the yankees had 1 hit in 15 atbats with runners on base , torre benched sheffield for an old standby , bernie williams williams was hitless in a shutout loss in game 4 , melky cabrera made a cameo while giambi sat cabrera went hitless , too the yankees' veteran starters , mike mussina and randy johnson , lost their starts in this series that left jaret wright on the mound for game 4 as tigers starter jeremy bonderman fired fastballs at 96 miles an hour , his teammates all but took batting practice against wright detroit did not swing and miss until wright s 37th pitch and wright gave up two home runs in the second inning , to magglio ord \? and craig monroe it was a threerun inning , exactly what the tigers had used to defeat johnson on friday johnson kept that game close for a while , but rodriguez did not give wright the chance with two outs and the bases empty in the third , rodriguez tried to backhand a grounder by ord \? he bobbled the ball , then gathered it and fired to first , the throw sailing into the path of the runner sheffield is a novice first baseman with a fragile wrist , and would hardly be expected to pull off a tag play the throw caromed off his glove for an error on rodriguez , and wright could not recover two singles chased him , giving the tigers a 40 lead and starting a parade of four yankees relievers as for bonderman , he needed no help until the ninth
as word of the midterm election results and later the resignation of defense secretary donald h rumsfeld spread across the globe , the criticism of america was less shrill , less gloating , more textured than in the past but none of those offering a public reaction said the vote had been about anything but iraq this was the bill to the white house for their disaster in iraq , said j \? n trittin , deputy leader of germany s green party it was not , of course , a presidential vote though some wished it had been but the tone seemed more conciliatory , in part because president bush s power is now seen as waning irrevocably before , bush was n't looking to be liked by the europeans , giovanni sartori , an italian political analyst , said in a telephone interview for europe it s good news because america will be forced to be less of a solitary aggressor no one expected the election results would end the war quickly , even with the change in the pentagon leadership on the streets of paris , h \? ne tonneiller , 23 , a journalism student , said bush will not be able to do all the things he wanted to do in the first place still , it wo n't change much concerning the war in iraq the midterm congressional vote had been widely observed outside the united states , particularly in lands like australia and britain that had committed troops to support the invasion of iraq in 2003 and had cast themselves as unshakeable allies of the american president with mr bush seen as weakened , his allies feel exposed essentially , the election results provoked two strands of thought , one on its likely meaning for america and the second on where it would leave those like britain s prime minister , tony blair , who have stood close to mr bush it s a little bit difficult to see what impact it will have on blair himself , as he is on the way out anyway , said daniel keohane , a specialist in defense and security matters at the center for european reform , a private policy institute in london but , he said , gordon brown , mr blair s likely successor , has close links to the democrats if it means they will have a chance at the presidency in 2008 , from brown s point of view , that s a good thing , he said mr blair gave no indication on wednesday that british troops would be withdrawn from iraq early indeed , in his most recent public statement , at a news conference on monday , he insisted , like president bush , that the effort in iraq must continue he said iraqis must be supported in creating a nonsectarian iraq in which people from different communities live together and decide their future through democracy and i do n't underestimate for a single instant the difficulties in achieving that , but i still say it is a battle worth fighting at the same time , though , britain s top general , sir richard dannatt , has called for british troops to be withdrawn sometime soon british military planners say the 7 , 000 british troops in southern iraq will leave as soon as iraqi forces are able to take over security duties from them the political antennae of the prime minister will be twitching , said allan gyngell , director of the lowy institute , an international policy research organization in sydney , australia , referring to john howard , the australian leader to the extent that it makes it more difficult for bush to argue his case , to the extent that he is wounded by this , it will disappoint howard it will speed up the planning for us to get out , he added of course , among bloggers and others , there was a residual sense of schadenfreude delight in the tribulations of an american president tripped on his own hubris in adventures seen as endangering the world rather than curbing terrorism i think bush will not be talking as loudly to the world as he has been since 2001 , said a posting signed by faisal ibrahim of oman on a message board on the bbc web site another contributor identified as meg smith wrote , hopefully , it will mean a marginally safer world for my fellow nonamericans ! some web postings looked further ahead , reflecting a sense that the midterm vote had been a rehearsal for the presidential election in 2008 it s time for a clinton government again where usa was liked and respected through out the world , a contributor identified as ted mcdick wrote from baku , azerbaijan come on hillary get your hat in the ring for the next president of the good old usa all of europe wants another clinton not a bush many experts said the vote did not alter president bush s prerogative to determine american policy but some hoped the vote would act as a catalyst for new thinking on iraq , in the united states and europe as the italian foreign minister , massimo d'alema , put it , one cycle is over the cycle of preventative war , of unilateralism , has ended in great failure that s the truth and that s how it is perceived by the american public opinion the time has come , he said , to initiate a new cycle of greater responsibility on the part of europe
ann w richards , the silverhaired texas activist who galvanized the 1988 democratic national convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state s 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named george w bush , died wednesday at her home in austin she was 73 ms richard died , surrounded by her four children , of complications from the esophageal cancer , the associated press reported ms richards was the most recent and one of the most effective in a longline of lone star state progressives who vied for control of texas in the days when it was largely a oneparty democratic enclave , a champion of civil rights , gay rights and feminism her defeat by the future president was one of the chief markers of the end of generations of democratic dominance in texas so cemented was her celebrity on the national stage , however , that she appeared in national advertising campaigns , including one for snack chips , and was a lawyer and lobbyist for public strategies and verner , lipfert , bernhard , mcpherson hand poor george , he ca n't help it , ms richards said at the democratic convention in 1988 , speaking about the current president s father , former president george bush he was born with a silver foot in his mouth her acidic , plainspoken keynote address was one of the year s political highlights and catapulted the oneterm texas governor into a national figure we 're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage , she said , bringing the great tradition of vernacular southern oratory to the national political stage in a way that transformed the mother of four into an revered icon of feminist activism dorothy ann willis was born sept 1 , 1933 , in lakeview , and graduated in 1950 from waco high school where she showed a special facility for debate she attended the girl s mock state government in austin in her junior year and was one of two delegates chosen to attend girl s nation in washington she attended baylor university in waco on a debate scholarship where she met her future husband , david richards after college , the couple moved to austin where she earned a teaching certificate at the university of texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at fulmore middle school she raised her four children in austin she volunteered in several gubernatorial campaigns , in 1958 for henry gonzalez and in 1952 , 1954 and 1956 for ralph yarborough and then again for yarborough s senatorial campaign in 1957 in 1976 , ms richards defeated a threeterm incumbent to become a commissioner in travis county , which includes austin , and held that job for four years , though she later said her political commitment put a strain on her marriage , which ended in divorce she also began to drink heavily , eventually going into rehabilitation , a move that she later credited with salvaging her life and her political career i have seen the very bottom of life , she said i was so afraid i would n't be funny anymore i just knew that i would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor but i did n't recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing in 1982 , she ran for state treasurer , received the most votes of any statewide candidate , became the first woman elected to statewide office in texas in 50 years and was reelected in 1986 in 1990 , when the incumbent governor , william p clements jr , decided not to run for reelection , she ran against a former democratic governor , mark white , and won the primary , then later fought a particularly brutal campaign against republican candidate clayton williams , a wealthy rancher , and won among her achievements were institutional changes in the state penal system , invigorating the state s economy and instituting the first texas lottery , going so far as to buy the first lotto ticket herself on may 29 , 1992 it was her speech to the democratic convention in atlanta , though , that made her a national figure a champion of women s rights , she told the television audience ginger rogers did everything fred astaire did she just did it backwards and in high heels in 1992 , she was chairwoman of the convention that first nominated bill clinton two years later , she underestimated her young republican challenger from west texas , going so far as to refer to george w bush as some jerk , a commend that drew considerable criticism later , she acknowledged that the younger candidate has been much more effective at staying on message and made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected she was beaten , 53 percent to 46 percent her celebrity , however , carried her onto the boards of several national corporations , including jc penney , brandeis university and the aspen institute she also cowrote several books , including straight from the heart my life in politics and other places in 1989 with peter knobler and i'm not slowing down in 2004 , with richard m levine on her 60th birthday , she got her first

plenty of readers , including many teachers , were indignant at my sunday column calling for easier accreditation of teachers in public schools here s a sampling ann writes i taught art with an alternative certification the principal who hired me wanted an artist instead of an art teacher i loved the job i loved the kids after getting my first paycheck i realized i could not make ends meet , or even come close on my teachers paycheck i had to work two jobs when my photo lab bill was more than my take home pay i had to leave teaching so i could support my own children alternative certification is great , but until teachers are paid what they are worth you will never fill the classrooms with the teachers our children deserve , certified or otherwise steve from new york writes i completely agree with your observations in the above cited article schools of education should be abolished i never met a teacher who learned anything useful in an education course i have 40 years experience teaching hs biology caroline writes the reason there are so many requirements for teachers to be certified is to make money for colleges if teachers have to continue to go to school over a thirty year career , colleges make money bottom line i have taught for thirtyfive years you are correct in your observation that we aren t getting the best and brightest young people none of our daughters have gone into teaching pay has to be increased , and the blame has to be put elsewhere for the failure of children by the way , more knowledge doesn t mean a better teacher colin powell would last one day in my inner city second grade he would not have lasted an hour in my eighth grade classes martha from seattle writes unless you re quite wealthy , it s hard to leave a conventional job for a teaching job getting a certificate just isn t that hard it s supporting a family on less than 40 , 000 a year that is when we start paying teachers more , we will have more of them and if we pay them well enough , we will once again attract the best and brightest to the field jack , a principal from fresno , ca , writes perhaps if we increased salaries for teachers , more smart people would be inclined to work in our profession miriam from warwick writes your article confuses the issues first , current teaching programs for the most part fail to yield competent professionals ask any parent in a public school that needs to be fixed the solution to that problem is not uncertified professionals second , most students leave college with enormous debt even if the student wants to teach , teaching salaries are less than adequate to service that debt , so there is no choice about teaching again , the solution is not uncertified professionals it is certainly possible to draft guidelines for advanced degree candidates who are not otherwise certified to teach the truth is that most school districts are opposed to this because the nea , the certified teacher s union , won t agree julie from sturgeon bay , wi writes while meryl streep would likely make a dynamite acting teacher , the idea of solving america s teacher shortage by relaxing certification requirements seems quaint as a teacher , i believe the real issue is our nation s lack of commitment to education we should scrap the moronic no child left behind , take some of our ridiculous military budget and shift it to education , reduce class size by half , and give teachers what they need to do their jobs , including a respectable salary ! respecting professional educators would go a long way towards recruiting gifted teachers

was at the hungarian grand prix last july , but that was the only one he scored in 2005 it makes me proud , said schumacher i wasn t expecting to be on pole the format of the new qualifying system did not let down either it succeeded in its purpose of making the saturday afternoon event more interesting than it has been in recent years after an experiment with a singlelap system despite the more complicated approach of the new knockout formula but it was thanks to an accident by kimi raikkonen in a mclarenmercedes in which the driver was not injured that the session really came to life all began as expected , with the slower cars taking to the track earlier and spending more time running in order to try to ensure they would not get knocked out after the first 15minute session most of the faster cars waited until the last five minutes of the session before they took to the track there had been a sand storm in the morning , and they were waiting for the desert track to be cleaned by the other cars they were also simply preserving their engines when raikkonen finally went out , suddenly , at high speed , his rear suspension broke , the rear of the car hit track and his rear wing broke off he further damaged the car as he spun off , as the rear wheel got tangled under the car and destroyed bodywork the session was stopped while raikkonen drove back to the pits on three wheels , and to give the track marshals time to clean up the debris so it was that last year s championship runnerup will start at the back of the grid for the race on sunday it is very disappointing , said raikkonen i could have been amongst the quickest after his accident , only 4 minutes and 34 seconds remained in the first session , and none of the top drivers had set a time this raised the tension enormously , as it meant that over half the grid had to qualify together most of the drivers then at the front of the grid were in the slower cars , although nick heidfeld held the provisional pole position in his bmwsauber when the session started again the cars lined up at the pit lane exit ready for the start of a virtual race with practically 22 cars on the track they would all desperately try to set their fastest time in order to not be knocked out of the qualifying and start the race from the back end of the grid the group was led by felipe massa in a ferrari with a clear track ahead of him but jenson button drove a faster lap than massa the session was a five minute race , complete with overtaking the winner , stamping his imprint on right from the start , was fernando alonso , the reigning world champion in a renault he finished just ahead of button s honda michael schumacher finished only sixth eliminated from the first session were kimi raikkonen , takuma sato , yuji ide , tiago monteiro , christijan albers and ralf schumacher vitantonio liuzzi was the last of the drivers to qualify for the second session , just behind his teammate , scott speed both drivers were using the controversial powerrestricted v10 engine the 16 remaining drivers prepared to start the second 15minute session , which began at 14 29 liuzzi was the first driver out as with the first session , the faster cars again waited while the slower cars cleaned the track most took to the track again by the last five minutes , although the two renaults went out with only about three minutes left alonso then immediately set the fastest lap of the session eliminated from the last session , were the 11th to 16th placed drivers jacques villeneuve , nico rosberg , david coulthard , jarno trulli , liuzzi and speed the final session , with only the top 10 cars , started at 14 49 for 20 minutes again , the cars lined up in the pit lane before the session started , in order to get on track as quickly as possible after 14 laps each , for massa and schumacher , the brazilian was the faster ferrari driver , holding virtual pole position the german then made a pit stop for a tire change and took the provisional pole with a lap time 33 seconds quicker than massa s massa then went out with six minutes left in the session and bettered schumacher s time by 072 seconds schumacher returned to the track and set a lap 092 seconds faster than massa s massa remained second on the grid , while button took third and alonso finished fourth ferrari s bridgestone tires probably benefited from a cooler track , as qualifying took place with a 21 degree celsius air temperature and a 30degree track but clearly , ferrari is back in strong form it is always very difficult to reverse a negative trend , said schumacher but last year s troubles have had the effect of making the team even more closely knit together
linebacker barrett green and offensive lineman jason whittle were starters for the giants two seasons ago , but neither started a game in 2005 suddenly expendable , they find themselves out of work , at least until the nfl s freeagent signing period begins friday in preparing for the start of the shopping season , and to create a bit more room under the league s salary cap , the giants released green and whittle yesterday they also announced the retirement of the starting free safety brent alexander , which may create the bigger hole in the roster green , expected to compete for the starting weakside linebacker spot , ended each of his two seasons with the giants on injured reserve a knee injury ended his 2004 season after 10 games unable to recover fully in 2005 , green played just one game , on special teams , before being placed on injured reserve again drafted in the second round by the detroit lions in 2000 , green was scheduled to make 2475 million in base salary this season , a 1 million raise from last season whittle , who signed with the giants as an undrafted free agent out of missouri state in 1998 , was a reserve center and guard in his first few seasons before becoming a starter in 2002 he then spent one season with the tampa bay buccaneers before returning to the giants in a trade in 2004 after several linemen were injured he started all 16 games that season , but started none in 2005 , as the giants settled on an interior of left guard david diehl , center shaun o'hara and right guard chris snee whittle was scheduled to make 15 million in base salary this season after earning 950 , 000 in 2005 the giants , who were already under the salary cap , cleared more than 3 million from the cap with the three roster moves but they now need to find a replacement for the 34yearold alexander , who never missed a game in his 12year career undrafted out of tennessee state , he played four seasons with the arizona cardinals , two with the carolina panthers and four with the pittsburgh steelers before signing with the giants in 2004 more steady than spectacular , he started 178 of 192 career games , including all 32 with the giants last season , alexander had four interceptions he had three or four in each of his final six seasons and made 61 tackles earlier this month , rich seubert , a backup lineman , was given a contract extension
president bush is expected to declare the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument today , thereby creating the largest marine reserve on earth the president s decision caps a century of protection efforts by both republican and democratic presidents beginning with theodore roosevelt and including lyndon johnson , ronald reagan and bill clinton but none ever proposed the sweeping level of protection for these islands that is being put in place by the bush administration while we and others in the conservation community have not always agreed with president bush s environmental policies , we believe it is important to acknowledge a significant policy achievement when it occurs and one is about to occur beginning 160 miles northwest of kauai , and extending roughly 1 , 200 miles into the pacific ocean , the uninhabited islands , reefs , shoals and atolls of this archipelago make up one of the most remote and relatively undisturbed coral reef systems in the world the area marked for protection covers roughly 140 , 000 square miles of ocean , larger than all of america s national parks combined almost 70 percent of the tropical , shallowwater coral reefs in american waters are in this one place , together with 7 , 000 species of marine and terrestrial life , a quarter of which are n't found anywhere else more than 14 million seabirds make these islands their home for at least a part of the year , along with the last population of the endangered hawaiian monk seal the president s plan for the monument designation has the distinction of receiving broad support from the hawaiian people and from hawaii s republican governor , linda lingle , who recently closed state waters in the northwestern hawaiian islands everything up to three miles from shore to commercial activities , including fishing many native hawaiians , who consider these islands an important part of their cultural and religious heritage , would also like to see commercial fishing ended in federal waters , which stretch three to 50 miles from shore in the plan to be announced by the white house , commercial fishing will be phased out over five years what s more , the president s action will spur efforts to compensate the few remaining fishermen in the area for surrendering their permits to the government , which would then retire them while it is still too early to know whether these efforts will be successful , such a buyout package would provide for an early end to fishing in the archipelago and offer reasonable compensation to the fishermen who have earned part of their livelihood there just as we have protected spectacular areas on land from destructive activity , we know it is equally important to do so for the sea the president s announcement is an important step in what we hope will be greater efforts to safeguard the ocean , while also addressing broader problems of overfishing , pollution and habitat destruction there are few opportunities for a president to protect such a large swath of ocean or land at little cost to the government , while garnering strong regional support this is one , and we applaud mr bush for taking the initiative to preserve one of the world s most spectacular marine environments
click on more for our live coverage of the match between portugal and iran today in frankfurt , which gets underway at 9am est , described by rob mackey postgame wrap that was much better from portugal even though their second was from the penalty spot , it was wellearned by lots of pressure and they didn t sit back for a minute after scoring to go ahead they kept possession and pushed forward making both their fans in the waldstadion and your matchtracker happy iran showed they re no pushovers , but in the end they lacked the quality to really take it to portugal now they just have one last crack at a victory before they leave germany that s all from the lower manhattan part of frankfurt thanks for joining us and be sure to return here for the match at noon est \( sorry , there s been some confusion here about that starting time , espn s coverage starts at 11 30 but the game is at 12 \) between the swashbuckling czechs and ghana the one and only jeff z klein is at the controls for that one one final note for completists after yahya golmohammadi was taken off by the medical staff , he was replaced in the 89th minute by sohrab bakhtiarizadeh his saba battery tehran teammate , but perhaps you knew that 90 6 now the ref gives up and blows for fulltime that s it portugal are through and iran has yet to beat anyone in the world cup but the us in 1998 they ll have just one more shot at it , against angola in what will probably be the last match of the tournament for both teams iran s out and angola needs portugal to hammer mexico and hammer iran themselves or they will also be on the plane home 90 6 portugal nearly get the goal the ref has been waiting for , as first petit whips in a shot that s parried by the keeper and then ronaldo slots in a returning cross , but he s just offside 90 4 the ref must be enjoying this more than the iranians , because he won t blow the whistle 90 1 forgot to mention that figo was taken off just a minute ago for benfica s sim o 90 portugal s keeper , ricardo , mangles a long ball , badly missing an attempted header , but iran makes nothing of it 89 nearly 3 ! ! ronaldo hooks in the free kick and almost squeezes it in at the near post side net 88 golmohammadi is finally off , and down the tunnel to the locker room , having been shown a yellow card on his way off 85 ronaldo with a beautiful piece of skill he chests the ball and turns to follow it and then on the break is blocked down by yahya golmohammadi aafter ronaldo poked the ball past him and was headed towards the goal both tumble to the ground close to the left edge of the box , where all of iran s troubles have begun today 84 now iran are in serious trouble , as several minutes of passing it about by portugal s stars shows players as technically accomplished as this can kill a game off without sitting back they can move it all around the pitch 79 gooooooooooooaaaaaaallllllllllaaaaaaazzzzo ! ! ! portugal 20 ! a penalty by ronaldo after figo was fouled in the box by iran s captain yahya golmohammadi the man who scored against mexico has now given portugal a goal here 78 iran break and zandi puts in a great cross for hashemian who powers a header at goal , but straight at the keeper ricardo that was their best chance of the day 77 zandi elscts to whack it off the wall rather than cross to his teammates in the box nothing to write home about for the midfielder born in germany to a german mother and iranian father who flirted with the idea of trying to play internationally as a german before committing himself to iran 76 spurred on by that comment from me , zandi gets the ball down by the box and wins a free kick 75 it s mostly potrugal now with the ball 73 now kaebi wins a yellow card for not letting ronaldo make a total fool of him , knocking the young star to the ground as he s about to go past the defender 72 quite a poor corner , back to the top of the box leads to a near break for iran but there s a foul and portugal regain possession 71 ronaldo runs down the left and wins a corner deco hits it short of the near post and its headed out for another go 69 no sooner is he on than khatibi should ve scored ! he gets on a long ball near the goal on the left and shoots too late across the face of the goal should have mentioned , sub for portugal maniche is off for petit 67 sub iran brings on a fresh attacker , rasoul khatibi of sepahan isfahan , for mehrzad madanchi 66 ronaldo mishits the freekick and it flares past both pauleta and the far post 65 now ronaldo s tripped up on the very spot figo passed to deco from , left of the box free kick sub ferydoon zandi , who plays for kaiserslauten in the german bundesliga , comes on for ali karimi 63 goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllaaazzzzzzzooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! portugal 10 figo to deco right above the box and he pummels it in ! 62 yellow card to costinha for a trip on madanchi free kick cleared by ronaldo who appers to have been aiming at the retractable roof 61 figo puts in a not very good shot that doesn t trouble mirzapour 59 deco is down the ref couldn t care less and play goes on 57 mehdi mahdavikia pops up from nowhere , like his namesake , and gets in front of goal then he decides to pass it to the portuguese keeper instead of shoot for some strange reason 55 mirzapour ! a great save from ronaldo at his near post but can he keep it up \? 54 ronaldo s back heel flip does not please shep messing on espn i m not picking any fights , but the idea that a flashy play that does not lead to a goal is just showing off is not really fair this is part of how portugal s attackers work when it does lead to a goal critics will change their tune 51 now iran is pressing , but nuno valente forces hashemian to knock it out for a goal kick iran more threatening now not to their neighbors , mind you , but to portugal s secret world cup hopes 48 deco gives nosrati a good look at his studs , facehigh , and the ref rewards him with a closer look at his yellow card  46 we re off again from the readers not much in the wy of comments from readers this morning , perhaps becuase its just now 7am in la where most of the us s iranian community is located , but checking the email i see that steven sono from sierra leone has written in to say that before his unfortunate death , my late father had in his personal account with a bank here in abidjan the sum of 128m apparently he needs some help with moving it around the world anyone out there want to help him \? halftime analysis here s my analysis if secret world cup favorites portugal are going to advance today , they ll need to score soon or iran could make one of those set pieces or long balls work and then the team of allstars lead by figo could be in real trouble against saba battery tehran s finest in fact , this kneejerk assumption , that stars of the european leagues should easily handle professionals from less wellregarded domestic leagues like iran , is obviously unfair the iranians can play , and they ve now stayed with two good teams in the first halves of both matches here in germany 45 3 that s it for the half and the portuguese fans are not pleased boos and whistles as they walk off for a little break from not scoring 45 2 forgot to mention , ronaldo just a minute ago , juggled the ball , literally , up in the air on his foot in the box remarkable stuff , though it lead to nothing much 45 pauleta is booked yellow card what for \? looked like nothing to me 44 deco releases miguel on the right he bosts into the box and forces a save from mirzapour , that just gets past pauleta at the far post that was close 43 speaking of dangerous miguel is down hard after a clash of heads with nosrati as they both go fora vall in the portuguese half 42 figo gets back and knocks the ball out on the left of portugal s goal before it can reach hashemian in the box iran looking more dangerous now 40 ronaldo hacked down as he starts a run by kaabi 38 iran attack up the right nuno valente blocks down a shot from outside on the right 37 figo is off briefly after taking some studs in the face i m not sure from whom , ut then figo might not know either 35 ronaldo ! ! a great shot just into the side netting on the right he created space in the box with his footwork and launched a rocket with is left foot he could ve had two in the last 90 seconds 34 figo is tackled by kaabi a corner and ronaldo just misses scoring as his header atowards goal is chested away by kaabi at the near post 32 madanchi pulls down ronaldo , yellow card after the free kick ronaldo dribbles and then makes a poor cross 31 a shot off the bar from teymourian , but he was offside 30 there s ronaldo complaining to the official on the side after he runs off the edge right in front of him he s on a yellow from the last match , better watch that temper 29 corner for portugal on the left ricardo carvalho nods it narrowly wide 26 figo charges up and gets it to ronaldo on the right , his step over gets him some space and he misses from a tough angle 24 mahdavikia swings it in and its just punched away by ricardo several white shirts were close to heading it in hashemian was nearly there 23 nosrati , the defender , pushes forward and steals a pass from miguel the iranians break and win a free kick after a trip 22 vahid hashemian nearley gets on a long ball in the box but meira is there for portugal 21 deco goes on a run up the middle and only just misses picking out pauleta charging up the left just offside 20 yelllow card to nekounam for taking down figo near the middle of the pitch 18 long , long ball from nosrati picks out portugal s keeper ricardo rather than any iranian 16 deco is fouled while putting some fancy footwork in on the right of the box figo swings the kick back to maniche above the box and it s a long blast , just deflected over by the defense 14 now up the other end a long ball gets to madanchi who nearly gets loose for a shot but he can t control it 13 figo pokes the ball in to deco in front of goal on the left and his shot is put over by mirzapour nice save on a shot from pointblank range 12 iran s free kick gets the ball to the head of javad nekounam , who knocks it wide of the right post 10 miguel , the defender brings the ball into the box on the right and takes a shot that s easily blocked iran briefly get up the other end and win a free kick but then portugal counter and ronaldo sets up constinha for a shot in the box that s blocked 8 figo brings the ball up the left , and gets it to nuno valente who wins a corner on the left nothing comes out it , unless you count a long offtarget shot 6 a long series of passes by portugal get the ball up to pauleta with his back to goal in the middle , but he s tackled right away nothing there but portugal have all of the ball right now 3 portugal are in their portcolored strip , iran in all shiite , i mean white 1st minute figo gets in the box on the right after 20 odd seconds , cuts it back for deco and he does less well than his namesake , the lead singer of the committments , might ve kickoff ! prematch build up 8 54 am est the teams come out on the pitch and first we have a rousing singalong of the fairly sombersounding portuguese national anthem i notic that the retractable roof today is closed above the waldstadion apparently tv viewers around the world watching the first match played here , englandparaguay , had the same feeling i did about the shadows on the pitch and the giant alien space spider now the less rousing iranian anthem and we re ready to go ! 8 50 am est not that he has much more to say about the iranian team in detail than me , or luis figo , but the brilliant iranian filmmmaker , abbas kiarostami has a column on the fifa web site in which he opines i would love it if iran made it to the round of 16 we need something to cheer about 8 40 am est welcome back to our live blog coverage of deutschland 2006 rob mackey here in the times playbyplay booth , within 4 , 000 miles of the action at the waldstadion in frankfurt , germany yes , that s the one with the retractable roof supported by a webbed grid of steel wires that , when it s open and the sun is shining , does make it look to tv viewers as if a giant space alien spider is hanging out above the park , watching the match i ll be bringing you updates on today s crucial group d match between portugal , who looked like worldbeaters for the first 6 minutes of their 10 victory over angola in their opening match , and iran , who will be fighting just to stay in the tournament after a trying 31 loss to mexico in nuremberg the match starts at 9am est , so grab a coffee and get set and home subscribers to the new york times don t go straight for arts leisure or check out the magazine right now , we ve got some business to attend to here first to stay on top of developments once we re underway , remember to click refresh or hit f5 compulsively to get the latest part of this report if you ve got something to say that s relevant , or irrelevant and somehow flattering to me , please do say it , either by taking advantage of the comments box below or by sending us an email at worldcup nytimescom a look at the teams portugal , described by the iranian news agency as secret world cup favorites , will be back at fullstrength today as deco , barcelona s other playmaker , returns from an ankle injury that kept him out of the opener , and 21 yearold cristiano ronaldo has apparently recovered from the muscle strain that kept him out of training on thursday iran s croatian coach , branko ivankovic , expects to see portugal attack with two wingers in a 4231 formation which just goes to show he s been reading el mundo online , since that s exactly how they picture portugal lining up for this game , in a fine grafico preview , here  but perhaps portugal s brazilian coach , luiz felipe \( big phil \) scolari , has been telling his friends back home something different , because globo expects to see a 442 attack , looking like this  however they arrange themseleves , here s the team that will start for portugal \( along with the club sides that pay their generous wages when they re not representing their nation \) 1 ricardo \( sporting lisbon \) 13 miguel \( valencia \) 5 fernando meira \( stuttgart \) 16 ricardo carvalho \( chelsea \) 14 nuno valente \( everton \) 6 costinha \( atl tico madrid \) 18 maniche \( chelsea \) 7 lu s figo \( inter milan \) 20 deco \( barcelona \) 17 cristiano ronaldo \( manchester united \) 9 pauleta \( paris saintgermain \) iran will be taking on portugal for the first time ever in competition today and portugal s captain , luis figo , has been telling reporters i know little about the team the iranians will field i have to admit i don t either , but if inter milan star luis figo is brave enough to admit that he doesn t follow the iranian domestic league closely enough to know whether defender yahya golmohammadi will be able to repeat the form he showed this season for saba battery tehran here in the world cup , why should i stay up all night studying persianfootballcom for clues \? who do you think i am , martin reza babry \? if el mundo has it right , brankovic will line up his players in a 442 , centered on his trio of players from the german bundesliga this could change though if the iranians go behind and need to introduce veteran striker ali daei , who has a sore back , befitting a player born in the 1960s , or ferydoon zandi , their germanborn midfielder , just back from injury here s the starting xi luis figo will have to come to grips with in a hurry \( along with the club sides who pay their no doubt less generous wages \) 1 ebrahim mirzapour \( foolad ahvaz \) 4 yahya golmohammadi \( saba battery tehran \) 13 hossein kaabi \( foolad ahvaz \) 5

21 mehrzad madanchi \( abu moslem \) 8 ali karimi \( bayern munich \) the referee keeping an eye on the proceedings at at the waldstadion today will be eric poulat , of france both coaches , you should know , have a pretty good idea of what works in the world cup branko ivankovic was an assistant to miroslav blazevic when he lead croatia to third place at the cup in france in 1998 and big phil scolari was in charge of a brazilian quad that did pretty well 4 years ago in korea and japan what s at stake just this if portugal wins , they re through to the next round no matter what , and if iran loses , they re out that s why luis figo promises that his side will treat this match like a final globo figo diz que jogo contra ir ser como uma final even if it s a final against a team that has only won a single game in the world cup , ever i ll leave it to you to figure out what hapless nation team melli managed to defeat , and to name the coup that may have given them extraincentive to press forward for the winner one clue , that victory was recent enough that the man who scored the deciding goal is in the iranian team today , none other than mehdi mahdavikia
we were not the first mother and daughter to be arguing over an inheritance i do not feel you have the right to make decisions for my children and my sister s children , and for our children s children , my daughter elisabeth wrote to me i imagine myself as a mother and i know that i would have chosen a very different way of handling the great treasure you were given this battle was not about money , or jewelry , or real estate we were at odds over faded pieces of paper , a precious archive of letters and photographs that were mailed to my mother , sala kirschner , during her five years in nazi slave labor camps she had kept the secrets of these letters for nearly 50 years , breaking her silence only when she was about to undergo cardiac surgery in 1991 until the day she gave me the letters , neither my father , a gi from new york who met the beautiful young survivor named sala garncarz soon after liberation , nor my two brothers knew any more than i did about her once large family , her experiences in the camps or the hundreds of letters that she preserved at great risk my mother recovered from the surgery in the following years , through close reading of the letters and our many conversations , i became acquainted with sala as a young girl , a daring teenager who volunteered for a sixweek posting to a nazi labor camp , taking the place of her sister raizel in the belief that she would get to see something of the world beyond sosnowiec , poland sala s six weeks stretched into five years raizel was her most faithful correspondent in more than a hundred letters , she cherished , admonished and soothed her youngest sister , until raizel , too , was deported , and then nearly killed on a 280mile forced march in the winter of 1945 i also found dozens of love notes from an ardent suitor named harry haubenstock , who gave sala his baby pictures and managed to have a photograph of the two of them taken inside the labor camp there were 31 letters from her friend and mentor ala gertner , whose strength , optimism and intelligence seemed to leap off the pages ala was not only my heroine , but also an important historical figure in 1945 , just three weeks before liberation , she was hanged at auschwitz , one of four women punished for smuggling gunpowder that fueled the only armed uprising at the camp for 10 years , i researched the story behind the letters at the same time , together with my husband , i navigated a complicated life with our three children and two careers i tried to strike a reasonable balance , but sometimes the letters drifted to the back of my mind besides , i was not exactly sure what to do next with them my aunt raizel s death in 2002 jolted me awake for too long , the letters had languished in my closet , nearly as silent they had once been in my mother s house sala had been motivated by fear that the weight of her sad history would compromise her new life in america or poison her children make us somehow not normal as time passed , we no longer needed that protection my next step became obvious finding a permanent home for the collection with my mother s permission , i consulted dozens of libraries and museums and eventually agreed to donate the original letters to the new york public library news of the decision set off a storm of opposition from my children in their view , these letters must never leave the family the needs of nameless strangers , whether historians or the general public , were none of their business they rejected any concern about the physical preservation of the archive , vowing that they would learn how to take care of the delicate papers my proposal to give them high quality digital copies elicited their deepest scorn , as if technology could substitute for the real thing my daughters grew so hot in their objections that one night i took the letters from their usual place and hid them in an empty suitcase , feeling absurd , yet genuinely anxious about thieving children their siege led to unforeseen revelations my father revealed in 2004 that he , too , had a box of letters , bigger than bubbe s , he boasted and it was indeed a bigger box , crammed full of his wartime correspondence within this second box , we eventually found another 56 letters and documents including a diary that sala had kept in the first few weeks of her imprisonment \( why these had been separated from the others remains a mystery \) with the help of this new discovery , we reached a compromise although almost all of the letters became part of the new york public library s permanent collection , i retained enough to give one to each of sala s children , her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren on the night before we delivered the original letters to the library , my daughter caroline turned over each one , as if saying goodbye to a dear friend forever i had been caught unawares in some strange mutation of the echo boom at the very moment that i defined a path for myself , my children came of age as thirdgeneration survivors , confronting their grandmother s history , claiming it and demanding their independence their campaign forced me to acknowledge that more than a little egotism had crept into my decisions over the years my mother had given her letters to me , but my exclusivity was limited it had taken me more than a decade to solve the mysteries of what happened to the nearly 80 correspondents who had written to sala , and to answer the questions of how and where she had received these letters i had taken an active role in the planning of the first public exhibition at new york public library , and i wrote the first book on the letters , sala s gift , which was also my first book yes , i had certainly earned the distinction of being the storyteller with special standing but i would not be the only one the voices of the letters called to me not only because they led my family out of the shadows but also because they emanated from rare historical documents a bridge to history , a time capsule , the letters opened up a direct encounter with my mother s past raw and powerful in their immediacy , the writers' words , even their handwriting , exposed the gradual disintegration of individual lives now my children were listening carefully , not only hearing the darker notes , the heartrending grief of mothers , fathers and children , the sounds of holocaust and war , but also the poignant and unforgettable messages of hope , love and humanity that sustained one young girl photo legacy top

to the editor our elected officials and the political process could benefit from a healthy discussion of the context and misjudgments in the alien and sedition acts , japaneseamerican internment and mccarthy scare tactics this is less likely to occur if we are asked to stake our nation and our lives on comparisons between the current terrorist threat and largely nonanalogous events that occurred 50 or more years ago before the internet , cellphones , plastic explosives , portable nuclear weapons and the rise of islamic radicalism nor is a balanced debate stimulated by joseph j ellis s assertion that terrorism places our lives and lifestyles at risk , but does not threaten the survival of the american republic this presumes on the future impact of terrorism , an area in which none of us should feel much confidence in our own clairvoyance steven a grossman silver spring , md , jan 29 , 2006

none of the paintings in american scenery different views in hudson river school painting , now showing at the samuel dorsky museum of art , are the pictures by which any of the artists here are remembered at first glance , then , this sprawling group portrait of the movement that defined 19thcentury american landscape art seems entirely beside the point it is a collection of minor works but if you linger a little and take the time to acquaint yourself with some or all of the 116 paintings on display , i think that , like me , you will be pleasantly intrigued not only do these paintings embody a sentimental concept of life that is now largely defunct , but they also show us that hudson river school painting was far less homogenous and bland than is often widely assumed the hudson river school is championed in art history textbooks as the first american school of painting it took root with thomas cole , an expatriate englishman , in the 1820 s along the banks of the hudson river , near catskill , and then flourished more or less unimpeded until about 1875 when the rise of cities , industrialization and modernity began to attract the attention of our most talented artists judith hansen o'toole , the curator and the exhibition s organizer , has grouped the paintings according to several themes , each reflecting a subject of recurring interest to several generations of hudson river school painters among these themes are seasons , man s impact on nature , weather conditions , atmosphere and mood , nature without man and man s activities in nature pleasure the exhibition begins , fittingly , with paintings by thomas cole and his student frederick church , the movement s heavy hitters but these are the only two paintings in the entire exhibition that do n't depict american scenery , which i guess reflects the limitations of the anonymous private collection from which the paintings are drawn it illustrates one of the recurring problems of themebased collection shows the cole and church paintings \( elegant sunset scenes of ruins in a landscape \) nonetheless establish a useful art historical context for the exhibition through their deference to european precedents for both landscape painting techniques as well as subject matter it particularly relates to the european tradition of romantic or sublime landscape painting centered on the worship of nature nature was something of a religion to the hudson river school painters they worshiped it through the depiction of scenes of natural beauty , awe inspiring in their intensity and grandeur , like rugged snow peaks , glowing sunsets , rainbows and strange atmospheric effects their ambition was to give viewers the impression of an encounter with a vast , spiritual space nearly untouched by man a delightful example of this type of painting is james augustus suydam s little circularshaped canvas sunset landscape \( no date \) , depicting a dramatic sunset viewed from a mountaintop falling over a distant , dense forest it is a peaceful , panoramic scene , conjuring up the vastness of nature we stand in awe of the scene , much like the single observer that the artist has painted into the foreground other artists sought to depict human encroachment into this untamed wilderness sanford robinson gifford s lake twilight \( 1861 \) fits this bill , depicting a mountain lake bathed in dramatic redyellow sunlight in the foreground a lone pioneer struggles to remove a deer carcass from his canoe , emphasizing , the conflict between man and nature , ms hansen o'toole writes in the catalog the changing seasons and weather conditions and the play of light at different times of day were popular subjects for the hudson river school artists two beautiful paintings from 1857 by homer dodge martin illustrate this theme , depicting saranac lake in the adirondacks at different times of day they are not brilliantly painted , but are among the show s most pleasing pictures john frederick kensett s mount chocorua \( 1857 \) is another top painting , as is asher brown durand s woodland interior \( circa 1855 \) , which spawned a legion of imitations , several of which are here these two artists were among the most talented of the group associated with the movement , and it clearly shows each of their works shows a commanding technique and an intuitive grasp of light and color the exhibition s final room is devoted to interpretations of the same scene by different artists jasper francis cropsey s delightful oil sketch of lake george stands out from the rest the artist himself and his wife , as figures on a boat , leisurely cruising the lake one afternoon in late fall the wilderness has been tamed american scenery different views in hudson river

black themes from fox twentieth century fox home entertainment has released three blackthemed films that provide an interesting counterpoint to the three titles released last week by warner home video the warner bunch has its feet planted firmly in the prewar era of racial relations the group comprised king vidor s 1929 hallelujah , the marc connellywilliam keighley green pastures of 1936 and vincente minnelli s transitional musical , cabin in the sky , of 1943 \( cabin in the sky was an mgm production but now belongs to the warner library \) the fox collection begins with andrew stone s 1943 stormy weather , which gave lena horne the leading role she earned with cabin in the sky , followed by the curious 1949 pinky , in which the director elia kazan replaced john ford , and the 1957 island in the sun , a multistory melodrama in the sprawling tradition of early cinemascope directed by robert rossen \( all the king s men , 1949 \) the warner titles take place in segregated worlds plausibly so in the case of hallelujah , with its documentarylike portrait of life in the rural south , but with recourse to fantasy and theatrical stylization in green pastures and cabin , both of which were based on broadway hits if one way of getting around the cruel fact of segregation in america was to pretend that black and white were separate worlds that never crossed , that fiction became impossible to maintain once america entered world war ii and black as well as white americans were scooped up into the service stormy weather though stormy weather unabashedly celebrated lena horne as a powerfully attractive performer , permitting a pinup sexuality that crossed racial lines , the film is fatally divided between the hideously dated minstrelshow tradition of black entertainment , as represented by the film s ostensible star , the great vaudeville dancer bill \( bojangles \) robinson , and the sophistication of the harlem nightclub scene , as embodied by ms horne , cab calloway , fats waller , the nicholas brothers and \( from the realm of high art \) katherine dunham and her dancers rural shuck and jive uneasily coexists with uptown elegance under the oblivious direction of andrew l stone , and the quick of eye will be able to spot the legendary jazz musicians benny carter , illinois jacquet and coleman hawkins among the band members though still , no white faces appear , even as the film drifts inexorably from 125th street to times square pinky pinky was released a year after president truman s order to integrate the army the film does reflect the racial tensions as it struggles to imagine black and white characters inhabiting the same world and the same frame but the script , by dudley nichols \( ford s man \) and the highminded philip dunne from a novel by cid ricketts sumner , must resort to the evasive device of an i passed for white plot , casting jeanne crain as the lightskinned granddaughter of ethel waters though crain is given a white lover \( the perennial second lead william lundigan \) , physical contact between the two actors is limited in a way that seems careful not to shock audiences of the period , despite the clear visual evidence that both performers belong to the same gene pool the film seems even to shift its opprobrium away from institutionalized racism to crain s character s uppitiness , suggesting that her resentment of the southern establishment \( represented by the dying matriarch ethel barrymore \) is something she must learn to overcome island in the sun by the time of rossen s island in the sun , the social problem picture of the 40 s had mutated into the social panorama of the late 1950 s those sprawling melodramas , their vision somehow fostered by the expansively wide screen of cinemascope , that followed different sets of characters through parallel plot lines set on the fictional west indian island of santa marta , island could now imagine interracial romance , though with certain precautions the visiting aristocrat \( stephen boyd \) can pursue a romance with the planter s daughter \( joan collins \) , even though the script insists that she had a black jamaican grandmother but the militant local politician , played by harry belafonte , is not allowed to embrace \( onscreen , at least \) the older white woman , joan fontaine , with whom he seems to be having an affair it s no problem , though , for a british officer \( john justin \) to pursue and even propose to an island woman \( dorothy dandridge , underused as always \) the standards are double , if not triple , drawing on age as well as gender and race island in the sun ultimately belongs to james mason , playing another of the tortured neurotics who became his specialty in the 1950 s \( a star is born , bigger than life \) as the weak scion of the local plantation family , he begins to selfdestruct when he learns that he , too , has some black ancestry , and his anxieties lead him to murder the film is no classic , but its ideological contortions make for fascinating viewing , as does , on a more practical level , the ravishing widescreen work of the great british cinematographer f a \( freddie \) young the three fox titles are 1998 each none are rated vidas secas released in 1963 , nelson pereira dos santos s vidas secas \( barren lives \) is often cited as a predecessor of brazil s rich cinema novo tradition , though this tough , dry , determined film has little in common with the stylistic exuberance displayed by later cinema novo directors like glauber rocha \( antonio das mortes , 1969 \) set in the early 1940 s in brazil s impoverished northeast , a setting filmed by pereira dos santos as a land of desiccation and despair , where the spindly scrub brush pokes up through the dry earth like skeletal fingers , the film tells of a small peasant family briefly permitted to live in a rundown ranch house and to tend cattle very little actually occurs in the course of vidas secas , which has led some critics to compare it to the existential conundrums of samuel beckett , set in a similar barren world in which the characters , inexplicably , are driven to keep on keeping on but pereira dos santos is no cold , distant absurdist this is a film full of emotions , most of them almost unbearable \( as when the father is forced to kill the ailing family dog \) the dvd edition is another excellent release from the newly energized new yorker films , featuring an appropriately highcontrast blackandwhite transfer , a discussion by the new york university professor robert stam and a whimsical short about the making of the film , baleia the dog , in which we learn to our great relief that the dog \( real name piaba \) survived the shoot and even attended the film

we have arrived once again at black history month , that time of year devoted to the remembrance and celebration of all things african american as something like a public duty or civic penance , depending on one s view pbs is rolling out african american lives , a fourhour special by henry gates turner classic movies will devote a day to sidney poitier , ethel waters and paul robeson public service announcements on many radio stations will remind us about the lives of great black americans an inventor or a civil rights lawyer who most of the public has never heard of bookstores will prominently display books by black authors or about black people in their windows school children will be told about the glories of the civil rights movement for 28 days the red , white and blue will be swathed in the red , black and green flag of black liberation and here i am at the new york times is it all pass , having separate space on the calendar about blacks \? does it all smack of a kind and gentle form of jim crow \? or , looked at another way , why celebrate this particular minority group without celebrating others \? why not a chinese american history month , a filipino american history month , an italian american or irish american history month \? why are blacks the exceptionalist group among american nonwhite and european minorities \? when i was a boy my irish and italian friends reminded me that their ethnic groups did not try to have columbus day or st patrick s day extended into weeklong celebrations \( this was in the 1960 s , before negro history week became black history month \) i always replied by saying , why not \? there are a lot of weeks in the year that aren t doing anything detractors of various political persuasions argue variously 1 \) black history month is assigned to the shortest month of the year , a sign that our nation does not really take it seriously 2 \) african american history ought to be discussed throughout the year , not just during one month 3 \) black history month reduces african american history to contributions made to a larger history of the nation it becomes a subhistory , a history contingent on the larger narrative of white history 4 \) black history month is divisive , part of the fragmentation and multiculturalization of american history , where every group must have its own version of history and cannot share a common one taking these objections in turn the creator of this commemoration , carter g woodson , who earned a phd in history from harvard and became one of the most prolific african american historians ever \( though , with his crabbed writing style , never the easiest to read \) , chose the second week in february for negro history week in 1926 because of the birthdays of abraham lincoln \( feb 12 , which , when i was a kid , was a national holiday \) and frederick douglass \( feb 14 \) , although , of course , douglass never really knew when he was born lincoln s birthday was clearly the more important because it tied african american history to the one white person who could make it a transcendent topic of human importance to both blacks and those whites who cared about this issue at all could he have chosen a better month \? thirty one days hath july and august but negro history week was primarily for school children and most didn t go to school during those months in december , it would have been overshadowed by christmas in march or april , easter might fall january may have been good the emancipation proclamation was issued on the first day of 1863 but woodson didn t want the week tied to a particular historical act he wanted instead to emphasize the larger historical issues of the union and the process of social transformation that lincoln as a historical figure made possible in short , he wanted to place the week in such a way that blacks would seem present at the creation of a new society , indeed , their condition being the cause of it as historian paul johnson has asserted , the civil war made the united states a nation so why not tie it to lincoln \? the week was expanded to a month in 1976 and there seemed to be little reason to change it at that point to another , longer month the argument that black history month in fact segregates black history misses two points first , that blacks , on the whole , rightly or wrongly , feel their history is sufficiently precarious actively suppressed as it was for a good part of the 20th century to merit a guaranteed space on the national calendar to ensure discussion of it the very nuisance quality of the occasion , which some disparage , is the very element that makes it of some cultural and historical importance to blacks they have always had to assert themselves as a nuisance group in order to achieve much of anything in this country for some , to say that black history should be integrated into the fabric of american history in some way denies the power of black history as a political polemic second , it can also be argued the segregation of the month only serves to remind the nation as a whole about how segregated blacks have been in our national life , a point that should not be forgotten most nationalist or afrocentrist types disparage any vision of a history built on contributions this perspective asserts that black people have a whole , organic history independent of any purely american context or american understanding as a radical friend told me in the 1970 s , there are no sub realities there are only competing realities minority classification fatigue is understandable , but it also takes on more than a little of the quality of majority envy it is hard to say whether woodson saw negro history week as contributionism , it is unlikely , judging from the miseducation of the negro , woodson s most popular and accessible book , which legitimated for many blacks the idea that history is nothing more than political propaganda that either works for or against one s selfinterests but contributionism is obviously only a strategy , a way for an outside group with relatively limited power to work its way toward intellectual and emotional ownership of the majority s history a sense of ownership of america and of its institutions , something blacks were denied for most of their history in this country , is essential for their future here some conservatives have argued that black history month is divisive , part of the leftist pluralist vision of american history there is actually very little to support this view black history month is part of a push for inclusion , not separation its pluralist bent was only a recognition of the racism that forced the study of black people to be a separate academic and civic enterprise there have been separatist moments among american blacks during the 1850 s , for instance , and again during marcus garvey s heyday in the early 1920 s \( a holdover from the 1890 s \) , and later during the black power era of the late 1960 s but african americans on the whole have displayed far less of a separatist temperament than the french in canada or the basques in spain or the koreans in japan after world war ii or many other groups around the world the creation of negro history week and , later , black history month , has probably done a great deal to ensure a sense of black civic pride and commitment what i think irritates some conservatives is not that the occasion is separatist but rather that blacks , through it , make a persistent claim to a form of exceptionalism as both a minority group and historical victims but what makes them exceptions is slavery and some would argue that if black history month reminds the nation of slavery , it is doing a good service , for that is a topic most of us would rather forget it might be thought from all of this that i am , on the whole , favorably disposed to black history month , and that this piece is a defense of it but actually , i am not as a boy , i remember negro history week as pain and embarrassment booker t washington , george washington carver , harriet tubman , mary mcleod bethune , and a few other historical blacks were trotted out by stern black teachers in what seemed to be nothing so much as a fit of racial piety that lacked both conviction and purpose and , alas , there was the subject of slavery , which no one could make sense of except that for some mysterious reason white folk enslaved blacks and for an equally mysterious reason , a few hundred years later , decided to free them as a boy , none of this seemed heroic , interesting or even intelligible it only made me wonder how i was supposed to relate to black people and why that is , what did this past , such as it was , have to do with me \? black history month , or negro history week , was the institutionalization of uplift , which i hated , as i was subjected to it almost daily in some form or fashion the preoccupation with uplift seemed to prove to me that blacks had swallowed their own sense of inferiority why was i being burdened with that problem \? the tale of people obsessed with their inferiority , with being cured , was no kind of historical narrative that was going to do me any good as a kid so , for a long time , i associated black history month with a kind of twobit therapy that tried to turn guilt into pride , that only the persecuted could fashion i was , on that score , always a skeptic
can t wait until tuesday night for the election results \? charlie cook makes his best guess as to what s going to happen in his latest off to the races column at national journalcom the bottom line is that at this stage , republicans should consider themselves lucky if their net losses stay in the 2025 range in the house , four or five seats in the senate , and between five and eight governorships it would be a tough election , losing their majorities in the house and governorships , but it would fall short of the devastating losses that are possible the democrats bestcase scenario in the senate , cook says , is an outside chance of a sevenseat , 5248 democratic majority the republicans bestcase scenario is a loss of four seats for a 5149 majority , but a 5050 senate with vice president dick cheney breaking the tie , or a sixseat gain that would give democrats a 5149 seat majority is most likely as for the house , it would take a miracle for the gop to hold onto their majority the losses look very likely to exceed 20 seats , and a 20 to 35seat loss is most likely , but we would not be surprised for it to exceed 35 seats cook adds perhaps the most remarkable thing about this election is that republicans are having to fight and spend money in states and districts where few democrats have dared tread in recent years , like in idaho01 \( butch otter \) , nebraska03 \( tom osborne \) and nevada02 \( jim gibbons \) while this election started out as largely a fight in northeastern and midwestern suburban districts , the more recent additions to the competitive race lists have been disproportionately small town , rural and small cities , though not as many in the south but many in the west these are districts that may have sent large numbers of their sons and daughters into iraq , take a dimmer view of immigration , don t believe in deficits and are most disheartened by scandals out west , some republicanvoting conservatives who have a strong libertarian streak have grown uncomfortable with the direction of their party of late , with their government should stay out of our lives philosophy applying to social and cultural issues as well north , south , east or west , suburban , small town or rural , different voters are responding to different stimuli and none of them good for the party in power
reported cases of lyme disease in the metropolitan region rose sharply in 2005 , according to health officials , with increases of 34 percent in connecticut , 23 percent in new jersey and 9 percent in new york state but some counties showed declines westchester had 458 reported cases , a decrease of 39 percent from 2004 on long island , suffolk county , with 542 cases , declined 3 percent , while nassau county , with 122 cases , had an increase of 107 percent fluctuations in case numbers are common , officials said , and the causes are difficult to pinpoint connecticut s increase last year , to 1 , 810 cases , is right within what we 've been seeing historically for the past 15 years , said randall nelson of the infectious disease division of the state department of public health there s variation from year to year contributing factors are food supplies for deer and rodents , which carry the ticks that spread the disease weather \( ticks have a twoyear life span and flourish during warm , wet winters \) and human activity , including prevention efforts and disease reporting midmay to early july is peak season , when about 90 percent of cases are transmitted , officials said the disease often causes a bull seyeshaped rash near a tick bite it can spread through the body if left untreated , causing arthritis , cardiac irregularities and neurological problems reported cases have been increasing over the last decade , experts say , partly because of greater awareness of the disease there s either a real increase or an increase in recognition , and it s probably a combination of both , said dr steven e phillips , the immediate past president of the international lyme and associated diseases society another expert , eddy bresnitz , the state epidemiologist in new jersey , where 3 , 372 cases were reported in 2005 , cited the increased proximity of humans to wildlife there s more and more suburbia constructed closer to parks and areas where there s increased vegetation , he said we have more deer and more deer ticks anyone who walks through leaf litter in the woods or on the edge of fields or lawns this time of year should check regularly for the nymphal stage of the tick , said durland fish , a professor of epidemiology at the yale school of medicine the size of a poppy seed , the tick spreads 95 percent of cases , dr fish said some prevention efforts appear to be working in hunterdon county in new jersey , the rate of reported cases fell almost by half , to 268 per 100 , 000 residents in 2005 from 554 in 1996 for comparison , the rate of lyme disease nationally in 2005 was 67 cases per 100 , 000 people , and it is 274 in the 12 eastern and midwestern states where it is most common , according to the centers for disease control and prevention hunterdon experienced an increase in the number of cases in the 1990 s after the completion of a section of interstate 78 in western new jersey in 1968 led to housing construction and more people moving into deer habitat , said john w beckley , director of the county health department he said some of the recent decline in lyme disease in the county might be attributable to public health efforts that included putting signs in county parks warning visitors to check for ticks distributing fliers about the disease to doctors' and veterinarians' offices , garden centers and schools and publishing a lymeometer in a local newspaper announcing the level of tick danger each week dr andrea gaito , a rheumatologist in basking ridge , nj , in neighboring somerset county , said in midmay that she was already seeing three to four new cases of lyme a week there s more awareness , that s what brings people in early , and that s the good news , she said it makes early diagnosis and treatment so much better as a result , she said , she is seeing fewer cases of chronic lyme disease , which she estimates account for 15 to 20 percent of cases kim uffleman , 49 , of rivervale , nj , suffers from the chronic form of the disease , which she contracted 17 years ago nine months after being bitten by a tick , she was bedridden , and it was two years before ms uffleman , who used to run almost 50 miles a week , could leave her house without help it took her too long , she said , to find a doctor who could give her a clear diagnosis , even though she had had the classic bull seye rash i grieve the loss of my health , and that i had to raise three children while being extremely ill , she said they know nothing except for a sick mother , and that s very difficult she still has headaches , back pain , fatigue , numbness in her hands and burning pain down her arms pat smith , president of the lyme disease association , a national nonprofit group based in jackson , nj , said her group had helped develop two bills now before congress that would provide 100 million for research , education and prevention , in part to develop a definitive diagnostic test people who receive an early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics generally recover and do not develop chronic symptoms but diagnostic tests have only been about 50 percent accurate , ms smith said , adding that she has seen an increase in chronic cases since the disease was identified , because as the number of cases grows , the number of undiagnosed , misdiagnosed and slowly treated cases has also grown some people have to go to dozens of physicians before they get diagnosed , and people are getting delayed or inappropriate treatments , she said linda davis , 42 , of freehold , nj , had misdiagnoses of multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia , among other ailments , before learning she had lyme disease in 2003 she was using a wheelchair when she finally started receiving proper treatment her sons , austin hutcherson , 8 , and myles hutcherson , 6 , also have the disease none of us had the bull seye rash , she said after receiving antibiotics , they are all doing better , though they still have symptoms austin has gastrointestinal problems , and myles has chronic fatigue we try to keep everything normal , she said they 're always playing outside most people do n't even know they have lyme disease ms smith said the lyme disease association was also raising money for an endowed research center at columbia university devoted to chronic lyme disease and supported research into the genome of borrelia burgdorferi , the bacteria that causes lyme disease researchers at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in newark are determining the genetic structure of 17 strains of the bacteria , with help from researchers at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , stony brook university and the university of utah one new jersey researcher , dr steven schutzer , said , knowing the genetic sequence will help in diagnostics , and possibly different kinds of therapeutics despite concerns about the disease , mr beckley , the hunterdon county health officer ,

there is a heroic allure to ridding the planet of a horrible disease forever louis pasteur is famous as the inventor of the vaccine jonas salk is synonymous with the one he created to combat polio in the medical community , doctors like donald a henderson and william foege are honored as the conquerors of smallpox though the dream of eradication continues to animate scientists , doctors and public health officials , the history is at best rocky in the past century , eradication efforts failed against hookworm , yellow fever and malaria today the struggling drive against polio has raised new questions about whether eradication of any disease is achievable , and , if so , whether the cost in terms of effort and dollars would be worth it , given all the other diseases that need attention the latest push began in 1993 , when the international task force for disease eradication , a panel of experts , was convened in atlanta by the centers for disease control and prevention , emory university and the carter center the experts reviewed 95 diseases and identified a handful they believed could be wiped out in a generation or less ancient scourges largely forgotten in rich countries , many of these diseases continue to cause misery and drain resources in the developing world , despite the existence of cures and vaccines yet none have been driven into extinction , inflaming the debate over whether simple control was a more reasonable goal that would allow donors and health professionals to spread their resources to greater benefit for greater numbers advocates of eradication say that it is a worthy goal to root out forever even one source of human misery , and that an unpredictable world offers brief opportunities to do so dr david l heymann , the world health organization director general s representative for polio eradication , noted that if smallpox had not been wiped out a year before the dawn of aids , it might well be impossible now , given that the smallpox vaccine was dangerous for people with compromised immune systems , like those with hiv now we know that there are many people we ca n't vaccinate for smallpox , he said it s very possible we could n't wipe out the disease think of what would have happened if we had n't eliminated smallpox in that window of opportunity a window we did n't even know about others agree as soon as polio is done and polio must succeed i think measles will be taken up , said dr donald r hopkins , of the atlantabased carter center , who heads the international task force for disease eradication but many , like dr henderson , who helped vanquish smallpox , remain doubtful and believe the obstacles to eradication are far greater than advocates admit the siren song of eradication , he says , has led public health authorities to declare goals he considers more evangelical than attainable after the struggle with polio , people will think very hard before taking on another disease , said dr julian loblevyt , executive secretary of the global alliance for vaccines and immunization , a group that includes countries , international organizations and the bill and melinda gates foundation he says that , despite scientific advances , the increased mobility of people and chaos in places like sudan and somalia , where no one can be sure of the status of any disease , make eradication harder today we 're not talking about eradication the way we used to , he said photos a woman with blinding trachoma in ethiopia \( photo by mariella furrer think \) the hands of a leprosy patient in ivory coast

who has n't heard saturday s overture the drone of a leaf blower , the pulse of a power washer , the echo of a distant hammer , the circular saw screaming through a board like an angry velociraptor \? this is the soundtrack of chores for some , it s a wonderful noise , an affirmation of the work ethic and a reassurance that property values are being maintained the formula is straightforward enough you get something done you stand back to admire your neatly stacked lumber or freshly painted fence and badda bing , badda bang your existence has been validated few tasks define the obligations of homeownership like this weekend ritual love it , hate it , none of that matters like gravity , it s the law people tend to fall into several confederacies when it comes to this designated labor those who reluctantly participate , those who attack the day with the zeal of a prussian general and those who avoid the situation altogether michael rothbard , my neighbor on long island , is a prime example of the last sort a child of the city , he grew up believing all chores could be solved by one simple activity you picked up the phone and called the building superintendent after moving to the suburbs and buying a home , he had trouble making the mental adjustment to the requirements of homeownership it was because of his condition , congenital laziness it s a disease there are few known cures for , he says he hires someone to do most of his saturday chores his philosophy is that he works so hard all week that he has already justified his existence michael s realization that saturday chores were not going to be a part of his life came one day two years ago , after his significant other suggested that he should mow the lawn \( she did n't actually ask , but rather only observed that the grass had grown so long that it was dying \) he grudgingly agreed an odyssey of frustration followed first , he wrenched his neck trying to start the mower then , he realized that since it had sat unused for several summers , it probably needed fresh gas while bringing home the fuel , he rounded a corner too fast , tipping the gas can onto the floor of the car , thereby turning it into a potential bomb he arrived home without exploding , but while filling the mower tank , added the wrong mixture of gas and oil after a few more pulls of the cord , the mower unexpectedly roared to life and began ripping up the lawn michael became apoplectic , experiencing a spasm of rage he had not felt since childhood he was not only making himself miserable , he was doing the same to his partner it was an epiphany the emotional cost was simply too great saturday chores , he realized , were meant to be done by others i have not flipped my lid like that since , he said personally , i fall into the first category the unenthusiastic choredoer much of this attitude has to do with my father , a ferocious saturdaychore man he was always up at dawn \( he complained that he could n't sleep because of the birds \) and attacked his tasks so enthusiastically that he often ran out of things to do he also required total family participation never was i allowed a leisurely saturday i 'd rather have you throwing rocks over a fence than sitting around doing nothing , he used to say years later , i reached an internal compromise between my own inclinations and my dad s standards as a result , i do respond to necessary tasks , but only when the situation has reached catastrophic proportions this is why my basement looks like an overstocked goodwill store and my yard has taken on the abused appearance of a jets practice field but i have learned two things to allow myself a relaxed saturday sometimes , and sitting on my backside actually is vastly preferable to throwing rocks over a fence the zealous category of choredoers probably is best exemplified by a second neighbor , pete costanzo pete is the type of guy whose tools are organized his garage is immaculate you can bet money that his lawn will be mowed and his leaves raked , with the bags stacked neatly beside the street i 'll never forget my shock one day when i discovered him scrubbing his garbage cans to me , such receptacles are made to accumulate a certain amount of grunge pete , apparently , was so far ahead in his requisite chores that he had moved on to optional ones i was also a bit stunned after learning that he came over one day when i was n't there and edged my lawn i took no offense this was n't a form of fastidious fascism , i realized , but merely a gesture of affection i chatted with him about the topic one evening he has always liked doing chores sometimes i lie in bed saturday morning and think of all the things i want to do , he said one reason may be his upbringing when he was a kid , he said , his father worked during the week , and doing chores was the only time they spent together now , he does the same with his son , james it s utterly relaxing to me , no matter how tired i am , he said , as crazy as that sounds it does n't sound that crazy to me anymore after our conversation , i realized that to him saturday chores are a way to push back the chaos that threatens to engulf us all they are a way to quantify our small universe a way of marking time in small , satisfying increments maybe that s what my father was trying to do in his own frenetic way this has been my own epiphany i'm trying to adjust my attitude about saturday chores these days i admire pete s faith in fact , i wish i had more of it needless to say , my yard also would look a whole lot better drawing \( drawing by dan page \)
public support for president bush s handling of the war in iraq keeps on plummeting , according to the latest cbs news poll released tonight fewer than onefourth of those polled friday through sunday approved of his iraq war policies , the lowest number ever recorded by cbs seventyone percent the largest percentage ever said the war is going badly just a year ago , about 52 percent felt that way the results of the cbs news poll show that support for mr bush s war policies has changed markedly among republicans and conservatives most of that drop has occurred among the president s base republicans and conservatives last month , 70 percent of republicans approved of how the president was handling the war now , just 47 percent do few democrats and independents approve conservative support for president bush s handling of iraq has also fallen , from 60 percent in november to 34 percent now and for the first time , a majority of americans , 53 percent , believe the united states will not succeed in iraq that figure increased from 45 percent just a month ago cbs news frequently does its polling in conjunction with the new york times , though this poll was a solo effort by cbs the poll respondents also were asked about the bipartisan iraq study group s report , which was issued just last wednesday twentyeight percent hadn t read or heard anything about it of those who had , about 40 percent expect that mr bush will enact few or none of the report s recommendations and about that term , civil war eightyfive percent believe the situation has devolved into a civil war mr bush has begun talking about a new way forward in iraq he met with state department officials today , and plans to receive more briefings from the military before talking to the american public about the new way forward , he said
at 8 30 on a recent morning in west windsor , nj , ken anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car , waiting patiently for a train to pull into the princeton junction station from new york he was not picking anyone up in what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into manhattan , mr anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot there s usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars , and when one of their spots opens up , i make my move , said mr anderson , 34 , of hightstown , nj , who works as an accounts payable supervisor at atari to have any chance for a parking spot , you have to get here before 6 30 in the morning or after 8 for me , parking every day is an adventure earlier that morning , kristan flynn , a 34yearold research associate who lives in princeton , five miles from the station , sped into the parking lot on her bicycle no place to park , she said even the bike racks are nearly all full more than 7 , 000 people board commuter trains each day at the princeton junction station , but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them , according to new jersey transit for mr anderson and the 3 , 767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the west windsor parking authority , the wait can be as long as seven years , officials said another 2 , 833 from west windsor are on a twoyear waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents commuters do n't have many alternatives at nearby stations thirteen miles to the south , the daily lot at the hamilton train station is filled by 6 30 am , and there are no available permits a few miles south , in trenton , the parking garage operator says the 90amonth specials are all taken , leaving commuters the option of paying 8 a day or 135 a month at a time when gov jon s corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the hudson river , at a cost of 72 billion , transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem even now there are not enough parking spaces and the problem is not unique to new jersey parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by metronorth in westchester county and connecticut and by the long island rail road in nassau and suffolk counties in westchester , there are about 26 , 000 parking spaces for 75 , 000 commuters on long island , almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full if we 're growing the commuter rail system , we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains , said jon orcutt , the executive director of the tristate transportation campaign in new york , a mass transit advocacy group it s a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area yet , commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies , like new jersey transit and new york s metropolitan transportation authority , which operates metronorth and the long island rail road , that have failed to keep up with the growing demand the names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles in the meantime , people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and , at princeton junction , even offering nearby homeowners 100 a month to use their driveways gone are what transportation officials call the kiss and ride days , when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night for many families , the parking crunch has created a hardship , particularly for those working parents who ca n't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 am or who would like to put their child on the school bus come september , but ca n't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies , including getting there by bicycle , inline skating , even skateboards in new jersey and across the region , municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations this means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents it also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages , often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community , leading to more traffic adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the bigcity boogeyman is coming , said darius sollohub , a professor at the new jersey institute of technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college s school of architecture it makes them feel that they have become too urban , that they are a city now and no longer a town , mr sollohub said it goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place

paul krugman responds to readers comments on his sept 11 column ,  paul dorell , highland park , ill i just watched dick cheney s latest defense of the invasion of iraq on meet the press emblematic of the bush administration s modus operandi , cheney said he had not read the current senate select committee on intelligence s report even if you buy into cheney s expressed fear of what might happen if the wrong people obtain nuclear weapons and accept that he is acting in good faith , you have to wonder about his decisionmaking ability normally , one is inclined to assume that the heads of government have access to more information than can be released to the public , and are therefore betterinformed than we are regarding military decisions but in this case , the more we learn about the evidence and their reasoning process , the less coherent their thought appears you are right in emphasizing that afghanistan was the appropriate place to focus our energies fortunately much of the world understands that ours is a crude country \( no pun intended \) given to recklessness on occasion , and that the democratic process will eventually sweep out the offending culprits i find it a great shame to be in this predicament in iraq when only a few years ago we were rejoicing the end of the cold war paul krugman cheney s comment was even worse when you bear in mind that the ssci s report was based on a cia report from last year if cheney doesn t know what was in that report , he s negligent indeed but who are we kidding \? we re ruled by people who never , ever admit mistakes mr cheney spent four years claiming , in the teeth of the evidence , that saddam and al qaeda were in cahoots bush himself declared , in his mission accomplished speech , that we had defeated an ally of al qaeda they re not going to admit now that none of this was true franzeca drouin , eugene , ore good morning i remember the excited , optimistic feeling following the early days of the invasion in afghanistan there was such a feeling of commitment , a determination to put this poor desolate land back on its feet , and provide safety , opportunities , justice , economic advantages , education everything that has been so sadly lacking there for so long i even remember the determination to make the kabul zoo modern , humanitarian , and a good place for the animals and the visitors , alike and then , as you so eloquently noted , it all fell apart i can t help but wonder if bin laden has become such a convenient bogeyman for the current administration that there is a preference that he be alive and free to serve as the perfect scapegoat for any horrendous and destructive decisions and policies that they wish to implement news of bin laden s capture , or death , would put a very different spin on activities in the war in iraq , and raise all sorts of questions that would be very awkward to answer and then i wonder if that was the intention all along thank you paul krugman yes , i remember that same feeling that civilization had triumphed over barbarism , and the confidence that we would fix things but it was already obvious by early 2003 that they had screwed up that s one of the reasons i was so opposed to the iraq war we already knew that this administration would make a mess of the war s aftermath , though i never imagined the mess would be this bad but i don t think they deliberately mucked up instead , it s this sort of adolescent behavior the administration consistently exhibits they play with their toys for a little while , then get bored and leave a mess behind
there is a photograph in the new book here comes the sun the spiritual and musical journey of george harrison , joshua m greene s biography of the exbeatle turned spiritual pilgrim taken in 1969 at the radha krishna temple in london during recording of the first popular album of sanskrit mantras , it shows harrison chanting alongside fellow worshipers mr greene is behind him , arms raised exuberantly the image harrison s face is nearly unrecognizable behind a shroud of hair and beard is lightyears from the grinning beatle in the pageboy haircut and tight pants it is also lightyears from mr greene s former self , a child of divorced parents living in manhattan and later a student in paris of french existential literature , who went on to become a documentary filmmaker , an author and an adjunct instructor of religious mysticism at hofstra university the photo portrays the george harrison who devoted his life to the study of hinduism and expressing his spirituality through indian music despite the success of that album and of his 1971 concert for bangladesh , harrison was rejected by fans and critics and generally withdrew from public life long before he died in 2001 , at age 58 , of cancer he s not a beatle anymore , mr greene said of the photo he s a seeker he described himself at that time as a servant of the servant of the servant of god , and that made him most happy here comes the sun \( john wiley sons , 2595 \) describes harrison s spiritual journey , which began on a 1966 trip to india weeks after the beatles' last concert , in san francisco mr greene said his own awakening came three years later after seeing hare krishna devotees chanting at woodstock we baby boomers were a very romantic , very idealistic , often na \? generation , and we left to find paths for ourselves in the world because our parents did n't know how to guide us , mr greene said popular figures like the beatles were their guides , he said when harrison began recording sanskrit meditations , mr greene said , that was a watershed moment during the 1969 winter break from the sorbonne , where he was studying , mr greene visited the temple in london where harrison worshiped and studied and was invited to play the organ and join the chorus he returned to paris , not to read stendahl but the bhagavad gita he shaved his head , donned the saffron robes of a hare krishna devotee and spent the next 13 years living in ashrams he said his childhood was difficult , and an ashram offered a readymade family all of a sudden i had hearth and home with bright , sensitive , peaceful brothers and sisters , he said still , just as harrison rejected organized religion in favor of a more private spirituality , mr greene eventually disengaged from the international society for krishna consciousness i had learned what i needed to learn and felt the time had come for me to exercise that knowledge in a larger world , he said other than a degree in hindu devotional literature , he had few job qualifications and no one would hire him what skills did i have \? sanskrit prayers \? he said his admiration for hindu storytellers led him to a studio that produces children s films and to more than 50 films of his own he married esther fortunoff of the retailing family whose fortune supports a video archive of holocaust survivors' testimony at yale the archivists asked mr greene to help preserve the tapes , and from that grew his 2000 documentary on public television , witness voices from the holocaust , and a book of the same title he then got a call from the widow of a man who prosecuted nazi war criminals at nuremberg a second documentary , justice at dachau the trials of an american prosecutor , was produced by discovery communications , and a book of the same title followed after immersing himself in evidence of concentration camp horrors , mr greene fell into a sort of depression so his wife suggested he look back to his weeks with harrison she said 'you 've always spoken so highly of george harrison why do n't you write about him \? ' he recalled among the thousand books about the beatles , he found none that dealt seriously with harrison s spiritual journey i wanted to tell his story as a thankyou to him and also because i think my generation is ready to rediscover the enthusiasm we knew and which then was lost , he said noting that yoga , meditation and other derivatives of hindu spirituality have achieved enormous popularity since then , mr greene said that harrison was a couple of decades ahead of his time he suffered so much derision because people back then could n't figure out for love or money what he was doing , mr greene said it was sad because he took it to heart , but people just did n't want to hear it they wanted to rock 'n' roll photos joshua m greene , inset , the author of here comes the sun in 1969 , he stood with arms raised behind harrison at a krishna temple \( photos by bhaktivedanta book trust international above phil marino for the new york times inset \)
wednesday , 12 may 1784 29 9 10 54 nw , w sun , brisk wind , small showers , sun , cold air the hanger seems to be quite in leaf sowed an other row of large white kidneybeans there seem to be two , if not three nightingales singing in my outlet 7 30 am 52 degrees windy , impenetrable clouds , heavy rain this is the weather the ducks and geese truly love puddles everywhere water falling from the sky as close to being adrift on a pond as they can get at our place it s also the kind of weather when chores are a special pleasure you may think i m being ironic , but i m not the horses look out from under the runin shed all but nell , who never goes under cover for any reason with a kind of satisfaction on their faces , none of their usual impatience to get out to the pasture and down to work and there is nothing quite like stepping from a downpour on a dismal morning into the barn and turning on the lights the rain roars on the metal roof above the hayloft , but everything down below is quiet and bright for some reason , the feel of coming indoors is far more powerful down at the barn than it is at the house
gov jon s corzine may be a lowkey , lowvolume new jersey chief executive , but state residents appear to be hearing him quite clearly after years of blaring headlines about corrupt politicos , mr corzine won the support of many new jerseyans because his softspoken demeanor and buttondown wall street r \? m \? eemed to offer a long overdue chance to hit the mute button unlike mr corzine s pledge to double propertytax rebates and resist the pressure to increase taxes , the new governor has so far kept his promise to conduct a quieter , gentler administration during his first three months in office , mr corzine has kept a comparatively limited public schedule his budget address was most notable for two things its bevy of tax increases and the audible silence with which it was received , even by fellow democrats he has focused so intently on hacking through the fiscal problems he inherited that mr corzine has made few of the sweeping proposals or grand gestures that may identify him with some overarching agenda or rousing public cause but for all the relief mr corzine s low profile may provide to the scandalweary , it carries some significant political liabilities modern politics is a combat fought with attack ads and killer sound bites , so if you 're too slow or softspoken to define yourself , events or your opponents will do it for you during the campaign , mr corzine s millions helped him beat back republican assertions that he was an aloof , elitist , bigtaxing , freespending liberal since mr corzine took office , however , his actions have largely spoken for themselves , and the public has been none too impressed an assortment of recent polls show that voters object to his call to raise the sales tax a penny , to 7 cents , and there have been sporadic protests from state university students angry that the new budget will increase their tuition last tuesday the latest public response came when residents went to the polls to vote on school budgets and rejected nearly half of them , results far more negative than the state has seen in more than a decade mr corzine s name was n't on any of the ballots , and the turnout was only 15 percent but school budgets are largely dependent on state aid , which the governor has proposed freezing again in his budget plan even worse , the remedy that most districts use for additional funds is an increase in property taxes , the third rail of new jersey politics so the fact that only 53 percent of the school budgets passed down from 71 percent a year ago can hardly be considered comforting news in trenton while the frustration is being communicated more subtlety than the outcry that greeted former gov jim florio s notorious tax increases in 1990 , when impeach florio bumper stickers traversed the turnpike and voters protested the tax on paper products by emblazoning the governor s likeness on bathroom tissue , the message is unmistakable new jerseyans are taxed out most of the interested political players pointed their fingers in predictable directions at one another republicans called for mr corzine and his fellow democrats to apologize to the state s schoolchildren democrats blamed a favorite bogeyman years of bureaucratic fraud , waste and abuse , as if none of those frauds , wastrels or abusers belonged to their party for his part , mr corzine responded with a more comprehensive view , saying that the state s educationalfinance problems were being fueled by inefficiency and judicial intervention , namely the court order that forces new jersey to finance lowincome districts at the same level as the wealthiest ones we 've got to save money , we need to make sure that we start squeezing out corruption , he said during a radio broadcast on new jersey 1015 the day the school results were announced we 're going to need a new school funding formula because i think we have a system today where we 're more focused on the districts than we are the kids but his proposed solutions , a citizen s propertytax commission and a rollback of the state s school financing formula , are unlikely to ever happen and even less likely to produce the kind of drastic reduction in taxes that may make a noticeable difference in people s pocketbooks so as mr corzine nears the benchmark of his first 100 days in office , you have to wonder precisely how he expects the public to regard him he portrays himself as a steady hand at the helm , someone willing to make the difficult fiscal decisions and avoid the temptation to promise expensive new goodies in the meantime , republicans are shouting that he s the governor whose policies raised your sales tax , college tuition and property taxes and voters appear to be growing restless it could be that mr corzine is just biding his time before presenting good news to the public maybe his friends on wall street have informed him that contrary to most predictions , the economy will soon rev up , providing a windfall for the governor to dole out or perhaps he wants to get the budget squared away before announcing some major initiative like a plan to strengthen and reorganize the state s public universities , cut health insurance costs or offer property tax relief to homeowners because if mr corzine truly believes that voters will be grateful to an elected official who makes them eat their spinach as long as he s quiet and polite about it , so far there has been little evidence out there to back him up photo
the twilight settles around you , the fireflies beam above you shines jupiter , surrounded by its moons io , europa , ganymede and calisto a nighthawk glides through the air , spots its prey and makes a sudden dive in vernal pools the fowler s toads call out with a plaintive bleating , a bit like sheep with colds you are not in a field on long island or in columbia county you have ventured into a park in new york city at night , something your mother has always told you not to do but these days the new york city department of parks and recreation will take you there park employees will take you camping at the great hill in central park or in marine park on the westernmost inlet of jamaica bay in brooklyn , or willowbrook park in staten island tent , sleeping mats and lanterns provided \( you take your own sleeping bag or sheets and a blanket \) at alley pond park in douglaston , queens , every friday and saturday night through the middle of august , the parks department will even provide a barbecue for campers in the meantime , urban park rangers will guide you on nocturnal hikes in places like high rock park in staten island the parks department also gives astronomy lessons yes , the stargazing in new york is excellent , at least for amateurs there is none of the confusion of sorting out myriad constellations on a summer night in the country because of light pollution , the lesser stars are diminished in the sky over new york only the brightest are visible , making them easier for beginners to identify during the last five years or so , the parks department has embarked on an effort to take back the city s parks at night , to make them a meeting ground for people of good intentions who want to explore the beauty of the dark the blackcrowned nightherons in inwood hill park that stand dead still at the edge of the salt marsh along the hudson river at dusk and dawn watching for fish , for instance , or the little brown bats that swoop about seeking insects part of the impetus for the parksatnight initiative has come from sara hobel , director of the urban park rangers , who began the camping program five years ago with support from the butler foundation now camping nights are usually booked to capacity , with 30 to 40 people at each site tents are pitched in various sites , like a meadow overlooking the palisades at inwood hill park , or on the oval lawn surrounded by trees at the top of the great hill at the northern end of central park ms hobel said that there had been no intrusions from uninvited guests , including rats there has always been entertainment music , theater and movies in the parks at night , but in recent years it has increased exponentially , with new film , theater and concert series springing up around the city \( details are at www nyc gov parks \) there is even dancing under the stars on the rollerhockey rink in little bay park , beneath the throgs neck bridge in queens the number of these offerings has exploded as the parks have become safer , and have also been perceived as being safer , a transformation that probably began with the creation of the urban park rangers program in 1979 very little crime takes place in parks when you compare it to the rest of the neighborhoods , said adrian benepe , commissioner for the new york city department of parks and recreation and bringing people into the parks at night makes them even safer , mr benepe said , because having a positive presence reduces the chance people will be doing bad things , hang out , use drugs , commit acts of vandalism and so the people have begun to show up there are now at least three stargazing programs , run individually by the urban park rangers , the amateur astronomers association and mark freilich , an adjunct professor of astronomy at queens college mr freilich gives a preparatory lecture at the alley pond environmental center in alley pond park in queens , and hands out star maps and answers questions he provides a 10inchlong telescope for viewing people may take their own telescopes and binoculars mr freilich estimated that the weather interfered with the view of the stars maybe 15 or 20 percent of the time in july and august , mr freilich said , in addition to jupiter and its largest moons , star watchers will be able to see constellations like cassiopeia the big dipper \( and the north star \) scorpius , with the bright red supergiant antares cygnus , with the double star albireo and the summer triangle of vega , altair and deneb when the moon is full or almost full , the lunar seas of tranquillity , serenity , fertility and nectar should be visible too in august will come the perseid meteor shower all you 've got to do , mr freilich said , is lie down on your lounge chair , and all night long you can see that without a telescope you lie back and you can just look up and count the meteors september brings andromeda into view , that galaxy being visible on a clear night with binoculars , even though it is about 23 million lightyears away the light reaching your eye tonight left the andromeda galaxy well over two million years ago , mr freilich said

residents of the gordon heights neighborhood in the town of brookhaven have complained for years that the fireprotection taxes in their district were higher than those in neighboring yaphank , coram , middle island and medford now some 400 neighborhood residents have petitioned the town board to dissolve the district altogether that may be a quick way to cut taxes , but it would also eradicate a community institution , fire district officials said at 17 square miles , with about 900 houses , gordon heights is not a village or even a hamlet its only official borders are those of the fire district and it does not have any commercial tax base to speak of , which largely accounts for the tax burden on its residents founded in 1947 , its fire department now has about 60 active members its fire and ambulance squads are the pride of the mostly black neighborhood , said chesley ruffin , a fire commissioner and a 23year volunteer a department in a district as small as gordon heights can provide services that busier departments cannot , including helping elderly residents plow snow , mr ruffin said more important , he added , this stands out as a role model for young black kids because they see black adults doing positive things volunteering and getting up in the middle of the night to help their neighbors mr ruffin said the complaints about taxes began when houses in fairway woods , a 72lot development in the gordon heights district , were sold , mostly to white families , starting in the mid1990 s this is n't really about taxes , he said it s about something else but donald price , a petition organizer , said the high taxes were the only motivation mr price , a retiree , said that his fire taxes came to about 2 , 500 last year while his neighbors in medford pay about 400 a year we 'd been asking the town to do something about this for years , and prior administrations never acted on it , he said the petition now forces the town to find a solution to make us equal to other taxpayers in other fire districts , he said lawyers for the town are reviewing the petition , councilwoman connie kepert said if the district is dissolved , the houses there could be protected by an adjacent district ms kepert said she was looking for ways to avoid that other options involve expanding the district s borders to increase the tax base or finding state or federal grants to reduce the amount that must be raised through taxes we 're supporting a fire district that is comparable in its budget to neighboring districts that serve 4 , 400 to 8 , 700 families , mr price said how long are we supposed to go on doing this \? glen cove facing 66 million shortfall ralph v suozzi , the mayor of glen cove , is between the proverbial rock and a hard place the city needs to find about 66 million to make up for its latest budget shortfall , but moody s investors service has downgraded glen cove s bond rating twice in three years and this year added a negative outlook warning that means higher interest rates on any money the city borrows to keep itself running through the end of this year mr suozzi , who took office in january , said he inherited the deficit from the previous administration i knew i was in trouble in january when we collected 10 million in taxes and had to send out 65 million to pay last year s bills , he said and then three weeks ago my comptroller said , 'we 're out of cash' the city has a few options for balancing the books , but none except borrowing would solve the problem entirely by december , mr suozzi said he has asked the state to send its annual aid check early , or he could tap 45 million in advance tax payments either way , it means robbing next year s revenue to pay this year s bills he has also offered to sell a building leased to the solomon schechter school , a private hebrew academy the school is interested in buying it , and an appraisal is under way the mayor said he thought the property was worth more than 6 million mr suozzi said he was looking to cut costs across the city budget , seeking more federal and state grants and increasing building permit fees and parking fines he said he expected to raise taxes for next year to pay back any deficit financing , and was pushing to collect 2 million in water fees owed to the city by a business that declared bankruptcy but the immediate solution is deficit financing mr suozzi said he had asked the state comptroller to audit the city s books as soon as he took office that audit , still going on , is calculating exactly how much the city is in the red , he said southampton campus sale is delayed by red tape the longawaited sale of the southampton college campus to the state university of new york at stony brook had not closed as of wednesday , just a week before up to 200 students were expected to begin classes officials at both stony brook and long island university , which owns the campus , attributed the delay to the voluminous paperwork lawyers were preparing to complete the deal we 've gone so far down this road that i ca n't imagine it s anything substantial , said patrick calabria , a spokesman for stony brook an liu spokeswoman , paola curciokleinman , said the closing could happen at any time it s just a matter of finishing up the paperwork , she said mr calabria said that stony brook officials expected the campus to be in full swing by next september and to build enrollment to a maximum of 2 , 000 over the following five years liu announced three years ago that southampton college s longstanding financial troubles had become too much of a burden on its other three campuses and began dismantling the south fork s only college photo pride chesley ruffin , a fire commissioner in gordon heights \( photo by maxine hicks for the new york times \)

president bush s twoday strategy session starting monday at camp david is intended to revive highly tangible efforts to shore up iraq s new government , from getting the electricity back on in baghdad to purging the security forces of revengeseeking militias , white house officials said three years of efforts to accomplish those goals have largely failed billions of dollars have been spent on both electricity and security , yet residents of baghdad get only five to eight hours of power a day , and the american ambassador acknowledged on friday that the city is more insecure now than it was a few months ago one of the senior officials involved in the strategy session characterized it as a last , best chance to get this right , an implicit acknowledgment that previous americanled efforts had gone astray he said the decision to hold a joint cabinet meeting on tuesday , between mr bush s top advisers and the newly appointed cabinet of prime minister nuri kamal almaliki of iraq via a video link from baghdad , was intended to set an agenda for the new government that could begin to win the loyalty of disaffected iraqis it is also an effort to hand off leadership to mr maliki s government and , in an analogy used by several american officials , to begin to let go of the bicycle seat and find out if the iraqi government can stay upright with less american support for mr bush , the session comes at a critical moment in baghdad and in washington his efforts to prop up two interim prime ministers with similar pledges of support largely failed at home , he is trying to create a sense of political progress at a time when some democrats and some in his own party are calling for significant numbers of american troops to come home by the end of this year , a debate that will be taking place in congress this week during arguments over spending bills for the war no matter how that debate turns out , congress has made clear that its willingness to pay for more iraqi reconstruction is just about exhausted both american and iraqi officials now acknowledge that they will have to seek billions in investment and aid from persian gulf nations that have been unwilling to contribute many dollars or any soldiers mr bush on friday made clear that the american commitment to the country will be longterm officials say the administration has begun to look at the costs of maintaining a force of roughly 50 , 000 troops there for years to come , roughly the size of the american presence maintained in the philippines and korea for decades after those conflicts but no decisions have been made , and mr bush has carefully sidestepped any discussion of a longterm presence , insisting that american forces will be in the country only as long as the iraqi government wants them there mr bush s aides said the meeting was not intended to focus on troop levels but in many ways , that subject is the subtext of the entire discussion providing electricity means securing pipelines and generators that have been prime targets of the insurgency enforcing a breakup of the militias that have infiltrated security forces could require a significant show of force , particularly if elements of the mahdi army and the badr organization , the two strongest shiite militias , resist mr maliki s plan is expected to be announced in coming days , and it will amount to what the american ambassador , zalmay khalilzad , said friday on pbs would be a new plan for the security of baghdad mr maliki wrote on friday in the washington post that among his first priorities would be to reestablish a state monopoly on weapons by putting an end to militias dealing with electric power and security , of course , were among the problems that the administration insisted , in briefings in the spring of 2003 , it was prepared to tackle as soon as saddam hussein was deposed none of these problems or even the solutions that are being proposed are new , said one former senior official who worked extensively on reconstruction , but did not want his name published because he still deals with the administration regularly what s been lacking is the political will administration officials say they are not trying to reinvent the reconstruction , but rather relaunch it everybody views the completion of a truly unity government as a moment of opportunity , dan bartlett , mr bush s senior counselor , said friday in his office at the white house that is exactly why this meeting is taking place now the session was planned , he said , before the killing on wednesday of abu musab alzarqawi , the qaeda leader in iraq , but mr bush has made clear he thinks mr zarqawi s elimination could help turn the tide mr maliki has said that solving the electricity problem , particularly in baghdad , and ridding the security forces of infiltrators who have killed sunnis and other rivals , are his top priorities but american officials acknowledge that to pay for some of mr maliki s agenda , it will be necessary to raise money among iraq s neighbors in the gulf an effort that has yielded minimal results so far as the prime minister s own tour of new electric facilities in iraq this week made clear , the challenges are enormous already , the united states has allocated 4 billion to electricity projects around the country , and at least 2 billion of that has been spent yet the amount of power flowing through baghdad s aging electric grid has not changed much the pipelines that feed oil to generating plants have been systematically attacked by insurgents who aim to shut down the grid and black marketeers seeking to steal the fuel and sell it for profit the most recent official figures say that baghdad is receiving at least eight hours of electricity a day , but iraqis say that after a fleeting improvement earlier this month , they now receive less than that when mr maliki visited the baghdad south power plant earlier this month with his electricity minister , karim wahid , they acknowledged that three years after the invasion , billions more will have to be spent mr wahid estimated that power output in the baghdad area must more than double just to meet current demand , which was growing at between 7 percent and 10 percent a year the cost to satisfy those needs , he said , could run to as much as 2 billion a year for 10 years , requiring substantial foreign investment i will ask the government to correct the budget , and if it s possible to add something else , mr wahid said

innovations in bread baking are rare in fact , the 6 , 000yearold process has n't changed much since pasteur made the commercial production of standardized yeast possible in 1859 the introduction of the gas stove , the electric mixer and the food processor made the process easier , faster and more reliable i'm not counting sliced bread as a positive step , but jim lahey s method may be the greatest thing since this story began in late september when mr lahey sent an email message inviting me to attend a session of a class he was giving at sullivan street bakery , which he owns , at 533 west 47th street in manhattan his wording was irresistible i 'll be teaching a truly minimalist breadmaking technique that allows people to make excellent bread at home with very little effort the method is surprisingly simple i think a 4yearold could master it and the results are fantastic i set up a time to visit mr lahey , and we baked together , and the only bad news is that you cannot put your 4yearold to work producing bread for you the method is complicated enough that you would need a very ambitious 8yearold but the results are indeed fantastic mr lahey s method is striking on several levels it requires no kneading \( repeat none \) it uses no special ingredients , equipment or techniques it takes very little effort it accomplishes all of this by combining a number of unusual though not unheard of features most notable is that you 'll need about 24 hours to create a loaf time does almost all the work mr lahey s dough uses very little yeast , a quarter teaspoon \( you almost never see a recipe with less than a teaspoon \) , and he compensates for this tiny amount by fermenting the dough very slowly he mixes a very wet dough , about 42 percent water , which is at the extreme high end of the range that professional bakers use to create crisp crust and large , wellstructured crumb , both of which are evident in this loaf the dough is so sticky that you could n't knead it if you wanted to it is mixed in less than a minute , then sits in a covered bowl , undisturbed , for about 18 hours it is then turned out onto a board for 15 minutes , quickly shaped \( i mean in 30 seconds \) , and allowed to rise again , for a couple of hours then it s baked that s it i asked harold mcgee , who is an amateur breadmaker and best known as the author of on food and cooking \( scribner , 2004 \) , what he thought of this method his response it makes sense the long , slow rise does over hours what intensive kneading does in minutes it brings the gluten molecules into sidebyside alignment to maximize their opportunity to bind to each other and produce a strong , elastic network the wetness of the dough is an important piece of this because the gluten molecules are more mobile in a high proportion of water , and so can move into alignment easier and faster than if the dough were stiff that s as technical an explanation as i care to have , enough to validate what i already knew mr lahey s method is creative and smart but until this point , it s not revolutionary mr mcgee said he had been kneading less and less as the years have gone by , relying on time to do the work for him charles van over , author of the authoritative book on foodprocessor dough making , the best bread ever \( broadway , 1997 \) , long ago taught me to make a very wet dough \( the food processor is great at this \) and let it rise slowly and , as mr lahey himself notes , the egyptians mixed their batches of dough with a hoe what makes mr lahey s process revolutionary is the resulting combination of great crumb , lightness , incredible flavor long fermentation gives you that and an enviable , crackling crust , the feature of bread that most frequently separates the amateurs from the pros my bread has often had thick , hard crusts , not at all bad , but not the kind that shatter when you bite into them producing those has been a bane of the amateur for years , because it requires getting moisture onto the bread as the crust develops to get that kind of a crust , professionals use steaminjected ovens at home i have tried brushing the dough with water \( a hassle and ineffective \) spraying it \( almost as ineffective and requiring frequent attention \) throwing ice cubes on the floor of the oven \( not good for the oven , and not far from ineffective \) and filling a pot with stones and preheating it , then pouring boiling water over the stones to create a wet sauna \( quite effective but dangerous , physically challenging and spaceconsuming \) i was discouraged from using la cloche , a covered stoneware dish , by my longstanding disinclination to crowd my kitchen with inessential items that accomplish only one chore i was discouraged from buying a 5 , 000 steaminjected oven by its price it turns out there s no need for any of this mr lahey solves the problem by putting the dough in a preheated covered pot a common one , a heavy one , but nothing fancy for one loaf he used an old le creuset enameled cast iron pot for another , a heavy ceramic pot \( i have used cast iron with great success \) by starting this very wet dough in a hot , covered pot , mr lahey lets the crust develop in a moist , enclosed environment the pot is in effect the oven , and that oven has plenty of steam in it once uncovered , a halfhour later , the crust has time to harden and brown , still in the pot , and the bread is done \( fear not the dough does not stick to the pot any more than it would to a preheated bread stone \)
maybe it was somebody s idea of a very inside joke but for some time now new york state officials have referred to a huge pool of hidden money appropriated by lawmakers each year as the 007 accounts these accounts amount to 200 million each year to finance a long list of porkbarrel projects across the state the funds are controlled by state leaders and appear in the budget in anonymous chunks , listed under health care , economic development or some other broad category this is camouflage for hundreds of socalled member items small and mediumsize public projects in each legislator s home district the clandestine way that 007 money is parceled out would make q himself proud very little about these items is disclosed to the public the scant records available on the state senate web site offer glimpses of items like 25 , 000 for a youth center \( no address given \) or 112 , 000 for dental clinics \( no locations listed \) it would take a fulltime investigator to figure out why one baseball field receives state aid and not another , and that is apparently how joseph bruno , the senate majority leader , and sheldon silver , the assembly speaker , want to keep it controlling these millions allows the leaders to control their legislators member items are , in fact , a form of legislative blackmail no politician wants to be held responsible for losing funds for the home district so when mr bruno whispers a command , republican senators jump when mr silver beckons his herd , democratic assembly members trip over one another to get to him this is no way to create a robust and democratic legislature and it is no way to sort out the priorities for spending the public s money the governor and leaders of the minority parties in each house traditionally get a share of these slush funds , and in recent months they have decided to open up their books , showing where and how the money is spent that s the right response but mr bruno and mr silver argue that it s none of the public s business how the public s money is spent reporters at the times union of albany spent months trying to use the new york freedom of information law to uncover details of the 007 accounts frustrated , the newspaper filed suit on june 21 against mr silver and mr bruno to force them to cough up the information it may be worth noting that the newspaper s editors had trouble finding a lawyer in albany for this case apparently the idea of bucking mr bruno and mr silver in the state capitol is about as popular as kicking the soccer referee who hands out the red cards as the times union discovered in the course of its investigation , the leaders have many reasons for keeping things quiet grants are often awarded to community centers , clinics or other enterprises whose payrolls are padded with family members and friends of the local legislators last year , one chunk of money found its way to a charity controlled by former senator guy velella , even after mr velella was jailed for taking bribes were they ever to become completely public , the files would surely yield many more conflicts of interest and cases in which state funds are being quietly funneled to friends , families and contributors that is to be expected when so much public money is handed out in the dark it s time to blow the covers off albany s secret 007 accounts
with many questions still to be answered about the cost and financing of the ground zero memorial , four prominent companies with executives on the world trade center memorial foundation board conspicuously absent until now from the donor rolls said this week that they intended to contribute the companies , american express , j p morgan chase company , pricewaterhousecoopers international and time warner , all made brief statements in response to an inquiry , indicating their support for the project none elaborated on their reasons for having held back generally speaking , however , fundraising has not been helped by the fact that the price tag for the memorial complex is not yet known executives of the foundation , which is to build and operate the memorial , are awaiting an estimate from bovis lend lease , the project construction manager , in a few weeks until you go out into the real world , the estimates are just that , gretchen dykstra , the president and chief executive of the foundation , said yesterday the lower manhattan development corporation estimated last fall that the memorial and memorial museum would cost 490 million but those figures did not include the entire cost of stabilizing the slurry wall that is to be a centerpiece of the museum \( estimated at 25 million or more \) , the cost of designing and constructing the museum exhibitions \( estimated at 17 million or more \) , or most of the memorial s share of the infrastructure costs , which the port authority of new york and new jersey has placed at 110 million this includes 45 million toward the chiller plant that will supply the public buildings at the trade center complex with cool air and 30 million toward the cost of providing underground structural support foundation executives said they believe the port authority should pay these infrastructure costs among other unknowns are the cost of security features , the effect on the memorial project of rising construction costs , and the results of a rebidding for the job of installing structural footings for the memorial ms dykstra said the foundation has raised 1303 million in private contributions to date , 28 million more than it publicly acknowledged two months ago asked about the participation of board members , she provided a list of contributors of 100 , 000 or more , most of whom had not previously been identified by name some of the more prominent companies with members on the board were missing from the list spokesmen for four of them said they intended to make donations eventually cantor fitzgerald and tishman construction corporation declined to discuss the matter on behalf of daniel r tishman , richard m kielar , a senior vice president of the company , said , mr tishman does n't wish to make any comments at this time because all board members have been asked to not speak to the press for the time being chart ground zero gifts below are all gifts of 100 , 000 or more that have been made to date to the world trade center memorial foundation where gifts are associated with foundation board members , their names are given in parentheses gifts greater than 10 million starr foundation \( maurice r greenberg \) 25 million deutsche bank \( josef ackermann \) 15 million bank of new york \( thomas a renyi \) 10 million goldman , sachs company two anonymous donors gifts of 5 million to 9 , 999 , 999 carson family charitable trust \( russell l carson \) keefe , bruyette woods gifts of 1 million to 4 , 999 , 999 bear , stearns company inc \( e john rosenwald jr \) brookfield properties \( john e zuccotti \) edward john and patricia rosenwald foundation \( e john rosenwald jr \) ford foundation franklin templeton investments and fiduciary trust international \( anne mtatlock \) hsbc north america \( sir john bond \) john c whitehead \( john c whitehead \) major league baseball baseball players association baseball tomorrrow fund peter g peterson \( peter g peterson \) robert wood johnson 1962 charitable trust \( robert wood johnson iv \) rudin family samuel i newhouse foundation inc thomas s johnson family in memory of scott m johnson \( thomas s johnson \) tishman speyer \( jerry i speyer \) one anonymous donor gifts of 100 , 000 to 999 , 999 alfred p sloan foundation anne m tatlock \( anne m tatlock \) avon foundation carnegie corporation of new york \( vartan gregorian \) horace w goldsmith foundation nyse foundation shea family foundation in memory of joseph p and daniel j shea w k kellogg foundation one anonymous donor
vick on pace for 1 , 000 falcons quarterback michael vick , above , had his second 100yard rushing game last week , with 101 in a victory over arizona not surprisingly , he holds the nfl record for 100yard games by a quarterback , with seven what is surprising is that with 333 rushing yards on 38 attempts , vick is the fifthleading rusher in the league the last quarterback to finish in the top 10 was philadelphia s randall cunningham in 1990 , with 942 yards vick , whose career high is 902 in 2004 , is on pace to surpass 1 , 000 yards \( the nfl record is 968 , by bobby douglass of the bears in 1972 \) of course , there is a reason for all these rushing yards vick has typically woeful passing numbers his passer rating of 698 puts him near the bottom of the league , and he is averaging 138 passing yards and completing only 50 percent of his passes he has only three touchdown passes and the falcons \( 22 \) have scored only five offensive touchdowns making the big time the rookie quarterback bruce gradkowski , who will take over for the injured chris simms when tampa bay visits new orleans on sunday , has impressed coach jon gruden with his toughness a sixthround draft pick who played at toledo , gradkowski once threw three touchdown passes in college with a broken hand he holds the ncaa record for career completion percentage \( 682 \) and completed 74 percent of his preseason passes with the addition of gradkowski , the midmajor midamerican conference has five quarterbacks starting in the nfl gradkowski joins ben roethlisberger \( miami of ohio \) chad pennington and byron leftwich \( marshall \) and charlie frye \( akron \) only the pac10 has more starters , seven , and that number was recently inflated when the backups damon huard \( washington \) and andrew walter \( arizona state \) replaced two injured starters , trent green and aaron brooks not necessarily the news sportswriters who cover the titans learned last wednesday that quarterback vince young would start sunday s game against dallas , but they did not report it until saturday tennessee is one of the teams that allow reporters to monitor all the practices , but there is a gentlemen s agreement that no competitive secrets are to be revealed titans coach jeff fisher presumably wanted the cowboys to waste a few days preparing to defend kerry collins \( it did n't do much good dallas won , 4514 \) still , with the losses piling up in tennessee , at least fisher seems to have found a winning media strategy had the practices been closed and had the sportswriters discovered the news from another source during the week , they would have reported it reporters can always break these kinds of embargoes , but they risk being shunned by the coach and the team in this case , fisher asked the reporters to hold the news until saturday , and they agreed so with the seemingly mediafriendly posture of keeping practices open , fisher was able to keep the flow of news closed secondstring sizzle the patriots' laurence maroney broke out against the bengals on sunday for 125 yards and 2 touchdowns , but he did not gain the most yards by a secondstring running back this season five backups have surpassed 100 yards , with the chargers' michael turner leading the way with 138 yards against the titans who is mike furrey \?

none of the above mike furrey , a fourthyear receiver from northern iowa who joined the team after three undistinguished seasons in st louis and a stint in the arena league , was the one who caught two touchdown passes from jon kitna the lions released rogers before the season mike williams is buried on the bench and roy williams has half as many touchdowns \( one \) this season as furrey scored in one game subway possibility the last time the yankees and mets were in the baseball playoffs , in 2000 , the ravens , with an outstanding defense and virtually no offense , started the season 51 and went on to defeat the giants in the super bowl this season , the ravens are 40 and striking a similar pose they rank second in defense and are first among teams that have played four games and they have a surer hand at quarterback steve mcnair is on pace to throw seven fewer interceptions than the combination of tony banks and trent dilfer did in 2000 but is it assault \?

i wouldn t have noticed her at all if she hadn t stepped on my foot her hair was in a tight braid that bounced against her exposed shoulders as she rushed past she wore a skimpy red top , extremely tight white pants and high heels i glanced after her with a tiny bit of indignation hey ! you stepped on my foot ! but before the thought could form , a man came through in her wake he had broad shoulders and wore a black buttondown shirt , untucked over jeans something in his posture was seething with intent you saying i m done \? he said , calling after her the phrase hung in the air it was 11 at night , and the cobblestone streets of the meatpacking district were swarming as if it were mardi gras a turbulence of lipstick , credit cards , alcohol , the percussive rhythms of taxi doors slamming shut and the clatter of tiny shoes on pavement it had rained earlier , a torrent , and it was as if the evening s late start , and the soft , close air had sent everyone into a delirium i was waiting for a friend from washington , dc he was a guy i associated with the chaos of foreign markets and improvised travel arrangements i thought he would like this place the girl arrived at the corner and paused , looking this way and that it seemed clear she was upset , though i saw her only from behind the man caught up to her and stood in front of her even as she tried to turn away the man was 24 or 25 years old , thick in his chest and wore his brown hair in a bit of a shag his body registered a restrained violence , but his face was more vulnerable , as though struggling to assimilate an unassimilatable insult he seemed to be asking her a question , perhaps repeating the one he had already said you saying i m done \? the girl kept scampering a few steps away from him he kept putting himself in front of her and talking to her something was slipping away from him that he did not want to slip away , and he was now being drawn toward violence against what he wanted to keep it was like watching a glass fall off a table in slow motion then , as she turned away again and he again stepped in front her , she slapped him not in his face she slapped his chest but it was slap back story oh boy , said the guy standing next to me skinny and smoking and watching the passing scene , he had a pleasantly detached manner , as if he were waiting for someone , too the girl was still moving this way and that with small nervous steps while the man hovered she slapped him again , in the shoulder all around us , as far as i could see , were swarms of men and women darting about as efficiently as schools of fish , but here was a dissonant movement , a break in the choreography the scene seemed poised to explode into something ugly finally she crossed the street he strode after her , gesturing emphatically as she moved ahead with purpose , hugging herself and looking down they faded into the darkness outside the bright rim of the meatpacking district i never saw her face , but i felt sure she had been crying the whole time that didn t look good , i said , to no one in particular after that second slap i though he might hit her back , said the guy beside me did you hear that line , the thing he said \? i asked he had you saying i m done \? wow it was like a bomb , he said so much information in that one line , i mean , the way he said it but no factual information no back story what do you think happened \? hard to say , he said they could have just met tonight , they could have been together for a while if you had to guess , what do you think was going on \? i don t think they met tonight , he said me neither i think they had been dating a bit i d say a month do you think they slept together \? he thought about it yeah i agree that intensity on his face at this point a couple of italian men stopped in front of my new friend and offered him a justopened pack of marlboro lights i am quitting , please take these , the italian guy said my new friend said thanks the italians walked away most people start smoking when they get drunk , he said this guy got drunk and decided to quit ! you want one \? i didn t yeah , they kill you he lit up so , what set it off \? he said my guess is she had been fading on him for a while , and they went out and had some drinks , and he did some tiny little thing , totally insignificant but it annoyed her , and that was the pretext for this thing going off in her head she hadn t even really known she felt this way , felt it that forcefully , but then suddenly she s just grossed out by him , and it goes downhill fast from there or maybe she had some drinks , and she starts flirting with another guy , and he gets really upset , and she s like , who do you think you are \? get away from me you think he ll get her back \? nah me neither hope not i thought he was going to hit her curtains cabs arrived and departed none of the people spilling out of them was my friend from washington the guy and i chatted a bit it turns out he was from los angeles i live across the street from this hotel , he said , i see all kinds of things i have these binoculars and if something good happens , i turn off the lights and settle in people leave their curtains open with a building across the street \? all the time ! but the thing is , the sexual exhibitionists are never young people it s always these older guys in their fifties , sixties , with these young girls , probably hookers , and they ve got the lights on and the curtains wide open that s amazing do you ever get too much of it \? like one night you just want to hang out and read a book and you look out the window and are like , oh no , not this again \? nah , it doesn t happen that often but i really wish i could have some sort of rear window experience , you know , see some crime and then get into jimmy stewart mode , and solve the murder my friend showed up at the same time his friends four women did suddenly we were a large , awkward group , and my new friend and i tried to convey the scene we had witnessed no one really responded , and then my friend chris said , i ve been that guy about seven times , and i looked at him and i could tell from his expression that we hadn t really conveyed the flavor of that moment , the way the guy in the black shirt was clenching his fists towards the end if we had , i don t think chris would have volunteered that information even if it were true we all said goodbye chris and i went into pastis and had a good dinner , though as i looked around i was struck by what seemed like the villainous nature of all the men in there they wore velvet slippers , or blue blazers with white polo shirts with the collars popped , grown men dressed in distortions of little boy prep they were middleaged , surrounded by young woman and glowing with petty cash it was like a casting call for james bond villains i thought of the men in the hotel with the lights on and the curtains open , surely the same guys surrounding me in pastis at midnight compared to them that young guy in the black shirt , with his youthful , wounded pride , almost seemed sweet almost

thomas e mann and norman ornstein have worked in and around congress for more than 36 years , beginning their careers in 1969 as congressional fellows they later moved to think tanks and academia , where they continued to study and write about the workings of congress , the first branch of government in their latest book , the broken branch , mr mann and mr ornstein chart what they perceive to be the deterioration of congress they write that the decline began at the end of the democratic party s long tenure in the majority and has accelerated since the republican revolution of 1994 and the consolidation of republican power in the legislative and executive branches mr mann and mr ornstein write that congress has become ideologically polarized and lacks tolerance for centrists , that the congressional agenda is driven by partisan politics , rather than the expertise of the committee system , and that deliberation and debate are often curtailed if not eliminated altogether most alarmingly , they write , republican congressional leaders have neglected their responsibilities to oversee and check the power of the executive branch in order to advance the administration s agenda the charges add up to their indictment of what they call the broken branch of american government mr mann is senior fellow of governance studies and the w averell harriman chair at the brookings institution mr ornstein is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute for public policy research he also is an election analyst for cbs news and writes a weekly column for roll call newspaper in your book , the broken branch , you place a large portion of the blame for the government s bungled handling of hurricane katrina on congress you say that congress failed in its responsibility to oversee the creation and management of the department of homeland security \( dhs \) , which includes fema one year later , do you feel that congress has stepped up its oversight of dhs to ensure that the problems that came to light after katrina hit the gulf coast are repaired \? ornstein i wish we could say that congress postkatrina has rebounded and improved after its failure to examine the fallout from the creation of a huge new department and its impact on things like disaster relief but we can t true , there have been a few tough oversight hearings , especially by the house government reform committee but nothing has fundamentally changed the structure of congress is inadequate to do the appropriate oversight of homeland security neither the house nor the senate committee on the subject has adequate jurisdiction the will to do sustained examination of what went wrong and what to do about it which might include painful steps to reorganize or undo what was done with the creation of dhs simply is not there and with congress spending so little sustained time in washington the smallest number of days in session in our lifetimes the ability to work through seriously how the enduring functions of fema can be meshed with the new functions dictated by a possible attack on the homeland is just not possible the ideas out there for detaching fema from dhs , or building a more independent entity within the department , have not been sufficiently examined when i think about the likely response of our system to another major natural disaster , much less a massive terrorist attack , i wince five years after september 11 and one year after katrina , there are many holes remaining in the response system congress has been largely awol when it comes to identifying them and riding herd on the executive branch to deal with them you also point out that it wasn t until public sentiment about the war in iraq soured that congress began to embrace its responsibility to ask the administration tough questions about its war policies but is congressional action coming too late \? do you think that congress can regain the public s trust in its handling of the war before election day \? mann much too late options in iraq are greatly constrained by decisions and nondecisions over the last three years congress was needed in the months before the invasion of iraq to pose difficult questions about the rationale for an optional war , plans for postsaddam stabilization , and prospects and policies for achieving our longterm objectives it was also needed after saddam s regime was deposed to review critical decisions taken in the field , establish benchmarks , monitor progress or the lack thereof , oversee contractors , listen to the concerns raised by critics , etc better late than never , but it will take many years for the federal government , including the executive and legislative branches , to regain public trust in its judgment and competence to deal with national security threats you accuse the current republican leadership in congress of undermining the legitimacy of the first branch of government to advance a partisan agenda however , you don t let democrats off the hook , accusing them of a rrogance , greed , venality , and condescension toward the minority when they were in the majority how can voters discourage bad behavior in congress when both parties have been guilty of abuses of power \? ornstein simply switching majorities is not enough to get appropriate change voters have to vote for change , but they also have to express some sense of outrage at bad behavior , and not just with the cynical , everybody does it , it is business as usual when the ethics process disappears , lawmakers who are dismayed need backup from the public or else the leaders in both parties will follow the path of least resistance and no change when a scandal occurs as it did with randy duke cunningham , tom delay and jack abramoff lawmakers immediately scramble to get behind lobbying and ethics reform , but then will invariably back off if they sense that voters are not paying attention that is just what happened this year of course , the press is an important component here stories about congressional scandal or failure in the process have to be reported , prominently and regularly one story and one editorial won t do it sustained outrage by the press is necessary to get sustained outrage from the public we need something more we need to get candidates who actually care about the process , who care about the institutions of government for that , voters have to reject those candidates who offer only cheap and easy shots at congress as dysfunctional as you say the situation in congress is now , you point out that things have been worse in 1856 , a senator was nearly beaten to death on the senate floor after a bitter debate over slavery at the least , can we feel grateful that our leaders aren t physically attacking each other \? mann it s always useful to remember that the past was not one long golden age of comity and productivity the civil war period was wrenching passions appropriately ran high in congress and physical violence was not uncommon and the last great partisan era in american politics the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth produced strains and dysfunction in congress similar to those we report in the broken branch but at those times , congress and the federal government were much less significant forces in peoples daily lives , in the economy and in the world today , with a 3 trillion budget as part of a 13 trillion globalized economy , and in an era where the us is the sole superpower , dysfunctional governing institutions matter more i have no doubt that we will come through this difficult period of politics and governance , but it will take an informed and energized public and a set of leaders who understand what has gone wrong and what needs to be done at the end of the book , you recommend that congress adopt a series of reforms to repair the institution , including changing campaign finance laws to encourage challengers , creating an independent body to handle ethics investigations and adopting a new congressional schedule to encourage longer work weeks and increase time for debates however , you say that real reform won t happen until it is forced upon the congressional leadership or they are replaced what do you think are the chances of either possibility happening \? mann achieving and sustaining a congress more faithful to the intentions of the framers will require broader changes in the political environment the most powerful lever for change inside congress is to be found outside returning members need different incentives from the public , away from ideological purity and unconstrained partisan warfare new types of members those who value genuine deliberation and develop institutional patriotism need to be elected by voters majority parties need more frequently to be sent by the public to the minority when they fail to exercise their responsibilities appropriately all of these are possible ornstein if republicans retain both houses of congress , the chances of real reform are slim or to use one of president bush s favorite phrases , slim to none and slim just left the building the only way to get reform in that case will be if the scandal turns massive lots of indictments of sitting members and staff if democrats take back the house , i do believe that there will be a strong push for reform from many members and some of the leaders the question first is whether it can be packaged and passed quickly , with what will certainly be a slender majority and second , whether any reform can be sustained and implemented once the real pressures of government with a margin in the low single digits take hold can you give us your predictions for the 2006 elections \? mann it has been apparent for the last six months that 2006 is likely to be a tidalwave election , with a powerful negative referendum on the party in power all of the key national political indicators , which have been remarkably stable throughout the year , point in this direction they are unlikely to change in the remaining weeks of the campaign and in recent months this macropolitical environment hostile to the republicans has been showing up in individual races i expect the democrats to take the house majority with a pickup of 20 to 30 seats in the senate , the most likely scenario is for the democrats to gain five or six seats , producing either a 5050 republican majority \( with vp cheney casting the decisive vote to organize the senate \) or a 5149 democratic majority at this stage , it s a coin toss ornstein the wind is blowing strongly in the direction of the democrats , but i am not yet sure whether that wind , in late october , will be a category 3 or category 5 hurricane if it is 3 , the democrats may fall just short of a majority in the house and a couple of seats short in the senate if it is a 5 , they can win majorities in both houses either way , the margins will be even slimmer than they are now , and that will make for another difficult , if not poisonous , climate for governing over the coming two years book reviews washington post publishers weekly
in sports' most complex and most basic team game , it s pro football s most telling and most elusive team record three consecutive nfl championships it is the record that the new england patriots had been silently pursuing ever since they won their second consecutive super bowl last february but they too can forget it after 10 consecutive postseason victories , the patriots were eliminated from the super bowl xl tournament last night by the denver broncos , 2713 the patriots have only themselves to blame in coach bill belichick s orderly universe , mistakes have been rare but last night , five mistakes ended the patriots' reign , the most glaring being quarterback tom brady s pass into the end zone that broncos cornerback champ bailey intercepted and returned 100 yards to position mike anderson s 1yard touchdown for a 176 lead late in the third quarter brady , virtually flawless in guiding the patriots to so many triumphs , had been driving the patriots toward what would have been the goahead touchdown when bailey justified brady s respect for him every time you throw the ball , he looks like he s a receiver out there , brady told reporters early in the week he s great he s got all the tools he s quick he s fast he s smart he s tough he s got great ball skills i 'll be careful throwing the ball out there brady was not careful enough on that pass intended for wide receiver troy brown , but he was not the only patriot to make a mistake cornerback asante samuel s passinterference penalty set up anderson s earlier 1yard touchdown kickoff returner ellis hobbs s fumble , forced by kicker todd sauerbrun and recovered by cecil sapp at the patriots' 39 , preceded jason elam s 50yard field goal and then adam vinatieri , the usually dependable placekicker , missed a 43yard fieldgoal attempt for the patriots , the emphasis all season has been on trying to be the first team to win a third consecutive super bowl , but that would have been the same as winning three consecutive nfl championships three straight titles do n't sound like much when compared with dynasties in the other major pro sports in baseball , the yankees won five world series in a row \( 194953 \) in hockey , the montreal canadiens won the stanley cup in five consecutive years \( 195660 \) and in pro basketball , the boston celtics won eight straight titles \( 195966 \) but in pro football , only the green bay packers have won three consecutive nfl titles , and they did it twice coach vince lombardi led the packers to the title in 19656667 \( including the first two super bowl games \) , and in the nfl s prehistoric era , the packers reigned in 1929'31 when curly lambeau was their coach and the firstplace team in the overall standings of a league with several smalltown franchises was crowned the champion during the super bowl era , seven franchises won two straight super bowls , including those 196667 packers , but none ever added a third in a row in addition to the current patriots , the larry csonka miami dolphins of 197273 , the mean joe greene pittsburgh steelers of 197475 and 197879 , the joe montana san francisco 49ers of 198889 , the troy aikman dallas cowboys of 199293 , and the john elway broncos of 199798 each won two straight super bowls , but none ever extended their streak to three straight the 49ers appeared on their way until they were upset by the giants , 1513 , in the 1990 conference championship game on matt bahr s five field goals the 1994 cowboys got to the championship game , but the steve young 49ers won , 3828 the 1974 dolphins lost a divisional playoff in oakland , 2826 , and the 1976 steelers lost the conference title game in oakland , 247 the 1968 packers , with lombardi as general manager after choosing phil bengtson to succeed him as coach , and the 1980 steelers each slid to third in their division the 1999 broncos dropped to last in their division in the presuper bowl era , when a team usually had to win only once in the postseason \( the championship game \) , six franchises won two straight titles but never a third the sid luckman chicago bears of 194041 , the steve van buren philadelphia eagles of 194849 , the bobby layne detroit lions of 195253 , the otto graham cleveland browns of 195455 , the johnny unitas baltimore colts of 195859 and lombardi s packers of 196162 longtime pro football followers remember that the original cleveland browns of the allamerica football conference won four consecutive titles from 1946 to 1949 , then joined the nfl in 1950 and added a fifth straight title with a 3028 victory over the los angeles rams in the championship game on lou groza s late field goal over those five seasons , the browns , with graham throwing to dante lavelli and mac speedie and marion motley galloping at fullback , had a 5763 regularseason record , and a 60 postseason record add their 111 record in 1951 before they lost the championship game to the rams , the browns were 6883 over six campaigns but when the nfl absorbed the browns , the 49ers and the baltimore colts from the aafc in 1950 , it declined to recognize any of that league s records so the packers , organized in green bay in 1919 when pro football was played in leather helmets long before their glory was revived by lombardi , remain the only franchise to win three consecutive nfl titles and they did it twice photo tom

\( photo credit three marines , photographed by warrant officer michael d fay in ubaydi , iraq , in nov 2005 , during operation steel curtain all three died in fighting a few days later at left , warrant officer fay s portrait of lance cpl nicholas g ciccone \) this past tuesday an email appeared in my inbox with the subject line , please read the sender s name was not familiar since setting up my blog i ve gotten hundreds of messages from folks i don t know , so that alone was no cause for alarm still , i was puzzled very little junk mail shows up in my account , but there it sat please read it was not junk mail i opened the message and found an urgent appeal from the stepbrother of a marine , lance cpl nicholas g ciccone , whose portrait i did in afghanistan back in 2002 he and his family had been unaware that the portrait existed and now desperately wanted to get copies the stepbrother and a flurry of emails that followed from friends and relatives assured me that the image absolutely captured this young infantryman i was glad to hear that i believe this portrait to be the finest of all my works , bar none but the stepbrother s email brought some other news as well lance cpl ciccone committed suicide in october of 2003 this message reached me as i was sifting through images and memories from my recent trips to iraq and afghanistan lance cpl ciccone s face is not the only one of a fellow marine i ve captured who has subsequently died during the intense fighting in old ubaydi , during operation steel curtain last november , i took photographs of three marines who days later died from bullets and grenade fragments in a particularly brutal firefight but the arrival of the message about lance cpl ciccone s suicide made me acutely aware that not all fatal wounds are physical after reading the email i took a long walk i live in fredericksburg , va , and these streets , now in the full green flush of spring , were once the scene of bloody combat during several frigid , gray days in december 1862 every construction project downtown turns up the detritus of war broken window glass , blackened chunks of brick and jagged fragments of fine china and crystal another consequence is that every house in the old town district is haunted to one degree or another there are many who believe that this historic town is the most haunted in north america tens of thousands , during the course of the civil war , died in these streets and homes from wounds , complications from primitive surgery and disease about a decade ago the local episcopal church even performed an exorcism in a home to rid it of a spirit , believed to be of a young confederate i have a ghost who only shows up on the coldest nights he dials up the oldstyle manual thermostat to its maximum setting he must long to be warm again after the arrival of please read there s perhaps going to be another ghost around here for me to contend with during the battle of fredericksburg in 1862 , word filtered back to the whitman family of brooklyn , new york , that a brother , george , had been a casualty the family had no idea whether it was a mortal or minor wound the whitmans were , by today s standards , a dysfunctional nightmare , and their george was apparently the glue that held them together someone had to prevent a familial meltdown , and that someone was brother walt , as in walt whitman , america s greatest poet whitman journeyed to fredericksburg and found brother george none worse for the wear , and the family , sufficiently reassured , resumed their everyday chaos but the poet also found a second calling he remained with the union army , and for the rest of the war was a nurse , a dresser of wounds and a writer of letters whitman s decision to stay with the army resulted in a new book being added to his core work of poetry , leaves of grass the 38 poems of drumtaps i finished my headclearing walk with a visit to the library i checked out his book of poems , again i needed to read a certain poem , a sight in camp in daybreak gray and dim nearly a century before i was born , whitman spoke in this poem a truth i experience everyday out in the field the truth written on the faces of young warriors what i call the young old look in this poem he tells of pulling the blanket back from the faces of three dead soldiers i give you the final stanza then to the third a face nor child nor old , very calm , as of beautiful yellowwhite ivory young man i think i know you i think this is the face of the christ himself , dead and divine and brother of all , and here again he lies that was the face of lance cpl ciccone i looked upon inside the freezing gutted remains of kandahar international airport in early january 2002 his platoon had just dragged themselves into the terminal building after completing a nineday combat patrol they had originally intended to be out for only twelve hours , but found a huge weapons cache and the taliban wanted it back i don t know what happened during those long days , but whatever it was , these marines had the look and of them all , ciccone had it in spades the drawing shows him the very moment he s dropped his backpack and removed his helmet looking at it now i realize what it was about him the weight was still there i am , rightly or wrongly , expecting a certain garden variety of responses to this posting the young men whose faces are appearing with these words are dead they can no longer speak for themselves i knew them i was there , but the bullets and grenade fragments that killed them passed me by i will speak for them they would want me to we in the military hear many of you say that you support the troops , but not the war we do not make these distinctions we are the mission you , america , sent us to fight we do not split you , america , into those who sent us and those who did not we could care less about politics , which party wants the white house or conspiracy theories we are doing the mission we are winning slowly , but surely we are fighting very bad people of the highest order because things are getting better they , the enemy , must resort to more and more heinous tactics we are often disappointed and disheartened that the press does not publicize our many successes , and only seems to focus on the bad , which is part of every war talk of whether we should be here or not is meaningless to us we are here the iraqis are capable of democracy and are worth our blood and treasure we can not abandon them stand behind us voice your unqualified support honor us , grieve us , but do not pity us this is the surest way to bring us home to you sooner , and far less wounded please listen grief is a true testament of your love and support but pity places our sacrifices which we gave freely back into the hands of our enemies and bears false witness that we suffered in vain to lance cpl nicholas george ciccone , i say what we marines often say to our fallen comrades as we pull the blanket over their faces go easy , my brother the copies of your portrait are on their way to your family i am going to leave you with a verse from a jody a military marching song we died on the beach at guadalcanal and we died in lebanon we died in the mud of belleau wood and we died in vietnam and when we got to heaven saint peter we did tell , another marine reporting sir , i ve served my time in hell
if a dog is caught roaming the neighborhood , the owner could pay a 92 fine under state law if it barks too much , the fine could be 75 and if the owner neglects to clean up after the dog , that is also 75 but what are the rules for cats \? as far as roaming and cleaning up after the cat goes , there are none but if your cat attacks someone , that is a whole different set of state charges and they are criminal a fairfield woman whose cat is accused of biting and scratching several of its neighbors is facing a charge of reckless endangerment and , in what many animal control officers in the state said is a first , the cat is facing a lifelong restraining order akin to full house arrest ruth cisero of fairfield , the owner of the cat , is scheduled to appear in superior court in bridgeport on april 25 to face one count of reckless endangerment rachel solveira , the fairfield animal control officer , issued a summons to ms cisero after her cat lewis , which was under a limited restraining order from a previous attack , got out of the house and attacked a neighbor a few houses away in making the charge , mrs solveira said she referred to a state law allowing animal control officers to seek restraining orders against animals that bite if the owner fails to comply with the restraining order , the owner faces fines of up to 250 and 30 days in jail with a cat , there are no such things as roaming or nuisance ordinances , mrs solveira said so the only option i had was a restraining or disposal order most of the town ordinances follow state statues , though towns are allowed to pass their own animal regulation laws animal control ordinances mostly focus on licensing , vaccinations , nuisance and roaming issues involving dogs they also focus on animal cruelty there is no law that says cats must be kept indoors but under state regulations , any animal that attacks someone is subject to 14 days' quarantine , a restraining order and possible death pet owners who do not comply with the quarantine or restraining provisions can face criminal charges ranging from creating a public disturbance to reckless endangerment animal control officers said it was not unusual to have to investigate cat bites but they said cats rarely bite again if a pet is repeatedly accused of biting , the owner usually has the pet euthanized , the officers said mrs solveira said that she did not intend to seek a disposal order for lewis , but that she thought it was necessary to convey to ms cisero the importance of watching him i felt she was n't taking us seriously for letting the cat outdoors , so i sent her to court on a misdemeanor summons for failure to comply with a restraining order , mrs solveira said the court set the charges at reckless endangerment my whole goal was keeping the cat indoors and for her to take it seriously lewis , a blackandwhite cat , has a long and storied history , according to neighbors animal control officials say the cat has bitten and attacked at least three women , including an avon saleswoman who is now suing ms cisero in civil court he was probably born with a psychiatric anomaly , said janet kettman , 76 , of sunset circle , who said she had been attacked by lewis twice he goes into super stalkingprey mode he s known to purr and sidle up against you and anyone who loves animals will go to pet it , and then he attacks that s happened a few times around here mrs kettman said the morerecent attack happened to her in december she arrived home in the evening from shopping , she said , and the cat pounced on her from under her front porch , grabbing onto her right leg i never saw it coming , mrs kettman said he attacked me from the back i had eight big gouges and three bites it burned like fire mrs kettman reported the attack to animal control and had to identify lewis in a cat lineup , she said lewis was then issued his first restraining order , which limited his outdoor hours to 11 am to 1 pm and 9 pm to 5 30 am lewis also had to be given medication to subdue his aggression but lewis got out again on feb 5 and attacked another neighbor , maureen bachtig , animal control officials said ms bachtig could not be reached for comment ms cisero said she has tried everything to keep lewis under control , including forcefeeding him prozac and coordinating the opening and closing of doors with her boyfriend whenever they enter and leave the house she said lewis slipped out that night because she was sick and upstairs in bed when her boyfriend came in the door with a pizza she said they did not realize until later that the cat was gone ms cisero , a real estate agent , said she took in lewis about five years ago when he appeared at her door as a stray and followed one of her cats inside she has two other cats that have never been in any trouble , she said ms cisero , who has applied to the court for accelerated rehabilitation , said she hoped that by keeping lewis indoors she could avoid more problems if he does get out again , she faces six months in jail , she said i tried to do whatever i could to make everybody safe and his life enjoyable , ms cisero said animal control officers said that although ms cisero s case was unusual because it concerned a cat , they have issued charges on a wide variety of domestic animal problems we would go to court with any animal owner if we felt the animal was a threat to public , said laurie hollywood , an animal control officer in stamford animal control officers said the biggest concern involving aggressive domestic animals is rabies in 1991 the state ordered that any domestic animal that bites someone be held for quarantine even if the animal has been vaccinated against rabies while most animalcontrol issues concern dogs or wild animals , some officers said they had responded to a variety of problems involving many different types of pets the complaints have included roosters crowing too early in the morning and horses escaping onto roads and causing traffic accidents edward risko , an animal control officer in monroe , said he once arrested a man whose two 500pound pigs had repeatedly roamed the neighborhood the man spent 30 days in jail for refusing to surrender the pigs when the animal control officers tried to seize them it s up to the person to control their animal s actions , mr risko said that s the nationwide standard photos ruth cisero and her boyfriend , ron merly , with lewis at home in fairfield , as tabby looks on rachel solveira , the animal control officer who issued a summons after lewis s most

the new canaan police have a hunch that some homeowners in fairfield county , and possibly in westchester county in new york , may have been robbed without knowing it that is why the police have put a rather eclectic collection of objects on display at headquarters , hoping those who may have been victims will claim items such as antique coins , gold pocket watches , jewelry and monogrammed dishes the police said brian carter , 50 , currently jailed at the bridgeport correctional facility on a larceny charge , may have stolen the items on display from homes where he worked as a carpenter mr carter was arrested after the police found a backpack they said belonged to him at the scene of an attempted library breakin earlier this month lt james george of the new canaan police said a subsequent search of a garage mr carter rented near his home turned up items previously reported stolen from the library and from local businesses at the same time the police also found the items now on display they include united states coins from the mid1800 s , a gold united states coin from 1921 and a russian coin set , as well as tiffany lamps , lieutenant george said about 30 people had viewed the display after hearing about it through the local news media , lt george said early last week he said the other police departments in the area had also been notified about the items a new canaan woman was the only one to claim anything , lieutenant george said early last week she recalled hiring him three weeks prior to his arrest , he said she had identified some of the coins , and she did n't even know they were missing patricia funt oxman , the owner of patricia funt antiques in new canaan , said she had viewed the collection the diversity ranges from a buddha statue to memorabilia from the 1939 and 1964 world s fairs in new york with the price tags still on , she said it s quite a strange array ms funt oxman said she also saw rings , small bags of diamonds and pewter plates she could not say how much value most of the items had somebody has to study things like the diamonds they could be worth anything , she said that s where most of the value was that i could see lieutenant george said anyone looking to claim items would have to provide proof of ownership lieutenant george also said mr carter could eventually claim that some or all of the items are his other charges on mr carter are pending , lieutenant george said he said none of the property would be released until the case is concluded , which is likely to be at least a year away mr carter is being held on a 95 , 000 bond , lieutenant george said according to the norwalk superior court , as of wednesday morning , he did not have a lawyer and had not applied for a public defender photo lt james george of the new canaan police with an eclectic collection of objects recently confiscated \( photo by carl david labianca for the new york times \)

jeanine f pirro , the republican candidate for state attorney general , said yesterday that her campaign had raised about 27 million in the last six months , one of the highest amounts raised by a candidate for attorney general in the current election cycle ms pirro , the former westchester county district attorney , entered the race for attorney general in december , after abandoning her candidacy for united states senate as a challenger to hillary rodham clinton she had raised no significant amount of money for the attorney general campaign before january ms pirro said the figures showed that her campaign had been receiving the support of a wide range of new yorkers people all over this state are energized by my message and by my vision for the attorney general s office , ms pirro said and i'm sure that the next filing we have will show figures that are just as strong meanwhile , the campaigns of ms pirro s major democratic rivals said they were not planning to release their fundraising totals until today or over the weekend the campaigns are required to make their fundraising figures public by july 15 both andrew m cuomo , the former housing secretary in the clinton administration , and mark green , the former new york city public advocate , said they would not release their totals until today or over the weekend charlie king , a former chairman of the new york county democratic party , also said he would not release any fundraising figures for his campaign for attorney general until the weekend sean patrick maloney , a former aide to president clinton and a democratic candidate , said yesterday that his campaign had raised about 750 , 000 in the sixmonth period , bringing his total fundraising to 2 million for the attorney general s race ms pirro s fundraising was particularly strong , considering her late entry into the race and the fact that none of her democratic rivals had raised that much in a sixmonth period but she still lags far behind mr cuomo , who reported raising 42 million in the last filing period , in january that includes 12 million left over from his failed bid for governor in 2002 mr cuomo , the son of former gov mario m cuomo , is by far the leading fundraiser among the four democratic candidates for attorney general still , ms pirro s figures were impressive ms pirro indicated that she had developed a strong following for her campaign , pointing to the endorsement of the conservative and independence parties in addition to the republican party i am encouraged because i have three lines and no primary , she said and the democrats are going to have a bruising primary in september people are recognizing that they have the choice of an experienced woman candidate who has experience in law enforcement in recent weeks , ms pirro has stepped up her criticism of mr cuomo in an apparent acknowledgement that she considers him the frontrunner and likely democratic nominee and in doing so , it places mr cuomo in a heightened defensive position , since he now has to contend with her critiques in addition to those from his fellow democrats

' recalled mrs zilinski i said , 'it s up to you' he said , 'how much would i have to leave the church \? ' i said 'it s very personal if you leave 500 they 'll be thrilled' lt dennis zilinski , 23 , arrived in iraq in early october 2005 his parents emailed and sent letters daily he was so busy , they said , several days could pass with no email messages back they heard from him nov 14 any time you have contact , it erases all those days you heard nothing , his father said you know you 're that much closer to him coming home 'as of today , he s safe' there were no email messages the rest of that week mrs zilinski had a recurring nightmare of a coffin draped in an american flag and that friday night , she woke in a panic while the neighbors along their suburban culdesac slept , she sat at the computer i wrote , 'i know you 're busy , i just need to hear , even a oneliner' mr zilinski checked the defense department web site daily , and on saturday morning , nov 19 , read of five deaths in bayji , iraq , where a roadside bomb blew up a humvee there were no names , but it was the 101st airborne , their son s division i did n't tell marion , said mr zilinski i figured every hour that passes and we do n't hear , the chance is better that we were ok at 11 pm he was showering when his wife came upstairs as soon as she came up , there was no question what happened , he said two officers were at the door dennis had told us , if they 're dressed in bdu s battle dress uniforms it means injured , mr zilinski said if it s class a uniforms , you 're dead unfortunately , they were in class a s , so that was it soldiers write a letter to be mailed in the event they 're killed three weeks after he died , lt zilinski s letter came home mom and dad , he began , if you are reading this letter , then i have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country he thanked them for a wonderful life , said he enjoyed every single minute of it i love this country , our friends , and most importantly our family he wrote that his spirit would always be with them and he knew they 'd meet again in heaven i do not want your life to be too affected by my loss , he wrote he also enclosed a list of how i want my stuff handed out to everyone this included his 100 , 000 death benefit , which he left to their church my reaction \? said mrs zilinski i said , 'holy smoke , ' only i did n't use the word smoke' if you knew dennis , that said everything about dennis a year has passed and despite their son s wishes , every day is too affected by his loss they hear him in the music at the beautiful white church in middletown about half his gift went to buy a new church organ mrs zilinski s faith remains strong , but mr zilinski says , my faith is still up and down because of what happened they 've attended several ceremonies honoring their son , and sunday morning , nov 12 , is the first annual lt zilinski benefit run at the pnc bank arts center in holmdel for a year their dining room was cluttered with his things the shells from the 21gun salute when he was buried at west point the cd of the memorial service in iraq his medals , and all the cards and letters an idealistic young man s death can generate i could n't go in there , mrs zilinski said i could n't breathe mr zilinski said , you 'd pick up something , read it , look at it , but it could n't go anywhere only in the last week have they got it into boxes you think of him when you wake up and go to bed , mr zilinski said they look for signs of him when the phone rings , and there s no one there , mrs zilinski says , i believe it s a signal from dennis and when mr zilinski runs , he talks to dennis i cry and it clears my mood they support the war and are grateful that even those who do n't seem to support the troops but they are amazed at how disengaged most americans are every day after work , mr zilinski changes his clothes , has dinner with his wife , then goes to the computer i'm consumed by that web site you see six killed , five , one you think of the families i know i'm them a year ago , and i still feel this way think what s in store for them , mrs zilinski said photos on display mementos of lt dennis w zilinski ii s brief military career , in his parents' dining room he was killed in iraq last november \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) mourning a year after their son s death , marion and dennis zilinski have only recently been able to sort through his things \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)
senior military leaders have begun a broad review of strategy in iraq and other crisis areas in the bush administration s campaign against terrorism , according to pentagon officials in a closely held effort , gen peter pace , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has assembled a team of some of the military s brightest and most innovative officers and told them to take a fresh look at iraq and afghanistan , among other flashpoints pentagon officials said that the team s objective was to outline a range of options that general pace might draw on in advising president bush and robert m gates , selected by mr bush to become defense secretary , as the white house adjusts its strategy in iraq ideas that have been discussed include increasing the size of the iraqi security forces , along with the american effort to train and equip them , and adjusting the size of the american force in iraq but pentagon officials stressed that the review extended well beyond iraq , and that some unorthodox ideas on how to fight terrorism were being weighed the review reflects the recognition that military efforts need to be part of an overall approach that includes all aspects of american power , including diplomatic and economic pentagon officials said the military review , which formally began sept 25 , is being coordinated with the rest of the government , but that the military team had not met with members of the iraq study group , the commission that is also looking into options for iraq the creation of that commission , headed by a former secretary of state , james a baker iii , and lee h hamilton , a former chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , had raised the possibility that fundamental decisions on how to proceed in iraq might be determined largely outside of the pentagon the commission is being advised by former military officers , but none of its members have served as senior military commanders the team involved in the military review includes col h r mcmaster , the army officer whose 2005 operation in tal afar has been cited as a textbook case in how to wage counterinsurgency in iraq other military officers include col peter r mansoor , the director of the united states army and marine corps counterinsurgency center at fort leavenworth , kan , who previously commanded an army brigade that fought the mahdi army militia in 2004 at karbala col thomas c greenwood , the director of the marine command and staff college , who oversaw efforts to train iraqi security forces in anbar , the restive province in western iraq , is also on the team all told , more than a dozen military officers are on the team , which is overseen by capt michael rogers of the navy , who serves as a special assistant to general pace though the review has been under way for six weeks , it has acquired special urgency as a result of the democratic gains in the election , president bush s decision to replace donald h rumsfeld as defense secretary and the clamor for some kind of course adjustment in iraq the goal is to finish the review in december , but some of its interim thinking has been made available to the military chiefs , pentagon officials said initially , the pentagon tried to keep the existence of the review secret but in recent days the bush administration has advertised its willingness to consider fresh approaches in an effort to counter criticism that it was rigidly adhering to a faltering strategy general pace referred to the review in general terms in tv appearances today we have to give ourselves a good honest scrub about what is working and what is not working , what are the impediments to progress and what should we change about the way we are doing it to make sure that we get to the objective that we set for ourselves , general pace said in an interview with cbs i am looking at it with the joint chiefs we 're making our recommendations we 're having our dialogue general pace said that gen george w casey jr , the top commander in iraq , and general john p abizaid , the head of the united states central command , were part of the effort mr bush is to meet monday with the commission headed by mr baker and mr hamilton others who will meet with the group are secretary of state condoleezza rice mr rumsfeld the national intelligence director , john d negroponte gen michael v hayden , the director of the central intelligence agency and zalmay khalilzad , the american ambassador to iraq the study group is expected to issue its recommendations around dec 7
when the lobsters were wiped out in the western long island sound almost overnight in september 1999 , it was a devastating bolt from the blue for a 100million industry on the island and in connecticut now the lobstermen have achieved something almost as unlikely winning millions of dollars in compensation for their losses from chemical companies last week , just before the case was to go to trial , the lobstermen reached a tentative settlement in a classaction suit against cheminova , the maker of a pesticide called fyfanon based in wayne , nj the company agreed to pay 125 million the settlement will be taken before judge thomas platt of the united states district court in central islip on monday two manufacturers of a different pesticide that were also named in the suit settled with the lobstermen in december 2004 , agreeing to pay a total of 375 million fyfanon was sprayed widely in new york city and on long island in september 1999 to kill adult mosquitoes and combat a newly emerging public health threat , the west nile virus fyfanon s active ingredient , malathion , is highly toxic to lobsters according to the lawsuit , heavy rains from the remnants of hurricane floyd then washed fyfanon into the sound over a period of a few days , killing off the lobsters and idling several hundred commercial lobstermen since then the lobster population has only slowly recovered , and remains much smaller than before 1999 the tentative settlement relieves gladstone n jones iii , the lobstermen s lawyer , of the need to prove in court that the dieoff was linked to the pesticide lawyers familiar with environmental cases say that establishing such a link is very hard mr jones called the settlement with cheminova a compromise to end a hardfought battle anywhere in the country , these cases are very difficult , and it was unpredictable what the outcome would be , he said a compromise is sometimes better than taking a case like this the final yard the lobster case was further complicated by conflicting scientific opinion at a symposium on the lobster dieoff held at stony brook university in october 2004 , scientists cited high water temperatures , low levels of dissolved oxygen and other pollutants like ammonia and sulfides as possible contributing factors none named malathion as a clear culprit , though several researchers said more study of the chemical s role was needed mr jones , a partner in the law firm jones , verras freiberg in new orleans , said that the research presented at the symposium was flawed and that he had experts ready to testify at the trial that malathion was to blame cheminova denied that its pesticide was responsible for the lobster dieoff a lawyer for the company , christopher kelly of haight , gardner , holland knight in manhattan , said it agreed to settle the suit to avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial and possible appeals he said cheminova had made no admission of liability whatsoever lawyers with experience in the field said that environmental contamination cases present enormous hurdles for plaintiffs , especially when they turn on injuries to people rather than to animals or crops james p rigano , a partner at certilman , balin , adler hyman in hauppauge , said it was extraordinarily rare for such claims to even reach court , much less succeed there proving the connection between exposure to a chemical and a real effect is very , very difficult , given the state of science , mr rigano said the only successful bodily injury actions i have seen were in the movies victor j yannacone jr , of yannacone yannacone in patchogue , said the rigors of assembling and presenting scientific evidence of injuries dissuaded many lawyers from taking such cases you have to have wellorganized evidence , solid scientific data and vigorous advocacy by attorneys who are capable of dealing with both the science and the law , said mr yannacone , a pioneer in environmental law who represented vietnam war veterans exposed to the defoliant agent orange a classaction suit against the makers , including dow chemical and monsanto , was settled for 180 million in 1984 the financial risks of pressing such suits can be large for both the plaintiffs and the lawyers , who must shoulder court costs and get nothing unless they eventually win a settlement mr yannacone said that a groundbreaking 1966 suit he brought against the use of ddt for mosquito control in suffolk county cost me everything i had , 585 , 000 out of pocket most environmental groups cannot afford to sue that way going to court is way beyond our budget , said adrienne esposito , executive director of citizens campaign for the environment in farmingdale when you look at the history , these kinds of cases take years and years , and cost multimillions she added , it has nothing to do with the merit of the cases it is rare for a government agency to positively identify one property as the source of contamination affecting another more often , the evidence is suggestive rather than definitive , making a successful suit unlikely sometimes , though , the evidence is overwhelming in 1994 , northville industries of melville agreed in a consent order to pay 15 million to the state and 10 million to the suffolk county water authority for a huge leak of more than a million gallons of gasoline from a storagetank terminal in east setauket the company , which found and reported the leak in 1987 , also settled for an undisclosed amount with nearby homeowners who sued over vapors entering their homes richard j lippes , a buffalo lawyer who represented homeowners in that case , is now pursuing brookhaven national laboratory on behalf of homeowners in north shirley who say that contamination of soil , air and water from the lab caused elevated rates of rare childhood cancers in their neighborhood their suit was dismissed last year by state supreme court justice mary m warner , who found that contamination from the lab was either too weak or too deep underground to be harmful the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and are awaiting a ruling there is no question that they polluted the community , mr lippes said of the laboratory in a telephone interview that s been documented it s a superfund site , and the place is a mess the question was whether there was any harm to property and health in the neighboring community mr lippes , who represented homeowners in the infamous love canal case in the 1970 s , said he knew of few lawyers who were willing to take on protracted environmental cases our average case takes about six years , he said our longest case was probably as lead counsel for love canal that went 20 years photo equipment stored in huntington by

readers respond to bob herbert s aug 3 column ,  susan , seattle , wash i think that by calling the phenomenon global warming we underestimate the consequences a more apt moniker is global climate disruption , which more effectively captures the ways that a change in global temperature that is small compared to weather effects has dramatic effects worldwide , including more dangerous tsunamis and hurricanes , killer heat waves , even blizzards and winter rain storms mere warming is not the problem it s the upsetting of the global climate that is the problem barb parker , columbus , ohio thanks for an excellent column , as usual you re right on the money with the points you make it s too bad the country is now so politically polarized thanks to bush that the people who need to understand this stuff refuse to even think about it you mentioned the times building shutting down lights in the offices to save electricity if you think about it , none of us lights up our homes all day long everyday even when we re there once a year , around christmas time when we have a gathering at our house in the evening , the interior is lit up more than usual skyscrapers and businesses all over the country do this as a matter of course 365 days a year , every year it s usually a big relief when they have to shut down the overhead lighting in summer because it helps cool the building down too too bad they don t adopt this practice every day during every summer bethany , lancaster , pa i have a practical solution to the heat wave that everyone will hate turn off your air conditioners if you have ever stood next to the exhaust unit of an air conditioner , you will know that it makes the air around it hotter using multiple air conditioners during a heat wave is like holding the door to the refrigerator open in order to feel cooler it may not matter if one or two houses have air conditioners , but when the vast majority of houses blast warm air outside their homes because of air conditioners , the overall temperature rises i understand that people who are elderly or people with certain medical problems may need air conditioning , but healthy people in their 20 s through 50 s do not need air conditioning go to the pool , use a fan , and drink lots of water another benefit of not using is air conditioning will be an understanding of the importance of halting global warming ps i have air conditioning set up in my apartment , but i choose not to use it for the above reasons
reported cases of lyme disease in the metropolitan region rose sharply in 2005 , according to health officials , with increases of 34 percent in connecticut , 23 percent in new jersey and 9 percent in new york state but some counties showed declines westchester had 458 reported cases , a decrease of 39 percent from 2004 on long island , suffolk county , with 542 cases , declined 3 percent , while nassau county , with 122 cases , had an increase of 107 percent fluctuations in case numbers are common , officials said , and the causes are difficult to pinpoint connecticut s increase last year , to 1 , 810 cases , is right within what we 've been seeing historically for the past 15 years , said randall nelson of the infectious disease division of the state department of public health there s variation from year to year contributing factors are food supplies for deer and rodents , which carry the ticks that spread the disease weather \( ticks have a twoyear life span and flourish during warm , wet winters \) and human activity , including prevention efforts and disease reporting midmay to early july is peak season , when about 90 percent of cases are transmitted , officials said the disease often causes a bull seyeshaped rash near a tick bite it can spread through the body if left untreated , causing arthritis , cardiac irregularities and neurological problems reported cases have been increasing over the last decade , experts say , partly because of greater awareness of the disease there s either a real increase or an increase in recognition , and it s probably a combination of both , said dr steven e phillips , the immediate past president of the international lyme and associated diseases society the disease was first identified in the 1970 s in lyme , conn , thus giving it its name another expert , eddy bresnitz , the state epidemiologist in new jersey , where 3 , 372 cases were reported in 2005 , cited the increased proximity of humans to wildlife there s more and more suburbia constructed closer to parks and areas where there s increased vegetation , he said we have more deer and more deer ticks anyone who walks through leaf litter in the woods or on the edge of fields or lawns this time of year should check regularly for the nymphal stage of the tick , said durland fish , a professor of epidemiology at the yale school of medicine the size of a poppy seed , the tick spreads 95 percent of cases , dr fish said some prevention efforts appear to be working in hunterdon county in new jersey , the rate of reported cases fell almost by half , to 268 per 100 , 000 residents in 2005 from 554 in 1996 for comparison , the rate of lyme disease nationally in 2005 was 67 cases per 100 , 000 people , and it is 274 in the 12 eastern and midwestern states where it is most common , according to the centers for disease control and prevention hunterdon experienced an increase in the number of cases in the 1990 s after the completion of a section of interstate 78 in western new jersey in 1968 led to housing construction and more people moving into deer habitat , said john w beckley , director of the county health department he said some of the recent decline in lyme disease in the county might be attributable to public health efforts that included putting signs in county parks warning visitors to check for ticks distributing fliers about the disease to doctors' and veterinarians' offices , garden centers and schools and publishing a lymeometer in a local newspaper announcing the level of tick danger each week dr andrea gaito , a rheumatologist in basking ridge , nj , in neighboring somerset county , said in midmay that she was already seeing three to four new cases of lyme a week there s more awareness , that s what brings people in early , and that s the good news , she said it makes early diagnosis and treatment so much better as a result , she said , she is seeing fewer cases of chronic lyme disease , which she estimates account for 15 to 20 percent of cases kim uffleman , 49 , of rivervale , nj , in bergen county , suffers from the chronic form of the disease , which she contracted 17 years ago nine months after being bitten by a tick , she was bedridden , and it was two years before ms uffleman , who used to run almost 50 miles a week , could leave her house without help it took her too long , she said , to find a doctor who could give her a clear diagnosis , even though she had had the classic bull seye rash i grieve the loss of my health , and that i had to raise three children while being extremely ill , she said they know nothing except for a sick mother , and that s very difficult she still has headaches , back pain , fatigue , numbness in her hands and burning pain down her arms pat smith , president of the lyme disease association , a national nonprofit group based in jackson , nj , said her group had helped develop two bills now before congress that would provide 100 million for research , education and prevention , in part to develop a definitive diagnostic test people who receive an early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics generally recover and do not develop chronic symptoms but diagnostic tests have only been about 50 percent accurate , ms smith said , adding that she has seen an increase in chronic cases since the disease was identified , because as the number of cases grows , the number of undiagnosed , misdiagnosed and slowly treated cases has also grown some people have to go to dozens of physicians before they get diagnosed , and people are getting delayed or inappropriate treatments , she said linda davis , 42 , of freehold , nj , in monmouth county , had misdiagnoses of multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia , among other ailments , before learning she had lyme disease in 2003 she was using a wheelchair when she finally started receiving proper treatment her sons , austin hutcherson , 8 , and myles hutcherson , 6 , also have the disease none of us had the bull seye rash , she said after receiving antibiotics , they are all doing better , though they still have symptoms austin has gastrointestinal problems , and myles has chronic fatigue we try to keep everything normal , she said they 're always playing outside most people do n't even know they have lyme disease ms smith said the lyme disease association was also raising money for an endowed research center at columbia university devoted to chronic lyme disease and supported research into the genome of borrelia burgdorferi , the bacteria that causes lyme disease researchers at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in newark are determining the genetic structure of 17 strains of the bacteria , with help from researchers at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , stony brook university and the university of utah one new jersey researcher , dr steven schutzer , said , knowing the genetic sequence will help in diagnostics , and possibly different kinds of therapeutics despite concerns about the disease , mr beckley , the hunterdon county health officer , urged people to enjoy the outdoors you can go on as many hikes as you want through the woods , but stay on the path , he said if you must go off the path , you should tuck your pants in your socks , he said , and use insecticides or insect repellent and check for ticks on yourself , your children and pets after being outside photos kim uffleman , shown with her dog , topaz , has had chronic lyme for 17 years a sign at mine brook park in flemington , nj , warns hikers

\( john mcfarland writes a weekly advice column on fantasy football in this week s introduction , he makes an interesting point in recent seasons , colts stars were a nightmare for fantasy owners in the most crucial weeks of the season because they were used sparingly to rest them for the playoffs not so this year \) by john mcfarland associated press peyton manning s unfortunate reputation as a big stats guy who can t win the big game isn t limited to the real world in fantasy football , more than a few players have coasted into the playoffs behind manning s gaudy numbers , only to find them shrivel up at the worst time there was his scoreless walkthrough last year in week 15 and his onetouchdown game in week 14 the year before and his 0td effort in week 15 of 2003 and don t forget his recent seasonending giveups , when he made brief cameos before resting for the playoffs but there s good news this year , fantasy geeks the colts aren t nearly as good ! they ll be scrambling for playoff position until the bitter end , all while failing to run or stop anybody from doing so the result should be a big fantasy payoff for owners of manning , marvin harrison and reggie wayne in fact , manning already has kept some fantasy teams afloat with 313 yards passing and a td run last week , and those figures should go up in the next two games against cincinnati s nflworst pass defense , then houston s no 26 pass defense as you tivo past yet another series of commercials featuring manning , here are some players to start in week 15 , some to avoid and a few long shots that just may pan out a safe bet usually this is no place for the painfully obvious pick , but it s the playoffs , so here s betting new orleans s drew brees goes crazy on a washington defense that s allowed an nflhigh 25 touchdowns \( brees may have to open the third quarter with the kneeldown play \) if tom brady didn t knock you out of the playoffs with his goose egg last week , give him another shot as the patriots take out some frustrations on a texans defense that has improved to just kind of bad the jets chad pennington should rack up big numbers , following the usual strategy of avoiding the ground game altogether against minnesota s no 1 run defense the vikings actually have stopped two straight quarterbacks , but it was only rex grossman and jon kitna green bay s brett favre might play for 10 more years if he can work detroit into the schedule more often he ripped the lions for 340 yards and three scores early in the season and they re even worse now ok , so maybe there s something positive for the lions , with kitna probably picking up another 300 yards and a score or two in garbage time after giving away a handful of turnovers \( really , for them that s positive \) take a shot suddenly arizona and matt leinart aren t so terrible he s got a pair of twotd games and a 400yard game in his last four outings , and the broncos are freefalling with four straight losses back away slowly and nobody gets hurt please , in the name of blair kiel , don t start these guys as crazy as it sounds , bench cincinnati s carson palmer if you have another option he should be relegated to handoff guy against a colts defense that gave up 375 yards rushing last week in other soft tackling news , look for eli manning to have a modest game as the giants run every down against the eagles \( philadelphia apparently built its 29thranked run defense using the colts model \) even though david garrard had three tds in jacksonville s 377 win over tennessee last month , he s a postseason risk he s thrown for two or more scores in three starts this year , but had none in his other four starts running backs all day long think larry johnson s a good guy to have in the fantasy playoffs \? he scored multiple touchdowns in the final three games each of the past two years for the chiefs he went over 130 yards rushing in four of those games , with 115 receiving in another game cincinnati should give the colts another glimpse of their playoff future , with rudi johnson rumbling for 375 yards or so the colts run defense has allowed an nflworst 1765 yards a game and 17 scores usually pittsburgh s willie parker is only good at home , but he s playing in his home state of carolina and the steelers are back to running every down unless passing absolutely can t be avoided \( the panthers are done tackling for the year , by the way \) if artose pinner can humiliate the lions , surely green bay s ahman green can too green didn t do much against the lions in week 3 , but detroit was still a week or two from surrendering it s easy to see why jacksonville s maurice drew can t be stopped at 5foot7 and 212 pounds he s like a really fast fire hydrant he s also scored in five straight games he could find a seam if you can figure out who s starting for minnesota , you re smarter than me if chester taylor returns from a rib injury , he ll shred the jets terrible run defense if not , pinner should red flags with kevin jones out with a major foot injury , steer clear of arlen harris or whoever else the lions dig up \( it s hard to believe matt millen hasn t stocked the bench with incredible talent , but trust me here \) give tennessee s travis henry a rest against a jaguars run defense allowing just 87 yards a game he was held to 67 yards and no scores last time against the jags ron dayne , houston s back of the moment after scoring twice last week , is on the cusp of being a feelgood comeback story \( isn t he always \? \) but alas , his story gets sad again in new england wide receivers throw him the darn ball ! the saints receivers situation remains dicey , with the only surefire fantasy points coming these days from third receiver devery henderson marques colston should be worth a start , though , even if he s only sort of healthy , against the noncovering redskins the jets laveranues coles and jerricho cotchery should both find plenty of open spaces against the noncovering vikings chicago s bernard berrian and muhsin muhammad are both good starts against a soft tampa bay pass defense with brian griese always warming up nearby , rex grossman is out to prove he can be not awful for two straight games philadelphia s donte stallworth has scored in two straight games and also had a td in the first game against the giants , who just got smoked for 423 yards passing by chris weinke , of all people houston s andre johnson has just one td in his last six games and hasn t hit 100 yards in seven straight , but he should cash in on garbage time points at new england maybe throw him the darn ball \? the browns have rediscovered freeagent acquisition joe jurevicius , who has averaged eight catches and 93 yards the past two games show him the darn bench ! denver s offense showed a little more life in jay cutler s second start , but not enough to merit putting javon walker in the lineup again even against the cardinals joey galloway s about all the bucs have , and they re playing a chicago defense that s softened , but don t pin your hopes on a 35yearold guy in the nfl s secondworst offense chock up the 144yard day by carolina s drew carter as a fluke \( plus , steve smith and keyshawn johnson would not stand for such ballsharing two weeks in a row \) freeagent shopping list pick up these guys if they re available in your league artose pinner of minnesota \( 125 yards , 3 tds \) , ron dayne of houston \( 87 yards , 2 tds \) , dj hackett of seattle \( 104 yards , td \) , drew bennett of tennessee \( 113 yards \) what do i know \? here s the best and worst of last week s projections big hits i thought drew brees \( 384 yards , 5 tds \) would handle dallas perhaps overly vaunted defense and that larry johnson \( 120 yards \) would succeed against the ravens deservedly vaunted defense i also expected success for ladell betts \( 171 yards \) , edgerrin james \( 115 yards , td \) marty booker \( 123 yards , td \) and devery henderson \( 92 yards , td \) big misses i knew the vikings backup would have a big game , but i thought it would be ciatrick fason , not artose pinner i didn t expect a resurrected rex grossman \( 2 tds \) or a merely human tony romo \( td , 2 ints \) i also expected big things for michael vick \( 0 tds \) and santana moss \( 34 yards \) , but failure for fred taylor \( 131 yards , td \)
on a bleak fall sunday , when even the foliage in northern westchester has taken on a gloomy cast , ruth zager and james gallagher settle into their booth at the 15th annual caramoor fall art and antiques show in katonah , ny , surrounded by what must be a ton of early american fireplace equipment 75 pairs of 18th and 19thcentury brass andirons , 30 fenders , 80 sets of tools , and enough candlesticks and biscuit tins to outfit half the bedandbreakfasts in the hudson valley already , it has been a bit of a slog driving to the hotel after the preview party friday night , the dealers' fourwheel pack mule a 1997 box truck with 100 , 000 miles broke down in the rain , sending them scurrying for a latenight repair shop and a truck rental and the show s foot traffic , some years a stampede , has been more of a pitterpatter so far the couple shrug it off martha stewart , whose 153acre estate sits across the street from caramoor , stopped by last night to eye some period andirons \( she did n't buy anything , but ms zager says even famousname renovators can take years to decide \) more important , fellow dealers have been streaming by all weekend , bearing sweets , sympathy and shop talk , which , when you 're living the vagabond life on the antiquesshow circuit , is as valuable as a fivefigure sale my sisterinlaw calls us the carny folk , because we 're always on the road , traveling from show to show , said ms zager , who , at 65 , still logs a bonewearying 16 shows a season , most within a fourhour drive of her home in north norwich , ny when we started out , we did 43 a year , but we were 30 years younger then it s as certain as beach days giving way to frosty nights every weekend from september to april , hundreds of art and antiques shows across the united states throw open their doors , most of them , like caramoor , modest operations populated by veteran dealers \( some from as far as california \) and alwaysfickle customers \( who are happy to come unless it s better weather for pumpkinpicking \) these are not the marquee national extravaganzas , like the winter antiques show at the seventh regiment armory in manhattan or the philadelphia antiques show nor are they the noname flea markets that inhabit back roads and church basements , where dreams of unearthing the next indian chief weather vane like the one that fetched 58 million at sotheby s last month clash with the kitschy reality of catshaped cookie jars shows like caramoor are , quite simply , the breadandbutter of the antiques business week after week , they help fill the coffers of local sponsors in the case of caramoor , home to the region s largest outdoor music festival , proceeds go to the estate s house museum and garden guild and they promise a ready stream of customers for the dealers , who often spend more time hauling to shows in houston , aspen and palm beach than they do in their own shops that is , if they have shops for many of caramoor s 31 vendors , the road is the shop with a tough hide , quick wit and comfortable shoes , these road warriors are as skilled at selling themselves as their wares one part historian , one part circus performer , they tightrope their way through 15 , 30 , even 40 shows and thousands of customers a year not even the patina of a vintage car show caramoor s tightly edited display included a 1948 ford woody station wagon , a 1950 jaguar roadster and a 1965 aston martin , all from the celebrated collection of its neighbor ralph lauren is enough to let them relax it s show business , said danielle ann millican , a florham park , nj , dealer in antique botanicals and maps , who travels to about a dozen shows a year you get the bug and you just want to do it there s an excitement to it , like any theater troupe going from town to town her enthusiasm is infectious on oct 21 , caramoor s opening day , ms millican stood in front of an early18thcentury print of a moth , caterpillar and papaya plant , her green eyes twinkling as she told the story of the artist , maria sybilla merian , a germanborn naturalist who divorced her husband and set out in 1699 , at the age of 52 , on a threemonth voyage from amsterdam to surinam to record bugs and plants i love telling people about women like maria and how you can do anything you want to , said ms millican , who left her own career as a hotel executive to sell prints that was 25 years ago as the number of shows has mushroomed in the last few decades , experts say , so has the pressure on dealers to find fresh merchandise and fresh audiences new york is infested with shows , said sanford l smith , who has been in the antiques business for 40 years , half of them spent putting together largescale shows the problem in the entire show business is that people are much busier than they were 10 , 15 , 20 years ago you have a husband and wife working , you have busy kids , and the only time they have to do anything is on weekends , so you 're not seeing the gate you used to

the mystic aquarium and institute for exploration is going into the restaurant and bar business next month , a commercial subsidiary of the connecticut aquarium s parent organization will open the first of three restaurants called the blue turtle in the connecticut post mall in milford the other blue turtles are scheduled to open this fall at the westchester mall in white plains , on the foodcourt level , and in the former sears store at the shoppes at buckland hills mall in manchester , conn the blue turtle , despite its name and its owner , will not have an aquatic theme , nor will the target audience be families the restaurant , aimed at customers 21 to 45 years old , will have computer games built into the bar , virtual reality games and simulators large flatscreen televisions will also enable people to play games against one another or watch sporting events the menu will include hamburgers , ribs , steaks and pasta and while the snack bar at the aquarium does not sell seafood , the blue turtle will salmon , lobster , calamari , shrimp and clam chowder will be served the move is part of a plan by the aquarium , a nonprofit education and research organization , to bolster its revenues so that it can offer new exhibits and improve its financial health annual attendance has remained flat at about 700 , 000 the aquarium has lost money over the last few years and has struggled to pay off the remaining 19 million in longterm debt for the renovation and expansion that was completed in 2000 we 're responding to the realities of the marketplace today , which tell us that a standalone education and research center will have a hard time making it , said steve coan , the chief operating officer of the aquarium tim mullany , the aquarium s chief financial officer , said the longterm plan was to open at least two new blue turtles between boston and washington each year he said that opening in the westchester made sense because the area s average household net worth and mall spending was second to none mr mullany and mr coan have compared the blue turtle to dave buster s and the espn zone , large entertainmentfilled restaurants in urban centers the blue turtles will be in 13 , 000squarefoot spaces in suburban shopping malls the restaurants have been designed by the cunningham group , a minneapolis firm that created the rain forest cafe and themepark attractions like the back to the future ride at universal studios in florida and in california the only mention of the restaurant s connection to the aquarium will come on the menus , which will say that the proceeds benefit the sea research foundation , the parent organization jim farrell , vice president for operations for the connecticut restaurant association , said he was surprised that the restaurant s connection to the aquarium would be so subtle you would think they would play that up a little more , he said cross marketing is such an important aspect of doing business today mr mullany , who is also chief executive of the mystic entertainment company , the subsidiary set up to run the restaurants , said the aquarium s board of trustees wanted to keep the two entities separate the aquarium has its own mission , and they did n't want to do anything to affect that brand , he said we also wanted a generic concept we did n't want to become a theme restaurant in the connecticut post mall , the restaurant will be on the second level it will be about 100 feet from the mall s food court and take up two store spaces , one of which is vacant and another that most recently housed a women s apparel store the milford and manchester locations will have outdoor patios art butterfield , a senior leasing manager for the westfield group , which owns the connecticut post mall and 66 other shopping centers , said that he could see the blue turtle becoming a national chain malls are very interested in having the first showing of a cuttingedge restaurant , he said it s a completely new idea there s plenty of demand for something like this mr farrell called the blue turtle a bold move for a nonprofit institution , but said he understood that such organizations had to look for new sources of revenue to survive if they do it right and put it in the right place where the market is , they 'll get people in there , he said it s a great concept we 'll see if the public latches on to it but the one thing the public will not see is an actual blue turtle according to the aquarium , blue turtles do n't exist we 're creating the species , mr mullany said photo the blue turtle will open next month in the connecticut post mall in milford another is planned for white plains \( photo by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)
after sunday s game between the jets and the bills at giants stadium , buffalo defensive end ryan denney will linger with his family , which now includes jets tight end doug jolley , before rushing off to make his team bus on the last friday in october , denney and jolley also had little time to talk the occasion was the wedding of jolley , denney s teammate and roommate at brigham young , and mary beesley , the younger sister of denney s wife , laura the ceremony took place in salt lake city during the jets' bye week the only problem was , the bills had a game at new england on sunday denney , a groomsman , made it to the church on time after traveling from buffalo the night before he received permission from bills coach mike mularkey to miss practice that friday , but had to dash from the wedding reception to catch a redeye to be back in time for the bills' morning walkthrough i did make a special effort to be there , denney said wednesday by telephone from buffalo doug would have understood if i did n't make it , but i wanted to be there i knew it was important for him it was a big deal , jolley said , and not simply because denney is his best friend it was through denney that jolley met mary when denney and laura were dating , her parents and six siblings occasionally stopped for dinner at the tony roma s in provo where denney and jolley were servers when denney was invited to dinner at the beesleys , he often took jolley along in an interview wednesday night at their rented house on long island , the jolleys snuggled and sometimes finished each other s sentences as they described their courtship boxes and bags were scattered in six days , they were leaving for utah and , in short order , a deferred honeymoon \( jolley has told mary only that they are departing from los angeles and that she will need her passport and scuba gear \) denney and laura beesley were married in the spring of 2002 mary , who was 15 at the time , said at the wedding , doug and i danced together i do remember that they got a picture of us jolley said i liked her a lot but we did n't think of each other as more than friends they were separated by seven years , not to mention the state of nevada , after jolley was selected in the second round of the 2002 draft by the oakland raiders for a long time , those gulfs seemed too great mary graduated from high school a year early and enrolled at byu , but jolley had moved to california every offseason , jolley returned to provo to work out , and made sure he crossed paths with mary one weekend last march , they met up with denney and laura in st george , utah , where jolley grew up , and realized , to their surprise , that they were in love the change in their relationship was so obvious , denney pulled mary aside during the weekend and asked what is going on \? you guys are acting like you 're engaged three months later , they were jolley , who turns 27 on monday , was traded to the jets in april on june 15 , he packed his belongings into his sports utility vehicle and drove straight from oakland to salt lake city , where he asked brent beesley for his daughter s hand in marriage ryan helped me out a lot with that , jolley said he kind of told me what to expect after receiving brent s blessing , jolley drove to provo , practicing his proposal during the hourplus trip as soon as she recovered her breath , mary said yes jolley wanted to get married right away so mary could be with him in new york from the start of the season mary wanted to wait until after the season so she had more time to plan the wedding they compromised and set the date for oct 28 the jets lost three of their first four games , and jolley started to get nervous what if coach herman edwards decided to hold practices in new york during the off week because the team was not playing well \? i worried about that , said jolley , who told none of the coaches and only a few players about the wedding a lot of times if your season is n't going well , the coaches will give you less time off during the bye week in the bye week , edwards let the players go after their wednesday meetings the next week , when jolley was asked what he did with his time off , he flashed his wedding band i think most of the guys thought i must have gone to vegas and eloped , jolley said , laughing on sunday , jolley and denney will show up at giants stadium , and a family reunion will break out all nine beesleys will attend the game laura and mary have two brothers , 13 and 9 , and mary said , the funniest thing about the whole situation is now my brothers think it s totally normal to grow up and be an nfl player photo jets tight end doug jolley , left , married mary beesley on oct 28 mary s sister laura , right , is married to bills defensive end ryan denney , jolley s roommate at byu the denneys have two children
like many in westchester , i have a mortgage to pay and children under age 9 to eventually send to college , and sometimes i figure that the only way to deal with all the bills successfully is for daddy warbucks to adopt me our financial futures , to be sure , are no joking matter but if those of us with small children ca n't laugh at footing who knows how much a year for college by the time the children are ready , we 'll have to cry hoping to avoid the tears , i turned to dave barry , a fellow graduate of the memorably named wampus elementary school in armonk mr barry , who , like me , has no idea what a wampus is , may be our nation s most popular humor writer although he is frequently associated with florida because he gained fame as a syndicated columnist for the miami herald , mr barry is from westchester like me , he grew up on the lessthanmean streets of armonk that s why , when i read an excellent review of mr barry s latest book , i knew i had to give him a call mr barry s new book , dave barry s money secrets , like why is there a giant eyeball on the dollar \? \( crown publishers , 2495 \) , gives tongueincheck advice while spoofing financial selfhelp books it focuses on the macropicture , but , mr barry still has plenty of advice on how to financially survive life in westchester , where that house down the street that looks like a million bucks sells for 457 million first , i asked mr barry , if you are looking for a home in westchester , how do you handle the manically inflated housing market \? people have asked me similar advice about the florida keys , mr barry said , and in terms of westchester , i 'd just tell them the same buy property in armonk 50 years ago i urge everyone to buy as much as possible back then buying in the past gives the investor the benefit of foresight , mr barry said , which is what you need back when his father bought land in westchester for 2 , 000 and built a house on it , this was a contrarian s play , something every canny investor looks to do armonk had no cachet then , mr barry said just bars my followup question was one many of our children will grow up asking themselves how will any of them afford to live in the county they grew up in \? they wo n't have to , mr barry said when people in westchester sell a home in coming years , he said , the kids will stay there he explained it will be a clause in the sales contract 'my son will stay in his bedroom throughout adulthood' mr barry noted that in armonk , many people had become used to the largess of ibm after all , as the world headquarters of ibm , armonk for years received ample tax revenue from the company they even paid for the trombones for the school band , did n't they \? mr barry asked they would fly over the village and drop dollars from a helicopter but ibm has moved much of its operations elsewhere , even as armonk has become bigger , with an everincreasing tax burden for residents these days , ibm s contribution is relatively smaller what was mr barry s advice on how to pay less in property taxes without ending up in prison \? none of his advice , mr barry cautioned , precluded the possibility of going to prison the only thing he could come up with on the semilegal side was to play poor when the local tax collector came by the house by putting your old bentley on cinderblocks in the lower portion of the front yard with so much now settled , i asked mr barry about that widely shared sorrow college costs with a keen eye for turning financial conventions on their heads , or maybe dropping them on their heads , he immediately set me straight bad colleges are way cheaper , he said but bad colleges require bad grades to this end , mr barry said that parents should really crack the whip when grades start creeping up , mr barry said , take action he does not think that many westchester children , after stumbling through school , will want to make a living through humor writing because , he said , it is frighteningly close to manual labor for a betterthansubsistencelevel living that can have you paying rent on that room in your parent s old home , he suggests leverage and branding i do n't know what they are , mr barry said , but they are good i do n't know if his advice will get me a private plane on standby anytime soon but i thanked him for his time and thought that s ok , mr barry said us wampus men have to stick together drawing \( drawing by nancy doniger \)
almost anyone who loves tennis and follows the men s tour on television has , over the last few years , had what might be termed federer moments these are times , as you watch the young swiss play , when the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you re ok the moments are more intense if you ve played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do we ve all got our examples here is one it s the finals of the 2005 us open , federer serving to andre agassi early in the fourth set there s a mediumlong exchange of groundstrokes , one with the distinctive butterfly shape of today s powerbaseline game , federer and agassi yanking each other from side to side , each trying to set up the baseline winneruntil suddenly agassi hits a hard heavy crosscourt backhand that pulls federer way out wide to his ad \( left \) side , and federer gets to it but slices the stretch backhand short , a couple feet past the service line , which of course is the sort of thing agassi dines out on , and as federer s scrambling to reverse and get back to center , agassi s moving in to take the short ball on the rise , and he smacks it hard right back into the same ad corner , trying to wrongfoot federer , which in fact he does federer s still near the corner but running toward the centerline , and the ball s heading to a point behind him now , where he just was , and there s no time to turn his body around , and agassi s following the shot in to the net at an angle from the backhand sideand what federer now does is somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward three or four steps , impossibly fast , to hit a forehand out of his backhand corner , all his weight moving backward , and the forehand is a topspin screamer down the line past agassi at net , who lunges for it but the ball s past him , and it flies straight down the sideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of agassi s side , a winner federer s still dancing backward as it lands and there s that familiar little second of shocked silence from the new york crowd before it erupts , and john mcenroe with his color man s headset on tv says \( mostly to himself , it sounds like \) , how do you hit a winner from that position \? and he s right given agassi s position and worldclass quickness , federer had to send that ball down a twoinch pipe of space in order to pass him , which he did , moving backwards , with no setup time and none of his weight behind the shot it was impossible it was like something out of the matrix i don t know whatall sounds were involved , but my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over the couch and i was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like noveltyshop eyeballs anyway , that s one example of a federer moment , and that was merely on tv and the truth is that tv tennis is to live tennis pretty much as video porn is to the felt reality of human love journalistically speaking , there is no hot news to offer you about roger federer he is , at 25 , the best tennis player currently alive maybe the best ever bios and profiles abound 60 minutes did a feature on him just last year anything you want to know about mr roger nmi federer his background , his home town of basel , switzerland , his parents sane and unexploitative support of his talent , his junior tennis career , his early problems with fragility and temper , his beloved junior coach , how that coach s accidental death in 2002 both shattered and annealed federer and helped make him what he now is , federer s 39 career singles titles , his eight grand slams , his unusually steady and mature commitment to the girlfriend who travels with him \( which on the men s tour is rare \) and handles his affairs \( which on the men s tour is unheard of \) , his oldschool stoicism and mental toughness and good sportsmanship and evident overall decency and thoughtfulness and charitable largess it s all just a google search away knock yourself out
to the editor re panel urges basic shift in us policy in iraq \( front page , dec 7 \) reading the 79 recommendations from the iraq study group , i ca n't imagine president bush admitting his failures bringing in controversial experts to help him carry out its suggestions when he surrounds himself only with yes people and allowing diplomatic talks to take place with iran and syria the report shows the utter chaos in our interagency communications the frustration of the military generals our abject failure of privatizing reconstruction the wasted money on building permanent bases and the complete lack of knowledge of the history in the middle east and those are just a few of the problems ! what a rebuke to the decider all i can say is what a mess , and good luck jacqueline jones portland , ore , dec 7 , 2006 to the editor reading your article about the iraq study group s report , i could only wonder does it occur to anyone else how sad it is that there had to be a study on the war in iraq at all \? a competent president with advisers both military and civilian would have had a grip on the situation , the mood of the country and the political ramifications of our policy \( or lack thereof \) in iraq and acted accordingly the president waited until after the election to bend ever so slightly away from staying the course , and defense secretary donald h rumsfeld s memo admitting failure was secret until after his resignation meanwhile , the committee investigating the iraq war was taking care of business while the president waited in the wings for guidance and answers the public saw the results of the study coming for a year or more there is nothing revealing or new in the report that has n't been in the news or on the lips of advisers for months we now have to wait and see if in the president s skewed view , this report is more credible than all the professional input he has received over the last three years what a waste of time , money and , sadly , more lives in iraq laure dunne darien , conn , dec 7 , 2006 to the editor while our country spends money and loses face by hiring an elite panel of advisers to help us out of iraq , let s also remember a different group of advisers the focus group of millions of americans \( and millions worldwide \) who took to the streets in 2002 and 2003 to protest invading in the first place many of them , with none of this panel s expertise , had the common sense to expect the very situation we 're in now david dartley new york , dec 7 , 2006 to the editor your frontpage article says that rather than embracing president bush s goal of victory in iraq or the white house s early aspiration that iraq might be transformed into a democracy in the near future the panel chose instead the formulation that mr bush has adopted most recently to establish a country that can sustain itself , govern itself and defend itself was n't that precisely the situation that existed in iraq before our invasion \? warren nadel new york , dec 7 , 2006 to the editor re welcome political cover \( editorial , dec 7 \) before the times and the american people embrace the findings of the iraq study group , the following should be seriously considered the conclusions do not reflect the results of the nov 7 election , which clearly gave our elected officials a mandate to get out of iraq posthaste , nor do they honor the wishes of the american people reflected in the polls , which sent the same message the conclusions do not honor the wishes of the iraqi people , who overwhelmingly support the end of the illconceived occupation of their country the conclusions do not reflect the views of much of the leadership of the democratic party , elected to the majority of both houses of congress , which called for a phased redeployment of american troops outside of iraq within six months while the media insist that the iraq study group is nonpartisan \( only to the extent that it is composed of five republicans and five democrats \) , the group did not pick up the mood of the country at all , nor did it adequately represent us in a supposedly representative democracy dennis dalrymple new york , dec 7 , 2006 to the editor your dec 7 editorial concerning the iraq study group s report is helpfully but sadly put in perspective by your frontpage news analysis the same day , will it work in the white house \? for it to work in the white house , president bush must be able to admit , at least to himself , that his policy in iraq , if it can be called that , has not worked and that the situation in iraq is deteriorating he must also be able to accept the criticisms implicit in the report nothing in his six years in office has shown him capable of such honest introspection the fact that the report does offer mr bush a chance to gather a bipartisan consensus for change is a compliment to the report but mr bush , since being anointed president in 2000 by the supreme court and very narrowly winning an election in 2004 , has acted like an emperor with a mandate to do as he sees fit to mr bush , bipartisan means having the support of his friend tony blair
