washington , may 10 the state department suffers from a systemic failure to protect secrets that is longstanding and far broader than the recent series of lapses publicly denounced by secretary of state madeleine k albright , a range of administration officials say interviews with state department officials , intelligence experts and lawmakers monitoring the department s security as well as a recent audit by the department s inspector general depict an agency where small violations are frequent , few are punished and many employees do not take basic precautions last year , the federal bureau of investigation reported that a suspected spy roamed the halls of the department unattended many of the department s officecleaners and maintenance staff work unsupervised , though most lack security clearances officials responsible for security admit they have no reliable way of tracking who enters or leaves the department s foggy bottom headquarters and lack the staff to inspect outgoing cars or briefcases more than four security breaches are reported on an average day , for a total of 1 , 673 incidents in 1998 , the latest year for which such statistics were available the vast majority of these were minor incidents , and only four were viewed as egregious , according to the inspector general s september 1999 audit , which did not detail those incidents from 1995 to 1998 , the department referred 53 cases to the fbi , the audit said none resulted in prosecution the reports and interviews do not shed light on any new instances in which secrets were lost rather , they depict a lax and even careless bureaucracy that resists the kinds of stringent precautions that critics say are necessary in the world of national security for example , employees sometimes leave confidential documents unattended on their desks , fail to change safe combinations frequently enough , and lose track of agency computers , the reports say officials in and out of the state department , including one who is to testify before a house hearing on thursday about security breaches , point to these areas as leaving the department particularly vulnerable employees and regular visitors are issued photo id cards that open turnstiles at the building s entrance when swiped through a slot but no one checks to make sure a card is carried by the right person a stolen or borrowed card can be used by an unauthorized person to gain entry since a new policy was instituted in august , all visitors who are not government employees must have escorts but the policy does not apply to accredited reporters , leaving foreign intelligence services a loophole they can exploit timothy d bereznay , an fbi section chief , will testify on thursday that his agency has identified more than one spy among accredited foreign journalists , according to a draft of his testimony none of the 140 offices handling classified materials had been inspected for listening devices or cameras and , although the department distributes about 3 , 500 pages of secret documents throughout the building on a given day , there is no record showing whether the papers were ever received or returned some security experts say the department s culture resists security measures while officials at the pentagon or the central intelligence agency see secrecy as a paramount value , diplomats embrace openness and depend on foreign visitors marine guards practice for overseas postings by conducting surprise inspections of the department s offices during eight inspections in 1998 , the guards turned up an average of 63 problems each time a diplomat said the marine sweeps have been cut back because they resulted in too much paperwork while many infractions may be relatively minor , the stakes are high spilled secrets may lead to serious damage to american ties with other governments , the audit warned , or even to the arrest , torture or death of sources working for the united states the cia is so troubled by the department s record that it routinely withholds classified information , diplomats and lawmakers said representative porter j goss , republican of florida and the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence , said recent security breaches involving a missing laptop computer and an eavesdropping device implanted in a department conference room were part of a longtime pattern their access controls are primitive and not well enforced , mr goss said their escort policies are bizarre and not well enforced their document control is between deficient and nonexistent dr albright s security adviser is already tightening some procedures david g carpenter , the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security and a former secret service agent , is leading a sweeping review of how the department handles classified materials and protects against espionage , with assistance from the fbi and the cia dr albright announced the security shakeup last month , more than two months after a laptop computer containing highly sensitive files about weapons proliferation disappeared from the department s bureau of intelligence and research in december , federal authorities discovered an eavesdropping device in a department conference room and swiftly expelled a russian diplomat from the country dr albright summoned nearly 800 employees for a public excoriation in which she asserted that they were all failures unless they protected government secrets in remarks to newspaper publishers on tuesday , dr albright referred to the recent lapses i was both angered and embarrassed , she said on behalf of all employees of the state department , i'm humiliated for decades , the department allowed foreign officials , journalists and other visitors to wander on their own throughout the building of roughly 1 , 000 visitors a day , about one in seven is a foreign government official the fbi reported last year that suspected foreign intelligence personnel had the opportunity to plant listening devices or steal documents as they moved unescorted through the halls in august , mr carpenter tightened the policy to require escorts of all visitors without permanent passes , except other government employees but representative benjamin a gilman , republican of new york and the chairman of the international relations committee , is not satisfied foreign reporters are on the honor system to remain in areas designated for the press , he said in other words , the new escort policy has a hole you could lead an elephant through , mr gilman said past reports indicate that foreign intelligence services , particularly russia s and china s , have used reporters' credentials as cover for their spies the department s reliance on contract workers for security guards , maintenance and food service poses other problems most contract employees are subjected only to cursory police checks only 15 out of 100 janitors have security clearances mr goss , a former cia agent , ascribes the department s problems to partially arrogance and disdain for security but defenders of the diplomats note that more serious breaches of security occurred at the cia , where aldrich h ames , who was convicted of spying for the soviet union , worked they view department officials as struggling under a unique mandate that simply will not let them retreat behind walls and security fences are they making too many mistakes \? as far as i can tell from the public record , the answer is yes , said steven aftergood , senior research analyst at the federation of american scientists but statecraft requires a tradeoff , he added your security ca n't be so overwhelming that you 're unable to perform the task of diplomacy
the private property sign posted just inside yaddo , the renowned artists' colony in saratoga springs , ny , has always seemed apt literally and metaphorically just as visitors are allowed in the rose garden but not near the 19thcentury mansion where artists work , yaddo has been willing to bask in the glory of the luminaries like truman capote and virgil thompson who blossomed there , but it has discouraged most publicity about itself yaddo has never even published a complete list of the more than 5 , 500 writers , composers and visual artists who have stayed there for periods of two weeks to two months over the years there was always the sense that publicity was bad , said michael g sundell , yaddo s president it was tied to the idea of yaddo being a retreat and not wanting to pollute that but this year is different in celebration of its 100th anniversary , yaddo is sponsoring a very public birthday party a festival of concerts , readings , exhibitions , screenings , open studios and symposiums in new york and saratoga springs that began on april 15 and runs through october something else is unusual , too in the past , on the rare occasions that yaddo people spoke about the retreat they usually dwelled on the colony s vaunted history on sylvia plath , clyfford still , katherine anne porter , william carlos williams and leonard bernstein \( who went to yaddo just once but whose antics have always been good for an anecdote or three \) for the festival , though , the spotlight is more on the artists of the 1980 s and 90 s the artists involved were insistent on it , mr sundell said they wanted to focus on work being done now or recently , because they think highly of a lot of the people they met there and so the festival includes world premieres of musical pieces by david del tredici , richard danielpour , steven burke and dan coleman it offers readings by oscar hijuelos , a m holmes and robert stone it has exhibits of work by martin puryear , joyce kosloff and kristen jones , and performance pieces by john kelly and william popel for friendships in arcadia writers and artists at yaddo in the 90 s , on view through saturday at art in general in tribeca , yaddo enlisted 25 alums to write wall texts for work by artists \( the complete schedule is listed on www yaddo org or www artandculture com \) in addition to celebrating its centurylong support of creativity , yaddo has another reason for its newfound willingness to trade some mystique for visibility a few years ago yaddo started a fundraising campaign to assure its future , seeking resources to keep the property in shape and add the occasional upgrade the goal 85 million by the end of this year is nearly realized , but yaddo s trustees say they need to attract more donors if we were going to ask people for money , they had to have heard of yaddo , mr sundell said that meant raising its profile , specifically in new york we do not have the capacity to do something nationally , mr sundell said but we could do something in the arts capital of the world , the media capital of the world so the festival is an investment of sorts the only moneymaking part is the annual benefit gala , a silent auction and dinner that takes place tomorrow ticket prices for the other events , mr sundell said , were purposely kept low to help spread word of yaddo some are free the story of yaddo \( an invented word meant to rhyme with shadow \) begins in 1881 when spencer trask , a new york financier , and his wife , a poet named katrina , bought a piney 400acre estate in the hudson valley , land that once held a tavern frequented by edgar allan poe and other literati of the 1830 s and 40 s a fire destroyed their first home there , but in 1893 the trasks build a victorian mansion , a darkwood and heavyfurniture kind of place that became the scene of famous house parties to which the trasks invited artists , authors , composers , statesmen and industrialists but there was tragedy as well the trasks' four children died young lacking heirs , the couple decided in 1900 to create a trust establishing an artists' retreat after their deaths they imagined a place where artists of all kinds , selected by peerreview panels , could live for two weeks to two months , able to work in peace without daily obligations or interruptions \( or , in the last halfcentury , television \) trask died in 1909 , his wife in 1922 , and yaddo welcomed its first crop of artists in the summer of 1926 thus yaddo is cheating a little , celebrating the anniversary of the idea of yaddo rather than its 100th year of operation \( this is n't the first 100th anniversary , either in 1993 yaddo marked the 100th anniversary of its 55room mansion by opening the doors to public tours for the first time , at 12 a head \) this is the most important date , mr sundell argued , because this is when they made the decision to create yaddo , when they signed the papers but he conceded that the colony will undoubtedly have another centennial in 2026
washington at the tumultuous 1912 republican convention , former president theodore roosevelt denounced the denial of credentials to his supporters by his successor , william howard taft teddy labeled the taft men stolen delegates and thundered thou shalt not steal ! forty years later , taft s son senator robert taft of ohio tried to block texans for eisenhower from contesting the seats of the protaft texas delegation an ike supporter rose to refuse to allow many thousands of decent texas citizens to be completely disenfranchised by slick , crafty political tricks and shabby conniving at a signal from the ike backer tex mccrary , a chant from the past filled the convention hall thou shalt not steal ! the aroused delegates overruled taft s credentials committee , and eisenhower overwhelmed the choice of the gop establishment now to the possible rubber match between insurgents and old guard in year 2000 , the center of crafty tricks and shabby conniving in gop primary politics is in the state of new york gov george pataki , with dreams of being george w bush s running mate dancing in his head , hopes he has reduced the onerous obstacles to ballot access just enough to pass federal court muster but pataki s new york remains the most unfair place in the nation for rankandfile republicans to contest boss rule four years ago , the albany gang s barriers forced the insurgent steve forbes to spend 18 million to get on the ballot in a gentlemen s agreement this year , bush and forbes planned not to challenge each other s signatures but when pataki was directed by bush to attack john mccain s names , the new york governor felt he had to try to knock off some of forbes s signatures as well , lest he seem inconsistent in court the dead canary has been sent , responds a forbes lawyer who has been watching mob movies he will file a candidate aggrieved suit and charge fraud in brooklyn districts but what worries bush s austinalbany axis is growing coverage of its blatant attempt to deny new york voters the right to choose delegates to support mccain it s embarrassing to admit fear of competition new york s state chairman , william powers , cannot have enjoyed telling many county leaders that the word from austin was to play hardball his press agents contend that everybody does it , that mccain s arizona is worse , but none of that chaff will fool insecuritysensitive new york republicans in manhattan s silk stocking district \( where i once happily flacked for the lefkowitzfinogilhooley balanced but losing ticket \) , i get reports that publicity about the austindirected nitpicking and armtwisting could tip the district to mccain even if their man loses in court and lost a few districts to the bush harassment , mccain volunteers expect to place him on the ballot in a respectable percentage of the state s districts assume mccain runs strongly where allowed to compete because new york is not a winnertakeall state , that would mean a vigorous minority would appear at the national convention who is to say that these insurgents will acquiesce in the presence of delegates unfairly chosen \? mccain has probably not thought ahead to the summer convention received wisdom is certain that all will be decided by the morning of march 8 , after the new york and california primaries but what if \? what if , for the first time in much too long , america were to be treated to a contested convention \? then the patakipicked delegates could be challenged in the rnc s contest committee when its chairman , the bush partisan mike duncan , brushes off the insurgents , the fight for fairness would move to the televised credentials committee when it refuses to budge , on to the convention floor with the rallying cry thou shalt not steal ! just dreaming as bush stonily replied yesterday to mccain s call for open competition , there s rules who gets infuriated these days by organized unfairness \? who will , with teddy r , stand at armageddon and battle for the lord \? of course , teddy lost but ike won
the anticipated throughtheroof success of the sequel to mission impossible , m i2 , should soothe any hurt feelings in the tom cruise camp over the actor s oscar loss for magnolia generally the academy swoons over beautiful stars who go into ugly mode to show they can act , but mr cruise s strutting , pelvisjutting television sex guru , out to seduce and destroy the female half of the species , was perhaps too far off the empathy curve when compared with michael caine s kindly doctor , patron of wayward women , in the cider house rules the incongruity of the dimpled megastar in vinyl vest and ponytail running a boot camp for misogynists might have delighted the critics , but mr caine was the sentimental favorite that is something mr cruise has never been and is not likely ever to be , as he tackles one steep career cliff after another , alternating between conventional action movies and decidedly riskier enterprises with such talented eccentrics as stanley kubrick and martin scorsese and paul thomas anderson yet the irony is that while playing cocky upstarts too full of themselves to join the team , in his best work as an actor mr cruise has done just that allowed costars and supporting players to shine while his own subtler contributions have gone relatively unheralded oscars have accrued , but not to him paul newman won best actor for the color of money \( 1986 \) , ditto dustin hoffman in rain man \( 1988 \) for jerry maguire \( 1996 \) , he was nominated as best actor , but it was cuba gooding jr who took home the prize , winning for best supporting actor as the flashy sports agent suddenly seized with moral fervor , mr cruise s jerry played straight man not only to renee zellweger , a freshfaced enchantress emerging into stardom , and the badattitude brother played by mr gooding , but also to a scenestealing dadseeking kid \( jonathan lipnicki \) with sprouting hair and rimless spectacles he partnered rebecca de mornay to delicious effect in risky business \( 1983 \) and made a superb supporting cast in top gun \( 1986 \) look even better and that s not to mention other major awards for which he bears some credit , like best director oscars to barry levinson for rain man and oliver stone for born on the fourth of july \( 1989 \) , the other film that won him a bestactor nomination but not an oscar after 1986 , flush with the stratospheric success of the starmaking top gun , he might have spent a decade performing solo turns in bigger and noisier action pictures days of thunder , nights of lightning instead , while doing the occasional blockbuster , he chose to pit himself against seasoned veterans in artier and more modestly financed projects it was n't just that he was eager to leap into the arena with heavyweights like mr newman and mr hoffman but that he was willing to play the jerk , to assume the odious qualities so that the nonetoostellar characters played by his partners might appear ingratiating and wise in rain man he plays bad cop to dustin hoffman s cuddly autistic savant in their oddcouple odyssey slick car salesman and the institutionalized brother he kidnaps , hoping to wrest his inheritance from him it is mr cruise s charlie babbitt who seems more likely to go over the edge insolent , greedy , rude and impatient , charlie rants like an outofcontrol child in the process he makes mr hoffman s mentally disabled mutterer seem more human than such a character , imprisoned in his armor of compulsive tics , has any right to be mr hoffman s oscarwinning performance is essentially a series of mechanical gestures , relieved by a sentimental and improbable awakening to the pleasures of the flesh , while mr cruise has to carry the emotional trajectory of the film in his anguished , pushpull relationship with the brother , mr cruise in a sense acts out the trauma of the family , the anger , the resentment , the inability to love and , as he probes , he provides the film s sense of illumination , making us feel as if we are grasping the essential mystery of raymond and their childhood together in the heartbreaking parting , when raymond , his limited capacity confirmed , takes the train back to the institution , it is charlie who bears the weight of the loss having finally made emotional contact , with his own feelings as much as with raymond s , he turns and walks away , shoulders slumped , shrunken in his clothes , as if he had suddenly lost 20 pounds yet the loosejointedness of his previously coiled body suggests a sadness offset by growth , the angry kid having become a man who accepts loss as an inevitable consequence of feeling it s a magnificent , generous performance in a movie that was voted best picture and won oscars for almost everyone except mr cruise likewise , paul newman s victory as the overthehill pool shark eddie felson in mr scorsese s color of money is as much a tribute to mr cruise s refusal to stop and ask for love in the role of mr newman s hustler protege as it is to mr newman s own undeniable charisma in the darkened dens of cheesy twobit pool halls leading up to the climactic playoffs in a cathedrallike atlantic city casino , mr cruise s vince is a whirling dervish , determined to show his stuff twirling his cue stick , dancing around the tables , alternating between a smug , whoneedsyou selfsufficiency and heartfelt apology \( i was showing off , i'm sorry \) , he resists mr newman s strategic blandishments to play possum as the two go toetotoe in an oedipal battle that only one can win
bint jbail , lebanon , may 30 the hezbollah militia , known for its rockets and bombs , is back in southern lebanon in force this time with an army of doctors , nurses , veterinarians , bulldozers , agronomists and engineers one week after the last israeli soldiers abandoned the rocky hillside villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years , the business of keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running for an estimated 75 , 000 lebanese civilians has been taken on by hezbollah in this ragged town of 13 , 000 , which served as a military headquarters for israel and its lebanese allies during their occupation of southern lebanon , hezbollah workers have set up metal dispensers filled with drinking water in the streets because a pipeline that had been bringing drinking water from israel has been closed here and throughout the south , hezbollah workers have also bulldozed debris from the streets and widened the narrow roads they have sent in insecticidespraying trucks to kill mosquitoes they are surveying the damaged and destroyed buildings to decide how much material to provide for reconstruction they drive from village to village in nine modern mobile clinics and have sent in doctors and nurses to run an additional nine stationary clinics in beit jbail , the hezbollah health organization has also taken over the regional hospital , which was abandoned during the withdrawal by the local lebanese doctors who used to be paid by israel to run it the new management quickly renamed the place , which used to be called simply beit jbail hospital , in honor of a comrade who died in a guerrilla attack on the town s israeli military guard post we 're not trying to take over , said fouad taher , who manages another hezbollahowned hospital in lebanon and was dispatched to help run the one here the government should take its normal place the only reason we took this hospital is that we knew the people really needed these services in the power vacuum left by the sudden withdrawal of israeli troops and the flight of many of their allies in the south lebanon army , hezbollah has started to operate in the south much as it does in the rest of lebanon , as a kind of parallel government offering social services , development loans and reconstruction aid although it is still considered by the united states and other nations to be a terrorist group that bombed embassies and kidnapped westerners in the 1980 s with the help of radical patrons in iran and syria , hezbollah has developed a different image in lebanon its network of services and institutions has helped it become one of the country s strongest political parties in recent years , with nine representatives now in parliament when other lebanese militias were forced to disarm in the last decade , hezbollah maintained its weapons , turning them on israelis and members of the south lebanon army hezbollah operations in the south , first as a guerrilla movement attacking israeli positions in the occupied buffer zone and now as a rapidreaction force to maintain public order , are likely to further its political ambitions for the moment , no one in the lebanese power structure appears willing or able to challenge hezbollah , or the party of god , which is lauded by every faction and religious grouping here as the liberator of national territory the government , which is still haggling with the united nations over whether the israeli withdrawal is complete , has refused to send its army to the south syria , which is the major power in lebanon and has 30 , 000 troops stationed elsewhere in the country , has done little but congratulate hezbollah , although syria has acted to try to limit the group s political power in lebanon in the last two days , thousands of lebanese , including mayors and federal government officials , have crammed into the beirut sitting room of hassan nasrallah , hezbollah s general secretary sheik nasrallah , who does not hold a government or parliamentary post , has acted deferential toward the official government , saying his organization has no intention of setting up a parallel or competing structure in the south the hezbollah directors of the bint jbail hospital , for instance , courteously showed the lebanese minister of health , karam s karam , around the facility today dr karam , who was accompanied by a french delegation that had arranged a training program for lebanese doctors who were scheduled to operate the hospital after the israeli retreat , said he is grateful that hezbollah moved quickly when the israelis withdrew , it was chaotic , dr karam said so those working in the hospital fled then thugs came in and started taking things the ones who came immediately to establish order were hezbollah they are organized and they are fast still , dr karam said , he is ready to take on the hospital so when he returned to beirut , he paid a call on sheik nasrallah , who offered reassuring words he told me , 'the minute you decide to take it over , we will give you the keys , ' dr karam recalled hezbollah banners , meanwhile , are draped across countless electric poles , buildings and even junk piles throughout the south now so are the banners of the jihadalbinaa association , hezbollah s reconstruction arm its engineers and architects are making a survey of every building in the area , its insecticide trucks are spraying , its veterinarians have examined livestock and its trucks have provided water none of those services have been provided by the lebanese government , which began only three days ago to work on a new water pipeline to villages once served by israeli water for 12 years , the jihadalbinaa has been rebuilding houses in lebanon that were destroyed by israeli bombs , as well as running two agricultural extension centers and advancing money to farmers like its parent organization , the reconstruction agency saw its work as part of the battle with israel at the time of the war against israel , it was a weapon in the struggle , said ibrahim a ismail , the general manager of jihadalbinaa we fought israel through development of lebanon mr ismail said the group s preliminary estimates show that 1 , 600 houses in the former buffer zone have been destroyed since 1978 , when christian militias allied with israel began attacking many muslim areas another 1 , 200 , he said , may have been partly destroyed after our survey of the houses , we will see if we can give help , he added , although that is not our job it s the government s job hezbollah s energetic efforts may have already paid off in terms of reducing tensions among lebanese in the south and particularly among christians , who had feared that they would be the target of the muslim militiamen in the first days after the withdrawal , hezbollah clerics visited many of the remaining priests and christian leaders and hezbollah fighters helped to stop some of the looting that took place after israel s allies fled their homes they came and talked to us and told us not to worry , said ibrahim yunis , a schoolteacher in the small christian village of dibel , near beit jbail , where twothirds of the residents fled to israel during the withdrawal it s not at all what we were led to expect , he added the whole picture has changed from black to white , from what we used to hear about what hezbollah would do to us to what we now are feeling photo a lebanese boy waved the hezbollah flag as he walked along the border with israel at fatma gate the crossing point was calm on tuesday \( reuters \) map of the middle east shows location of bint jbeil in bint jbeil , hezbollah is showing it can do more than just wage war
the selected letters of tennessee williams volume i , 19201945 edited by albert j devlin and nancy m tischler illustrated 581 pp new york new directions 37 in an essay introducing a 1979 collection of tennessee williams s bestknown plays , harold clurman highlighted williams s characteristic mixture of realism and poetry , asserting that the terror he experiences at what he senses within himself and sees in our american circumstances produces the need to exorcise it through his poetic vision this constitutes the tension that is at the core of his creation as director of the group theater four decades earlier , clurman had been one of three judges to award williams a special commendation \( and 100 \) to playwrights under 25 , a prize that arrived at the zero hour , as williams dramatized it in a thankyou note to the judges dated march 21 , 1939 he had been working on a pigeon ranch and only that day had started working as a shoe clerk a half block away from mgm studios and he was actually not quite 28 when he received the telegram announcing his prize thomas lanier williams iii had shaved three years off his age and renamed himself tennessee when he submitted the three oneact plays that were later published as american blues clurman was right about the duality that animates williams s work the playwright s own sense of himself , as revealed in these selected letters , foreshadows clurman s conclusion and confirms what anyone who has listened to his characters already knows williams was a poet who found his greatest inspiration in writing for the theater his most successful plays are triumphant dramatic structures built upon a precarious fault line between poetry and prose \( in 1933 , anticipating one of the most famous exit lines in american drama , williams wrote to harriet monroe , editor of poetry , will you do a total stranger the kindness of reading his verse \? \) as a poet first and later as a shortstory writer , williams saw himself , he wrote to the publishers of story in 1936 , as an experimentalist at a time when the magazine buying public is not interested the result , he said , is that most of the literary experimentation is now being done by incompetent young nobodies like myself who have absolutely nothing to lose , no money , no reputation , no public by writing any way they damned please ! that was the same year he turned to the theater , but he never swerved from this quasi manifesto to the end of his life he wrote just what he wanted the commercial failure of his plays after the night of the iguana \( 1961 \) , all of them as experimental in their way as his earliest stories , was anticipated in the very genesis of his career the selected letters of tennessee williams , as edited by albert j devlin and nancy m tischler , contains 330 letters , most previously unpublished , though lyle leverich s 1995 biography , tom the unknown tennessee williams , relied heavily on the same material \( like tom , this volume ends in 1945 , following the broadway success of the glass menagerie a second volume will cover 1945 to 1983 , the year of williams s death \) kinetic energy suffuses the best of these letters , and their impact is cumulative , the reader s pleasure amplified by awareness of the theatrical glory that will come by the book s end , shadowed by the dissolution that will follow it is sad to read , on page 14 , of tom s first taste of alcohol on a trip to europe , when he was 17 grandfather , himself , keeps his tongue pretty slick with manhattin coctails and ryeginger ales i have tried them all but prefer none to plain gingerale and coca cola , he wrote his mother in 1928 fifteen years later in hollywood , he meets christopher isherwood , who warns him that i must not take to drink , as most hollywood writers do i am not going to but he did , and a number of letters show his developing taste for alcohol and pills , which would rise to legendary proportions some of the letters are brilliant in particular , those to audrey wood , who became his agent after the group theater prize , give a vibrant sense of the maturing artist the letters to joe hazan , a dancer he met in provincetown , mass , in 1940 and who was apparently his first gay friend , and to paul bigelow , another close friend , are heartbreakingly honest they reveal the dichotomies of his personality in potent style and show how profoundly he was transformed by coming out and by finding first love unfortunately , his letters to his friend donald windham , which reveal this part of his life in greater detail , were published separately in 1977 and are not included here nevertheless , it is unalloyed pleasure to read the letters collected here , if only because scattered like diamonds throughout them are williams s insights into his own work as you have observed by now , he wrote to wood in 1939 , i have only one major theme for all my work which is the destructive impact of society on the sensitive , nonconformist individual in another letter to wood , describing two characters in a oneact play he has in mind , he writes , they live in the glorious expectations of the past , a stunning foreshadowing of the people who would populate his plays and fiction for the next four decades yet it often feels like labor to read this volume , for there is much that williams hides from his correspondents and much that becomes necessary for the editors to explain in lengthy notes , frequently citing his journals , forthcoming from yale university press in 2002 \( on the evidence of the brief quotations here , the journals will make a revelatory volume , and a necessary companion to the letters \) absent in williams s correspondence , for example , is any mention of the mental decline of his beloved sister rose , or of his own blue devils , as he called his recurrent depressions the same is true of his emerging awareness of his homosexuality the editors acknowledge his strategic allusions to girlfriends in letters home , and then quote to telling effect his first recorded homosexual encounter as vividly described in his journal the letters and commentary become alternating , almost competing , narratives , an effect compounded by the editors' decision to feature extensive notes following virtually every letter the attention to detail is impressive , but one consequence is that the emotional and psychological realities of williams s life seem often to lie in the interstices of the editorial commentary it s almost as if williams were living parallel lives rather than the single , rounded one the editors had perhaps hoped to convey williams s earliest professional experience as a writer was a frustrating year at the university of missouri school of journalism by the time he arrived in new york in 1940 , he had long ago discovered that the type of writing he was best fitted for was playwriting but the poetry and realism that harold clurman perceived were both there from the beginning , and williams s skill as an observer , deployed in witness to his own life , enlivens much of the best writing in selected letters photo a publicity photo of tennessee williams for battle of angels , 1940 \( new york public library from the selected letters of tennessee williams \) richard anderson
mexico city , july 5 minutes after mexicans learned they had elected vicente fox quesada as their president , they watched him glare into the cameras in his first nationally broadcast interview and issue a sober warning to drug traffickers to the criminals , those who commit violence and live outside the law , they should know the one thing we do n't want in mexico is criminality , violence , drug trafficking , organized crime , mr fox said sunday evening after mexico s presidential balloting to them i say , this is the last call in the days since , mr fox has vowed that fighting organized crime will be one of his highest priorities , and he has outlined plans to overhaul mexico s federal law enforcement institutions his proposals would require several constitutional amendments , and , experts said today , they suggest that he intends to bring the power of the presidency to bear in the fight against crime more than his recent predecessors mr fox has pledged to tear down much of the tottering edifice of corrupt police forces and special prosecutors' offices that constitute mexico s federal law enforcement system command of various parts of this bureaucracy is splintered among the attorney general , the interior ministry and the armed forces the presidentelect is not the first recent mexican leader to announce grand plans for ending corruption but none of the others have offered plans quite this ambitious , the experts said fox s plans have to be sweeping because the process of rot and decomposition has advanced so far , said ernesto lopez portillo , a consultant to the mexican senate who coauthored a 1994 study of mexico s criminal justice system historians say the corruption of the police and prosecutors traces back at least to the 19th century but in recent decades , graft has worsened greatly as control over the police has been shifted , from scandal to scandal , between the interior ministry and the attorney general s office under mr fox s proposals , the attorney general , who commands the federal police and oversees prosecutors , would be eliminated completely , and the interior minister would be stripped of police functions , the experts said control of the federal police would pass to a new cabinetlevel department of public security , and the work of thousands of federal prosecutors would be administered by a new , asyetunnamed agency the changes are aimed at reducing the police corruption that grew dangerously in the 1970 s , when mexico faced several small guerrilla insurgencies successive presidents gave the federal police , especially an elite corps known as the federal security directorate , license to wipe out the subversives using whatever means necessary by the early 1980 s , the guerrillas had been suppressed but the security directorate , mexico s political police , had acquired an array of extralegal skills they began to use in the service of drug traffickers after agents of the security directorate , which was controlled by the interior ministry , were discovered to be involved in the 1985 murder of an american drug agent , that agency was abolished president carlos salinas de gortari opened his presidency in 1989 with two spectacular police operations , which brought the arrest of a top trafficker and a corrupt oil union leader but the drug mafias nonetheless proliferated the narcotics corruption continued under president ernesto zedillo various antidrug agencies working for the attorney general s office have been abolished or restructured , and corrupted again in a cycle repeated several times during his tenure if the governing party has had little success in fighting organized crime , mr fox s national action party has done no better through much of the last decade , national action governors controlled the states of baja california and chihuahua , and the narcotics violence only increased in both states , which are major staging areas for smugglers moving drugs across the border mr fox himself has little direct experience in combating organized crime because guanajuato , the state he governed , lies outside the major drug corridors mr fox s proposal for a new department of public security would lodge mexico s federal police in a new agency , independent of both the attorney general s office and the interior ministry the aim is to create a wellpaid , modern and apolitical police force the creation of a new agency to oversee the work of thousands of federal prosecutors would strip away the other half of the attorney general s duties the new agency would seek to improve prosecutors' abilities to gather evidence currently , more emphasis is often placed on gathering intelligence on traffickers than on assembling courtworthy cases , aides to mr fox said mr fox s proposals will require the backing of large majorities in both houses of congress in order to enact several constitutional amendments after he takes office dec 1  clashes over balloting mexico city , july 5 \( by the new york times \) as the official count of sunday s balloting drew to a close today , protests and violent clashes over elections results erupted in at least eight workingclass suburbs and country towns around the capital in chimalhuacan , a rough neighborhood on the eastern edge of the metropolis , at least 13 people were injured when followers of the leftist party of the democratic revolution , claiming fraud , blocked a victory march by the institutional revolutionary party , or pri , which won the local mayor s post in ixtlahuaca , about 80 miles west of mexico city , hundreds of disgruntled followers of mr fox broke into the elections offices where the count for mayor was under way they dragged out the main elections official by his hair , burned ballot boxes and threw rocks at police in ecatepec , a huge suburb , pri supporters protested in front of the local elections office until officials agreed to a recount photo vicente fox has outlined

san francisco , june 30 the oracle corporation , the world s secondlargest software publisher , said tonight that raymond lane , its president and chief operating officer , had abruptly resigned mr lane , 53 , had been at oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996 though he was the secondranking executive in one of silicon valley s most powerful companies , he has always been overshadowed by oracle s flamboyant chief executive and cofounder , lawrence j ellison mr lane s departure came just days after the company admitted that it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival , the microsoft corporation , in an effort to prove that microsoft was secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the federal antitrust lawsuit against it the spying operation led to several exposes based on documents that were supplied to reporters at the new york times , the wall street journal and the washington post in a short statement announcing mr lane s departure , oracle gave no indication why mr lane had chosen to resign mr lane made no public statement today and could not be reached tonight mr lane will continue to serve on oracle s board of directors , the company said i am grateful to ray for all of his efforts , mr ellison said in a statement he will be missed we wish him nothing but the best an oracle spokeswoman , jennifer glass , declined to comment on why mr lane was leaving his post but she said his departure was not due to the microsoft controversy it is absolutely unrelated , she said , to the events that exploded this week when oracle executives admitted the company had hired the washington detective firm of investigative group international in an effort to link microsoft to public relations efforts in its behalf during the trial mr lane s departure has been rumored for months tonight , several people familiar with the company s internal strategy said that mr lane s role has decreased in the past year and that mr ellison has increasingly guided the company in a direction different from the one advocated by mr lane

dale f morrison , chief executive and president of the campbell soup company , who had been in the job less than three years and was unable to expand the canned soup business , stepped down yesterday the move raised speculation that the iconic redandwhite brand immortalized by andy warhol could be for sale the company made the announcement after the stock market closed but for months , investors have been punishing the stock , pushing it down to 296875 yesterday , from a high of 47 in november quarter after quarter , campbell has failed to meet its earnings targets , despite promises that the company had gotten a grip on its problems david w johnson , the chief executive and president from 1990 to 1997 who retired last year , will take over while the board forms a committee to search for a new chief executive , the company said philip e lippincott will remain as chairman with david johnson coming back , perhaps we are one step closer to a sale , said jeffrey kanter , an analyst for prudential securities he is not coming back to launch a new soup initiative campbell s chief problem has been its reliance on sales of condensed soup , which account for half of its profits condensed soup has fallen out of favor with many consumers , partly because of lifestyles that demand food that can be more easily eaten on the go mr morrison issued lapel pins to employees at the company s camden , nj , headquarters after taking over the pins were in the shape of a redandwhite soup can , and read growth where chicken noodle or tomato might have been campbell has put money into advertising campaigns , licensing tieins with children s programs like blue s clues , and new products , like a pourable tomato soup that could be heated in a microwave oven it also shed some of its underperforming businesses , including swanson tv dinners , by spinning off a separate , publicly traded company called vlasic foods international , and issued morecontemporary recipes that called for a can or two of its soup as an ingredient none of this seemed to work mr morrison , who got the top job by leading the company s pepperidge farm division to strong earnings during the early 1990 s , stumbled against the demands of wall street for better earnings and volume growth they are saying that he resigned , but i am sure that he did not resign voluntarily , said nomi ghez , an analyst for goldman , sachs who has been a critic of the company she issued a warning to investors on tuesday , saying she did not think the company would meet its latest earnings forecast this year was supposed to be the recovery but i lost faith in the recovery materializing the main problem here is soup consumption , she said they say they have a new innovation in the condensed soup area , but they did not say what it was the innovation is probably not enough to pull campbell out of its slump , she added
washington , sept 20 a principal author of gov george w bush s medicare plan , dr gail r wilensky , serves on the boards of eight health care companies whose fortunes could be affected by the bush proposal dr wilensky , a former administrator of the government office that runs medicare and the current chairwoman of the panel that advises congress on medicare policy , holds stock and stock options in the companies worth 4 million to 5 million today , according to company documents and dr wilensky s own estimates she said her relationships with the health care concerns were a matter of public record and denied that there was any conflict between her service on the corporate boards and her role as a health policy adviser to governor bush i behave in an open and public manner and do n't try to hide what i am doing , dr wilensky said in an interview i might be opinionated , i might be wrong , but i'm not carrying anybody else s water she said she has recused herself from decisions of the medicare payment advisory commission , the congressional policy panel , while she serves as a health adviser to governor bush to avoid the appearance of a conflict and she asserted that there was no way to calculate the direct or indirect financial effect of the health plans of mr bush or vice president al gore on individual companies nor does her service on those boards in any way affect the public policy positions she advocates , she said but public citizen , a research group founded by ralph nader , charged that dr wilensky represented drug and managedcare interests directly affected by mr bush s plan and called her financial relationship to numerous health care concerns wholly inappropriate frank clemente , director of public citizen s congress watch , said that dr wilensky advocated a health care proposal that favored providers over consumers and he contended that she stood to profit personally if the bush plan were enacted here is a central health care adviser to bush who is a major representative of pharmaceutical and insurance interests , which is why the bush prescription drug program is so favored by the industry and so opposed by consumers , mr clemente said it is just wholly inappropriate and a direct conflict of interest mr bush s health care proposal leaves much medical decisionmaking to private industry , including insurers and health maintenance organizations the government would still pay most costs and would supervise insurers , approving or disapproving all plans dr wilensky wrote much of the plan and explained it to reporters when it was released the proposal is consistent with dr wilensky s longstanding views on the most efficient means of delivering medical services to consumers public citizen is planning to release a report this week detailing dr wilensky s holdings in health care companies and accusing her of designing a health plan that could enrich her the report , which the group made available to the new york times , contends that her financial stake in the medical industry is more troubling than the halliburton company stock options of dick cheney , mr bush s running mate mr cheney might shape energy policy some time in the future in a bush administration , the report states , while dr wilensky is already drafting proposals for the campaign mr cheney said this month that if elected he would forfeit stock options worth about 35 million in halliburton , the energy services company that he left to run for office the bush campaign reacted angrily to public citizen s charges and defended dr wilensky this is a ridiculous assertion by a leftleaning group which supports more government control over health care , said dan bartlett , a spokesman for mr bush democrats and republicans in congress believe she has high integrity and trust her to advise them on health care policy and we believe she is an added asset to our campaign , mr bartlett said the policy that governor bush implements or promotes will be based on what s best for america and will be based on consultation from a wide range of advisers from a wide range of backgrounds vice president gore s health policy advisers are chiefly fulltime democratic campaign aides or government officials the group includes elaine kamarck , mr gore s top domestic policy adviser sarah bianchi , a gore campaign health policy specialist donna e shalala , the secretary of health and human services chris jennings , the white house s senior health affairs adviser and dr david a kessler , the dean of the yale university medical school none appear to hold any outside employment or corporate directorships , according to the gore campaign and public records dr wilensky , 57 , who holds a doctorate in economics , is the john m olin senior fellow at project hope , an international health foundation , her only fulltime position she is taking leave and vacation time from project hope to advise the bush campaign , she said she served in the white house under president bush in 1992 as deputy assistant for policy development , working on health care and welfare issues dr wilensky s largest single holding is in the united healthcare corporation , one of the nation s leading managedcare companies dr wilensky has a total of 70 , 750 shares and stock options in united , which closed at 9231 a share today she exercised her option to acquire 16 , 000 of the shares at 4950 a share in may , yielding a paper profit of nearly 700 , 000 the face value of all securities of companies she serves as a director is more than 12 million , corporate filings show but dr wilensky said that because many of her holdings were in stock options granted her as compensation for her board service and many had not yet vested their actual value was less than 5 million today company disclosure documents generally do not reveal the price at which the options were granted so it is impossible to calculate precisely the value of dr wilensky s holdings she said she has disclosed all of her directorships and outside interests under congressional ethics rules however , she added , i do n't feel i have an obligation to disclose asset accumulation as a result of her board service , dr wilensky holds thousands of shares and options in gentiva health services , syncor , advanced tissue sciences , shared medical systems , st jude medical care , quest diagnostics and manor care the companies provide a variety of medical services from human tissue replacements to nursing care to data management spokesmen for several of the companies said that they took no position on the bush or the gore health care proposals dr wilensky said that the drug industry has the most to gain or lose from the presidential candidates' competing health plans the industry s trade association , the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association , has been critical of the gore plan because , the group contends , it will lead to government price controls the industry has been more sympathetic to the bush proposal because it leaves drug purchasing for medicare largely in the private sector dr wilensky said that she is not a director of any drug company or member of the industry s trade association photo dr gail r wilensky , an author of the bush medicare plan , is on the boards of companies the plan could affect \(

east rutherford , nj , dec 10 if the nets had captured lightning in a bottle on friday night by upsetting the phoenix suns and snapping a ninegame losing streak with unrelenting aggressiveness and without stephon marbury , then tonight they seemed to toss that bottle out to sea the nets had none of the defensive electricity they displayed friday , none of the fedup fight in them instead , they came out against dallas surprisingly muted , and were immediately stunned by the mavericks' agile 6foot11inch wonder from germany , dirk nowitzki it was as if the nets' dramatic victory two days ago had been enough to assuage their bruised egos and compensate for bruised limbs allowing nowitzki to score a gamehigh 31 points , the nets stumbled to their worst loss of the season , a 9973 blowout before a crowd of 10 , 654 in continental arena in losing their 10th in 11 games , they sent out a familiar message without marbury , their star point guard and leading scorer , who missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle , the nets' ship was listing severely yeah , i'm pretty desperate right now to have him back , said nets coach byron scott , who continued to be cautious in keeping marbury out i'm still not going to force or ask steph to play when i know he s hurt the nets \( 714 \) play marbury s former team , the minnesota timberwolves , on tuesday , and marbury said his ankle would be close to 90 percent healthy by then tonight , scott overruled his appeal to play in a pregame meeting , but afterward marbury said firmly , his eyes gleaming , i'm going to play tuesday his teammates lacked that kind of fire and resolution tonight scott said one thing i told the guys , 'you ca n't live on your laurels of the last game and think everything s ok' we had a ninegame losing streak and broke that and guys took that deep breath we took a couple of steps back tonight while the nets believed in their talent without marbury on friday , that confidence collapsed tonight , along with their defense we got a little complacent after getting the win over phoenix , forward aaron williams said williams , the workhorse who scored 23 points on friday , fouled out with 9 minutes 15 seconds remaining he scored just 4 points , and his disappearance was indicative of how his team played we thought we could just show up and the game would go like it would against phoenix , he said you have to come play hard for 48 minutes every night i know i played a bad game williams was primarily responsible for guarding nowitzki , although his teammates were helpless as well nowitzki , in his third year in the league , ran the floor like a guard , hit four 3pointers one more than the nets tonight and scored 18 points in the first half small forward michael finley added 21 points the rookie kenyon martin led the nets with 18 points , and point guard sherman douglas added 13 , with 7 assists after shooting an encouraging 41 percent in friday s victory , the nets fell to 329 percent , their secondworst percentage of the season the nets' defense allowed dallas \( 148 \) to shoot 529 percent it was a dismal effort in a game in which the nets trailed by double digits for virtually the entire second half dallas led by 5143 at the half , on the strength of a latefirstquarter run and its quick penetrateandkick offense with 3 43 left in the first quarter , lucious harris tied it at 1717 for the nets , but nowitzki scored 4 points in a 70 dallas run and the nets never seemed to recover i really do n't think some of our guys were ready for the type of game these guys possess , scott said , adding of nowitzki , our guys are not used to guarding someone as mobile as he is or as good as he is the mavericks extended their 8point halftime lead to as many as 19 in the third quarter , and the nets made just 3 of 19 shots in the fourth quarter they came out and got a 15point lead and boom , we got our heads down , douglas said by that point , they had allowed dallas open shots all night , playing with little of their opponent s energy marbury is usually the one who instills that in his team i think i'm ready , marbury said i 've got to the point where i'm comfortable i know it is going to hurt but by practicing and playing , it s going to make my ankle stronger as well as his team rebounds shooting guard kendall gill also sat out sunday s game , his third straight , and he will not return until saturday he is still receiving treatment for tendinitis in his right knee dallas coach don nelson , who was recently found to have prostate cancer , left the team sunday morning and went to salt lake city to determine treatment his assistant del harris is the interim coach hopefully things will work out and he 'll be back in the saddle again soon , harris said i did n't come here to be the head coach depending on the scheduling of nelson s treatment , he could join the team on its sixgame road trip before missing an indefinite amount of time photo mavericks' shawn bradley picking up one of his three blocks against the nets , this one on johnny newman \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
following are excerpts from a transcript of gov george w bush s remarks yesterday in washington on national security , and the questionandanswer session that followed and included a brief remark by gen colin l powell , as recorded by the new york times opening remarks today , i am here with some of our nation s leading statesmen and defense experts and there is broad agreement that our nation needs a new approach to nuclear security that matches a new era when it comes to nuclear weapons , the world has changed faster than us policy the emerging security threats to the united states , its friends and allies and even to russia now come from rogue states , terrorist groups and other adversaries seeking weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them threats also come from insecure nuclear stockpiles and the proliferation of dangerous technologies russia itself is no longer our enemy the coldwar logic that led to creation of massive stockpiles on both sides is now outdated our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror while deterrence remains the first line of defense against nuclear attack , the standoff of the cold war was born of a different time that was a time when our arsenal also served to check the conventional superiority of the warsaw pact then the soviet union s power reached deep into the heart of europe to berlin and warsaw , budapest and prague today these are the capitals of nato countries yet almost a decade after the end of the cold war , our nuclear policy still resides in that already distant past the clintongore administration has had over seven years to bring the us force posture into the postcoldwar world instead , they remained locked in a coldwar mentality it is time to leave the cold war behind and defend against the new threats of the 21st century america must build effective missile defenses based on the best available options at the earliest possible date our missile defense must be designed to protect all 50 states and our friends and allies and deployed forces overseas from missile attacks by rogue nations or accidental launches the clinton administration at first denied the need for a national missile defense system then it delayed now the approach it proposes is flawed , a system initially based on a single site , when experts say that more is needed a missile defense system should not only defend our country it should defend our allies , with whom i will consult as we develop our plans and any change in the abm treaty must allow the technologies and experiments required to deploy adequate missile defenses the administration is driving toward a hasty decision on a political timetable no decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the hands of the next president and prevents america from defending itself yet there are positive , practical ways to demonstrate to russia that we are no longer enemies russia , our allies in the world need to understand our intentions america s development of missile defenses is a search for security , not a search for advantage america should rethink the requirements for nuclear deterrence in a new security environment the premises of coldwar nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size of our arsenal as president , i will ask the secretary of defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture and determine how best to meet our security needs while the exact number of weapons can come only from such an assessment , i will pursue the lowest possible number consistent with our national security it should be possible to reduce the number of american nuclear weapons significantly further than what has been already agreed to under start ii without compromising our security in any way we should not keep weapons that our military planners do not need these unneeded weapons are the expensive relics of dead conflicts , and they do nothing to make us more secure in addition , the united states should remove as many weapons as possible from highalert , hairtrigger status another unnecessary vestige of coldwar confrontation , preparation for quick launch within minutes after warning of an attack was the rule during the era of superpower rivalry but today for two nations at peace , keeping so many weapons on high alert may create unacceptable risks of accidental or unauthorized launch so as president i will ask for an assessment of what we can safely do to lower the alert status of our forces these changes to our forces should not require years and years of detailed arms control negotiations there is a precedent that proves the power of leadership in 1991 , the united states invited the soviet union to join it in removing tactical nuclear weapons from the arsenal huge reductions were achieved in a matter of months , making the world much safer more quickly similarly , in the area of strategic nuclear weapons , we should invite the russian government to accept the new vision that i have outlined and act on it
i was excited , but also a little bit skeptical , when i heard that rhino records had released a boxed set of the complete sessions from the stooges' 1970 album fun house the original is one of my favorites and a pop music landmark in its own right \( though i may be in the minority in that view \) , but the reissue project seemed somewhat dubious six cd s of outtakes \( plus another disc with two songs \) from one of the most singlemindedly aggressive rock albums ever made \? as curious as i was to hear the set , i wondered if i could get through the whole thing indeed , rhino s release seems like the answer to a dare called 1970 the complete fun house sessions , it documents the recording of the second of three albums by the stooges , the band that brought iggy pop to fame in the pop world , only the beach boys \( the complete pet sounds sessions \) and the beatles \( the anthology series \) have been able to put out sets comparable to this one the original fun house album has sold only about 89 , 000 copies since its release , which suggests that the appeal of such an exhaustive set would be severely limited knowing this , rhino is offering 1970 in an edition of 3 , 000 through the company s internetonly branch , rhino handmade , available at www rhinohandmade com the set s spare packaging gives all the essential data fun house was recorded live on 12 reels of 3m scotch brand audio tape over the course of about eight days in a los angeles studio in may 1970 the sessions were recorded by don gallucci , then an elektra staff producer , whose resume carried one factoid that must have been irresistible to the band as a teenager , he had played keyboards on the kingsmen s classic version of louie louie yet 1970 is sometimes baffling it offers no real revelations about the band s creative process if you 've heard the original album , you probably know all you need to know about the sessions already nothing s been added or changed there s no lost harpsichord arrangement of dirt , no a cappella breakdown in down on the street the set is simply a record of a rock band albeit an extremely proficient rock band pounding out take after take of the same few songs there are 28 takes of loose alone , none of them offering any insight into the writing or shaping of the music beyond a few slight changes in tempo even the tracks labeled studio dialogue are not illuminating most of the words spoken fall into the let s try that one again or what s that noise \? category one of the few surprises is the vocal prowess of iggy pop , who is usually portrayed throughout this period as drugaddled , too wild to be contained by anyone , including himself but during the sessions his voice is the strongest instrument , a constant vehicle of rage and lust he sounds like a hyperstimulated jim morrison who has given up on poetry , expressing himself instead through grunts , howls and stock sexual comeons he is pure sonic testosterone , and while his band might miss a note now and then , iggy s vocal parts are uniformly excellent and despite the repetition and the exasperation i felt listening to 1970 , it contains its share of miraculous moments this is hardly surprising , since fun house is something of a miraculous oddity in rock history the album s poor sales prompted elektra to drop the stooges shortly after its release the band is better known for its subsequent album , raw power , issued on columbia in 1973 , which became a canonical album in 70 s punk raw power features a vastly differentsounding band , sloppy and unfocused but fun house had an influence that crept into underground rock in the 80 s and 90 s , in the heavybutnotexactlymetal sound of fugazi , the jesus lizard and other bands what is most peculiar about fun house is its strange hybridization of punk rock and jazz , a kind of fusion that never quite caught on at the time , iggy pop and ron asheton , the stooges' guitarist , were listening to john coltrane , archie shepp and others and wanted to incorporate the kind of passion they found in jazz into their own music the result made abundantly clear in 1970 is endless searching for an abrasive zest that went beyond mere garage rock rough rock 'n' roll is the foundation of the music , but in the stooges' hands the form is stretched beyond its limits , and every element of the music goes through a painful , but liberating , transformation quick romps become extended jams , iggy s sexual grunts become existential cries , and the function of the guitar solo is reconfigured by mr asheton as he duels in wailing counterpoint with steven mackay s saxophone the scale and scope of 1970 make it unusual in rock , but such extensive archival treatments are fairly common in jazz , where the fans are insatiable and the vaults are immense columbia legacy is in the midst of a ninepart miles davis project that will collect unreleased material from every phase of the 30 years that davis recorded for the label four sets , including the complete bitches brew sessions , have already been issued , with two to come later this year and three still in the planning stages this kind of exhaustive treatment of an artist s work makes more sense in jazz , in which musicians improvise over a skeletal framework , painting emotional colors over a basic outline each run through a tune can be fresh and revealing in pop , on the other hand , studio sessions are often just a means to getting a song right to find its essence and eliminate flaws outtakes are mistakes , throwaways , imperfections the stooges' stabs at a jazzinfluenced rock are what make the music on 1970 consistently interesting the momentum is powerful , and there are almost no bad takes here , false starts aside even on the 28 takes of loose a song that has just five chords the musicians push forward , reaching for something they finally found it on take 28 , the cut used on the album the original album s defining moment came at the very end , with la blues , a squealing , rhythmless meltdown that sounds like free jazz it was as if the band finally found what it had been looking for pure noise 1970 ends the same way , with musical squalor expressing the intense , undiluted frustration the band had been chasing after for two weeks la blues , the final track recorded during the session it was called freak then lasted 17 minutes 24 seconds on its first take a second was made and cut off at five minutes for the album no more takes were needed photo the stooges at the elektra records studio in 1970 clockwise from upper left dave alexander , scott asheton , ron asheton and iggy pop \( courtesy ben edmonds archive \)
american rhapsody by joe eszterhas 432 pp new york alfred a knopf 2595 on april 25 , 1978 , in the camelot hotel in little rock , ark , a nursinghome supervisor named juanita broaddrick was , she says , bitten and raped by the attorney general of arkansas as joe eszterhas describes it in american rhapsody finished , he got off the bed and put his pants back on she was in shock , sobbing he went to the door he put his sunglasses on he turned back and he looked at her 'you better put some ice on that , ' he said , and was gone the alleged perp is now the president of these united states , and it s pretty clear that joe eszterhas thinks the story is true \( he says broaddrick was as believable as anyone i 'd ever seen on television , which is high praise in his idiom \) but , as he adds it did n't matter we were a tired people , tired of pornographic imagery on the evening news , tired of feeling we were mired in filth this was the worst and we did n't want to hear it it all depends , here , on what the meaning of we is for a start , who is joe eszterhas and how come he s our moral tutor in this fearandloathing tour of the clinton sex scandals \? if you 've ever left a movie theater muttering to yourself , how 'd that sucker ever get made \? then you are probably familiar with eszterhas s work \( i speak of sliver , showgirls , jade and other insults \) then again , if you 've ever left a movie theater having had a slightly better time than you expected \( music box , fist \) , then you have this harddriving screenwriter to thank admit it , though , you probably know him from basic instinct but since hollywood s studio leadership has always been a reliable part of the proclinton phalanx , you wo n't be seeing much of the starr report on the silver screen so when eszterhas found himself consumed by the need to make sense of it all , his only recourse was a factbased , ranting , rockingandrolling screed with none of the fullfrontal scissored out the we , it turns out , is the who at least in the sense of my generation eszterhas feels betrayed by clinton , precisely because he once believed in him believed in him , that is , as the dopesmoking , draftdodging adulterer of mary matalin s encapsulation the boyprince of the rolling stone set one of us , in jann wenner s own unashamed words so this is a long yell of protest from a professional hedonist who , faced with the ugliness of professionalized hedonism in the white house , does n't care for the refraction of the mirror \( i should perhaps say here that i was an oxford contemporary of clinton s did n't know him well but knew his set spoke at a vietnam moratorium where he was present have an exgirlfriend in common with him have always thought of him as a dirty campaigner , only for himself include me out of the presumptuous we \) eszterhas prepared himself for this adventure in the same way monica lewinsky did by buying and reading the memoirs of gennifer flowers here he learned much that has since been denied and , which is almost to say the same thing , much that has since proved true he also decided to annex what she says was their pet name for clinton s male member \( willard chosen because it was longer than willie \) and has cast this organ as a key protagonist , with lines and even soliloquies of its own , in his script when the full starr report was published , as many people forget , clinton s lawyers stipulated that they had no factual quarrel with any of its findings in other words they admitted that it was all true clinton s defenders , on the other hand , announced that it was all pornography it was as if , in a rape or harassment case , the defense had objected to the prosecution evidence on the grounds that it was distasteful i must say for eszterhas that he will have none of this he has been through the footnotes minutely , and even parses starr s mention of a sexual practice that is still unmentionable in a national newspaper here is the complete menu , from soup to nuts and including the postprandial cigar if it were n't for the rape scene , the bulk of this book would be about sex the calls for bill clinton s impeachment would n't cease , the rabid twin gorgons of scandal and ruin were running amok eszterhas has a heated and hyperbolic style of his own , and scarcely requires the doppelg diamond ngers he enlists , in passages of bold type , to compose some hectic fantasy sequences and internal monologues these mostly fail by trying too hard , or not hard enough the silly idea of judge starr as an onanistic puritan has been done to death by now the puerile passage in which willard reviews his past escapades does n't have the nerve to include juanita broaddrick at times eszterhas forgets where he is or what he s supposed to stand for the weathergirl banshee bernadine dohrn is at one point lovingly described as one of our brave and sexually emancipated heroines , only to be sternly reproved several chapters later as a depraved charlie manson fan
it was perhaps the most arcane statement in all the hours of acronymfilled testimony , one that came on the last day of the sixday trial but it may have been a turning point in an important battle over the limits of a new copyright law , a potential landmark case that ended its trial phase last week in manhattan and now awaits a verdict by the judge more news coverage may have been devoted to the recent legal wranglings over napster , the web service that the recording industry has accused of abetting widespread music piracy but the manhattan case , involving the copying of dvd movie disks , may have more farreaching effects both on the way cultural products are consumed and on whether computer code is deemed to be speech deserving of first amendment protection from the witness stand last tuesday , prof david s touretzky , a computer scientist at carnegiemellon university , paged through a series of exhibits that included lines of software source code in the c computer language , an englishlanguage description of the code , long strings of ones and zeros known as object code and a picture of a tshirt with the object code printed on it all of the exhibits pertained to the subject of the trial a software program that enables a user to decode the scrambling technology meant to prevent dvd movie disks from unauthorized copying professor touretzky , an expert witness for the defense , told the judge that if he saw fit to ban any one depiction of the dvdunscrambling software he would have to ban them all , because they all communicate the same thing i see this as having a chilling effect on my ability as a computer scientist to express myself , professor touretzky said he was referring to the court s preliminary injunction that barred a web site from posting the underlying , or source , code for the cracking program if the court upholds this injunction , what would happen is that certain uses of computer language my preferred means of expression would be illegal until that moment in the trial , united states district judge lewis a kaplan had appeared to have little doubt about the copyright law s constitutionality in ordering the injunction , he had noted that the first amendment does not shield copyright infringement , and that computer code was essentially no more expressive than an automobile ignition key but in light of the professor s testimony , judge kaplan said , he would reconsider his constitutional analysis it would be hard to make a case that computer code of any kind has no expressive content , the judge said which then gets you to the question of how then do you deal with it under the first amendment \? it was a significant statement to many legal experts , who see the dvd case pitting hollywood s right to retain copyright control in the digital age against the right of individuals to exercise first amendment freespeech rights in essence , the dvd case does not center on traditional copyright issues , like how much of a given work may be freely copied , or how many copies may be legally made , or even as in the napster case who can be held liable for enabling someone else to make illegal copies rather , the dvd trial is the first test of a 1998 federal law that made it a crime to manufacture or offer to the public a way to gain unauthorized access to any copyrightprotected work that has been secured by a technology like encryption it may sound like a hairsplitting distinction , but some people in the debate see it as a fundamental change as if the law now made it illegal not only to photocopy and sell a copyrighted book , but also to simply tell someone how to open and read that book without the publisher s authorization the socalled anticircumvention provision is part of the digital millennium copyright act , congress s attempt to update copyright law at a time when digital technology has made copying words , sounds and images far easier and less expensive than ever before but critics of the law in its current form worry that it goes far beyond the specific copyright challenges of the digital age to give copyright holders broad new powers over how the public uses their material they worry that even timehonored fair use privileges like quoting from a novel in an essay of literary criticism or showing a movie snippet on a televised review could become illegal or even technically impossible since devising a way to do so would be illegal we fundamentally change the face of copyright law if we say none of the limitations and defenses to copying apply if the copyright owner was smart enough to encrypt , said mark lemley , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley who is not involved in the case can you reverseengineer software \? can you make parodies of someone s work \? can you make educational copies \? all of that may be irrelevant if the mere act of getting access to the content for these purposes turns out to be illegal in the dvd case , eight hollywood studios are suing the publisher of 2600 , a hacker magazine , for publishing computer code on his web site that enables someone to break the encryption system on dvd movie disks studio executives say they are depending on the new law to prevent the sort of mass copying of movies over the internet that is already happening with music without the guarantee of that protection , a warner brothers executive testified in court , the industry would never have begun releasing movies in digital format
the man who spends more money on players than anyone in baseball history has a quirky economic personality george steinbrenner finances the first payroll that soars beyond 100 million , but he holds the line at giving mike mussina 15 million a year , approving 1475 million instead he outspends every other team taking risks in signing cuban defectors and other latin players , but he does n't sign derek jeter to a multiyear contract because he is waiting for some other team to establish a new salary plateau but most inexplicable of all , for years , has been the way steinbrenner has squandered money , lots of money , by refusing to sign his good young players to multiyear contracts taking note of the yankees' 113 million payroll this year , an agent said this same team could be an 80 or 85 milliondollar payroll the yankees would be in the top 10 , but they would n't be no 1 and getting slammed all the time if steinbrenner had adopted the successful practice of the cleveland indians , who signed many young prospects to longterm deals , the agent suggested , players like jeter , bernie williams , andy pettitte , mariano rivera and jorge posada could have been signed early at a tremendous savings they could have been locked up well under market value , he said the core of the team could have been signed commissioner bud selig , who has to deal with the payroll disparity the yankees help create , said he found the theory interesting but added , it s also highly speculative in the case of some of the young players the yankees signed pettitte to a threeyear contract last winter , but he was already only a year away from free agency they offered rivera a fouryear , 36 million contract , but he was going into his sixth season \( they recently offered him 27 million for three years \) they came close to signing jeter to a sevenyear deal , but steinbrenner threw up the stop sign before the money that the yankees and casey close , jeter s agent , were discussing about 1185 million could be presented as a formal offer the detroit tigers , unconcerned about creating the highestpaid player , made juan gonzalez an offer whose average annual value would have been slightly higher than jeter s , and steinbrenner wanted to wait until that deal was done so he could say he was n't establishing any standards with jeter but gonzalez never accepted the offer , and the yankees never made theirs to their shortstop now , one year later , and with jeter only a year from free agency , the cost will be greater an official estimated that the yankees would have to give jeter more than seven years , perhaps eight or nine , and a higher annual average , 185 million or more instead of a 1185 million commitment , it could be a minimum of 1665 million a contract delayed is a contract escalated two years ago the yankees signed williams , a free agent , to a sevenyear , 875 million contract if a few years earlier they had negotiated a longterm deal , instead of going year by year and fighting him in salary arbitration , they could have saved millions consider the indians' strategy with jim thome , whose career paralleled williams s through their first six years signing thome to a fouryear contract before he had played a full major league season , the indians paid him 98 million in the same fiveyear period the yankees paid williams 17 , 125 , 000 steinbrenner did not return a call seeking an explanation for his approach , but , asked once before , he said he might change his ways then , he added what happens if a pitcher you sign for 5 million tears his rotor cuff and never pitches again \? that s an awful lot of money to be gambling he also lamented the change he said had occurred in negotiations for younger players the way it was originally , the teams had the advantage in the earlier years , he said players had theirs in later years now what has happened is players and their agents are forgetting that the first years are to be for the benefit of ownership and the team then when they served some time it would be to their advantage unfortunately , they want to remember onehalf of it the whole thing has gotten askew based on their signing of mussina last week , some people have speculated that the yankees' payroll will soar again to astronomical heights next season however , the yankees will pay mussina 10 million next year , 2 million less than they paid david cone this year their biggest increases would come with the salaries of jeter and rivera , but the yankees could keep their pay at a reasonable level next year if they sign them to multiyear deals and pay out most of the money in the latter years of the contracts that is what they will do with mussina , whose sixyear contract calls for 62 percent of his salary to be paid in the final three years by that time , they will be finished paying roger clemens the 309 million in his new contract a raise for middle relievers talk of suspected collusion against free agents arose last month , but there is no evidence of it among the ranks of setup relief pitchers long one of the lowestpaid groups , the relievers have made a breakthrough this offseason
each month , at least one woman comes into katterman s sand point pharmacy in seattle to ask for a prescription drug none of the women have seen or spoken to a doctor but each says she needs the drug immediately the routine for a pharmacist there , beverly schaefer , never varies first she ushers the woman into a private cubicle then she counsels them and gives them the prescription pill the pill is an emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy if it is taken within 72 hours after intercourse , and it is part of what public health officials say is a revolution that is potentially as important if quieter as the one initiated by the recent approval of the abortioninducing pill , mifepristone , or ru486 while mifepristone offers a way to end pregnancies , the emergency contraceptive pill can prevent them the contraceptive pill s name is plan b \( as in , if plan a the usual means of preventing pregnancy fails , try plan b \) groups in several states expect to provide the pill to women who have not seen a doctor first washington has already done so and katterman s pharmacy is one of 155 pharmacies , about 13 percent of those in the state of washington , that are providing the pill under these circumstances women who want to find a pharmacy near them need only call 1 \( 888 \) not2late or visit the web site not2latecom the web site from the maker of plan b has a similarly catchy name gotoplanbcom public health groups in alaska are testing a pilot program to make emergency contraceptives available to women without requiring them to see a doctor , and groups in california and oregon will soon put into place their own pilot programs earlier this month , norway became the first country to make a similar drug , called norlevo , available over the counter , on shelves and out in the open along with headache remedies and cold medicines and on thursday , the french parliament changed its law on contraceptives to allow nurses to give norlevo to teenage girls in schools , said dr andre ulmann , whose company , hrapharma , makes norlevo not only is plan b approved in the united states as a prescription drug , but public health advocates have also gotten contraceptive pills approved in canada and some african , asian , and south american countries , including some , like mexico , brazil and venezuela , where abortion is illegal the new pill has the same ultimate effect as the old morningafter pill it uses high doses of hormones to prevent pregnancy but the morningafter pill was never an actual product doctors would mix it up themselves , ripping open packets of birth control pills and telling women to take several of them the exact dose depended on the brand of pills the regimen , while effective , often caused nausea and vomiting the new pill , in contrast , is packaged , marketed and designed specifically to prevent pregnancy it also has fewer side effects but the emergency contraception pills are not universally accepted while most public health experts and doctors say the pills are contraceptives , not abortioninducing drugs , because they work before a fertilized egg has implanted itself in the uterus , some abortion opponents disagree the national right to life committee , for example , asked to comment on the pills , sent a fax saying that as far as it is concerned , once an egg is fertilized , a human life has begun and most pharmacies in washington , including mrs schaefer s , have no signs advertising emergency contraception there could be some controversy , mrs schaefer explained but , said elise wells , a public health advocate who helped start the washington project and is now starting the one in alaska , there has been little outcry in washington from opponents there had been concern that there would be protests and pickets , but that has not happened , ms wells said public health advocates say the pill could provide enormous benefits our belief is that if emergency contraception pills really were widely used , to their maximum potential , then the number of unintended pregnancies could be cut in half , said dr james trussell , associate dean at princeton university s woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs it has a huge potential but i can guarantee you that the emphasis in that sentence is on potential , he added plan b was born out of the passion of people like dr trussell it was the deliberate conception of a consortium of public health advocates who decided that there was a crying need for the drug , located a hungarian company to make it and formed a company to market it in the united states on july 28 , 1999 , the pill was approved for sale by the food and drug administration , and on aug 23 , 1999 , the marketing company , called the women s capital corporation , filled its first order for planned parenthood of pasadena , calif at first , plan b was sold only to groups like public health clinics and planned parenthood but about two months ago the company put the pills into commercial distribution it does not yet have sales figures from pharmacies the company says that within the next year it will apply to the fda to sell plan b over the counter
washington , dec 2 the case is submitted , chief justice william h rehnquist said at the end of the argument on friday , a phrase that means the preliminaries are over and the work of producing a decision is about to begin now what \? the hippocratic injunction to first , do no harm applies to judges as well as to doctors , even though it is not engraved along with equal justice under law over the supreme court s pediment a famous 1947 case cataloged some of the countless precedents for stepping back from the precipice of constitutional decisionmaking , the most important and the most delicate of the court s functions questions of timeliness and maturity , of concreteness , definiteness , certainty and of adversity of interests affected should first be considered , the court said in that case , rescue army v municipal court of los angeles it counseled against supreme court intervention in essentially matters of state law that are still unresolved or highly ambiguous by the time they reach the court justice louis d brandeis put it more succinctly the most important thing we do is 'not doing' given the fissures on the court that were evident in argument in the florida election case , the question now appears to be whether the justices will turn to any of its avoidance doctrines as an alternative to a split decision that could make the court look like a partisan player rather than a neutral arbiter they are working through the weekend to decide the case in a matter of days while many pundits , after watching or listening to the argument , were quick to proclaim that a 5to4 decision appeared to be in the offing , more serious students of the court were not so sure it s the difference between judges and justices , dennis j hutchinson , a former law clerk to two justices who now teaches at the university of chicago , said in an interview today a judge applies the law and tries to get it right , he said a justice is always acutely conscious of the political context and consequences of what the supreme court does at moments of great national need , the court has worked hard to speak with one voice chief justice earl warren achieved unanimity against substantial odds in brown v board of education in 1954 and maintained it for all the subsequent desegregation cases the court decided during his tenure in cooper v aaron , the 1958 case that forced the integration of the little rock schools , the justices emphasized unanimity by placing all nine names on the court s opinion chief justice warren e burger signed the court s 8to0 opinion in the watergate tapes case that brought about the resignation of president richard m nixon in 1974 history has judged these decisions to be institutional successes for the court , in part because of their unanimity other crisisdriven rulings , like the 6to3 decision that invalidated president harry s truman s seizure of the steel industry in 1952 over dissenters who included two truman appointees , are not viewed so favorably by students of the court if an initial try for unanimity on the legal issues in bush v palm beach county canvassing board falls short , the court has several options that could avoid the appearance of taking sides in a dispute that has probably moved beyond the court s power to affect , in any event in fact , the very prospect that spending its capital on a decision that will make little difference to the outcome of the election might be the greatest incentive for a divided court to find a way out the quickest way out would be what the court calls a dig , or dismiss as improvidently granted , an order removing a case from the docket for a variety of reasons , none of which have to be specified once or twice a term , the justices dig a case after the argument or some other development has revealed that the case never was or is no longer what it appeared to be when the court undertook to decide it that is certainly a plausible view of the current status of the florida case in the eight days since the court granted gov george w bush s appeal from the florida supreme court , not only has he been certified the winner of florida s 25 electoral votes , but the heart of the dispute has shifted to another phase of litigation in the state courts that is proceeding this weekend even as the justices are working on this case but a simple dig , which is usually unaccompanied by an opinion , could be a bitter pill , given that the court granted the bush appeal after being vigorously advised by lawyers for vice president al gore that there was nothing in the case to justify the supreme court intervention at this point so dismissing the case would seem to call for some fuller explanation beyond an implied never mind more appealing , perhaps , would be a very short opinion , of a few paragraphs or pages , incorporating various justices' reasons for not addressing the merits of the case some justices might conclude , as justice stephen g breyer indicated at the argument , that the case has been overtaken by events others might believe , as justice sandra day o'connor suggested , that whatever statutory or constitutional issues might be presented by a dispute over the legitimacy of florida s electors , that dispute is not yet ripe for adjudication others might agree with justice ruth bader ginsburg that however problematic the florida supreme court decision might be , the court should rely on its tradition of giving state courts the benefit of the doubt all those separate reasons for not acting could be appended to a brief opinion announcing the court s disposition of the case that is sometimes the way the court acts when speed is of the essence in the pentagon papers case , decided four days after it was argued in june 1971 , a threeparagraph unsigned opinion announced the majority s view that the government could not block the papers' publication while all nine justices then added their separate opinions , six concurring and three in dissent , the court as a whole had spoken for judges , the hippocratic oath means not only do no harm to the law or to the country , but to the court itself photo as the justices of the supreme court heard arguments on friday over the florida supreme court s decision that extended the date for certifying the state s vote in the presidential election , supporters of vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas debated outside \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg 39 \)
washington loeb s delicatessen on 15th and i streets serves the best hot corned beef sandwich in town it was there i ran into lee radek , who for years has been successfully making certain that no investigation of illegal asian money poured into the clintongore campaign touches any of the higherups munching a pickle , i asked how come the current trial of maria hsia the longtime gore fundraiser charged with using buddhist nuns as conduits for 140 , 000 in illegal contributions was being held in washington , rather than near the hacienda heights , calif , temple , scene of the alleged crime we thought this would be a better venue , the chief of the coverup replied from his concealing standpoint , he s right the nation s capital is far better for acquittal or most lenient sentencing of the defendant reno justice wants none of the clintongore asian funnymoney traffickers such as john huang , pauline kanchanalak and charlie trie to face punishment that might induce them to involve any of the famous recipients of china s largess in moving the trial of hsia \( pronounced shaw \) to democratic dc , reno justice was certain it would get a clintonappointed judge that s because in all the asian connection cases here , the chief federal judge bypassed the normal random assignment procedure to direct all those cases to judge paul friedman after this liberal jurist relieved clintonites in 1998 by dismissing as alice in wonderland five of six felony counts against hsia , the court of appeals overruled him , reinstating the charges whose prosecution he so reluctantly oversees today \( feeling the heat of criticism about being the repeatedly chosen instrument of the coveruppers , friedman last week got the chief judge s egregious assignments stopped \) reno s radek not only has a demonstrably antiprosecution democratic judge but the usual 90 percent democratic dc jury hsia s lawyer reminded it this week that the defendant is a minority , supports democrats and has all her life witnesses against hsia \? not to worry john huang , having been given a walk and thus under no coercion to talk , will remember nothing about clintongore involvement two potentially incriminating buddhist temple money handlers , given immunity by justice in return for promises of testimony , have fled overseas \( it just did n't occur to evertrusting radek to pick up their passports \) the judge wo n't allow the absent witnesses' grandjury testimony to be used at the trial no wonder justice considers dc the best place to pretend to be prosecuting the clintongore milking of asian money sources only here can it safely point to maria hsia as the evil mastermind of a secret plot and portray the vice president and members of his staff who were present at the buddhist temple fundraiser as the innocent victims of her nefarious scheme this argues that the chairman of the democratic national committee , also present with his hand out , was duped as well reno justice thus dumps everybody s guilt on maria hsia s head , treating her as the dragon lady of moneylaundering all the while confident of her acquittal or \( if the jury surprises \) sure of her gentle treatment in sentencing , or \( if the judge suddenly wants to learn the truth \) relying on her presidential pardon right after election day about that awful word , truth at first gore said the fundraiser was merely community outreach months later , he amended that to knowing only it was financerelated but gore s 10year relationship with hsia was always based on her fundraising harold ickes sent him a memo that john huang was organizing the temple event to raise 250 , 000 and there stood fundraising maria in a golden robe when he walked in yet he still denies he knew he was raising asiangenerated money in a buddhist temple but gore has never denied it to the justice department that s because no prosecutor , no grand jury , no fbi agent has ever dared to ask the vice president janet reno protected him as maria hsia will protect him gore has broken no law because as we have seen all too often in the clinton administration there is no law against misleading the public
when the united states senate convenes in 2001 , a familiar face will be missing for the first time in 24 years daniel patrick moynihan , the fourtime senator from new york , is retiring , to be replaced by either hillary clinton or rick lazio mr moynihan s political career seemed to break all the rules he was a democrat in the nixon administration and leaped into the senate from the ambassadorship at the united nations , never before having held elective office but he has been unusual in another respect as well he is not only a professional politician he is also an influential scholar , a harvard social scientist with 18 books to his credit the almanac of american politics calls him the nation s best thinker among politicians since lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since jefferson so as the tributes to a long and successful political career pour in , the question arises how does mr moynihan stack up as a scholar \? what is his reputation among his academic peers \? mr moynihan s reputation at harvard was not high when he arrived there in 1966 he was viewed by many people as little more than a journalist , said phyllis keller , a former associate dean of the faculty at harvard and a coauthor , with the brandeis historian morton keller , of the forthcoming making harvard modern although he had a doctorate from tufts university , mr moynihan was not well trained in methodological techniques , and to this day he has rarely published in peerreviewed journals in a field where thorough data collection , rigorous statistical methods and careful scrutiny by one s peers are considered the hallmarks of quality , mr moynihan continues to be spoken of as a flawed social scientist , even a lightweight his writings on poverty and welfare , said frances fox piven , a professor of political science at the graduate center of the city university of new york , are shoddy he is very clever and very wordy , she argues , but his linguistic facility obscures the fact that he has not made a positive contribution to public understanding of those topics ms piven goes further mr moynihan s flaws as a scholar , in her view , result in large part from his direct involvement in government ever sensitive , she said , to the way the political winds were blowing , he tailored his analysis to the politics of the day and hence produced work that , almost by definition , could not last james q wilson , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of california , los angeles , disagrees he said that mr moynihan s best books were written after he became a senator pandemonium , his study of ethnic conflict , foreshadowed what would happen in eastern europe after the collapse of communism , mr wilson said a later book , secrecy , called attention to the problem of government obfuscation , long ignored by political scientists pat gets engaged intellectually by getting engaged with real problems , mr wilson observes that does n't happen if you sit around at the harvard faculty club and argue over parking spaces mr wilson is not impressed by the methodological rigor so often praised by academic social scientists take the 20 best books in the social sciences written in the last 50 years , he said , and hardly any got their start as articles in refereed journals mr moynihan first achieved a scholarly reputation in 1963 when he wrote beyond the melting pot with nathan glazer before ethnicity and race became major subjects of academic concern , these authors demonstrated the degree to which new york city s politics and social life resisted assimilation william julius wilson , malcolm weiner professor of social policy at the kennedy school of harvard university , considers the book a classic of all of mr moynihan s social science writings , none have proved as controversial as his report on the black family issued in march 1965 , when mr moynihan was an assistant secretary of labor in the johnson administration , the negro family the case for national action argued that the breakdown of the negro family has led to a startling increase in welfare dependency because the report urged that federal policy be directed toward strengthening the family \( implying that enhanced welfare payments were not the solution \) , it stirred anger among liberals and leftists and because mr moynihan said that measures that would work for most groups will not work here , he seemed to be saying that the problems facing the black family were more intractable than those facing any other group in the united states critics immediately denounced mr moynihan s reasoning , data and recommendations william ryan , a psychologist teaching at the harvard medical school , attacked mr moynihan s methodology in scathing tones in the nation no sophisticated social scientist , he wrote about the idea of family breakdown , would rest a broad concept on such crude and simplistic measures as outofwedlock births , for there were many forms the contemporary family could take he said that mr moynihan s methodology was filled with fantastic errors that led to stupefying statements mr moynihan had cause and effect backwards , ryan argued it was not the negro family structure that caused poverty it was poverty and racism that caused the absentfather syndrome that mr moynihan mistook for family instability
long island has become a battleground for the major phone companies , which have launched aggressive advertising campaigns to woo customers to their local , regional and longdistance services there has always been competition , but the real mass marketing did n't start until we got into long distance , said toby s frank , director of consumer competitive response for bell atlantic in december , bell atlantic became the first of the baby bells , the companies formerly grouped under the att umbrella , to win permission to offer longdistance service , after satisfying the federal communications commission that it had opened the local phone market to competitors a month before the fcc ruling , sprint opened its bid for these customers , and a month after the ruling att entered the fray the nation s other major longdistance company , mci worldcom , has been offering residential local and regional service since february 1999 it s very intense , said a spokesman for att , gary morgenstern bell atlantic is spending a ton of money on advertising and the competition is fierce we are doing very well we have taken more local customers from bell atlantic than they have taken longdistance customers from us and the value of the customers we are taking is greater than those they are taking from us dennis wax , director of regulatory affairs for bell atlantic , acknowledged that the competition has had an impact on his company statewide , we have about 12 million lines , and we have lost 2 million over the past five years , he said edward collins , a spokesman for the public service commission , which regulates phone companies , said most of that loss occurred this year in the first four months , he said , 1 , 616 , 845 customers switched from bell atlantic to other companies that compares with 321 , 280 who switched in 1998 and 946 , 000 last year mark marchand , a spokesman for bell atlantic , pointed out that during the first three months of this year , his company captured 428 , 000 longdistance customers and , he said , it is well on its way to meeting the one million mark for the year jon hargis , director of marketing for att consumer services , said the company was exceeding expectations in its goal of signing up 750 , 000 homeowners statewide for its local service by the end of the year he said that by the end of may , the company had attracted 475 , 000 customers and that most were downstate \( he did not have separate figures for the island \) a spokesman for sprint , greg embry , declined to say how many customers his company had signed up for local service there is a lot of pentup demand because people have not had a choice before , he added now when people are presented with two or three choices , it is natural for them to say they will exercise their choice and try something new mr collins said the public service commission believes that competition will provide customers with more choices in terms of service and lower rates but mr morgenstern , at att , said true competition did not really begin until just a month or two ago , after bell atlantic resolved what it said were computerrelated problems that delayed the transfer of customers to competitors bell atlantic admitted to mishandling 270 , 000 orders in new york during the first few months of the year , mr morgenstern said in march , bell atlantic entered into an agreement with the fcc in which it agreed to pay the treasury 3 million for its loss or mishandling of orders , and to pay up to 24 million more if the problem persisted in addition , the public service commission ordered it to credit 10 million to its competitors in the local phone market , and threatened to require bell atlantic to pay another 24 million in credits if the company continued to run into difficulties the commission has also been monitoring consumer complaints stemming from the local phone competition , and fined mci worldcom 3 million in april because of the higher than normal number of complaints it had received regarding the company s local service mr frank , of bell atlantic , said that what is occurring now is fullblown competition and from our perspective , that s not a bad thing , he continued it means there are more choices out there , and bell atlantic wants to make sure the consumer understands his choices mr morgenstern pointed out , however , that although the major longdistance companies are vying to provide local phone service here , there can be no price war because none of them own their own facilities they all lease bell atlantic s lines and features at wholesale prices and resell the services our offer does provide a savings but it is not dramatic , he acknowledged it s not like we can say it used to cost 40 cents and now it s a nickel you can say that for long distance but we have no control over the cost structure when we have to lease the facilities as a result , what the competitors are selling is easytounderstand pricing , package deals and in some cases discounts for customers who sign up for a package of local , regional and long distance service
many people remember reading george orwell s animal farm in high school or college , with its chilling finale in which the farm animals looked back and forth at the tyrannical pigs and the exploitative human farmers but found it impossible to say which was which that ending was altered in the 1955 animated version , which removed the humans , leaving only the nasty pigs another example of hollywood butchering great literature \? yes , but in this case the film s secret producer was the central intelligence agency the cia , it seems , was worried that the public might be too influenced by orwell s poxonboththeirhouses critique of the capitalist humans and communist pigs so after his death in 1950 , agents were dispatched \( by none other than e howard hunt , later of watergate fame \) to buy the film rights to animal farm from his widow to make its message more overtly anticommunist rewriting the end of animal farm is just one example of the often absurd lengths to which the cia went , as recounted in a new book , the cultural cold war the cia and the world of arts and letters \( the new press \) by frances stonor saunders , a british journalist published in britain last summer , the book will appear here next month much of what ms stonor saunders writes about , including the cia s covert sponsorship of the parisbased congress for cultural freedom and the british opinion magazine encounter , was exposed in the late 1960 s , generating a wave of indignation but by combing through archives and unpublished manuscripts and interviewing several of the principal actors , ms stonor saunders has uncovered many new details and gives the most comprehensive account yet of the agency s activities between 1947 and 1967 this picture of the cia s secret war of ideas has cameo appearances by scores of intellectual celebrities like the critics dwight macdonald and lionel trilling , the poets ted hughes and derek walcott and the novelists james michener and mary mccarthy , all of whom directly or indirectly benefited from the cia s largesse there are also bundles of cash that were funneled through cia fronts and several hilarious schemes that resemble a spy vs spy cartoon more than a serious defense against communism traveling first class all the way , the cia and its counterparts in other western european nations sponsored art exhibitions , intellectual conferences , concerts and magazines to press their larger antisoviet agenda ms stonor saunders provides ample evidence , for example , that the editors at encounter and other agencysponsored magazines were ordered not to publish articles directly critical of washington s foreign policy she also shows how the cia bankrolled some of the earliest exhibitions of abstract expressionist painting outside of the united states to counter the socialist realism being advanced by moscow in one memorable episode , the british foreign office subsidized the distribution of 50 , 000 copies of darkness at noon , arthur koestler s anticommunist classic but at the same time , the french communist party ordered its operatives to buy up every copy of the book koestler received a windfall in royalties courtesy of his communist adversaries as it turns out , animal farm was not the only instance of the cia s dabbling in hollywood ms stonor saunders reports that one operative who was a producer and talent agent slipped affluentlooking africanamericans into several films as extras to try to counter soviet criticism of the american race problem the agency also changed the ending of the movie version of 1984 , disregarding orwell s specific instructions that the story not be altered in the book , the protagonist , winston smith , is entirely defeated by the nightmarish totalitarian regime in the very last line , orwell writes of winston , he loved big brother in the movie , winston and his lover , julia , are gunned down after winston defiantly shouts down with big brother ! such changes came from the agency s obsession with snuffing out a notion then popular among many european intellectuals that east and west were morally equivalent but instead of illustrating the differences between the two competing systems by taking the high road , the agency justified its covert activities by referring to the unethical tactics of the soviets if the other side can use ideas that are camouflaged as being local rather than sovietsupported or stimulated , then we ought to be able to use ideas camouflaged as local ideas , tom braden , who ran the cia s covert cultural division in the early 1950 s , explained years later \( in one of the book s many amusing codas , mr braden goes on in the 1980 s to become the leftist foil to patrick buchanan on the cnn program crossfire \) the cultural cold war began in postwar europe , with the fraying of the wartime alliance between washington and moscow officials in the west believed they had to counter soviet propaganda and undermine the wide sympathy for communism in france and italy

the journey home by olaf olafsson 296 pp new york pantheon books 24 what sort of novel would you expect from a man who helped develop video games as the founder and former president and ceo of sony interactive entertainment \? a cyberthriller perhaps , fastpaced , probably full of cliches olaf olafsson , who was born in iceland and graduated from brandeis university with a degree in physics he is now vice chairman of time warner digital media is a most unlikely literary aspirant yet this former whiz kid , still in his 30 s , has now published his second fine novel in english the story gets more implausible olafsson writes in longhand in his native icelandic and translates his work into english himself both his novel absolution , which appeared in the united states in 1994 , and the new one , the journey home , were first published in iceland what is most surprising and satisfying is that both novels are soulful and thoughtful they 're eddying explorations of themes like honor and betrayal , loss and endurance , the high cost of emotional repression both are journeys into partly buried memories that prove to be riddled with psychic land mines in absolution , absolution itself is the one thing that peter peterson , who believes neither in god nor in human forgiveness , ca n't have an old , wealthy businessman close to death , he is writing his memoirs to settle his accounts with whom , we wonder at first he writes with contempt of his former wives , scheming children and business rivals he remembers his childhood in iceland and a girl who did not return his love gradually , his memories spiral down to one black episode there was a little crime he committed during the war years in germanoccupied copenhagen , where he had followed the girl , who is always a nameless you the more he justifies his act of revenge , the more hysterical his voice becomes a creature being eaten alive by resentment , peter would be at home in a dostoyevsky novel his selfdeception is so thorough as to be almost heroic in its willfulness the book is a tour de force , both brilliant and perverse olafsson makes readers dwell in the sour brain of a damaged man only the teasing clues peter drops along the way , and the clarity of language , if not thought , olafsson gives him , make it possible for us to keep sitting in an airless room with a corroded soul the journey home , which has a female narrator , is also haunted by the war years and is built on the same structure of memories spiraling back to places of insurmountable pain it is an impressively mature and wideranging book , both geographically and emotionally the heroine , and she is one , is a nervy , selfsufficient woman whose sensuous spirit has survived deep insult , betrayal and tragedy we first see disa at dawn in the english countryside , opening windows , watching the birds , patting her dog , sniffing the lingering good smells of the dinner she cooked the night before she is about to go on a journey back to her home in iceland , a trip she has postponed for many years the mood is calm , with hints of anxiety olafsson is good at delayed gratification important facts are doled out slowly , and the most important of all the reason for her journey is not revealed until the book s end this mysterygenre structure feels tricky at times , what with misleading clues and disa s ominous bad dreams , but it also makes her an interestingly unpredictable character we sense her struggle to keep her selfcontrol she is always on the verge of saying something that she ultimately does n't for 20 years she s been running a hotel in rural england with her best friend , anthony , and her cooking is praised in guides and magazines she loves her work , her dog , her greenhouse and anthony , who is gay the only thing she fears are the nightmares that throw up shards of the past but as she sets out on her journey , with a blank diary anthony has given her , she begins to write down her story each chapter visits a different period in her life , interspersed with the course of the physical journey itself when she arrives in iceland and finally tells us what she has come for , many hints and seemingly random observations make new sense , and provide a retrospective aesthetic pleasure we understand why , standing at the hotel window in reykjavik , she watches a little boy with a coat that s too big for him as he runs after his parents a scene with marilyn , a kitchen apprentice who is as eager to learn how to cook as disa is to teach her , crackles with an emotional ferocity that feels right even though we do n't understand why until later disa becomes furious when she learns marilyn is leaving to get married she is taken aback by her own rage , but explains it away and then makes an odd remark should i have congratulated her instead of trying to make her see that what she thought was love would only bring her unhappiness in the long run \? in the late 1930 s , we eventually learn , disa was cooking in a london restaurant when she fell in love with a german jew named jakob he went back to germany to get his parents out of the country none of them return from buchenwald that s not the end of misery , unfortunately disa goes back to iceland , which is now defended by the british , and takes a job as cook for a family the son , atli , a nazi sympathizer , returns from germany , full of admiration for herr himmler he fascinates disa almost as much as he repulses her what happens between them explains early scenes in the novel when disa wakes from bad dreams there are more tragedies to come in disa s life she s job , but without faith hope is the sister of selfdeception and i have learned to avoid those sisters as far as i can their smile is fawning and their manner false olafsson could have spared disa a few disasters , and he sometimes lays on the omens and symbols a bit thick there are the apples whose significance is never clear for example , and the color red , which is always a harbinger of blood and pain but he gives his protagonist and us enough sensuous pleasures to get us through the hard stuff there are the good smells , indoors and out , birds in the poplar trees , and the dishes disa prepares there is a depth to her flavors , which she achieves by adding an unexpected sweet note to the savory , like stuffing a chicken with figs , or cooking snails in honey disa herself is a memorable creation , a complex blend of contradictory notes
washington , aug 19 secretary of state madeleine k albright and george tenet , director of central intelligence , are at odds over the extent to which the united states should release documentation of its involvement with repressive latin american regimes in decades past during a visit to south america this week , dr albright pledged to push for the fullest possible declassification of files related to the coup that toppled chile s elected socialist government and the 17year military dictatorship that followed she also promised to start reviewing for release documents about argentina s disappeared and their children , victims of statesanctioned kidnappings during successive regimes between 1976 and 1983 this has been something that the president and i have not only supported but have been instrumental in making sure it happens , dr albright said in chile on thursday she added the whole enormity of the project reflects our commitment to clarify the historic record of a highly controversial period in our bilateral relations but mr tenet recently notified members of congress that he had decided to withhold an unspecified number of documents about chile on the grounds they would disclose too much about how his agency conducts its business these materials present a pattern of activity that had the effect of revealing intelligence methods that have been employed worldwide , mr tenet said in an august 11 letter to lawmakers the documents had already been cleared by the cia s own declassification experts as part of the last and largest release of interagency files related to chile , which is scheduled for september 14 president clinton last year ordered the national security agencies to retrieve and review for declassification documents that shed light on human rights abuses , terrorism and other acts of political violence in chile between 1968 and 1990 i think you 're entitled to know what happened back then , and how it happened , mr clinton said at the time , referring to covert american actions that aided the rise of gen augusto pinochet , who led the junta that overthrew chile s socialist president , salvador allende gossens the president s initiative , which began after the arrest of general pinochet in london at the request of a spanish judge , has yielded about 7 , 500 documents so far , most of them from the state department archivists who have reviewed the redacted documents say none of them reveals the cia role in destabilizing the allende government mr tenet said he would submit the withheld documents for a final interagency review , and insisted , we are in no way trying to withhold information embarrassing to the united states government but advocates of a broader declassification of documents voice concerns that mr tenet is doing just that withholding details of american complicity in the overthrow of a democratic government and , by extension , in the repressive regime that followed they accuse the cia director of flouting the spirit of mr clinton s order i think we 're witnessing an internal division within the administration , said daniel weiss , a spokesman for representative george miller , a california democrat we believe the president genuinely wants to see the full story on chile and the united states told publicly mr weiss said the cia chief apparently wants to withhold information that would speak unfavorably of the united states but that s the historical process that s the integrity we 're trying to establish , to understand fully what took place in chile the outlines of cia operations in chile have been in the public domain for a quarter century american records related to recent repression in argentina are not expected to provide as rich a historical trove that country s first military coup , in 1976 , coincided with the election of president carter , whose human rights campaign strained ties with the architects of a dirty war that eventually killed more than 15 , 000 people but the united states was well apprised of operation condor , a plan by south american regimes to arrest dissidents in one another s countries the white house declined to say whether president clinton would back up the openness of his top diplomat or ratify the caution of his spymaster david stockwell , a spokesman , said the matter is still under review we want to ensure that the american public has access to as much information as possible about human rights abuses , terrorism and other acts of political violence during and prior to the pinochet era in chile , mr stockwell said of course , he added , the president has confidence in george tenet
the apostle paul , in a letter to the corinthians , wrote , but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head perhaps none of the faithful then or since have taken that advice so literally and with such aplomb as black women going to sunday church services or , as was the case yesterday , going to the studio museum in harlem to celebrate their particularly fashionable style of worship it is doubtful that paul had in mind the fanciful feathers , the gold sequins or the napoleonicstyle headgear , church hats all , that dozens of women donned for a contest at the signing of a new book , crowns portraits of black women in church hats \( doubleday \) , the authors noted but there was consensus about this what the biblical letter inspired in certain black christian circles is nothing short of a cultural phenomenon the church hat , not to be confused with any old regular kind of hat , is big and boisterous the more eyecatching , the better bold colors \? yes shape \? does n't matter flowers , birds , pins and other ornamentation \? practically prerequisite most important , though , explained rose marie davis , whose cream and gold headdress was about six inches high , the church hat proclaims a person s joy without the wearer ever having to say a word i would n't feel properly dressed at church without my hat on , said mrs davis , 65 , who said she has not had a bare head in church since her grade school days and the hat is no mere fashion accessory , according to the authors , michael cunningham and craig marberry , who interviewed and photographed women for the book they say the custom has roots in some cultures of africa and represents a particular convergence of faith and fashion that keeps the sabbath both holy and glamorous , mr marberry wrote in the book s introduction i learned that vanity is not at the root of this tradition , mr marberry , 42 , said as he signed copies for the crowd of about 150 people it has to do with religion , and the basic belief brought over from certain african communities that the head is special because it is the seat of wisdom and the spirit the head is adorned for that reason demetria thomas , a teacher from the bronx , agreed , adding that the days of slavery probably bolstered the practice slaves were only allowed to gather for church , ms thomas said that was the only place for someone who , say , worked in the fields to feel special , to dress up we 're very strong on tradition , so i think that s why it s something that has n't left us through so many other changes ruth tudos , 80 , who owns about 200 hats , said she buys about three to match every outfit yesterday she wore a golden one that rested low across her brow other women sported fuchsia feathers , explosions of frilly lace and tulle , and rhinestonestudded berets as the judging quietly progressed \( seven people were appointed to watch out for the best hats \) , the women did not seem to be so much in competition with one another as in admiration of one another s creations traditional lace and flowers conversed approvingly with leather and leopardprint in the end , it was 82yearold eula james who stole the show in her furry , widebrimmed blue number , which was speckled with gray and white paint she could hardly contain her happiness as she accepted a bouquet of red roses and a round of applause this hat , i saw it and i just knew i wanted it , she said my friend made it for me two weeks ago attention then turned back to the book , as the women clamored around the authors to hear the stories of other women like themselves the stories that accompany the blackandwhite photos in crowns are funny and poignant they are stories of old women who remember admiring hats through the windows of stores they were not allowed to enter they are the stories of hat queens , the divas of the congregation they are the stories of fashionforward young women who want to uphold their grandmothers' traditions the women featured in the book are mostly from north carolina and were not present at the signing still , as people at the signing flipped through the book , some said they recognized their friends and family in the faces of the strangers pictured i think it has to do with the strong personalities of the hats and women who would wear them , ms thomas said dr virgie brightellington , 33 , an internist from the upper west side , was perhaps the only women in attendance who could claim to own only one hat truly a disgrace in this crowd i found this event to be really inspiring , she said i think i'm going to work on my look , and that means i 'll probably be buying a few hats photos eula james stole the show yesterday at the studio museum in harlem at a signing for crowns portraits of black women in church hats also showing off their sunday finery were brenda simmons , left , who sells hats at her harlem s heaven boutique , and ruth tudos , 80 , right , who owns about 200 hats three to match every outfit , more or less \( photographs by james estrin the new york times \)
highland park , ill , jan 16 seventeen years ago , carl berg asked the 27 students in his fifthgrade class , ages 10 and 11 , to write essays imagining their lives and jobs , and those of their classmates , in the year 2000 they also made a promise that when mr berg called at the turn of the century to take attendance , they would make every effort to avoid being marked absent by their teacher , who would be 48 now ages 27 and 28 , all but five of those graduates of sherwood elementary kept their word this weekend , reuniting in this suburb of chicago to read their essays and determine whether anyone s predictions had come true though some of the essays were remarkably prophetic , none of the students anticipated the influence that mr berg , who still arrives in his classroom at 6 am most days , would have on so many of their careers eight of the 27 all of them women have taught or are teaching in elementary or secondary schools by comparison , the proportion of teachers in the general population is fewer than 2 out of 50 and each of the eight said that emulating mr berg had weighed heavily on her decision he s definitely an inspiration , said suzanne wollack , 27 , who quit an advertising job in chicago last year to begin studying for a master s degree in education at nationallouis university in nearby evanston it s something i had always wanted to do , said ms wollack , who was mr berg s teaching assistant last fall i had just become sidetracked to be sure , there were plenty of nonteachers present when the students convened for two reunions in mr berg s class on friday , when the alumni helped the current fifth graders write essays looking ahead to the year 2020 , and on saturday night , at a smoky bar called rainbow s where mr berg said he and his colleagues had written some of their best lesson plans sitting on a bar stool , carl schwarz , 27 , told the group that he owned a construction company bearing his name and had become an architect , just as joanna arlow had written that he would ms arlow , now a law student , said she could not recall what had motivated that prophecy jeff benjamin , who could not make it because of a commitment to teach snowboarding in colorado , sent word through mr berg that he had become a speed skater one of ms wollack s predictions and had narrowly missed making the united states olympic team and lisa pinsky , 27 , disclosed that jenna messer had been correct when she predicted that ms pinsky would marry someone named john ms messer , now 27 and a fifthgrade teacher , had missed only on the last name \( and the spelling of the first \) instead of john travolta , ms pinsky married an accountant named jon ezrol ms pinsky had predicted that she would arrive at the reunion in a chauffeurdriven rollsroyce instead , she came in a black ford taurus driven by her husband indeed , sometimes the predictions that did not come true were more telling than those that did , particularly for what they showed about the perspective of a 10yearold in the early 1980 s in 1983 , linda vogel imagined that when mr berg s call came , she would be doing nothing but wait for my husband to come home in fact , she is an interior designer of restaurants and office buildings in austin , tex , who has yet to marry michelle chase made no mention of a potential job in her essay , other than being the mother of seven she said on saturday that she was running a bit behind she is due to be married in july because of her teaching career having done her student teaching three years ago at sherwood , ms chase , 27 , now teaches third , fourth and fifth graders with behavior disorders in nearby waukegan someone had predicted that jennifer spiegler would be a waitress , but she became a marketing manager in the promotions department at the new york times and in a sign of what a 10yearold imagines 48 looking like , most of the students had predicted that mr berg would arrive with a cane , false teeth and white hair in fact , he is an athletic six feet tall , with all his teeth in place and his thick hair mostly black , with flecks of gray as they walked around mr berg s class , his former students discovered that little had changed , other than his room having moved from no 18 to no 25 the box houses are still there six giant cardboard clubhouses in which the students array their desks , and which ring a common meeting area but the wall decorations are different where the favorite pinups of the class of 1983 were of brooke shields and scott baio \( remember chachi from happy days \?

the announcement came crackling over the office intercom in the din of hillary clinton s campaign headquarters the president of the united states is on line 5 for bill bill is mrs clinton s campaign manager , bill de blasio the president of the united states is , of course , married to the democratic candidate for senate in new york news of who was holding on line 5 set off a rustle of excitement in the campaign headquarters near madison square garden but it was hardly a rare occurrence president clinton has taken an intense and consuming interest in the campaign for senate in new york , friends and advisers said , interposing himself on matters ranging from farreaching strategy to custodial details that would seem to fall below the presidential pay grade in the twilight of his presidency , mr clinton has found time to offer his counsel on where mrs clinton should campaign \( upstate , his aides say \) and how heavily she should advertise on television \( too much a few months ago , not enough last month \) he has advised her on fundraising strategy \( raise more hard money \) , and how to come across at her debate tomorrow \( speak in compact sentences \) and he has offered up his very strong views on what he thinks she should be talking about on the trail \( it s the economy , mrs clinton \) when mr clinton called venus williams , the tennis star , to congratulate her for winning the united states open last month , she asked him why she felt bombarded with commercials for representative rick a lazio , and had seen none for mrs clinton an irritated mr clinton promptly called the first lady s advisers to demand why they were not buying more television time , campaign aides said no other race in the nation including the one by al gore to succeed him has commanded as much of mr clinton s attention , and drawn as much of his time and concern , the president s friends say while aides to mrs clinton say the intensity of mr clinton s involvement varies from day to day , depending on the pull of his other duties , his influence is felt as much as anyone s at her headquarters , save for that of the candidate herself there are times that mr clinton , who is feeling the discomfort of playing the spectator as he begins his exit from elected life , seems so invested in his wife s campaign that it is as if he were running against mr lazio accordingly , mr clinton has , at times , pressed mrs clinton to do things that seem more suited to his political style white house officials said mr clinton urged her aides to inject more policy minutiae into her speeches while that may work for the president , who can be arresting on the stump , mrs clinton sometimes comes off as a plodding speaker president clinton and mrs clinton both declined requests for an interview for this article mr clinton and his aides have gone to some lengths to play down what he is doing in new york , concerned partly that his involvement would suggest that mrs clinton s political skills were not up to the demands of this race i 've seen it when he was the candidate and she was the spouse , and now when she is the candidate and he is the spouse , and their roles have totally flipped , said mark penn , the longtime clinton pollster who mrs clinton installed in a senior role in her campaign at the strong urging of mr clinton but make no mistake about it she has learned about new york , she makes the decisions , and she runs the show still , reports of his intervention are plentiful for example , upon learning that mr lazio s wife , patricia , was attacking mrs clinton for attacking mr lazio on his record on health care in congress , president clinton immediately called campaign officials in new york and urged them to make a rebuttal they did mr clinton has also chastised campaign officials for cramming mrs clinton s calendar with too many events , warning that fatigue can lead to mistakes all the while sounding very much the way mrs clinton did in 1992 when he was the candidate he s actually into a spouse role 'you 're working her too hard , she really needs a day off , ' the same things that she used to say about him , said one adviser to both clintons because he is president , and is viewed by democrats and republicans as unrivaled in his political skills , mr clinton helps his wife in ways that no other spouse conceivably could , giving her an enormous advantage over mr lazio , the suffolk county republican the most public manifestation of that has been in fundraising for months , aides said , mr clinton had reassured his wife that she would have enough money to be competitive and in the face of fundraising reports that now suggest that mrs clinton has good reason to be worried , the president has gone to considerable lengths in public and private to back up his assurances mr clinton has attended two dozen fundraisers for his wife across the country this year , raising more than 5 million on wednesday night , he was the star attraction at a fundraiser for mrs clinton at the home of senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts earlier in the week , mr clinton appeared at three events in florida , leaving mrs clinton free to travel in new york while he was raising money for a campaign that he fears is underfinanced
boston if we are to believe what has been written about the camp david talks , they collapsed not because of an outdated idea of holiness , but rather an outdated idea of sovereignty what was held sacred was a principle of exclusive legal jurisdiction that not a single european state exercises today , and that neither a palestinian state nor israel would be able to exercise under any workable peace agreement prime minister ehud barak of israel and yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , have long conceded this in the way they have framed and resolved standing security issues mr barak and mr arafat came tantalizingly close to a deal in an explosive environment that could be ignited by failure with both sides saying they want more talks , and scheduling meetings , can we not hope for them to move beyond a claim of sovereignty in east jerusalem that can never be anything but quaint \? just think of bethlehem , as close to the jewish jerusalem neighborhood of talpiot as the metropolitan museum is to lincoln center in manhattan formally , the palestinian authority has full sovereignty there but during the last christmas season , festive lights stretched along the road from talpiot to bethlehem in a continuous stream , leading tourists into manger square , making it nearly impossible to determine where the border checkpoints were when i visited , twice , after dark , israeli and palestinian border guards were casual , waving cars through and giving directions in bethlehem , palestinian hoteliers and shopkeepers scrubbed buildings and streets while israeli technicians helped construct the manger square stage and satellite uplinks for a telecast from the church of the nativity none of this seemed in the slightest utopian it was natural no , necessary for the governments of jerusalem and bethlehem \( each run by ostensible hardliners \) to cooperate on tourism it was a division of labor expressing the commercial interests of hundreds of entrepreneurs , some local , some global nor was this at odds with the political background it was part of an inevitable trend the israeli army and the palestinian police have regularly consulted to keep the peace , though israelis know that if serious trouble were started by palestinian radicals , the israeli army would be in the wings , and the palestinians know that the palestine liberation organization and arab governments have made common cause with the israeli government against west bank jewish extremists the working together is just common sense , and common people know it even if cold peace is the fate of israelis and palestinians for the coming generation , cooperation of this kind will be the tip of the iceberg what jurisdictions , after all , could either side exercise without the formal cooperation of the other \? water is getting dangerously scarce if a palestinian state is formed along the expected lines , neither side will be able to pump from the west bank water table without affecting the other and many plans for bringing water from farther away envision pipelines or canals that would pass through both arab and israeli territories , requiring the same sort of cooperation competing interests in the american west had to develop after the building of hoover dam israel and a palestinian state will have to work together on roads and commercial links between the west bank and gaza , and , if the regional economy is to be efficient , on labor law and standards , monetary policy \( the israeli shekel is still the major palestinian currency \) , immigration , telecommunications policy \( bandwidth is even scarcer than water \) and more as cyrus vance pointed out after the first camp david summit in 1978 , americans believe that sovereignty derives from the consent of the governed by that standard , palestinians would have claim to formal sovereignty over their neighborhoods in jerusalem , just as jews now have it over theirs and if prime minister barak has already agreed that the haram alsharif , or temple mount , in the old city of jerusalem should be formally palestinian , why should n't the palestinian arab shops selling olivewood carvings and other souvenirs nearby \? the point is , nothing like exclusive political control of any of these territories would be sustainable or even desirable , short of mass movements of populations it is easy to see why the nuanced limitations of political sovereignty can be lost on some palestinians and israelis israelis in their 50 s remember an old city they could not enter , dangled before their eyes by the hashemite king palestinians of all ages hate israeli checkpoints and searches , which became common with the intifada but mr arafat and mr barak have reportedly agreed that the city should be free and open to citizens of both states and to all religions , so that jews would go to the western wall under a declaration of peace and arab leaders would return solemnly , triumphantly to alaqsa mosque so what exactly explains the stall \? why does east jerusalem pose a problem that bethlehem does not \? perhaps it is time for the leaders of the european community to join president clinton in helping israelis and palestinians think about the transnational institutions and global markets the two states can share to get on with their lives to help them understand that a place like quebec cannot be made to look like a place like japan only one turn of events would absolutely guarantee a divided and closed city it would come overnight not only in jerusalem , but around bethlehem too , if the current stall led to violence but that would be as unthinkable as europeans plunging into total war over the killing of an archduke by a citizen of notquitesovereign serbia drawing \( boris kulikov \)
tuxtla gutierrez , mexico , dec 8 mexico s southernmost state , chiapas , joined the country s transition to its first real democracy today when it inaugurated an opposition politician as governor , ending the institutional revolutionary party s long control over this impoverished and troubled region the new governor , pablo salazar mendiguchia , 55 , is a former senator and human rights lawyer who was elected on the same wave of change that lifted the new president , vicente fox quesada , into office a former teacher in sunday school and the father of three children , mr salazar was supported by a coalition of eight opposition parties , including the leftwing democratic revolutionary party and the conservative national action party mr fox , who was inaugurated a week ago , making him the first opposition politician in 71 years to be president , sat beaming and clapping as mr salazar delivered a revivalstyle inaugural speech the new governor promised to create a justice system that would protect people from terror and help end the layers of religious , political and ethnic conflicts that erupt in violence no more bloodshed , mr salazar said , particularly the blood of the innocent although none of its leaders were in the auditorium , mr salazar also directed part of his inaugural address to the zapatista national liberation army , a rebel group that declared war against the government nearly seven years ago to demand equality and justice for the state s large indian population after years of stalemate with violence between zapatista supporters and rightwing paramilitary groups , the rebels announced this week their willingness to resume peace talks the rebel group said it would agree to renew negotiations if the fox administration complied with several important demands , including withdrawing troops from seven rebel strongholds and releasing zapatista political prisoners in a speech after the inauguration , mr fox , from the national action party , also reiterated his commitment to pursuing peace saying his actions speak more powerfully than his words , mr fox reminded people that he had already ordered the withdrawal of a small number of troops and the dismantling of dozens of military checkpoints that had been set up throughout chiapas he also sent to congress a series of changes aimed at granting limited autonomy to indigenous communities in one of mr salazar s first official acts , he ordered the state s attorney general to review the cases of all those who said they were zapatista political prisoners and to suspend the sentences of those who had been charged with political crimes those who went to war had no other options , he said those who went were racked by hunger , authoritarianism and desperation and who thought that violence was the only way to open a space for justice for the poor they are those who were tired of waiting in a ceremony after the inauguration , mr fox called the new governor a brave fighter for democracy and seconded his words without a doubt , mr fox said , there is a new dawn in chiapas the federal government will be here to work with you to work on a concrete plan with concrete commitments because , as pablo has said , democracy is built with actions in the 175 years that chiapas has been a state , it has had 162 governors five interim governors have been appointed in the last seven years as a result of scandals or violence related to the zapatista uprising mr salazar pledged to complete his sixyear term he has described the work ahead of him as a titanic task although most mexicans live in urban areas , chiapas remains a largely rural state with a majority of residents living as subsistence farmers or peasant laborers the state has mexico s highest rate of poverty some 30 percent of residents older than 15 are illiterate , and 62 percent never finished elementary school it is a state steeped in ancient mayan traditions about onethird of the residents are indigenous people who speak a variety of dialects and practice different social customs the conflicts between them and attacks against them by wealthy landowners have forced at least 30 , 000 to live as refugees the conflicts pit roman catholics against evangelicals , supporters of the institutional revolutionary party against zapatista sympathizers , and brother against brother practically every day there is some kind of conflict , each one with its own unique dimensions , said emilio zebadua , a harvardeducated historian who is chiapas s new interior secretary this is a state that presents enormous challenges for establishing an atmosphere of governability we must look toward the future without forgetting the past but we also cannot get stuck in the past we must advance we must quickly reestablish law and order and peace with dialogue and tolerance in discussing the zapatista conflict , mr zebadua said mr salazar would oversee talks between the federal government and the rebels he said the salazar administration had agreed that the military presence in the state , estimated at 50 , 000 troops , needed to be scaled down but he added that chiapas , along the guatemalan border , had been used as a transshipment point by drug traffickers and immigrant smugglers he said the new government did not want to see a complete withdrawal of troops we cannot create a total vacuum of security and order in the state , he said the zapatistas are going to have to address that issue photo the new governor of chiapas , pablo salazar mendiguchia , right , and president vicente fox

the old adage that age is a state of mind is a bunch of bunk , said reggie jones , who , at the age of 73 , may be the oldest lifeguard in the western hemisphere age , in the opinion of mr jones , is a state of nature you ca n't beat the reaper , but you can put him off , he said , and to prove his point , mr jones pulled an old photograph of himself from a chest of drawers inside lifeguard shack 5 at jones beach state park on long island it was an old blackandwhite of a young reggie jones dated 1944 his first year on the beach and he looked something like a muscular sal mineo the beach was not named after mr jones , he would like you to know \( it was named after maj thomas jones , an 18thcentury whaler and parttime pirate \) reggie jones is , in fact , two years older than the park that robert moses built he is also older than the dark , cakeshaped shack that he works from the shack has no plumbing or glass windows and houses a halfdozen men like mr jones who have more than 35 years on the job it is affectionately called jurassic park by the other lifeguards at jones beach and these old men with the boyish faces think ponce de leon was a fool instead of traipsing around the everglades in search of the fountain of youth , they believe the explorer should have known he was sailing on it you spend a life staring at shells and sand and salt and swells , it does something good to you , said jay o'neill , 66 , a retired insurance broker who is working his 48th year on the big white chair it is the best job i ever had it is halfway through the summer season and , on many beaches , lifeguard jobs still go wanting from westchester to new york city to the jersey shore , it seems young people no longer find the clean , glamorous job appealing not even for 10 an hour it s gotten so bad that ocean city , nj , is digging through its personnel files and asking the oldtimers to fill the empty observation chairs but on the long island waters there is a surfeit of young candidates who want to work the problem here is that the young bulls must wait for the aging pachyderms to ramble off to the tar pits this season , 120 applicants tried out , 80 qualified and 50 were hired the job on long island is popular the reasons are many , the lifeguards say state parks pay more than others , from 11 an hour for a beginner to 20 for a captain the state park lifeguards have a union , and they are paid for inclement days and then there is a certain esprit de corps that comes from working on one of the world s most famous beaches i 'd rather watch the tomatoes walk by than watch them grow in the backyard , said mr jones , who has the old habit of pardoning himself before he curses or says something risque , as he does in a complimentary fashion when beautiful women pass by jeez , i'm a terrible character none of the guards can coast on their reputations each year , the applicants new and old must swim 100 yards in 75 seconds to requalify , and every year mr jones has done it i go ocean swimming in the winter , he said it s my physical if i do n't drop dead from a heart attack , i'm back for another year henry j stern , new york city s parks commissioner , who has had trouble over the last few summers attracting enough qualified people to guard his beaches , was flabbergasted to learn that a man of mr jones s age was still employed as a lifeguard how s his vision \? the commissioner asked perfect , he was told hmmm , said mr stern , who is 65 i 've got to find something to do after i retire of the 240 lifeguards at jones beach , one mr jones started in the 1940 s , 9 in the 1950 s , 36 in the 1960 s , 58 in the 1970 s , 74 in the 1980 s and 62 in the 1990 s they performed 2 , 079 rescues at jones beach last year , and no one drowned as far as anybody knows , reggie s the dinosaur of the ocean , said joe scalise , the water safety director for the state beaches on long island he keeps himself in phenomenal shape he outdoes a lot of the young people his skin is clear and cancer free , his mind sharp he maintains a rigorous training regimen throughout the year that includes running , swimming and weight lifting with a youthful body , the leathered neck of a turtle , seakelp eyebrows , and an old hat with a button that reads older than dirt and a grimy sea gull feather , reggie jones is hard to miss from his perch atop the lifeguard stand he reckons he has made more than a thousand rescues in his career , including saving a swimmer s toupee and a few sets of dentures the toughest rescue was the fat man who floated out to sea , with me holding on to him , mr jones said it was '47 , in the middle of a fog bank he had to be 300 pounds i got him , though i never lost anyone mr jones met his wife near the jones beach concession stands 50 years ago he is still happily married , still thick chested , but carries an extra 10 pounds and has lost half his hair since then other things have changed in half a century , as well dress , for instance people used to wear fullbody woolens now they wear dental floss , mr jones said the first bikini walked on the beach around 1952 she nearly caused a riot and the police took her away there are minority swimmers at the beach the overpasses on the parkways to jones beach were deliberately built too low to allow buses to fit under them city people got cars now , mr jones observed , which has broadened the beach s accessibility still , the crowds seem to be half the size they once were , he said there were no malls then no airconditioning no backyard pools everything was closed on sunday the beach was the only game in town the most egregious change \? the suits got smaller and the people got bigger , he bitterly complained america is fat photos reggie jones , 73 , is the oldest lifeguard at jones beach 46 guards there started before 1970 a 1944 photograph shows mr jones , second from left , in his first year at jones beach \( nancy siesel the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) reggie jones , at 73 the oldest lifeguard on jones beach , works out of shack 5 with several other veteran guards friends call it jurassic park \( ruth fremson the new york times \) \( pg b6 \)
the blue bedspread by raj kamal jha 209 pp new york random house 2195 if strength is in numbers , then cities are a dismal exception nothing is as deflating , nothing as alienating , as the cramped austerity of the modern metropolis albert camus called cities the only desert within our means never before have so many people in such proximity lived in such isolation the unnamed narrator of raj kamal jha s first novel , the blue bedspread , is like a desert explorer lost in the sahara without water or compass he lives a barren existence , thirsting for companionship and , astray in calcutta , a city of 12 million names , is shorn of bearings his northern star his beloved sister , who ran away from home as a child is eclipsed a police inspector calls from the hospital to say that she has died in childbirth the narrator takes custody of the baby , and during the course of the heated night that makes up the novel , while the baby sleeps on a blue bedspread , he writes the stories of his family , hoping to give the baby a past and his own life some coherence these are stories only in name like the novel itself , many of them have little narrative unity or direction but what they lack in structure , they more than make up for in mood each episode is like a dream , a gently contoured moment from childhood or urban life obscured in the vapor of the aging narrator s imperfect memory the narrative is hesitant , shy it is full of selfconscious references to its own authorship its vocabulary is one of maybe , perhaps , of the truth that lies somewhere in between in part , this obfuscation is deliberate the narrator is struggling not only against a failing memory but against an aversion to memory , an unwillingness to revisit his painful past like his narrator , jha , an editor at the indian express in new delhi , wrote the blue bedspread by night , and the product is a sepulchral tale of wife beating , murder , child abuse and incest but the obfuscation is not only about a refusal to remember it is also about the impossibility of naming of penetrating the complexity of a conradian soul in which depravity is entangled with goodness , revulsion with longing , despair with anticipation if the blue bedspread is a novel of the night , then this is not the disciplined night of the indian countryside , in which the stars stare fixedly from their appointed spots , white never seeping into black this is the ambiguous night of the city , the streets and sidewalks a marbling of gloomy yellow lighting and gray shadows companionship , in this novel , is stained with the indelible knowledge of aloneness two women who find friendship share an inner darkness that merges with the darkness of the city happiness is tinged with that peculiar human attachment to misery the narrator is reluctant to give up his solitude , fearing that the city \( which likes lonely people \) will spurn him for another lonely man or woman in some other neighborhood a father who sexually molests his children in one chapter buys them an ice cream in the next later , after another gift , the children thank father from the bottom of whatever is left in our hearts , the exhausted hearts a poignant intimation of the grief that stalks even our happiest moments all this dreaming and subtlety could easily have collapsed into mellifluous fluff if jha s prose itself were not so muscular he has been compared to raymond carver , but that is only partly correct his individual clauses , packed with tactile detail , have something of carver s abrupt grittiness but there is an elegiac quality to his sentences , which flow like a river from clause to clause , their meandering construction a reminder of the structure of the novel itself this combination of grit and elegy is new in modern indian writing jha combines the energy of a salman rushdie with the precise lyricism of an amit chaudhuri he avoids the unruliness of the former and never strays into the phlegmatic if beautiful pensiveness of the latter the blue bedspread is suffused with this originality priests are not sanctimonious guardians of tradition but mercenaries who extort bribes at funerals the funerals themselves are perfunctory , possessing none of the habitual ceremony and maudlin ritual so common in literature about india likewise , the urban world jha concocts is neither a chutnified metropolis of satellite television and cosmopolitan middle classes nor a third world jungle of street kids and slum dwellers jha s metropolis is the universal metropolis lonely , jarring , crawling with life , yet shadowed by an existential aridity this could be hong kong , new york or london jha s cityscapes reminded me of the 21stcentury los angeles in blade runner , ridley scott s science fiction classic , in which a grim urban setting is a backdrop for the hollowness in men s souls the novel does have its flaws some of the stories barely hold together , the originality can seem overwrought and jha s prose occasionally degenerates into florid sentimentality but it is a powerful novel , and i found myself haunted by it , returning again and again to individual moments there is something wonderfully ineffable about the episodes that make up this book like lonely new year s nights that i have spent in new york , they are swarming with event and a sense of momentous occasion yet enveloped in a crowded haze of color and music and celebration they are moments without handles , moments whose passing leaves no mark save a moody nostalgia they are , in jha s masterly formulation , like a memory , a fragment , more sound than image drawing \( ingo fast \)
imagine that you are a drop of water falling from a cloud over the croton river in westchester county the year is 1848 the new york water company has just put the finishing touches on the city s first aqueduct , drawing fresh , potable water from upstate new york and carrying it to the lower reaches of manhattan if the drop lands near the river s mouth , it would begin a 41mile journey through ossining , tarrytown , dobbs ferry and other towns , traveling across the bronx and traversing the harlem river by bridge from there , the drop would flow into one of a number of underground siphons , moving southward underneath amsterdam avenue and through a series of water mains , arriving ultimately in the city s distributing reservoir on 42nd street , where the new york public library now stands in the 19th century , the city s drinking water took this course through a system now known as the old croton aqueduct today , in the portion of the system that is in westchester county and the bronx , the path can be traced through the pastoral landscape of the aqueduct trailway , a state park but once you cross into manhattan , it is difficult to find the trail while the westchester and bronx sections of the old croton aqueduct have been listed on the new york state and national registers of historic places , the part in manhattan has not been preservationists and other aqueduct enthusiasts have long asked the city landmarks preservation commission to designate important stops along the croton aqueduct s manhattan portion on march 28 they scored a success the commission voted to designate a croton gatehouse , one of the important manhattan markers , at 119th street and amsterdam avenue andrew s dolkart , a city historian who teaches at columbia university s school of architecture , said the gatehouse , an unassuming but sturdy little granite structure with a slate shingle roof , was one of the last three remnants of the water system in manhattan the other two are a similar blocky gatehouse at 113th and amsterdam , built in 1876 , and a much larger , and significantly more ornate , castlelike structure at 135th street and convent avenue , completed in 1890 although apparatus for routing water was housed underneath each gatehouse , none of the three structures served any practical purpose above ground , mr dolkart said it s a symbol , like the fortress gates of a medieval city , he explained it signifies the importance of the water system to the city it s protecting this lifeline to the city it is impossible to imagine the city functioning today without a huge system to guarantee a ready supply of potable water but until the old croton aqueduct was completed , the city relied on local waterways , springs and wells for this necessity in the early 19th century , however , the growing city faced two crises its poor system of sewage and drainage contaminated many water sources , leading to repeated outbreaks of disease second , fires plagued the city because the available water was insufficient to put them out and because there was no pressure to propel water to the tops of four or fivestory buildings prompted by an epidemic of asiatic cholera in 1832 , a committee of the common council , a city agency , asked an engineer to investigate new water sources he suggested a system of dams and pipes , modeled on the roman aqueducts , to transport water from the croton river to manhattan but despite widespread interest in such a system , construction did not begin until 1837 john b jervis , one of the nation s leading engineers , oversaw the construction , which was disrupted by several insurrections by irish immigrant workers who were paid 75 cents for their 10hour days the final hurdle , getting the water across the harlem river , was cleared when the high bridge , an impressive romanstyle promontory connecting the bronx to manhattan at west 174th street , was completed in 1848 when water began to pour through the elaborate system that year , throngs gathered in city hall park to celebrate , reading poems to commemorate the event , and singing anthems of lavish praise the old croton aqueduct remained the city s principal source of water until 1890 , when the new croton aqueduct , which incorporated updated technology , supplemented it today , the entire city s water is furnished by the new croton system , the delaware system and the catskills system the latter two , more recent systems are far larger than the old croton aqueduct in 1981 , the city landmarks commission designated the gatehouse at 135th street and convent avenue , which was part of the new croton aqueduct in 1990 , neighborhood preservationists lost a fight to designate the gatehouse at amsterdam and 113th street , when the city auctioned off the structure to the amsterdam nursing home corporation , which slightly altered it for use as a day care center for elderly patients early this year , upon hearing a rumor that the city was planning to auction the 119th street gatehouse , bob roistacher , chairman of the morningside heights residents' association , asked the landmarks commission to consider its designation the commission responded swiftly mr roistacher said he was saddened that the manhattan portion of the old croton aqueduct was never listed as a national historic landmark , when the bronx and westchester portions were but it s the city designation that offers the highest level of protection , he added so we 're elated to have that , and to know that nobody and no institution is going to come along and try to significantly change it or demolish it now photos the 113th street gatehouse has become a day care center for the elderly the gatehouse at 119th street is unassuming but sturdy the castlelike structure at 135th street and convent avenue is more ornate than its downtown counterparts \( photographs by rebecca cooney for the new york times \) chart map route welltraveled

detroit , march 12 small hands shot up when daniel s varner asked his afterschool class of mostly poor , mostly africanamerican children here , who can tell me what the internet is \? it s like a big dictionary , said jordan nichols , 9 a new way of communication , offered stacey blair , 12 and across the room , terrell brazier , 13 , said , it s a superhighway to anything you want to these children , and others like them who grow up poor , the internet is all that and much more it can be a path to the future , all right , but its effect may be more profound on those who do n't know how to use it with more and more jobs requiring computer and internet literacy , experts fear that children not exposed to those skills will be left further behind in the new economy a couple of detroit lawyers who wanted to keep that from happening have chucked their law careers to start an unusual program here that helps poor children join the information age they draw hundreds of children into afterschool sports leagues , then offer free computer training the children learn not only how to use the computers , but also how to take them apart , fix them and put them together again the trophy they take home is a handmedown computer there are enough for everyone on the sports teams we knew kids needed the character that comes with team sports , and we knew they needed the tools of the future that come with access to technology , said michael f tenbusch , who founded the nonprofit group think detroit with mr varner in 1997 early on , the group organized sports leagues for children at the same time , the group began setting up 17 computer laboratories in churches , schools and nonprofit agencies enough to serve 2 , 000 people last year filling them with used computers donated by area companies but it became clear that closing the gap in computer access would require reaching homes so in november , think detroit switched strategies and began the balls and bytes program combining baseball , soccer and basketball leagues with computer classes for children over 10 the group has donated about 30 computers and plans to give away 200 more this summer stacey blair , a seventh grader at westside christian academy , said that when she joined the group s baseball team she did not know she would also get a computer she spends about an hour a day on it and went back to mr varner s class to learn how to use the internet her first computer classes were intimidating i ca n't do this , stacey remembered thinking after the instructor took the machines apart and showed us which spaces were for the motherboard and the cards , she said , then i was like , this is pretty easy statistics show children like stacey are at risk of being bystanders in the digital age although virtually the same percentage of all children have some access to computers at school , poor and africanamerican children are far less likely to use a home computer , according to a poll conducted last month by national public radio , the kaiser family foundation and harvard s john f kennedy school of government using the computer and the internet can be such an important set of skills to be marketable for the economy , said mollyann brodie , a vice president of the kaiser foundation any digital divide will further exacerbate the gaps we 've always had in our country between the haves and havenots detroit is a good example , because it is the nation s poorest big city many poor children here will not go to college in the past , they might have had a ford factory in their futures , at best now few workers with only a high school diploma can pass the tests automakers require social workers say the gap may be even more acute for poor people who are already out of school and have had little contact with computers carris m carey , a social worker at focus hope , a nonprofit organization in detroit that trains poor people to work in the auto industry , said , the kids who are in the younger generation , the 18to25 range , have had some type of exposure to computers , even if it is not as much as the children of wealthy families have but , mr carey said , older poor people are seldom familiar with computers and the internet that observation was echoed in the new national poll , ms brodie said the gaps by income are just profound , she said the poll found that 56 percent of those in the 1840 age group earning less than 30 , 000 a year had a home computer , while 87 percent of those earning more than 50 , 000 a year had one public schools here are struggling to keep up with their counterparts in school districts that are better off all 263 schools in the district have now been wired for computer access , but not all schools have computers , particularly uptodate ones , to attach to the wires , said stan childress , a spokesman for the detroit public schools none of our schools have computers in every classroom , and that is a goal , he said for now , the secondhand computers from think detroit will help close the gap between technology haves and havenots in two ways first , more children each month are being given computers to take home second , they are teaching older family members how to use them troy brazier , a sixth grader at george crockett academy , a charter school here , took home one of the think detroit computers after playing baseball and basketball on one of the teams set up by the organization his mother works at a target store and an older brother is a security guard , so when he got the computer home , i had to teach them , my mom and my brother , how to use it , troy said during a break from mr varner s internet class i'm still trying to learn a little more photo daniel s varner of the nonprofit organization think detroit

washington , april 6 in the wake of concerns raised by some republican leaders over the intrusiveness of some census questions , census bureau officials have become alarmed that a smaller percentage of households are mailing back their census long forms than did so in 1990 census bureau officials said this week that 48 percent of households had filled out and returned the long form , compared with 58 percent of those who had mailed back the short form at a comparable time in 1990 , the response rate for the long form was 6 percentage points behind that of the short form ten years ago , census takers interviewing people in households that did not mail back the long form were able to close the gap to 45 percentage points but officials are fearful that unless there is a significant upturn in the number of households sending in the long form , the gap will not be significantly reduced i do n't think it can be , said william barron , deputy director of the census bureau i do n't think it s going to be information from the long form is considered critical , used as the base for items like the consumer expenditure survey , a key component of the consumer price index the monthly unemployment figures issued by the labor department and the national crime victimization survey by the justice department the long form is a 53question version that is mailed to one in six households nationwide it asks people to provide personal data on things like income , the amount of time it takes to commute to work , the amount paid for utilities and what kind of plumbing facilities are in their homes the short form has eight questions and only seeks information about things like name , age , sex , race and ethnicity in some ways this year s long form is less intrusive than in years past in 1990 , the long form had 58 questions in 1980 it had 65 and this year s form pales in comparison with the long form of 1940 , which had 83 questions in recent weeks the census bureau has received numerous complaints from the public that many of the questions on the long form were too nosy census bureau officials said the level of complaints from the public is not significantly different from what it was in 1980 and 1990 several republican leaders , responding to the complaints , suggested last week that people fill out the form and simply skip questions they find objectionable campaigning in milwaukee last week , gov george w bush of texas said people should mail back their form and if they 're worried about the government intruding into their personal lives , they ought to think about it a survey conducted for the census bureau found that in the first two weeks after the forms were mailed out , 10 percent of those polled said they believed the census was too intrusive , kenneth prewitt , the director of the census bureau , said in the third week , as news accounts appeared detailing concerns of some republicans over the questions , the number of people who said the census was too intrusive jumped to 17 percent democrats in the house have criticized the actions of these republican , noting that the census bureau had sent copies of potential questions to congress in 1997 and 1998 and asked for comments they received none in 1997 and 1998 not one of these sanctimonious census reformers said one thing when they received books on their desks that said 'this is what we 're going to ask , ' said representative carolyn b maloney of manhattan , who is the ranking democrat on the house subcommittee on the census in recent days republican leaders have been scrambling to not be seen as trying to undermine the census today house speaker j dennis hastert , of illinois representative j c watts jr of oklahoma , head of the house republican conference and representative dan miller of florida , chairman of the house subcommittee on the census , held a joint news conference to urge people to complete their forms , though they still left open the possibility for people to skip some questions i think every american ought to fill it out to the best of their ability , mr hastert said if they have reservations about their phone number or some things that they think are private , i think that s a condition that they ought to be able to make their own decision on even as the republican leaders sought to be seen as friends of the census , some business groups that rely heavily on census data said that the 2000 census may already be irreparably damaged the cow s out of the barn , said david crowe , staff vice president of the national association of home builders we 've had some very negative statements from some influential politicians i do n't know how you counteract that
blue ridge by t r pearson 243 pp new york viking 2495 i wish more mainstream writers turned out the occasional mystery there are notable exceptions , but most american detective novels are composed with all the verve and originality of the instruction manual that came with your food processor and thanks to the iron grip of raymond chandler , that mysterycummanual is probably littered with preposterous metaphors that are better read with your eyes half shut , for your own protection \( english whodunits , on the other hand , are generally worse \) i can say all this because i am an indefatigable fan of the mystery genre as such , i was curious to see what t r pearson would do with it in his new book , blue ridge pearson is best known for a short history of a small place , a deceptively folksy , highly ornate exploration of a suicide in a small southern town every longwinded writer who ever set foot south of the masondixon line has been compared to faulkner , but there s no getting around it a short history of a small place is definitely faulknerian in mystery circles , faulkner is best known for remaining indisputably himself when he wrote the detective stories in knight s gambit pearson , too , remains his neofaulknerian self in blue ridge , and the results are delightful the book alternates between two crime stories , and on the surface , at least the conventions are followed ray tatum , a new deputy sheriff in hogarth , va , is directed by a couple of hikers to a pile of bare bones just off the appalachian trail the skull is caved in for the investigation , he is teamed up , buddymovie style , with a tough black park service employee who could be played by pam grier \( well , well , she says to one man they 're questioning , if it is n't superfly \) the other story concerns ray s cousin paul , an actuary in roanoke , who is asked to come to new york to identify the body of his son paul has never really been acquainted with the young man \( more on that later \) , but he dutifully goes north and winds up being escorted around manhattan by various colorful cops and criminals , all of whom are very interested in what exactly happened to this ne'erdowell the two puzzles end in real solutions , with none of the lifewillalwaysbeunknowable evasions found in many literary expositions of the genre the solutions are simple and believable , not surprising but that is n't the point pearson is up to a lot more here blue ridge is much funnier than most mysteries not too broad , not too dry , effortlessly finding the right tone , time after time paul , who can be devastatingly honest about his own haplessness , finds himself in especially ludicrous situations \( on an earlier trip to new york for an actuarial conference , he and a colleague decided to save money and stay in weehawken , n j , near the lincoln tunnel , in a motel that advertised rooms by the hour as he recalls the story , the motel manager and a customer abandoned a heated argument and stood in stunned silence when confronted by the two men s request , helplessly constrained , i have to think now , to imagine me and lowell engaged together in some manner of middleaged whiteboy sexual congress , 72 prepaid hours of swampy actuarial love \) the splicing together of the two different plots puzzled me at first the investigations start off unrelated and remain so throughout the book \( i think i can give that much away \) but gradually it became clear how very shrewd this decision was paul s story confounds expectations at every turn , from the moment a local policeman shows up at his insurance firm , obviously bearing bad news paul casts his mind over his family tree , trying to figure out which relative has died when he is told it is his son , he pauses , then says , who \? it s a funny line , and quickly explained by the circumstances the boy was conceived after a casual fling in the early 1970 s and his nowdeceased mother opted for single parenthood paul has seen his offspring only once or twice in over 20 years but that who \? is also indicative of the poison in paul s personality he has no feel at all for human ties his cousin ray is the more usual solitary detective type he s divorced he wanders from job to job but it s all because of a horrible loss in ray s past for which he feels responsible his presence is an implicit criticism of paul , a character it would be hard to read a whole book about after consulting an advice column in the newspaper about ways to ease up on his compulsive tidiness , paul picks out a dog at the pound but the dog annoys him , and one night he neglects to let his new pet back in the house later , when a neighbor with two kids asks if the dog is his , paul says , never seen him before and suggests that she keep him this is the sort of thing heroes of detective novels do before they inexplicably go off and risk death to save the lives of strangers the idea is that the dog would be better off with the neighbor , so the hero sacrifices his own comfort you are never supposed to believe the crusty excuses he makes but in blue ridge , even though you may be laughing at the way paul tells the story , abandoning a dog turns out to be nothing more than abandoning a dog

mr bush i'm just saying , you can disagree on issues we 'll debate issues but whatever you do , do n't equate my integrity and trustworthiness to bill clinton that s about as low a blow as you can give in the republican primary mr king and that s what got you mad to sort of fight back mr bush well , i stand by my ads mr king you would n't change any \? mr bush no i stand by what i'm trying to do i mean , when the man says that i'm spending all the surplus on tax cuts and it s not true , i'm going to define what reality is mr king senator mccain , did you break a promise \? mr mc cain well , let me tell you what happened there was a ad run against me , we ran a counter ad in new hampshire governor bush took the ad down and then i was beat up very badly by all of his surrogates , called clinton , called clintonlike , called a hypocrite mr king in new hampshire mr mc cain no , here in south carolina you 've seen it turn on the radio , turn on the television and unfortunately now , pick up the telephone and you 'll hear a negative attack against john mccain but let me tell you what really went over the line governor bush had a event and he paid for it and stood next to a spokesman for a fringe veterans' group that fringe veteran said that john mccain had abandoned the veterans now , i do n't know if you can understand this , george , but that really hurts that really hurts and so five united states senators , vietnam veterans , heroes , some of them really incredible heroes , wrote george a letter and said apologize you should be ashamed you should be ashamed mr king is he responsible for what someone else says \? mr mc cain well , this same man , he stood next to him it was his event this same man that attacked his father viciously it was remarkable mr bush let me speak to that mr mc cain so so , i 'd be glad to tell you the rest of the story if you 'd let me when it s appropriate mr king well , let him respond on that point mr bush let me answer , let me answer that mr king alan , you come in , too mr mc cain you should be ashamed , you should be ashamed mr bush let , let me say something mr mc cain of sponsoring an event with that man there , who had attacked your own father mr bush let me finish john , i believe that you served our country nobly and i 've said it over and over again , that man was n't speaking for me he may have a dispute with you mr mc cain did you mr bush let me finish please please mr mc cain he s listed as your mr bush let me finish let me finish mr king all right , let him finish mr bush the man was not speaking for me if you want to know my opinion about you , john , you served our country admirably and strongly and i'm proud of your record , just like you are and i do n't appreciate what he said about my dad either but let me say something , if you 're going to be hold me responsible for what people for me say , i'm going to do the same for you and let me give you one example warren rudman , the man who you had as your campaign man in new hampshire , said about the christian coalition that they 're bigots he talked about the christian coalition in a way that was incredibly strong i know you do n't believe that , do you \? mr mc cain george , he s entitled to his opinion on that issue mr bush well , so is this man mr mc cain you paid for an event mr bush so is this man mr mc cain you paid for an mr king please do n't but i want alan to give me one thing if you have a surrogate making a speech for you today , are you responsible for what he says \? mr mc cain if he s at your event mr keyes larry , i'm sorry i i i i really am sitting here wondering , because i said we were going out to 202 countries , and is this kind of pointless squabbling really what we want them to see \? we 're we 're talking about electing the president of the united states mr keyes does leadership consist in going into bob jones university where serious questions , in fact , do exist about religious bigotry and racial bigotry \? going in , taking the applause , risking nothing because you refuse to raise the issues \? that s what gw bush did mr king why did n't you speak against bigotry at bob jones \? mr bush i was asked the question do i support his policy of no interracial dating i said of course not of course not
president clinton and hillary rodham clinton , who moved into their dutch colonial in chappaqua , ny , in january , have not been shopping for an apartment in manhattan , a spokesman for mrs clinton said yesterday aides to mrs clinton said it was not inconceivable that the couple might decide to look for a manhattan apartment at some point but howard wolfson , the communications director for mrs clinton s senate campaign , said there was no truth to a report in the new york post yesterday that the clintons had enlisted colleagues to look at condominiums in two luxury buildings , one on central park west and one on park avenue an apartment would complement their chappaqua home , the report said none of it is true , mr wolfson said howard j rubenstein , a spokesman for the new york post , said the newspaper stood by its article mrs clinton s opponent , representative rick a lazio , who has criticized mrs clinton for her relatively recent arrival in new york , could not resist a dig when asked about the report i knew they were going to put their house up for sale in chappaqua after the election , he said , but i did n't think it would be this quick
south bend , ind , nov 12 a flock of reporters gathered around matt lovecchio , then another he patiently answered questions in a low monotone , but continued to crane his neck , trying to pick out two faces in the crowd on the other side of the tall iron gates at notre dame stadium he was looking for his parents , and that says a lot about lovecchio , notre dame s freshman quarterback from franklin lakes , nj the irish \( 72 \) , ranked no 11 by the associated press , no 7 by the new york times computer and no 11 in the bowl championship series ranking , are a surging team that has gone 50 under lovecchio notre dame plays saturday at rutgers he is totally , completely , absolutely unfazed by it all this is part of the plan actually , i 'll think about it some day , he said of all the attention being directed his way but if i did that now , it would n't help me or this team he paused , took a breath , then said this is the reality of the situation this is just the way it s worked out lovecchio has apparently always played football this way although he has stepped onto a national stage for the first time , he has been through much of this before he has been a quarterback since the third grade his mother said he never has been rattled by too much that s what i love about him , lori lovecchio said for example , his father , larry , tells the story of how rutgers became the first college to offer his son a scholarship matt got the offer before his sophomore year in high school , before he had started a single game at powerful bergen catholic high school in oradell , nj one of the reasons he said he had picked notre dame , besides the prestige , was because the school offered him an early opportunity to play arnaz battle , a junior , had won the starting job , and the 6foot3inch lovecchio was one of four freshmen quarterbacks on the roster but we kind of knew that if the starter went down , he 'd have a pretty good shot , larry lovecchio said of his son guess what happened \? battle broke his left wrist in a loss to nebraska in the second game of the season gary godsey , battle s backup , started two games , but was ineffective in the second game and was shifted to tight end lovecchio got the job for a game against stanford , when notre dame s record was 22 he threw eight touchdown passes in his first four starts notre dame coach bob davie said he still recruits quarterbacks primarily based on two characteristics do they have strong legs and can they run \? lovecchio has 176 yards rushing in his 5 starts at first , davie did not want to ask too much of his young quarterback after a 2816 irish victory over boston college last saturday , eagles coach tom o'brien said of lovecchio , they 're doing what they have to do to win but now , davie thinks he can add plays to the game plan because lovecchio has gained some experience there are no limitations , cerebralwise , with what we 're doing with our fundamental offense , davie said the irish have caught a huge break along the way none of the five opponents they have faced with lovecchio as the starter are ranked , and their last two regularseason opponents , rutgers and southern california , are also struggling should notre dame win those games , it would likely earn a spot in the bcs lovecchio is the first notre dame starting quarterback from new jersey since a youngster from south river named joe theismann won the job in 1969 lovecchio could become the first fouryear starting quarterback from new jersey since frank tripucka started from 1945 to 1948 lovecchio has a chance to finish with more victories as a freshman starter than blair kiel , who was 611 in 1980 , or steve beuerlein , who was 53 in 1983 \( the other freshman starter , the former giant kent graham , won his only start in 1987 before transferring to ohio state \) lovecchio s teammates say he is quiet , almost laidback they see his composure as a sign that he knows what he is doing matt s a real confident guy out there , said jim jones , a senior offensive guard we feed off him there s never once , now , where we 're thinking , 'oh , man this guy s young' now the young man goes home there is excitement in bergen county larry and lori lovecchio are not sure how they will get a ticket for everyone who wants to go to rutgers stadium in piscataway , nj but the 18yearold in the center of it all has prepared for the game as if rutgers was simply another opponent when matt called home , his father said , the conversation had nothing to do with football when you get down to it , he s very evasive , larry lovecchio said i find out what s going on with him by reading the papers before i find it out from him that is the way his son wants it modesty works better you could get overwhelmed with everything at notre dame , matt lovecchio said it s such an honor to play here my focus week to week is just on helping this team photos notre dame s freshman quarterback matt lovecchio has a 50 record as a starter for the fighting irish \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \) matt lovecchio , center , playing last week against boston college he had eight touchdown passes in his first four starts for notre dame \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)

austin , tex , june 20 some are active republicans , their offices decorated with stuffed elephants or pictures of gov george w bush many have some sort of experience in law enforcement these include a former secret service agent , a former prosecutor and several former parole workers but there is also a psychologist , a rancher and a former schoolteacher these men and women are members of the texas board of pardons and paroles , the obscure state agency whose job is to review the clemency petitions of inmates in what is by far the nation s busiest death row when gov bush is asked about the fairness of the death penalty in texas , he often says that the power to grant clemency to death row inmates rests not with him , but with this 18member board under state law he can commute a death penalty only if the board recommends it but while mr bush has made a point of distancing himself from the board s decisions in capital cases , as governor he has appointed all of its members to their sixyear terms he has also selected the chairman and designated the six members who set policy and guidelines , all subject to approval by the state senate now the board is faced with its latest highprofile decision unless it intervenes , gary graham , a convicted murderer whose case has drawn national attention largely because of accounts of poor work by his lawyer , will be executed at 6 pm thursday in an unusual move , the chairman of the board has postponed the deadline for the vote until noon thursday , six hours before the scheduled execution if history is any measure , mr graham s lawyers face an uphill struggle since 1995 , 68 death row inmates have asked for clemency , and only once has the board granted it the board has not held a public hearing on a capital case since 1992 indeed , the board has been criticized for working in secret , seldom explaining its lifeanddeath decisions adele shank , an ohio lawyer specializing in capital defense who argued a landmark clemency case before the united states supreme court in 1997 , said the texas board was out of step with the decadeslong trend toward greater openness in handling capital clemency decisions many state boards require public hearings if requested in capital cases , she said the texas board has also been accused by defense lawyers of not giving a thorough review to the death row cases it is responsible for evaluating a majority vote is required for any form of clemency once the board s votes are all in they generally send them in to the main office in austin by fax the decision is immediately relayed to the governor board members are not required to meet publicly on capital cases , or even to hold telephone conference calls and the apparent lack of such discussion on any sort of systematic basis has prompted criticism from defense lawyers as well as judges but with mr graham s lawyers trying to make a powerful case for his innocence in the 1981 robberymurder for which he was sentenced to death , there has been an unusual amount of conferring among members about his case , said one board official who asked not to be quoted by name there s an awful lot of talking going on , the official said they 're concerned about him being possibly innocent and they 're concerned about the lack of an adequate defense michael jones , a spokesman for the governor s office , said mr bush did not personally interview any of the candidates for the paroles board , noting that the governor controlled 3 , 000 appointments he said candidates usually apply to the governor s appointment office , which asks a variety of questions , inquiring about a person s views on crime and punishment but mr jones says none of the candidates are asked their views about the death penalty , nor about their political party affiliation capital murder cases are a very small percentage of the caseload , mr jones said in an interview today the goal is to select people who are balanced , fair , thorough and who make decisions based on facts and who have no agenda except to protect the public mr jones said one goal in choosing members is to get a diverse perspective , and the board is diverse in ethnicity and geographic representation but none of the members are criminal defense lawyers in fact , at least five of the members once worked for the texas department of criminal justice , the same department charged with carrying out executions interviews with present and former officials indicate that most , if not all , of the board members seem to support the death penalty one member who left in the last year , bennie elmore , abstained in all capital cases , though he declined to say why kent a schaffer , immediate past president of the texas criminal defense lawyers association , said all texas governors carefully selected board members who could serve as a fire wall when a particularly sensitive case arose they are predisposed to protect the governor , mr schaffer said the governor makes appointments to the board with people he knows can take the heat he s in the enviable position of saying , 'i can only do what they allow me to do'

at his small suite of offices in fort lee , nj , david chang was a tycoon without much to do mr chang , 56 , often rode to work in a rollsroyce and strode through the door in a long mink coat , a cigarette dangling from his lips but although his holding company boasted of big , global deals in everything from oil exploration to telecommunications , almost none of those ventures ever got off the ground i never really saw anybody there do anything , said clark r wilcox , a former banking executive who was hired to help run the firm in 1997 , only to quit soon after and successfully sue his former employer for breach of contract in washington , however , mr chang cut a very different figure there , he attended state dinners at the white house and visited informally with the president he hired mr clinton s chief fundraiser as a consultant and cultivated senators and congressmen from both parties the chairman of his company , a retired navy admiral , had been chief of staff to george bush when he was vice president the secret of mr chang s popularity among american politicians was of course no secret he and his employees gave generously to favored candidates and their parties more than 100 contributions that totaled 325 , 000 mr chang also pledged at least 1 million toward the presidential library that mr clinton hopes to build in little rock , ark mr chang s activities finally caught the attention of federal campaignfinance investigators , who learned he was spending more on politicians than he was reporting in taxable income in june , he pleaded guilty to channeling more than 53 , 000 in illegal contributions to one of the democratic party s most important fundraisers , senator robert g torricelli of new jersey now , mr chang is at the center of a widening federal inquiry into the possibility that mr torricelli s 1996 campaign staff may have been complicit in mr chang s illegal donations something the senator strongly denies lawyers familiar with the case say mr chang has given prosecutors information suggesting that mr torricelli s aides accounted improperly for some of his contributions , and at least two dozen federal bureau of investigation agents have been added to the inquiry in recent weeks mr torricelli and other politicians now cast him as an unscrupulous con man , and themselves as his unwitting victims through his washington lawyer , mr chang declined to comment at all but mr chang s credibility is likely to be a central issue in any new case that is brought a portrait of mr chang drawn from interviews , court records and a thick file of lawsuits by and against him shows a man of glaring , sometimes comical contradictions one who claims to have been educated at england s best schools but who speaks broken english whose closest business contacts included communist officials from north korea and a former republican congressman from new jersey who rallied american politicians to help him buy a billiondollar south korean insurance company but never had even a small fraction of the money he needed how can a guy like chang get hooked up with all these people \? asked mr wilcox , his former employee as a citizen , quite frankly , it makes me very angry as a businessman , many of his former employees say , mr chang generated all sorts of ambitious schemes but almost no apparent profit though he has owned large homes , expensive cars and the 235room fort lee hilton hotel , just over the george washington bridge from manhattan , it is unclear where he has gotten his money , large chunks of which have arrived in wire transfers from abroad , court records show and while mr chang s generosity won him many attentive friends in washington , it did not buy him all the political favors he sought his most important request , that the clinton administration help him win repayment of tens of millions of dollars he said he was owed by north korea for grain shipments , made almost no progress at all did anything go wrong \? said a spokesman for mr clinton , jake seiwert his proposals were neither accepted nor acted upon what he wanted to do did n't happen still , the story of mr chang s education in money politics is a remarkable chapter in the saga of washington influence bought and sold in a world of fundraiser business executives , dealsavvy senators and retired officials who increasingly exploit their connections abroad , mr chang was a magnet for the powerful even after he was publicly identified as having given illegal donations to two different election campaigns basic contradictions just who david chang is has been difficult to ascertain at a bail hearing earlier this year , prosecutors noted that mr chang had used at least two passports and three social security numbers , listed two different birthplaces and three different birth dates , and was married to two women at the same time not including a reputed girlfriend who has also been listed as his wife david chang is a chronic liar , one of his many former lawyers , michael s kimm , asserted in a recent lawsuit that , like several others by other people , claims that mr chang failed to pay him what he owed
washington , june 10 democrats have a financial advantage in the contest for control of the house of representatives that s right , democrats ever since republicans took control of the house in 1994 , they have outraised the democrats contributors pay for access and influence , and they would much rather get to members of the majority party , especially subcommittee and committee leaders when the republicans took over those posts in 1995 , business and trade groups no longer needed to give to democrats , and republican fundraising soared another piece of the republican advantage was a more effective fundraising operation , maintaining a base of small donors who were reliable this year , neither factor seems to matter very much , as democrats have greatly improved fundraising efforts and contributors hedge their bets they know it will take a net gain of only six democratic seats to install democrats in house positions of power , so they are giving to both sides this week when the federal election commission released data for the 15 months that ended march 31 , it showed that the house democratic campaign committee had substantially more money in the bank than did its republican counterpart the democratic congressional campaign committee reported 15 , 082 , 503 in soft money , the unregulated contributions from business , labor and rich people that these days are chiefly used for television advertisements attacking the other party s candidates the national republican congressional committee had 9 , 818 , 178 when it came to hard money , the regulated contributions from individuals and political action committees , democrats held a narrower advantage they had 9 , 308 , 266 in the bank , while republicans had 8 , 449 , 372 democrats held another advantage , although it is not so obvious , in the fundraising of individual house candidates in crucial races the federal election commission report said that the median receipts of republicans in open seats those most likely to change hands because no one has the advantage of incumbency were 165 , 775 for democrats , the figure was only 75 , 820 but those figures were misleading they include more than one candidate in places like houston , where the contest for the seat of retiring representative bill archer drew a big , wellheeled republican field , six of whom raised more than 195 , 000 , and one forlorn democrat with no chance of being elected and a fundraising total of 7 , 911 when the new york times examined 24 districts widely believed to be winnable by either party , comparing only one candidate from each party \( the nominee or , if none had been chosen , the leading fundraiser \) , the advantage was with the democrats their median receipt was 655 , 849 , compared with 539 , 893 for the republicans and the democratic candidates reported median cash on hand of 433 , 892 , while the republicans showed 325 , 907 when the focus was narrowed to the 11 open seats on that list of two dozen , the democratic cash advantage grew the democrats' bank accounts held a median total of 395 , 911 to 237 , 067 for the republicans' none of this means that the democrats are going to take control of the house but it means that one traditional republican advantage is gone the spokesmen for the two campaign committees were oddly in sync in their comments john del cecato of the democratic congressional campaign committee said the numbers showed that there will not be a single democrat who loses a house race this year due to a lack of funds on the republican side , jim wilkinson said that in any race in america that matters , both sides , the democrats and the republicans , are going to have all the money they ever want at the end of a redistricting cycle of 10 years , only a small number of seats are really in play the weak incumbents have already either lost or retired so that means the parties and outside groups like labor and business can concentrate their attention , and their money as mr wilkinson said , we 're going to have 20 to 30 mininew hampshires in those contested house districts , he said , your phones are going to be ringing , your mailbox is going to be stuffed , your tv will have constant commercials , and strangers are going to be knocking on your door
all those early american football league club owners must be chuckling they remember chipping in a few thousand dollars to save the jets' ancestors , the new york titans , when the players' paychecks from the original owner , harry wismer , were bouncing higher than the polo grounds' roof now , nearly four decades later , the jets' franchise is about to be bought for more than 600 million that s more than 600 million , for a franchise that does n't even have a coach but unless the jets' new owner , either charles f dolan , the cablevision impresario , or robert wood johnson iv , the wealthy philanthropist , has forgotten the business acumen and power of persuasion that helped each amass his fortune , bill parcells will be the jets' coach again if you were putting up more than 600 million for the jets , would n't you want the best possible coach \? especially when the best possible coach is already on the franchise payroll and even though parcells would prefer not to coach in the 2000 season , he remains the best possible coach even if parcells , who is still the jets' chief of football operations , could hire any of the other current national football league coaches , none would be a better choice with his peopletopeople skills , parcells belongs on the sideline as a coach , not behind a desk as a club executive prowling the sideline during games , growling at practice during the week , in the weight room with his players , that s where he s the best at what he does all his talents as a coach would be wasted behind a desk vince lombardi discovered that situation the year after he had guided the green bay packers to their second straight super bowl victory and to their fifth nfl title in seven seasons lombardi would acknowledge having missed the fire on sunday in 1968 and the next season he was on the sideline again , this time as the washington redskins' coach it would be his only season with the redskins he died of colon cancer shortly before the 1970 season like that of lombardi , like that of any great coach , parcells s value is on the sideline , not in an upstairs suite with the club owner when parcells told his players last monday morning that he was resigning as coach and that bill belichick would be taking over , he mentioned that he could still suck it up as coach for another 16game season , but he would rather not , that belichick would be in charge of all football decisions , including the college draft but when belichick surprisingly announced on tuesday that he was resigning because of so many uncertainties in the team s future , parcells was suddenly in charge again , notably in charge of the search for a coach parcells keeps saying that his intent is still not to coach again , but that does n't mean he ca n't be persuaded to suck it up and coach again if only for one season , especially if dolan or johnson offers to add a million or two or three to his paycheck when parcells announced his resignation he mentioned dale wimbrow s 1934 poem , the guy in the glass , meaning you ca n't be fooled by your reflection in the mirror now that he s searching for a new jets coach , he should look in the mirror again the best coach is in that mirror as for belichick , his departure \( probably to the new england patriots \) leaves the jets without their defensive guru , but he may have done the jets a favor whether parcells returns or not to the sideline , the jets will be better off without belichick as their head coach just as parcells s maximum value is as a head coach , belichick s maximum value is as an x s and o s tactician belichick s introverted personality thrives in studying videotapes of opponents , devising defensive game plans and making adjustments from the sideline to use pro football s longtime analogy with warfare , he was a brilliant colonel on the general s staff but he has never projected the aura of a general who could inspire the troops a good head coach must do that , the way parcells does in belichick s five seasons as the cleveland browns' head coach from 1991 to 1995 , his records were 610 , 79 , 79 , 115 \( and a playoff victory over the patriots in parcells s second season in new england \) and 511 \( the last season in cleveland before the franchise moved to baltimore \) that adds up to 3644 in the regular season , 11 in the playoffs as if those numbers were n't negative enough , his personality also alienated the fans and the news media in cleveland after his dismissal from the browns , belichick quickly resurfaced in new england with parcells , who had been his boss when the 1986 and 1990 giants won super bowls when the jets pursued parcells in 1997 , belichick was hired as the temporary head coach with the contractual promise that he would eventually succeed parcells , as he did for less than 24 hours early last week as the nfl s bestpaid assistant coach , belichick earned more than 25 million over his three seasons on the jets' staff his 2000 salary as head coach would have been 14 million but when belichick learned last monday that robert k kraft , the patriots' owner whom parcells despises , had requested permission \( which the jets did n't grant \) to contact him regarding the dual job of general manager and coach , presumably for much more than 14 million , he jumped his signed jets contract now he s challenging that contract s nfl legality in time , the patriots are expected to negotiate a deal with the jets that will allow belichick to join them in return for a few draft choices , as the jets did when parcells was still obligated to the patriots it s the latest chapter in the feud that still simmers between parcells and kraft , but it s also another reason parcells can be persuaded to coach again the opportunity for the jets \( and parcells \) to beat the patriots \( and kraft , if not belichick \) twice next season photo
los angeles , march 10 it was a perfect example of the rangers' imperfections there was less than six minutes remaining in regulation thursday night and the rangers , on a power play , trailed the kings by a goal theo fleury faced a gaping expanse of open net because the kings' goaltender , jamie storr , was out of position behind the goal with 14 goals this season only one on the power play fleury needed the goal almost as desperately as the rangers did fleury flicked a backhander at the net from the slot just as he was being hooked down from behind the shot went wide and ricocheted off the right post before time ran out , fleury actually beat storr but hit another post it has been that kind of season for fleury and the rangers final score kings 3 , rangers 1 fleury has scored 40 goals or more in a season four times and at least 30 goals seven times in his career the rangers signed him to a lucrative freeagent contract last summer and are paying him 85 million this season to do only one thing score goals but fleury cannot find the net this season , even when there is no one there to protect it it s just ridiculous , fleury said i do n't understand i just do n't understand neither does anyone else and so the rangers squandered yet another opportunity to put some distance between themselves and the rest of the eastern conference the rangers will face the swooning penguins on saturday night in another mustwin game for both teams the rangers are in eighth place in the eastern conference , 1 point ahead of the penguins the sabres acquired doug gilmour from chicago and chris gratton from tampa bay for the postseason run the rangers answered with a minor trade of checking right wings tonight , sending mike knuble to boston for rob dimaio , whose best season came two years ago playing on a line with tim taylor with manny malhotra deemed not ready for prime time by coach john muckler , the rangers could use another center but what the rangers really need is for fleury to start scoring goals it s not even like i'm pressing anymore , he said i'm relaxed out there it s hard to explain why the puck is not going in the net fleury was asked as he has been many times if he had ever experienced anything like this never , he said never , ever never , ever , ever , ever , never it s totally a mystery the net looks about as big as a lacrosse stick right now i would n't call it frustrating it s just one of those years just one of those things that there is no explanation for fleury scored 40 goals last season this season , only three of his 14 goals have come in his last 26 games the rangers could use some production from valery kamensky , too kamensky , who also signed with the rangers as a free agent last summer , has eight goals this season and none in his last 13 games there are lots of games left and points ahead , fleury said that s what i'm looking forward to if fleury does not start scoring soon , however , he and his teammates could be staring at a long summer instead slap shots the 32yearold rob dimaio , was so happy about the trade , one of the first people he called was tim taylor from day 1 we just seemed to click , taylor said of dimaio , whom he centered in boston the last two seasons this season dimaio had 5 goals and 16 assists for 21 points in 50 games with the bruins his best season came in 199798 , when he scored 10 goals and had 17 assists for 27 points that was the same season taylor had his only 20goal season taylor has nine goals this season , but has not scored one in his last 19 games mike knuble had 9 goals and 5 assists for 14 points in 59 games since scoring two goals , including the gamewinner at pittsburgh on jan 25 , knuble has gone 21 games without a goal it s disappointing not to be able to see this whole thing out , what with the way we started the season and then fighting our way back into the playoff race , knuble said

immigrant workers , a huge but often voiceless group , were given a chance to speak up yesterday , and speak they did about abuses on the job , about mandatory 70hour weeks , about not being allowed to take bathroom breaks , about making just 2 an hour these workers were given their soapbox at an unusual forum sponsored by the aflcio , which is seeking to persuade millions of immigrant workers to join unions , though labor has long turned a cold shoulder to them the forum , at a union hall in lower manhattan , was the official kickoff of a nationwide effort by the aflcio to reach out to immigrant workers as labor leaders increasingly acknowledge their importance to the future of american unions immigrants are not only the history of the union movement , they are its future , its soul , its spirit , linda chavezthomson , the aflcio s secretary treasurer , told the 300 people at the forum we are on the side of working people everywhere , and that means we are on the side of immigrants the forum was part educational session , part revival meeting , part public relations vehicle , aimed at burnishing labor s image among immigrants the forum was held at the headquarters of local 32b32j of the service employees international union , a local that represents 55 , 000 building service workers from 54 countries many immigrants at the forum appeared happy to flock to the union banner herbert jeanbaptiste , an immigrant from haiti , complained that 90 percent of immigrants who work at nursing homes lack health insurance syed armughan , a limousine driver from pakistan , said that many drivers had to work 70hour weeks , received no health insurance or retirement benefits and earned less than 30 , 000 a year and zonia villanueva , a housekeeper from el salvador , complained that many employment agencies charged exorbitant fees and that many homeowners cheated their maids out of wages we are workers who contribute to the economy , ms villanueva said people depend on us to clean their houses and care for their children we have been in the country for many years and we pay taxes we want to stand up for our rights we want to live and work free from intimidation we only want the respect that every worker deserves the forum reflected a sharp change in organized labor s approach toward immigrants for decades , many unions and union members looked askance at newcomers , viewing them as interlopers stealing jobs and driving down wages but as the aflcio has focused increasingly on unionizing workers on the lowest rungs , like waiters , janitors and hotel maids , union leaders have recognized that they have to improve labor s image among immigrants explaining the reason for the forum , ms chavezthompson said , we want to bring a better understanding within the labor movement because there has been such strong opposition to immigrants yesterday s forum came six weeks after the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations reversed its longstanding policy and called for granting legal status to all illegal aliens and repealing laws that bar employers from hiring illegal immigrants in the mid1980 s , the labor movement , worried about high unemployment , backed legislation that made it illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrants there s been an amazing sea change in the aflcio s attitude toward immigrants , said kent wong , director of the labor studies center at the university of california in los angeles , who attended yesterday s forum in many ways , the forum was a stacked house , filled with union leaders and prounion immigrants who repeatedly talked about all that unions could do for immigrants not surprisingly , none of the immigrants invited to speak criticized the many union leaders who do a poor job fighting for workers or the many construction unions that long turned their backs on noneuropean immigrants the aflcio plans similar forums in atlanta \( april 29 \) , chicago \( may 6 \) and los angeles \( june 10 \) the purpose of these meetings , union officials said , is to listen to immigrants speak about their problems at work , while also spreading the word about how unions can help them immigrant after immigrant talked yesterday about how , just when a unionization drive was gathering steam , their employers called in immigration authorities to crack down on illegal immigrants that tactic , these workers said , often took the wind out of organizing drives john wilhelm , president of the hotel employees and restaurant employees union , spoke angrily of how immigration officials , acting on an employer s tip , arrested eight hotel maids who worked at a holiday inn in minneapolis the arrests came four days after the hotel s housekeepers voted to unionize , and all eight arrested were on the union s negotiating team joshua bernstein , a policy analyst at the national immigration law center , said this fear of arrest and deportation is bad for american workers because it adds a weapon to the arsenal businesses can use to undermine efforts to improve all of our working conditions
montauk , ny bang ! the fishing went off at montauk one recent afternoon overnight , the coast teemed with feeding fish blues , albacore and stripers my guide , as she had been for most of the summer , was amanda switzer of three mile harbor amanda is a born angler she has that sense that there will be fish here and not there , that a cast in the next second but not five seconds later will catch a fish , and that she may ease upon a school of feeding stripers if she cuts the engine now and glides toward shore i have been fishing much longer than she has i have fished many more places occasionally , i can cast farther still , time after time , so many times that i know it s not an accident , she has taken three fish to my one , four fish to my none we puttputted out of montauk harbor the sleepy summer port showed signs of energizing for the fall commercial fishermen in boats large and small made their way out of the harbor amanda waved to a friend who towed his rusty but reliable old trawler to the boatyard outside the jetty , two fishing boats , draggers' nets hanging from their sides , made their way from three mile harbor obviously , they had heard of the goings on at montauk as well we headed for the point the remnants of a tropical storm were bearing in from the south , and we hoped for a two or threehour window of fishing before the seas built too much for her flats skiff in the distance , we saw a few boats in the tidal rip that had formed past the lighthouse when we rounded the point , there was a flotilla of boats of all sizes extended as far as i could see a picket line of surfcasters ranged along the shore mobile homes crouched on the cliff tops like a row of pillboxes guarding the coast bunker , or perhaps snapper blues , leapt from the rip , desperate to escape predators amanda cut her engines she took up her rod she is a lefty who learned her flyfishing on saltwater , so her cast has none of the frantic to and fro that betrays trout fishermen who take up saltwater flyfishing after years on the stream a pod of albacore came up in back of us in unison , we wheeled and fired , like grouse hunters pointing and shooting at the sound of flushing birds amanda was quicker than i was she connected as the fish swirled with operatic enthusiasm i tried another cast but had no time to fish it out as amanda pointed her rod toward the front of the boat and , looking for all the world like a neophyte water skier holding on for dear life , she ran forward , around the bow and then back to the rear as the albie dashed for safety , and amanda tried to keep it from doubling over and breaking her rod the school of albacore , as is their habit , moved up and down the beach , returning every 15 minutes , a halfmile circuit we chased them for an hour good , but not amazing , amanda said let s head east and see what s happening we moved out at full throttle the warm southern wind felt soft the air shimmered with the frosted glass look that dekooning and his painter friends called long island light one of the last tshirt days , amanda added as we approached the cliffs just west of the point , we saw paul dixon , amanda s mentor , and the dean of east end flyrodding somehow he always knows where the fish are he gestured to us we looked ahead of him there in the rocks next to the shore the black forms of bass en masse churned the water surrounding them , large bluefish picked off bait that had escaped the mayhem of the stripers i cast into the school i was a little short a bluefish struck five minutes later all 8 pounds of him went into the cooler on the next pass , i took the helm and amanda picked up her rod bang ! a 34inch bass slammed her fly i backed us out , and she fought the fish to the boat we crept in on the school again , and again , and again every approach produced a good bass then other boats started to show up the only way to fish this small pod of big fish was for one boat to move in , hook up and back out it became a bit of a circle dance we waited back from the pack a huge school of large bass came up in back of us we circled and drifted into them and within two or three casts we were both into keeper fish we landed them amanda stood on the stern , spread her arms and cracked a grin as wide as a pie plate you can have a whole month of crummy fishing , and then this , she said we fished until we had our fill , and when we left the bass were still working that night , i panroasted the bass in a corn meal crust and topped it with a salad of diced tomato , watermelon , celery leaves and chili oil a cold riesling went down perfectly on this first perfect striper day of the season
beautiful wasps having sex by dori carter morrow , 24 if there were an award for attentiongetting titles , beautiful wasps having sex , with its picture of an elderly turnofthecentury jewish couple on the jacket , would probably win hands down but the story itself , which is meant to be one of those wicked satires of hollywood but is in fact more about being jewish in hollywood , is a bit puzzling dori carter is a former screenwriter who is married to chris carter , the creator of the xfiles , and her first novel is about 40yearold frankie jordan , a newly divorced and none too successful screenwriter the book s central conflict is between frankie and her eventual nemesis , a 24yearold aspiring producer named jonathan prince the primary story here is about frankie s attempts to get her screenplays made and the treacherous agents and producers who thwart her but carter s larger thesis is that hollywood is a kind of shtetl for the waspenvying jews who run the town , and in this book there s hardly a gentile in sight too many of the jewish characters , although most of them are under 45 , speak like jackie masonesque cartoon jews they frequently use the kind of yiddishisms you might expect from early vaudeville oy vay iz mir , she s cleaning again , says one character , a producer we 're all suffering from secondhand windex will you put that away \? the shvartzeh comes tomorrow she s a baleboosteh carter gives us a stunningly dreary portrait of jews in hollywood and she is even more scathing in her depiction of the families they left behind back east frankie confesses that she , like other jewish characters in the book , married her gentile husband to escape from the handwringing heaviness of it all to that , and to this book in general , even a gentile would say , oy vey dana kennedy
yoel judah walks slowly , talks fast it is a disarming contradiction , to watch the casual way he saunters into a room , usually a son or two in tow , and to hear his words tripping and tumbling over each other , his voice all low and lyrical judah ambled into gleason s gym in brooklyn recently to work out with his boxing star of a son , zabdiel judah they were dressed alike , stylish in designer tshirts and billowing jeans jumpy teenagers and former fighters shook zab s hand or slapped his back , but they huddled with yoel zab is the newly crowned juniorwelterweight champion of the international boxing federation , a 22yearold who will defend his title for the first time on saturday , but his father is the one with all the answers as zab busied himself with sparring , his father stood ringside , arms draped over the ropes yoel never took his eyes off his son in the ring , but he still managed to conduct three or four simultaneous conversations with those gathered around him occasionally , he barked encouragement good , there you go , yoel said back up ! go in ! good yoel is a seventhdegree black belt and a former worldchampion kick boxer , but more important , he is the undisputed ruler of team judah , a stable of seven fighting sons who range in age from 8 to 24 they call him abba , hebrew for father they , like many large families , are insular you see the fun and wish you could join but cannot yet there is something eerie about this family of fighters and its patriarch well , you know , i got an aura around me , yoel said after the workout the aura s name is order yoel judah s life has always been about order and violence and scratching out an identity within the two like the yinyang philosophy he loves so well , order and violence are his pendulum those forces govern every aspect of his life as well as the lives of his sons , whom he has reared almost singlehandedly yoel , who is in his early 40 s , once kept his distance as a father and lost the custody of his children he worked feverishly to reclaim them , though , and has since made them the center of his world he has full custody of all seven sons , although their mother still sees them occasionally yoel s is a world without question he gives the rules , and the boys follow the family is coiled in discipline , and yet it seems to thrive in the environment the boys idolize their father they are polite , diligent , soft spoken and eager to please none have been lost to the prison system or the streets of brooklyn and none expect anything less than to succeed zab knocked out jan bergman \( 383 \) in the fourth round on feb 12 to claim the ibf juniorwelterweight title at mohegan sun casino in uncasville , conn he will defend his title on saturday against jason rowland \( 211 \) in glasgow , on the mike tysonlou savarese undercard zab has 23 professional victories , 18 by knockout , and no losses , and boxing writers have long called him pernell whitaker with power zab s manager of four years , shelly finkel , said the differences between the two lefthanders are almost too subtle to detect i 've managed pernell for 17 years , finkel said , and the only difference is that zab s punch is better within new york boxing circles , he was considered championship material years ago i do n't get excited too much about any fighter , said joe guzman , a boxing historian , but zab judah is the best fighter out there , maybe with the exception of roy jones he is a kid who s going to make 50 million , and you see a fighter like that once every 10 years godliness and the crossbar yoel judah gave his sons biblical names ariel , daniel , zabdiel , joseph , josiah , michael and yoel jr zab s namesake is found in i chronicles 27 of the old testament , a soldier in charge of king david s first army division of 24 , 000 men the man s life is encapsulated in one sentence about his occupation and his ancestry he was a leader of an army , and his father was jashobeam , zab said it s deep in jewish genealogies , the story of the son always begins with the father it grounds him , explains him and it is the same with the judah family at 13 , yoel embraced a centuryold hybrid of christianity , judaism and black nationalism , and today he and his sons call themselves israelites , or black jews the movement is informal and varied , and some branches of the israelites have even been accepted by reform judaism the judahs do not belong to a formal congregation instead , they huddle in their east flatbush home in the evenings or on weekends to hear yoel tell them about the men of god king solomon is a favorite godliness means you got laws that govern you , and the laws are good , yoel said if you do n't fear god and you do n't have any guidance , i'm going to have to watch you because you might do anything you 're an outlaw i got a lot of friends like that , and now they 're in the crossbar hotel as a child , yoel craved the guidance of his father , james judah , but james , a decorated korean war veteran and club fighter , instilled in his son little beyond a reverence for selfdiscipline and an ability to fight james divorced yoel s mother , viola , when yoel was 12 , and after that he was gone
farmingdale the east northport eighth graders invited to preview the american airpower museum at republic field had all witnessed war before some had seen the movie battlefield earth others remember the persian gulf war from television but most , like 13yearold hassan nagvi , get their notions from video games this is like seeing the real things behind the games i play , hassan said as he crawled through the drab , cramped interior of a b17 flying fortress as maurice berger , a museum volunteer , guided the students through the collection of vintage military hardware , the visitors seemed impressed but not as dazzled as when sergeant berger , a former b17 gunner from queens and now a member of the 533rd living history squadron , showed them the shrapnel that was pried out of his back after one mission in 1994 they winced as they leaned forward to see the fragment that is the type of living history the museum offers the museum , which opened last week , has the east coast s biggest collection of world war iiera military aircraft in flying condition in addition to the boeing b17 , there is a grumman avenger of the kind made next door at bethpage , a north american b25 mitchell bomber , a vought f4u corsair , a curtiss p40 warhawk and a north american t6 texan but the crown jewel is the latest acquisition a republic p47 thunderbolt , an illustrious fighter plane returning to the place it was built the museum is the brainchild of jeff clyman , 54 , an aircraft enthusiast and ceo of avirex , a new york city clothing manufacturer after working on the concept for three years , he received a 250 , 000 grant from the state with volunteer help from local trade unions and the assistance of the long island jet center , which owns part of republic field and leased two hangars to the museum , mr clyman s dream is now a reality the museum will depend on admissions , corporate sponsorship of flights of the vintage planes , corporate grants and rents paid by movie and television companies for the vintage planes there are other flying museums of world war iiera aircraft the confederate air force in midland , tex , is the largest , and other collections exist in chino , calif kissimmee , fla , and elmira , ny but none has the connection to the past provided by republic field the p47 was purchased recently from a california collector although no price was disclosed , a museum spokesman said this p47 is one of only six that can still fly one long islander particularly pleased to welcome it was francis gabreski of dix hills , the nation s highestranking living flying ace the retired colonel shot down 28 german planes in a p47 , and added six and a half kills in the korean war aviation has been a part of long island from the beginning , and having that great workhorse , the p47 , return here is very important , the colonel said it is a wonderful and very important thing , showing history like this , flyable airplanes , exposing world war ii to the public it was the greatest war ever won by americans , in my book we need to perpetuate this history for the future people in my age bracket are n't going to be around much longer , so people who come to this museum can have the benefit of hearing from living historians one of them is josephine rachiele , 76 , of west babylon in 1943 , at age 20 , she came to republic for a mailroom job i wanted to do something for my country , she said she ended up getting a job as a riveter i used to sew , but i did n't know anything about riveting , she said my first day i was so shook up she built p47 s for 60 cents an hour , six days a week she worked at republic , in the hangar just north of where the museum has been set up , until the end of the war , then gave up her job to a returning veteran but 18 months later she returned , working at republic \( later fairchild republic \) until it closed in 1986 , building successive generations of planes f84 thunderjets of the early cold war , f105 thunderchiefs of the vietnam era and a10 thunderbolts , the warthogs of persian gulf war fame the p47 s are my favorite , she said nine thousand of the 15 , 683 p47 s were built in farmingdale i'm very excited seeing these planes again , she said women like ms rachiele are important to remember , said julia lauriablum , 40 , a guide from farmingdale who specializes in the women who were military workers , especially the women s air service pilots , or wasps there were 18 wasps who flew the p47 s from long island to new jersey , where they were sent off to battle , ms lauriablum said sometimes they ran eight shuttles a day they were civilians and had no benefits , not even death benefits the american airpower museum is opening just a few months before the cradle of aviation museum , which is to open at mitchel field in garden city next year both sides say there s no competition they 're a small museum focusing on world war ii with a halfdozen flyable world war ii planes , said josh stoff , curator of the cradle of aviation we cover the entire 20th century and beyond but farmingdale has something the cradle will not flyable planes demonstration flights are planned for republic field , and for a donation of 350 visitors will be able to sign up for flights on the planes that are big enough to carry passengers even on the ground , there is the sense of being there as one scrambles through the cramped b17 , smelling the grease and aviation fuel , touching the bruised frame and trying to imagine the fear enhanced by claustrophobia and freezing cold that a b17 crew must have felt on a highaltitude bombing mission over europe the students toured the briefing room , which was filled with authentic gear \( the silk scarf with a map of germany , intended for use by downed airmen trying to escape , was a favorite \) before he knew it , hassan was modeling the uniform of a world war ii pilot this place is pretty neat , said hassan , who would like to return you can almost feel what they went through as the p47 arrived at the dedication ceremony on wednesday , harry love fought back tears the retired major , from rosedale , queens , was a b17 bombardier who was shot down over germany in 1944 and was a prisoner of war for nine months those p47 s were our cover , our protection , he said this is the first one i 've seen in 50 years i have such a feeling of pride and exhilaration seeing these planes come back to life is like a reincarnation it s our freedom coming back photos francis gabreski , top left , with jeff clyman , museum president , and his p47

love me , love my cat was the theme of a big cat show last saturday at lake grove , organized by the paumanok cat fanciers it is not always easy to love our cats they scratch all the best furniture , none of the cheap stuff their various boxes , baskets , blankets , catnip mice and untouched scratching posts make the house look like a complete wreck they create safety hazards by lurking in doorways or or the stairs , by leaving their toys in unexpected places , and by careering through the house on wild chases to nowhere they waste valuable time by demanding that we play their silly games , and fit in with their obsessive routines one cat has to be picked up and carried around the house every morning the other has to play the mouseundertheblanket game on the bed last thing at night cats are famous for their attitude there s an old folk tale that god created the cat to teach adam the virtue of humility cats treat their tame people with such a breathtaking mixture of arrogance and condescension that the folk tale must be true people like ernest hemmingway , colette , albert schweitzer , and t s eliot could afford to let cats into their lives nervous and insecure types would be better advised to get a dog in spite of all this , cats are much more popular than dogs , by a ratio of three to one nobody has counted the number of cats on long island , but there may be as many as half a million of them within our own halfacre , we have four resident cats , and five or six occasional visitors suffolk county alone has 583 , 000 acres , so do the arithmetic wherever you look , there are cats scurrying suicidally across suburban streets , peeking out of store windows or taking naps in the sunniest spots the whole island is a cat show the paumanok cat show might therefore seem like a case of overkill but you go to these shows to see superior cats who would refuse to give our plainvanilla felines the time of day i paid my 7 and walked into an allurophobe s nightmare a hall full of 300 cats and kittens , of all breeds and no breed at all each cat lounged in a cage draped like a boudoir , where it reclined at its ease like an eastern prince or princess , gazing out with immense selfpossession at the crowds of mere people filing past cats in general hate to leave their homes but these aristocrats were here with a purpose like bathing beauties or olympic athletes , they had come to be admired and rewarded six judging rings were arranged around the hall , and the complex business of finding the most superior cats in each category was soon in full swing mysterious announcements boomed out number 135 is transferred to class 2055p number 147 is transferred to champion \( general applause \) all longhaired kittens to ring no 5 the process of judging was somewhat undignified each cat was paraded on a white table , turned upside down and examined , then shown a toy it was no worse than the average job interview , and most of them endured it with great calmness , relaxing into a boneless state of acceptance they were there to be worshipped at the end of the day , almost every cat would get a roseatte and a huge boost to its selfesteem the show was full of exotic cats , breeds that are seldom seen slinking through our backyard the curlyhaired cornish rex , the beautifully spotted egyptian maus and majestic maine coon cats , bigger than even the meanest of our local strays there are half a dozen glossy magazines about cats , and hundreds of books including henri le barbe s french for cats , with such useful phrases as here comes a fur ball \( 'voici une boule de poils \) , i want food in my bowl right now \( je veux qu'on remplisse mon bol immediatement \) the cat fanciers' association is a national club for folks who adore the little monsters , and the longrunning musical cats celebrates their many perversities a recent survey , published in modern maturity , showed that 36 percent of cats sleep on their owner s bed , and most of the others sleep wherever they like we treat cats so well because we know that they are superior beings cats enjoy the kind of life style we would all choose , if we were smart enough like other sensible animals , cats sleep 18 to 20 hours a day , and occupy their waking hours with food and entertainment human beings are well on the way to not sleeping at all , what with neighborly stereos that stop at 3 am and rush hours that start at 5 am we take pride in our superior intelligence , but is the cat curled up by the fire any dumber than its master , stuck in a snowstorm on the expressway \? intelligence is only measured by what we do with it and what most of us do is work our lives away to provide a comfortable home \( for the cat \) in our spare moments , if any , we watch television neil postman , a media critic , has theorized that television has rolled back the development of human intelligence by thousands of years the cat , meanwhile , finds the tv a warm place to sit , and his cunning brain is unclouded by it the secret appeal of cats is their obvious intellectual superiority as i walked around the cat show , i decided that we might as well close down the space program , and switch off the hubble telescope the search for intelligent life ends here drawing \( p c vey \)
half a heart by rosellen brown 402 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 24 rosellen brown likes to explore what happens when a family a perfectly nice family , with all the right values gets slammed by a meteor from its own past often in her novels it s children who embody the longhidden truths that shatter a family s protective sense of itself civil wars , published in 1984 , describes a couple of former civil rights activists wrestling with their aging principles who must open their home and lives to a newly orphaned niece and nephew , both imbued with their parents' racism in her 1992 best seller , before and after , a teenager kills his girlfriend and the crime exposes moral and psychic crevices in his family that none of its members have ever confronted typically , brown alternates points of view among different characters , suggesting that a sense of family is being rewoven even as contrasting voices underscore the isolation of the family s individual members her new novel , half a heart , unfolds along similar lines , with a longlost daughter showing up both to challenge and to recreate a family bond brown even returns to the volatile issues that prompted civil wars race and racism , integration and separatism , the 1960 s and the present both civil wars and half a heart are about conscience as much as anything else once we 've chosen decency , how do we keep choosing it when the definition seems to change with every decade \? but while civil wars places this discomforting debate at the center of a marriage , half a heart tucks it inside a woman s soul and lets it fester there for years miriam vener is a rebel who has lost track of her cause a wife and mother living in houston in the mid1980 s , she has a spacious house decorated in perfect taste her clothes are expensive and well cut , so is her hair she goes to the gym regularly once upon a time she had studied the necessary details for her masquerade costume , brown observes by now she was beyond having to think of them but nearly 20 years earlier , miriam was wearing jeans and an army jacket and leaving graduate school to teach at a black college in mississippi to her dismay , the students were bored and sullen , contemptuous of the white northerner trying to teach them american history falling in love with eljay reece , a brilliant black musician who was also a member of the faculty , renewed her faith in the whole effort but by the time she learned she was pregnant , eljay was already turning away from her , entranced by a new movement that preached black power and separatism when their baby , veronica , was 8 months old , he managed to wrest her from miriam , who left mississippi in a blur of guilt and grief that ultimately froze solid around her now veronica is 18 , and miriam at last decides to seek her out there s no fairytale quality to their reunion as the two size each other up at the door of the faded building in brooklyn where veronica lives with her father she calls herself ronnee now , and she s a smart , cynical teenager who grew up believing that her rich white mother walked out on her though she is as wary as ronnee , miriam is unwilling to admit that this longawaited moment will have any but joyful repercussions yet the first time she and ronnee meet a friend of miriam s , in the small new england town where she spends her summers , miriam finds to her horror that she does n't know what to say in a panic , she ends up introducing her daughter as just another holiday visitor half a heart has many of brown s stylistic trademarks , including the shifting viewpoints and detailed flashbacks that make her narratives multidimensional without bogging them down but there are also places where she seems more rushed , more given to contrivances than in previous books the first couple of chapters in particular feel tightly condensed , as if she were hurrying to set the stage before raising the curtain on the novel proper there s one of our first glimpses of miriam , for instance , entertaining at poolside but detached and lonely nobody but her husband knows her secret loss and torment her politics are repressed , too , for all she does now is write checks and attend charity functions other important bits of information are planted just as summarily , and much of it never quite convinces miriam s misery is just too overwhelming , her friends too bigoted , her ailing mother s brush with death which draws ronnee and miriam quickly back to houston too conveniently timed the mildmannered ophthalmologist we know as miriam s husband remains such a hazy figure that their marriage is incomprehensible only ronnee , who does n't make an entrance until the novel is well on its way , has complexities that are palpably rooted in character yet half a heart is genuinely powerful , partly because brown is a fine writer \( ronnee as a baby gave off warmth like a small thrumming motor \) and partly because the reunion at its core is about much more than a mother and a daughter forced to turn her back on her baby , miriam has also surrendered her convictions , the moral passions that sent her to mississippi in the first place the closest she 'll come to taking a public stand is an occasional outburst at a cocktail party reconciling with veronica means restoring what was once the best part of herself , however awkward the changes she will have to encompass but for ronnee , the moral politics are very different and call for even greater courage miriam symbolizes everything she has been raised to disdain accepting her mother seems horribly tantamount to accepting the most contemptible part of herself , as well as rejecting the father who loves her a press release for half a heart says the book was published just in time for mother s day a bit of timing that the story itself hardly seems to justify what brings miriam and ronnee together is n't love , hallmark style it s a longing for wholeness , for an integrity that neither woman knows until she sees the other s face pain , doubt and frustration will always be part of their relationship as brown makes clear , some of the losses incurred when you turn your back on the past can never be made up but by stripping most of the customary emotions from this motherdaughter bond , brown shines a light straight through to the heart of it in the end , she leaves us with a hint of sentiment that s all the more welcome for being hard won maybe a touch of mother s day is n't out of order after all

southampton , bermuda robert w pittman , the president of america online , caused a frisson at the conference here run by the magazine publishers of america when he announced that in the last five months , aol had sold 500 , 000 subscriptions to time inc magazines to an audience of magazine executives who privately spoke of their willingness to crawl on their naked bellies through the gobi desert for a dozen paid subscribers , the news came like a long frosty drink of evian relief magazine subscribers via the internet ! 500 , 000 of them ! manna from heaven ! was in sight but mr pittman s figures beg a compelling set of questions for the magazine industry especially as it scrambles for new ways to bolster circulation levels in the face of declining newsstand sales , an expected increase in periodical postal rates and the collapse of the sweepstakes houses , which alone has removed millions of potential subscribers from publishers' pockets among the questions are will subscriptions gained online be as reliable as those obtained through traditional methods \? is there a possible liability in the vogue on the internet for signing up socalled evergreen subscriptions \? those are are renewed automatically on credit cards unless consumers specifically ask for them to be stopped and as far as time inc s parent , time warner , and america online go , can the two prospective merger partners work together \? are each other s best interests if only as far as promoting time inc magazines like money , in style and sports illustrated is concerned economically compatible \? and , if they are , will competitors be crushed \? a closer look at mr pittman s 500 , 000 figure is revealing while it sounds large , many of the subscriptions are not yet paid for they were offered in popup boxes on america online some of the most valued commercial real estate on the aol sites on a freetrial basis that means consumers get several issues of a magazine sometimes months' worth with the option of canceling before they are even charged no one knows how many of those subscribers will pay up , much less keep coming back in other words , whether or not , in the jargon of the internet , they are sticky the internet tends to be a freewheeling world , where it is easier , more tempting and possibly just more fun to order something with the click of a mouse than by filling out a form and walking to the mailbox that may bring more subscribers , but it also brings fastfingered consumers who might experience something of an internetshopping hangover , and who might later change their minds more readily about what they ordered of mr pittman s number , jeremy koch , the senior vicepresident for consumer marketing at time inc , said this figure does not necessarily mean 500 , 000 subscriptions it means 500 , 000 gross starts of those gross starts , 95 percent were put on credit cards and 50 percent of those are the evergreen , also called negative option , subscriptions that is different from the usual arrangement in which magazine publishers contact their customers near the end of their subscription terms and beg them to renew the evergreens are increasingly being used for subscriptions collected on the web , executives at several companies said that kind of arrangement is already raising concerns in an area of the magazine industry that is highly sensitive to controversy two of the industry s most profitable longterm subscription campaigns , the sweepstakes run by american family publishers and publishers clearing house , have collapsed in the last year after their tactics finally angered consumers to the point that they prompted lawsuits by the attorneys general of several states \( at gruner jahr , for example , 25 million subscriptions came in for magazines off those socalled stampsheets last year , said the company s chief executive , daniel b brewster jr , at the conference , but only 200 , 000 this year next year , he said , he expects almost none \) mr koch also said that his division at time inc was specifically monitoring consumer reactions to evergreen subscriptions we are trying to be very careful about continuous service , he said we need to be very careful about doing all the things that remind them of the deal so that when their credit card is charged , they do not feel we are pulling a fast one mr koch said that aol s gathering of time inc subscriptions was is still just a test at its heart is whether aol will find it profitable to use such coveted commercial real estate for offers for magazine subscriptions , he said i think aol has in the spirit of this agreement thrown itself behind this effort , without worrying too much about the lost cost of other things they might be promoting , mr koch said so this is a sort of assessment stage we are in right now , where both sides need to look at whether what we are doing is good for the other party do we make more money by crosspromoting this way or is there an opportunity cost that is not good for the company \?
moscow , aug 9 russian law enforcement officials said today they had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed 7 and wounded 97 on tuesday evening but they said that so far none could be directly linked to the bombing in the heart of the russian capital in an unusual rebuke to mayor yuri m luzhkov of moscow , who was quick to attribute the bombing to chechens fighting for independence from russia , president vladimir v putin said today that it would be wrong to brand a whole people in the absence of proof of who was behind the bombing the police and prosecutors also said they had no evidence of chechen involvement mr putin s admonition reflected the political sensitivities of russian leaders who are trying to build a viable new government in chechnya , said aleksei y zudin , a political analyst the rush to judgment exemplified by mayor luzhkov s statements , he said , fed the worst suspicions of chechen civilians , who have suffered through two rebellions and two devastating invasions by the russian military since 1994 mr zudin said that blame for this affair cannot be generalized to all chechens , even if evidence gathered eventually points toward the rebellious republic , where rebel leaders have in recent weeks threatened to strike russian cities still , mr putin said russia would complete its military campaign in chechnya and finish off terrorists in their own den overnight , combined russian security forces said they had scoured 160 subway stations and underground passageways using bombsniffing dogs to ensure that the capital s public transit system was clear of explosives at the kazansky railway station here , the police reportedly found nearly nine pounds of tnt as well as seven detonators , which were not hooked up to the explosives this morning , muscovites were back underground as usual , with thousands of them passing through the reopened , though charred , passageways beneath pushkin square , where vendors picked through the debris in their shops of course we will go back to work here , said a woman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk and of course we are scared the low granite walls along the exits from the underground passageways had already become memorial altars , where friends , relatives and passersby laid carnations and lilies to express their sympathy for those who died russian television reported tonight that mr putin , too , had visited the square and laid flowers interior ministry officials said today that seven people had died , contradicting a news agency report on tuesday that said eight were killed police officials said they were working with three witnesses who saw two men bargaining at a leather goods shop in the tunnel and who dashed for an exit leaving behind a satchel , which exploded moments after the sales clerk summoned a security officer to inspect the bag mr putin , speaking at the kremlin , struck a note of calm resolution , admonishing russians that terrorism was an international illness for which the only cure was political will , the vigilance of the people and effective law enforcement terrorists , he said , count on bloodshed , sensation , panic and hysteria and he warned that disorganization and disorder would make the best possible gift for them

the jets , despite addressing some needs with their many picks in the national football league draft , did not make anyone forget the departed receiver keyshawn johnson but they may end up reminding a lot of people why the nfl has a character issue in the year in which the nfl stressed wariness of players with offthefield troubles its extensive predraft background checks showed one in five of the 323 drafteligible players had something that raised eyebrows among the league s security personnel the jets took three players with known records none of those players defensive end shaun ellis , and receivers laveranues coles and windrell hayes have anything in their pasts that compares to rae carruth or ray lewis , both of whom are facing murder charges but the jets , needing a successful draft to quash some of the dissonance over the johnson trade , chose to walk a tightrope with their future , hoping that these players have abandoned their troubled ways before they enter the pressurefilled , temptationladen and highly scrutinized world of a professional athlete in new york this is a bit of a departure for the jets , who in the past have shied away from drafting players with troubled backgrounds coach al groh insisted he was not concerned that there could be problems with these picks we have had a very active program for three years in security checks before the draft and while the players are here , groh said we did our research if we saw that as a potential problem , we would n't have done it the jets' draft , while tinged with risk , did fill some gaping hopes on the field they got two desperately needed passrushers in ellis and linebacker john abraham , both of whom are expected to contribute immediately they picked up tight end anthony becht , another glaring need , and got the bonus of nabbing , they hope , their franchise quarterback of the future in chad pennington in the later rounds , they picked up receivers who will get a shot to fill the slot left by johnson , but the trade of the secondround pick to san francisco precluded the jets from getting a higherrated receiver did they make up for the loss of johnson \? no the failure to get a wide receiver with four firstround picks was confounding , and as a result the jets figure to run the ball more than in recent years did they make the best of a bad situation \? once the chance to trade up for a receiver was lost , they used the picks they got for johnson , nos 13 and 27 , to get two players who will challenge for starting jobs right away and they shored up the pass rush but they also gave themselves the potential for future headaches ellis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge last july after being charged with felony assault for striking a woman in the head with a drinking glass he did community service and paid the woman s medical bills coles was thrown off the team at florida state after pleading guilty in october to a misdemeanor petty theft charge in relation to the same scam at a tallahassee , fla , department store in which peter warrick was involved coles was already on school probation for a variety of academic and legal troubles , including a battery incident in 1998 involving his stepmother according to a story in espn magazine , coles mushed the face of his father s exwife against a car window , he said , after the woman took a swing at coles s mother coles would not discuss that incident after he was drafted saturday , although groh implied that the extenuating circumstances involved made him confident the incident would not be repeated i think that laveranues understands that this is his last opportunity to use his football talents to create a far better life for himself than he otherwise would have , groh said sometimes if you have no strikes left , you protect the plate a little bit better than if you still had all three of them to take a swing at coles said he had learned something from the departmentstore scam it opens your eyes , he said it lets you know people are watching you and people are out to get you and people want to pull you down i do n't think i'm down to my last strike i'm just thankful that they gave me the opportunity usually when a guy gets dismissed , he s not allowed back in football anywhere hayes faced three felony counts in 1998 suspicion of writing bad checks for merchandise , conspiracy and burglary hayes said he met the people he got in trouble with during 1997 , when he sat out as a transfer student before joining the southern california football team he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fraudulent check cashing and received three years of probation , which he is still serving he was ordered to pay 8 , 500 in restitution hayes said he was asked by nearly every team at the combine about his record but the jets , he said , did not ask i got caught up hanging out with the wrong type of people , hayes said i got involved in writing checks to get some clothes , in insufficient funds it was a little scam an acquaintance of mine had started up and it sounded good at the time fortunately , i got caught early , so i did n't get in too much trouble to this day , i ca n't describe what made me go along with it i 've never done anything close to that before
hitler 193645 nemesis by ian kershaw illustrated 1 , 115 pp new york w w norton company 35 hitler was a crushing bore , the last person you would wish to meet , a dinner party guest from hell his breath stank , and his hobbyhorses the jewish conspiracy , the bolshevik threat , the german destiny , the treachery of almost everyone were trotted out at the slightest opportunity , interminably , madly , tediously true , he managed to charm the odd english socialite some of the mitford sisters found him an absolute sweetie but as the war dragged on , even his most loyal courtiers could hardly bear to have lunch with him then , of course , to be a bore is one of the perks of tyranny you have a captive audience the interesting thing about hitler , however , is not so much his own personality but the effect he had on others how was it possible for this uncouth austrian crank to turn so many people toward barbarism \? various explanations have been offered a nation of poets , romantics and opera lovers was seduced by hitler s demonic powers or perhaps the nation of poets and thinkers already harbored genocidal feelings toward the jews , and all hitler had to do was tap that well of poison there are also those , beyond the pale of respectable historiography , who believe that hitler was a relatively decent man who had no idea what savagery people got up to in his name ian kershaw , who has now completed the second and final volume of his superb biography , hitler 193645 nemesis , will have none of the above not all germans had genocide on the mind , and hitler was neither a genius nor an innocent , and certainly not decent like most historians , kershaw , the head of the department of history at the university of sheffield in england , believes that the condition of the german nation had much to do with hitler s rise the national sense of selfpity , after wartime defeat and economic catastrophe , could be whipped into a frenzy , and the erosion of organized religion could place spiritual yearnings where they did not belong , in leadership cults and the like as kershaw says , the rise from the depths of national degradation to the heights of national greatness seemed for so many \( as propaganda never ceased to trumpet \) to be a near miracle a work of redemption brought about by the unique genius of the fhrer if hitler had one outstanding talent , or perhaps one should say instinct , it was an unerring sense of other people s weaknesses their irrational fears , their vanities , their greed and their bloodlust he was sensitive to these things because he shared them to an extreme degree in the second half of the 1930 s , hitler gave most germans what they wanted victories abroad , a pumpedup economy , revenge on imaginary enemies and grand spectacles to celebrate the quasierotic ecstasy of belonging to a master race what he did on a large scale , he did for individuals too he gave his generals most of whom he never trusted , and often detested all the arms and men they wanted he offered the industrialists untold riches old comrades were loaded with titles , money and vast powers nightclub bouncers and beer hall bullies suddenly found themselves living in grand palaces , lording it over millions of people mediocre scholars , artists and intellectuals were treated as geniuses , while more gifted men and women were persecuted as racial inferiors and degenerates no wonder things looked good to most germans in 1936 , when the world came to berlin to party beneath the nazi banners at the olympic games that is , things looked good if you were able to look away from less agreeable aspects of the new regime and most germans looked away hitler , as kershaw describes him , had the perfect personality for the successful cult leader he was a malign guru , allowing his followers to project their fantasies onto him his asexual , aloof , hollow personality probably helped he lived vicariously through the crowd , soaking up its energy kershaw s brilliant account is a depressing book to read , not only because of what it tells us about hitler but also because of what it says about the masses who followed him the greasy opportunism of his generals and paladins is bad enough but there is something particularly revolting about the idea of 20 , 000 people crammed into berlin s sportpalast one night in 1938 bellowing fhrer command , we will follow ! after listening to hitler rant hysterically about the need to stop the czechs from exterminating germandom there has been a great deal of debate over the last decades about how much hitler knew of the holocaust revisionist historians like david irving argue that there was no systematic , planned genocide of jews , because there is no evidence that hitler ever ordered such a thing he believes that jews were haphazardly killed by ss zealots beyond the fhrer s control kershaw makes mincemeat of such theories , not by producing a document signed by hitler ordering the holocaust \( there was no such thing \) , but by showing that nothing inside the third reich was beyond his control if nazi murder squads ran amok in poland , russia and the ukraine , it was because hitler allowed them to he did n't have to know all the details others could work out the methods shooting , starving , gassing hitler s people knew their enterprise was blessed by him they murdered , and hitler said it was good
for nicholas pavia , a city councilman and mechanic in stamford , conn , the call to the priesthood was neither an urgent whisper nor a siren it was a tugging , always in the background , that stayed with him as one election followed another and it was a summons put off by earthly misgivings until , that is , mr pavia met the emissaries of edward m egan , the bishop of bridgeport , soon to become new york s archbishop i never felt empty , or anything like that , said mr pavia , a 40yearold who is to be ordained saturday in bridgeport but i felt i could be doing something more at a time when other dioceses throughout the nation are struggling through a shortage of priests , bishop egan has vigorously recruited men like mr pavia for the priesthood , ordaining a higher proportion of priests than any other diocese in the northeast the bishop s success weighed heavily in his being made head of the new york archdiocese , said one church official involved in the highly secretive selection process , a sign that the vatican considers the shortage one of the most serious problems facing the church in his first news conference after he was named archbishopelect this month , bishop egan boasted that his business card gave not only his own phone number , but also that of his diocese s recruitment director the bishop s accomplishment , it seems , lies in creating the structures that have allowed others to nurture aspiring priests though bridgeport s diocese is only onesixth the size of new york s , bishop egan opened a minor seminary soon after arriving there in 1988 , modeled on one that cardinal john o'connor established in the bronx , to embrace men considering the priesthood and to allow them a year to glimpse the life they would take on if they proceeded to a seminary with a program that could lead to ordination but the bishop also created a fulltime recruitment team , headed by the rev christopher walsh , whose stated purpose was to recruit aggressively for the priesthood they keep track of men who express an interest in becoming priests , following those who enter the seminary the bishop created , st john fisher in stamford , at every step of their preparation the diocese also adapts the seminarians' training to accommodate each candidate s interests and circumstances , and , like many other dioceses hard pressed for new priests , it readily accepts older men into the ranks of seminarians the lord is calling , but there s a lot of static out there , father walsh said my job is to reduce the static to create the environment where the call can be heard while bishop egan has aggressively courted men for the priesthood , he has not done so by softening or popularizing the church s stands , but rather by stressing the orthodox view of the clergy s role it remains to be seen how bishop egan s approach to training men for the priesthood will influence relations between the church and the new york archdiocese s 24 million roman catholics many of the priests bishop egan has ordained say his emphasis on restoring the traditions of the church was one of the reasons they chose to serve in bridgeport father walsh said that some of the seminarians seemed nostalgic for a church steeped in rituals they had imagined , but not known many of them are not into getting all excited about guitar masses and masses on the beach , father walsh said they 're , to be honest , more attracted to the tradition , to the liturgical tradition , to some of the devotions of the church , rosaries , novenas and eucharistic adoration in a sense , the generation that s coming up now have been deprived of that tradition they 're the children of the baby boomers who discarded much of that , father walsh added i do n't see it as an ideological fixation on the past , but as a longing for the tradition that they 've missed underscoring the priority he sets on building up the priesthood , bishop egan officially not new york s archbishop until his installation on june 19 ordained this year s graduates of st joseph s seminary at st patrick s cathedral on saturday the priests prostrated themselves on the cathedral s marble floor as the congregation prayed over them bishop egan closed his hands over theirs while the men swore lifelong respect and obedience to the archbishopelect and his successors but there were only five of them over the last year , considered an average one , more than a score of priests have died in the new york archdiocese and a declining enrollment of candidates for the priesthood at st joseph s suggests the number of new priests will slide even further in the next few years the problem is not limited to new york with fewer and fewer young men choosing a life of celibacy and sacrifice , many priests

foxboro , mass , june 27 the united states women have become accustomed to dramatic finishes but never before have they had to rely on something as obscure and unsatisfying as a coin toss but that is how it was determined tonight that the americans had won group play over brazil in the gold cup tournament after kristine lilly had a penalty kick saved in the 90th minute of a scoreless tie before 16 , 386 at foxboro stadium both teams had scored 19 goals and given up none in their two previous matches in roundrobin play , so after tonight s tie they resorted to a fourth tie breaker , the coin toss , which was implemented instead of the preferred resolution of overtime or penalty kicks sissi , the brazilian captain , called tails , but the coin came up heads , which means the americans won group play with a 201 record the united states will now likely face canada on saturday in the gold cup semifinals in louisville , ky , while brazil \( 201 \) will play china the final will be played here next monday the americans had an inviting chance to win in the 90th minute when brazil s formiga was called for a foul for undercutting julie foudy as she jumped for a brandi chastain pass in the penalty area and they were awarded a penalty kick lilly scored confidently in the upper left corner as the americans won the 1999 women s world cup on penalty kicks over china , but tonight she placed a soft shot to her right the shot lacked any pace and brazilian goalkeeper andreia made a diving save i did the thing you 're not supposed to do i changed my mind , lilly said that was a big mistake in this replay of the world cup semifinals , which the united states won , 20 , the americans dominated from the beginning , outshooting brazil by 188 , but could never score lilly , the world s most experienced international player , had several tempting chances in the 11th minute , she blocked a clearing pass by brazil s tania , chested the ball toward the goal and spun a shot that nicked the post at the end of the first half , her left footer from 19 yards was deflected by andreia off the crossbar brazil s best chance came in the 81st minute when forward katia , who scored seven goals in an earlier match against trinidad and tobago , got behind kate sobrero and launched a low line drive that goalkeeper siri mullinix deflected with a sliding save mullinix continued to play superbly in replacing the injured briana scurry , roaming frequently and aggressively it was odd that it did n't go into overtime or pk s , mullinix said overwhelmingly , that s what the american players would have preferred , to keep playing i 've never seen it , coach april heinrichs said of a cointoss resolution we 've always talked about what a disaster it is to decide a game like that when you invest so much emotionally and physically , you want to get the benefit of a win foudy , the american captain , said the tie felt like a loss she said she was not quite sure what was happening as she and sissi stood at midfield for the coin toss after the coin came up heads , and the americans advanced as group champions , foudy did not react at all , simply walking back to her teammates how can you celebrate a coin toss \? she said we 're happy with the way it turned out , but you want to win you do n't want a tie or a coin toss photo cindy parlow , right , taking down formiga of brazil in the first half formiga was taken away on a stretcher \( reuters \)
in the early 1840 s , as a whaling seaman not yet embarked on his prodigious literary career , herman melville read owen chase s narrative of the most extraordinary and distressing shipwreck of the whaleship essex later he wrote in his own copy of the narrative the reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea , close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect on me the surprising effect was to give melville the inspiration for the ending of mobydick , the sinking , or the stoving , of the pequod by the white whale in the fictionalized version there is only one survivor , ishmael in the case of the essex the 20man crew lived through the attack , but in the long , disastrous voyage that followed , 12 of them died , some cannibalized by their shipmates the sinking of the essex and the aftermath are brought viscerally to life in nathaniel philbrick s in the heart of the sea , which begins where mobydick ends the essex was absolutely crucial to melville s conception of the novel , mr philbrick said during a recent visit to new york from his home in nantucket , mass a book that we think of as such a discursive wandering into the imagination has a ballast of real fact that was very important to melville this could happen this did happen that s what my book is about almost every year there are new books dealing with aspects of melville , and adaptations of his work onstage , in films or on television melville is in the air , said mr philbrick , who has hit the crest of that wave his book is both a critical success and an international best seller for a time it was first on bestseller lists in london and dublin recognizing the increasing interest in melville , hershel parker , who is completing the second volume of his monumental biography of the author , attributed it partly to a general desire to be stirred , moved , exalted , ennobled by what we read , in particular by melville s mythic voyages the boom is not over by any means , he said only in recent years has melville entered the national consciousness beyond 'mobydick' led by books like in the heart of the sea , he added , we are ready to look at melville as a participant in one of the great american adventures the whaling industry in addition to in the heart of the sea , elizabeth hardwick s herman melville , an intense psychosexual analysis of the author s art in the penguin series of brief lives of famous people , and tim severin s personalized expedition , in search of moby dick the quest for the white whale , have recently been published rinde eckert s and god created great whales , a bold experimental musical starring mr eckert as a composer attempting to write an operatic version of mobydick , had a brief run at dance theater workshop in june and is scheduled to reopen next month off broadway for the show mr eckert has written and sings several songs that have the power of the novel in the works is melville s world , a book by andrew delbanco that will be an effort to see the world melville lived in through his eyes and his incredibly penetrating intelligence mr delbanco , an author and critic who has been teaching melville for more than 20 years , plans to deal in the book with the novelist s response to the civil war , industrialization , human sexuality and changes in race and religion in america the fascination with melville begins , of course , with mobydick in 1850 melville moved from manhattan to pittsfield , mass , where he bought a farm he named arrowhead two important things happened while he was there he met nathaniel hawthorne , who became his friend and mentor , and , looking out the window of his study toward the whalelike mount greylock , he completed mobydick and dedicated it to hawthorne when his masterwork was published in 1851 , melville was only 32 and already the author of five novels , beginning with typee and omoo , popular adventure stories based on his life at sea readers apparently had hoped for another typee and were not prepared for a daring metaphorical exploration of a man s obsession with good and evil and his monomaniacal act of vengeance the book was unappreciated and sold few copies , in contrast to hawthorne s scarlet letter , which was published the previous year melville immediately followed mobydick with the obdurate pierre or the ambiguities and became increasingly bitter at his lack of success he also felt abandoned when hawthorne moved from the berkshires to concord , mass during the last two decades of his life , melville worked as a clerk in the customs house in manhattan and gave up writing fiction , more or less becoming a reallife counterpart to the passive clerk he wrote about in bartleby the scrivener during this time he was writing his epic poem , clarel long after the author s death , mobydick was rediscovered and became the foundation of his career and of american literature itself acknowledging the book s neglect in the author s lifetime , the english critic james wood says melville wrote the novel that is every writer s dream of freedom it is as if he painted a patch of blue sky for the imprisoned
the republican party signaled a shift in attitude toward cities when it chose philadelphia for this week s national convention the party in recent years has used big urban centers as metaphors of moral decay and examples of faulty democratic stewardship but the choice of philadelphia revealed the gop s intent to abandon an antiurban rhetoric that had proved alienating to moderate suburban voters it also reflects a growing awareness among republicans like gov tom ridge of pennsylvania and gov christine todd whitman of new jersey that urban centers are crucial to state economies and must be recovered , even if the upfront costs are great in attempting to rebuild crucial city centers , mr ridge and mrs whitman have both moved beyond the traditional republican gospel that views local control as sacred and intervention from above as political heresy the need for strong , statelevel intervention has become especially apparent to governor ridge , who has been faced with some of the most stubborn redevelopment problems in the country not just in philadelphia , which is rebounding after 40 years of decline , but also in the neighboring city of chester , an industrial powerhouse in the 1950 s and 60 s that has gone largely untouched by the recovery and was until recently in danger of becoming a ghost town i grew up in chester during the boom years and went back to visit during this week s convention the city has begun to inch forward , with new roads , housing and infrastructure , but only after heavy , heavy lifting by the state government in harrisburg chester was the site of william penn s first landing in the new colony of pennsylvania in 1682 , and became a successful mill town soon afterward it boomed in the 1940 s , when the warstoked economy spawned steel mills , shipyards , textile mills and a range of heavy industries that made chester a magnet for the great migration of black people moving into the industrial north from the rural south chester s sun shipyard employed 40 , 000 people from around the region , in a city whose population totaled a mere 66 , 000 but the yard lost roughly 10 , 000 jobs per decade and then closed in the 1980 s , with catastrophic effect on chester and its surrounding municipalities skilled laborers fled as quickly as they could , leaving behind the poor , who turned in great numbers to the drug trade the decay was worsened by a corrupt and longlived republican machine that brought graft and administrative ineptitude to new lows the machine s founder was the legendary republican boss john j mcclure , a natty dresser in a vest and high buttoned shoes whose power in chester and surrounding delaware county rivaled boss richard daley s in chicago mcclure was a republican kingmaker who helped to choose pennsylvania governors and to whom even richard nixon paid homage as an aspiring president mcclure ruled , through patronage and punishment , from 1930 to his death in 1965 his successor was jack nacrelli , a tough machine politician who led chester as mayor from 1968 to 1979 , when he was convicted of racketeering he returned from jail to dominate the city into the 1980 s according to a 1991 report from the pennsylvania state crime commission , which investigated organized crime throughout the state , mr nacrelli exercised his most intensive patronage efforts through the school board , which quickly deteriorated the republican machine was impervious to state intervention into the 1990 s but faced with enormous decay , mounting crime and a corrupt school system that has consistently ranked at or near the bottom in the state , governor ridge has led state intervention on several fronts once chester was declared in distress , the state took over its fiscal affairs , including economic development , and has overseen everything from rebuilding city sewer systems to housing redevelopment to building new roads to actually buying a building for the police department and replacing its rundown cars public housing projects have been torn down and replaced with the first new housing built in the city in decades chester has seen the first glimmers of postindustrial business , with one new hightech park just opened and others on the drawing board the hollowedout school system poses the steepest challenge of all at the governor s instigation , the legislature has passed a radical new plan that allows the state to dissolve the school system if it wishes , replacing it with a charter system or any other system of its choosing results from the new legislation have yet to be seen but the system is coming under close fiscal scrutiny for the first time in at least 50 years the giant cranes over the longdead shipyard still stand rusting and unmanned , a testament to prosperity gone by but redevelopment plans are under way for the first time in memory and there are other encouraging signs of revival police cars that actually run , sewers that drain the streets , and street signs in vast stretches of the city that had none the irony of the moment is that the rebuilding effort in this city and others has fallen to republicans , who have historically shunned this kind of intervention , leaving fallen cities like chester to the mercy of the market
in a city exploding with ever more pedestrians who are digitally muttering over cell phones , a city department has given its blessing to 2 , 262 new public pay phones , more than 1 , 000 of them on the upper east side of manhattan but since many of the phones are to be housed in large booths providing space for advertising , some upper east side residents would just as rather disconnect people are very upset about this , said eva s moskowitz , the city council member who represents the area she said she has received more than 50 complaints about the issue i am very concerned , ms moskowitz said , citing constituents' concerns about the effect of phone kiosks on pedestrian traffic and neighborhood aesthetics the city maintains that it has an obligation to protect people s life and safety by providing phones in the street , said allan h dobrin , the commissioner of the department of information technology and telecommunications the commissioner said there was a need for street phones because only 50 percent of residents have cell phones , and because 20 percent of those in poorer neighborhoods do not even have regular telephones one million 911 calls were made from public pay phones last year , he said , adding that the phones are also used heavily by tourists but the department must consult those who live in the affected neighborhoods before pay phones can be installed , and the wednesday night meeting of community board 8 on east 67th street drew speeches from a dozen residents who opposed the plan there are already too many pay phones out there , said m barry schneider , the board s chairman the community is troubled by this rush to take away sidewalk space to have additional telephone booths every 50 feet does n't make any sense especially barricadeready are some residents of park avenue , like peter price , who described his neighborhood as a residential area where everyone is coming and going from their homes where they have two phones , and everyone is armed with a cellular mr price is chairman of the avenue association , a 2 , 000member nonprofit group not every east sider is antikiosk increasing the number of public phones would make life a little easier , said sanford teller , a publicrelations consultant who uses a cell phone and lives on york avenue the technology department forwards phone companies' applications to the community boards earlier this month , new requests were sent to manhattan community boards 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 in neighborhoods ranging from greenwich village to east harlem the boards , which do not have veto power but can lodge strong objections , must scrutinize the locations and return their comments to the department of the 1 , 062 pay phones proposed for the upper east side , 381 are in the area s six historic districts , and therefore must win approval from the city s landmarks preservation commission , but none of the applications have reached that step yet , said terri rosen deutsch , the commission s chief of staff it was not immediately clear if there is as high a concentration of new phones being proposed in other neighborhoods the application process is just one facet of the city s labyrinthine system of awarding street phone contracts , which has its roots in deregulation and attempts to improve service there are 32 , 500 street phones under the technology department s jurisdiction , according to the department , and thousands more in stores and buildings advocacy groups claim there may be 10 , 000 illegal pay phones street pay phones were originally derided as impractical and unpopular when they were introduced in 1959 , said mr dobrin , then called unreliable after the populace became accustomed to them neither verizon nor att has applied for new phone locations on the upper east side , but 11 other companies have , from telebeam telecommunications corporation to phone management enterprises under its prior name of bell atlantic , verizon was for years the city s curbside payphone provider , but dozens of independents paid merchants to place their phones on buildings payphone abuse ranging from overcharging to broken equipment prompted the city to establish a franchise system overseeing competition in 1996 that year , congressional reform permitted independent companies to bid for curbside locations the city s technology department set up rules that spell out telephones' permissible proximity to objects like buildings and fire hydrants about 95 companies have approval to operate pay phones many existing verizon pay phones do not have to comply with the siting regulations because older payphone locations were grandfathered in 1996 according to the technology department , the city receives 26 percent of the gross revenue from public payphone advertising , more than 215 million in the 2000 fiscal year some critics contend the city is promoting the pay phones to fill city coffers under the guise of putting in a needed public service , said kent barwick , president of the municipal art society every city agency seems hell bent on discovering new sources of revenue , but no one is looking at it in a comprehensive way , so what we 're getting is exploitation without protection many of the independents' new pay phones would be housed in booths that provide space for outdoor advertising , occupying a larger street footprint than some of the old curbside booths the independents need the advertising revenue to pay for the installation , said raymond mastroianni , chief executive of telebeam , which spends 15 , 000 for each new kiosk he said advertising would not be permitted in residential areas we can provide much more , and better , services , mr mastroianni said his company s stainlesssteel graffitiresistant kiosks will have 15inch touch screens and web phones that will enable customers to check email and print out maps and city information the city enforces generalized specifications for companies' new booths , which can be exceptionally large and clunky , as ms moskowitz , the councilwoman , put it a twophone booth is allowed to be enclosed on three sides to have a rainprotection overhang and to measure 7 and a half feet high , 7 feet wide and 3 feet deep photo some on the east side object to new phone kiosks that would carry advertising att owns this phone but has not applied

the polls tuning out the news journalists' coverage of the characters of the presidential contenders has had little effect on voters' perception of the characters of vice president al gore and gov george w bush , according to a study released yesterday the study s authors at the project for excellence in journalism , in washington , said that journalists' statements about a candidate s character that mr bush was inexperienced , for example , or that mr gore was prone to stretch the truth were usually accompanied with supporting evidence but that denials of such assertions were given short shrift the study examined a sampling of five months of election coverage in 17 news outlets , including network news broadcasts , sunday morning talk shows , cable news talk shows , national and regional newspapers and online publications the study compared the themes the journalists emphasized with voters' perceptions of the candidates , as measured in a separate survey of 1 , 204 potential voters conducted by the pew research center the comparison indicated that voters gave issues like mr bush s family connections or mr gore s fundraising tactics substantially different weight than journalists did the journalists' lens on what s being said by one candidate or others does n't affect the public , said amy mitchell , one of the study s authors but , the study noted , journalists offered no evidence for their statements or cited the work of other journalists about onequarter of the time that they made assertions about the candidates' characters the researchers found that coverage of mr bush tended to rely on his conduct of this campaign for evidence about his character , while coverage of mr gore tended to rely on his record in congress , the senate and the clinton administration felicity barringer the democrats gore 'mulling' over no 2 speculation may be swirling around vice president al gore s decision on a running mate , but mr gore was the picture of tranquillity yesterday as he sought to begin a vacation with his family on a private island off north carolina mr gore told reporters that he had pretty much finished his interview process for a running mate and was entering the mulling phase of his decision , but he gave no clue as to where that might take him and would not offer up any names i 've got the luxury of time to kind of sit and let things settle for a while , mr gore said i have not even preliminarily picked someone he said there were fewer than 10 people on his list of candidates and he said that none of them would visit

baltimore , nov 17 duckpin bowling is to the sinew of this city as h l mencken is to its sass which makes it all the sadder that alva brown , a 79yearold duckpin legend , has finally had to close southway lanes , long the playground of the old south baltimore working class , to make way for what she suspiciously terms those new york apartments , the things called lofts the nine luxurypriced lofts that will replace the 61yearold southway lanes are as foreign to mrs brown , the bowling alley s manager , as duckpins are to the younger gentrifiers now remaking the old neighborhood duckpins , a smaller , more difficult game than conventional tenpin bowling , was invented in this delightfully eccentric city 96 years ago , most authorities say , and it spread like the charleston or canasta as bluecollar recreation along the east coast the funny thing is the new people and they 're good people , you know , these yuppies they were coming in to find out about duckpins and having lots of fun , mrs brown said this week as she watched the last game crash and tumble at southway but they told me they 're too busy to make a commitment to joining our leagues , she said as silence overtook the lanes of the humble walkup recreation niche on south charles street it seems a pity the young professionals flooding into south baltimore will not have the chance to commit to southway for the newcomers' respect for urban authenticity is quite evident as they strip away the neighborhood s signature formstone insulation the laboring class s postwar touch of home improvement to get back to the original redbrick fronts on the classic row houses that are being snapped up and there is nothing more authentically baltimorean than duckpins at southway , an unpretentious , soothing place where babe ruth was photographed bowling a game as he sported a big cigar and a white golf gap duckpins is said to have started when baltimore baseball players john j mcgraw and wilbert robinson , according to some versions of the story wanted to relax with a less risky strain on their throwing arms than the heavier ball of the tenpins game presented they had a local carpenter make a roughly halfscale version of the larger pins and a smaller ball duckpin leagues , shrinking but still avid , endure here in the more authentic precincts on federal hill , a fancy name for south baltimore \( which

duckpins on the altar god s grace was present with us each time we bowled , a congregant insisted duckpins offers none of the aerobic leap at immortality that modern exercisers seem to crave it is more the staff of life for bluecollar natives like mrs brown she will tell you she not only knew toots barger , the intimidating queen of the duckpins , but she beat her fair and square in memorable games at southway when miss alva first rocketed to stardom before packed galleries at the game s height 35 years ago , mrs brown was enshrined in the duckpin hall of fame in washington the sport spread along the coast but not much west of the mississippi baltimore was the hub , with more than 1 , 100 lanes in 50 centers across the metropolitan area 40 years ago now only one in four survive without southway , the city s heart has but 2 centers and 24 lanes left , said jim mokhiber , a public television producer who is working with his film partner , rick young , on a documentary , this is duckpins country southway is a kind of metaphor for the changing city , said mr mokhiber , who has been tracking such bluecollar descendants as alva s misfits , the southway women s traveling team , which bowls on some of the 300 lanes still left in the suburbs oh , they 're my girls and they 'll still be bowling and picking me up every monday so i can keep score and kind of coach them , said mrs brown , of her future in duckpins mrs brown is the peerless matriarch of the old south baltimore , says gilda johnson , a local civic leader who first bowled at southway as a little girl ms johnson has begun a spare southway drive to raise enough money , about 50 , 000 , to dismantle and store the 23 hardwood maple lanes in the hope that southway might somehow , someday roll again so sweet and innocent , said ms johnson , referring at once to the game and miss alva , who was national women s champion for two years she had to quit bowling six years ago when arthritis closed in one of her eyes has turned sightless , but they both gleam sparkling blue when alva brown talks of all the action life offered in managing southway for the past 42 years now , min weisenborn was something , mrs brown recalled , demonstrating the form of a dearly departed old rival she stands out there , tossing the ball way up in the air first , then stretching it far back like this and zooming it down me , i just picked the ball up , took four steps , and there it went down the lane mrs brown s son , rand , the southway mechanic who kept the pinsetters tuned up , watched her in the closing hours mom s keeping a certain amount of sadness hidden , but her girls keep her young at heart , he said of the misfits the last game was bowled by mr brown and charles davis , a 19yearold duckpin prodigy tutored at southway since he was in kindergarten as long as you try your best , the pins will do the rest , mr davis told mrs brown , quoting back one of her lessons by way of farewell a bowler from the game s heyday , 90yearold john bolander , composed a duckpin eulogy for the church service along the lines of casey at the bat heartstruck , he pronounced oh , somewhere the sun is shining and the

' i'm like , 'oh yeah , that 'd be awesome' so he went out and did it it was n't any of my doing it was all billy beane s doing the athletics are basically all billy beane s doing a challenger for the american league west championship and the leader in the al wildcard race , the athletics are in chicago this weekend playing the team with the league s best record , then come to new york for a threegame series with the yankees that will end the most rigorous segment of their 2000 schedule the athletics will have played 10 successive series , a total of 30 games , against teams with winning records , and they will have lived to tell about it after splitting the first two games with the white sox , they have a 1510 record in those games , having increased their wildcard lead from one and a half games to three and a half , and sliced their distance from seattle from three games to two their position is somewhat remarkable considering that , in this age of payroll disparity , they have one of the five smallest payrolls in the major leagues among the lowestpaid players on that payroll are mark mulder and barry zito , rookie starting pitchers who epitomize the idea that the athletics are all billy beane s doing mulder and zito , neither of whom began the season with oakland , are pitching in only their second seasons professionally mulder turned 23 yesterday zito is 22 both lefthanders , they will start in the series against the yankees we knew we had a covey of position players who were already here or would be here in the next year or two , beane said , explaining the presence of the young pitchers when we went into the mulder and zito drafts , we tried to find the most polished pitchers so they could be part of this we passed on some pitchers who maybe had a higher upside but might not be ready as quickly we needed to get pitching prospects here quickly to mesh with the good young position players the athletics made mulder the second player chosen in the 1998 draft zito was the ninth the next year mulder became a member of the oakland rotation april 18 and responded with a 52 record in his first 13 starts he has since slumped , going 15 in his next seven starts zito is a more recent addition , pitching his first major league game july 22 and gaining a 10 record and 237 earned run average in three starts the rotation has another young pitcher , slightly more experienced than mulder and zito tim hudson , 25 , is the team s no 1 starter in his fourth professional season , his second in the majors he is scheduled to pitch against the white sox today with his 123 record the young position players beane referred to are abundant , whether or not jason giambi , at 29 with a 321 average , 27 home runs and 95 runs batted in , qualifies shortstop miguel tejada is 24 , third baseman eric chavez is 22 , catcher ramon hernandez isi 24 , left fielder ben grieve is 24 and center fielder terrence long is 24 beane himself is 38 , a former major league outfielder , whose wisdom was well ahead of his playing talent he sort of retired as a player on spot , sandy alderson recalled , when he found out the advance scouting position was open he applied for the job and did a great job in that capacity alderson was the athletics' general manager when beane played for them in 1989 , the last season of his decidedly unspectacular career starting in the mets' organization , beane produced a 219 average in 148 games and 301 atbats over six seasons he has already accomplished more as a general manager , which he became in october 1997 , after alderson groomed him for the job there was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the game , an excitement for the game that translated into a great deal of energy and tremendous work ethic , said alderson , now the top baseball operations executive in the commissioner s office he just ate and slept the game beyond the enthusiasm , he s as intelligent as anyone i 've ever met in the game he grasped concepts and really was receptive to new ideas and different approaches to the game one approach that beane has learned well is how to construct a team with a payroll less than a third of the yankees' pay sheet the athletics have not won anything yet , but the real test for beane will come if they do reach the playoffs for a couple of seasons and the good young players remain good those players will also accrue major league service time and will reach the point in their careers when they can become free agents but the owners , not beane , will determine the type of contracts the players are offered beane , meanwhile , will continue searching for good young players and making judicious trades , such as the two deals he made with the mets last july that brought long to the athletics to play center field and jason isringhausen to be their closer
the voice on the phone message was polite , calm , reasoned he did not give a name it is always better to know who s doing the talking but because the caller made sense and his observations are so revealing of how many new yorkers must feel right now , his words seemed worth sharing he was responding to a column that ran on saturday about the jury s decision to acquit the four officers accused of murdering amadou diallo that column did not quarrel with the verdict , but reflected considerable sadness that an innocent man was dead and that there really was no way to hold anyone accountable the caller took issue not with what the column said , but with what it did not say i think it would be nice if occasionally you could acknowledge the fact that police officers are people , that we ask them to go on the streets every day to risk their lives and these were young men who did n't become police officers because they wanted to go out and shoot and kill people they wanted to protect people like you and me and they were asked to make a splitsecond decision and maybe it would be nice if you include the statistic that new york city cops shoot less than any other police departments in the country , and that one of the highest is the dc police department , which is made up mostly of blacks shooting other blacks and that s statistically true and it would also be nice if you would also mention achh , 40 , 000 cops ! you stereotype 40 , 000 cops you do n't even acknowledge them as human beings it s infuriating everything he said was true every aspect of this terrible case is infuriating the jury was convinced that the four officers sean carroll , edward mcmellon , kenneth boss and richard murphy made mistakes , however tragic how to explain that someone who did nothing wrong dies in a hail of 41 bullets and nobody is considered responsible \? amadou have a right to live , mr diallo s father , saikou diallo , said at yesterday s demonstration near the united nations at least 1 , 000 people stood in a chilly afternoon mist to protest some of the women wore black veils the crowd waved wallets demonstrators held signs that read jim crow justice representative charles b rangel , the democrat from harlem , accused the officers of racial profiling you know and i know that if amadou was white in a white neighborhood , he would n't have been shot down , he said hearing themselves accused of racism was a phalanx of police officers , restrained in their conduct , their faces implacable what were they thinking \? few were willing to say anything , even when guaranteed anonymity officers on duty do not have opinions , they explained a handful took a chance this has nothing to do with race , said one a colleague nodded this was a tragic occurrence a tragedy another said i took this job not thinking it would be like this it s disheartening a fourth made the same point as the man on the phone it s almost like being stereotyped , you know \? the stereotyping goes every which way those four officers saw a black man in a dangerous neighborhood surely they judged him by his color , at least in part we all judge people by their color or their uniform not by their individual humanity mr rangel is absolutely right does anyone believe that a white man in , say , bensonhurst , standing in the vestibule of his own building , would have been shot dead by four white police officers \? but can the police ignore color when so many crimes are committed by black males most often against other minorities \? statistics show , for instance , that black males between 14 and 24 make up 11 percent of the country s population but commit more than 28 percent of the homicides most police professionals , black and white , say that racial profiling is part of the job , that it reflects statistical realities , not racism but an innocent man is dead the problem is that everyone is looking for answers when there really are none critics are now hoping for a civil rights prosecution that s considered unlikely , but even if there is a federal trial , nothing will reverse what happened and it will probably happen again maybe the closest we come to a solution is knowing why mr diallo died between the anger of protesters seeking some kind of redress and the concerns of the caller , perhaps there is a way at least to understand
in a legal document filed yesterday , microsoft argued that the government s antitrust case is completely unsuitable for direct appeal to the supreme court because it is complex and because the trial judge made serious and substantive procedural errors microsoft wants its appeal to go first to the federal appeals court in washington , which ruled in favor of the company in a related case the company s argument , filed with the supreme court , rests heavily on a scathing attack on the work of judge thomas penfield jackson , who heard the lawsuit in federal district court the microsoft document , citing interviews judge jackson granted to new organizations , including the new york times , stated , the district court s blunt comments to the press raise serious questions about its impartiality microsoft also questioned the evenhandedness of judge jackson s decisions in general first , the company asserted , the judge improperly allowed the justice department and 19 states suing the company to broaden their case then , after allowing the additional evidence , judge jackson assured the company that his findings would be based on the more limited , original complaint , according to the microsoft filing those assurances , the company stated , the district court would later repudiate judge jackson ruled earlier this year that microsoft was a monopolist that had repeatedly violated antitrust laws , and he ordered that the company be split in two an order he later shelved pending appeals if the case goes straight to the supreme court , it could be resolved in a year if it goes first to the appeals court , the resolution might take up to two years the government is seeking to have the supreme court hear the appeal directly and sidestep a review by a federal appeals court direct appeals to the court are permitted in major antitrust cases brought by the government four of the nine justices must vote in favor for the case to go directly from the district court in its filing , microsoft is trying to persuade the court that the appeal will involve a thicket of technical issues , procedural challenges and disputed facts sorting out these matters , microsoft says , will involve poring over the voluminous written record of the lengthy trial precisely the kind of winnowing usually left to an appeals court the justice department had no comment yesterday , other than a brief statement saying that the government will respond in its filing still , there is little mystery about what the government s theme will probably be when it files its brief with the court on aug 15 first , according to legal experts , the government will say that the factual findings are clear and that the issues for appeal are a couple of big legal questions precisely the kind of major judgments of law that the court so often reserves for itself the big legal issues , they say , are whether microsoft s bundling of its internet browser with its industrystandard windows operating system was an illegal tying of two products and whether microsoft s dealings with other companies was indeed monopolizing conduct , in legal parlance judge jackson ruled that microsoft s bundling move and its behavior did violate antitrust laws , and microsoft is appealing his ruling the government is also expected to make a forceful policy argument for the expedited appeal , given the importance of computer industry to the economy the government will say that microsoft s monopoly is imposing a significant social cost while this case is on appeal and no remedies are in place , said herbert hovenkamp , a professor at the university of iowa law school it will say that not taking the case is a costly act , and that this is exactly the kind of case that was meant to go directly to the supreme court in its 30page filing , microsoft stated that the case went badly awry from the outset , referring to judge jackson s decision to permit the government to add additional evidence after the suit was filed in may 1998 that move , microsoft said , allowed the justice department and states to transform their case beyond recognition in doing so , microsoft declared that the judge committed an array of serious and substantive procedural errors these errors , microsoft said , included giving the company too little time for discovery and preparation of its defense to the expanding array of evidence much of the evidence in the case , microsoft contends , should have been tossed aside as not being suitable for admission in court the district court , microsoft stated , largely suspended application of the federal rules of evidence , admitting numerous newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay judge jackson , legal analysts say , did allow a wide range of written evidence in the case but he gave that leeway to both sides , they said , noting that microsoft submitted many newspaper articles , even press releases , as evidence and the government maintained that the additional evidence presented after the complaint was filed was part of the pattern of anticompetitive practices microsoft used to stifle competition thus , the government said , the additional evidence involving companies like intel and apple was not an expansion of the original complaint , but merely further examples that fit the same pattern of behavior judge jackson agreed with the government in its filing , microsoft suggested that in its appeal , the company will seek to make sure that it no longer appears before judge jackson it said his comments to the press should be considered grounds for a reversal or , at least , the basis for having the case sent to another district court judge if his remedy order is remanded for hearings , which is a possibility judge jackson has explained that he spoke to the press because , given the importance and prominence of the microsoft case , he thought that there was a public interest to be served by speaking to the press about his reasoning none of the press articles were published until after he had issued his final order in june but he did give interviews beforehand with the new york times , which microsoft cited in the filing stephen gillers , a professor at the new york university law school who specializes in legal ethics , noted that the code of conduct for the federal judiciary states that a judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action the judge s comments to the press , mr gillers said , could well give microsoft a basis for avoiding judge jackson s court in the future he termed microsoft s assault on judge jackson s work uncommon but understandable the bridges between microsoft and judge jackson have been burned , mr gillers said microsoft has nothing to lose
austin , tex , june 2 eleven years ago , when a plane carrying representative mickey leland of texas on a hunger relief mission crashed in ethiopia , rodney ellis , a young democratic councilman in houston , was grief stricken and shaken mr ellis had not only lost his mentor , but he was also supposed to have been on that plane and had even fumed at mr leland for bumping him from the trip urged by mr leland s widow to run for his seat in congress , mr ellis gave it some thought before deciding instead to seek the state senate seat that mr leland had once held in the decade since then , mr ellis has become perhaps the leading political force behind the decidedly unpopular efforts in texas to slow the state s speedy executions and erase what he said were the inequities that often keep black , hispanic and indigent defendants from a fair trial it might seem an unusual role for a man who like almost every influential texas politician supports the death penalty but mr ellis s deep reservations about the system , and his occasional clashes with gov george w bush , earned him the spotlight this week with mr bush campaigning in california and lt gov rick perry , a republican , in europe , mr ellis , as the senate president pro tem , became the acting governor and was left to decide whether to grant a reprieve for convicted murderer ricky mcginn mr bush announced on thursday in sacramento that he had recommended a 30day reprieve , which mr ellis had accepted but actually , mr ellis had mostly made up his mind five days earlier , having conferred with his staff and read an order by a state judge imploring an appeals court to postpone the execution to allow dna tests that defense lawyers said might exonerate mr mcginn of raping his 12yearold stepdaughter mr mcginn was convicted of murdering the girl , but prosecutors could not have asked for a death sentence without also getting the rape conviction the case kept him awake until 3 am monday night , mr ellis said , thinking , what if i disagree with governor bush \? how would we resolve that \? his wife told him to call mr bush s aides first thing on tuesday , which he did , so mr bush would have the chance to return to texas to make sure the execution was carried out but to his surprise , mr ellis said , mr bush s aides said they were already seriously considering a reprieve for mr ellis , mr mcginn s case highlights only some of the problems with the state s criminal justice system mr ellis , 46 , said it was outrageous that there was no legal process in place allowing the new dna tests to be conducted , as the state s highest criminal appeals court , without explanation , refused to postpone the execution in the legislature , mr ellis has advocated banning executions of the mentally retarded , giving juries the option of sentencing murderers to life without parole , thus making it easier for jurors to forgo the death penalty , and putting control of courtappointed lawyers in the hands of county governments and not the local judges who , he said , often favor lawyers who speed cases along instead of fighting toothandnail for their client that last proposal was vetoed by mr bush because , mr ellis said , judges worried that it took away a piece of their patronage mr bush said that power should be left to judges because they were better qualified to select lawyers for defendants who needed them texas courts , mr ellis said , are essentially a system of judicial apartheid our focus tends to be on the law and order , lock them up , throw away of the key stuff , and a refusal to look at the inequities of the system , he said part of the problem is that our governor and a number of my conservative colleagues somehow have the view that if you show compassion , you can be perceived as weak mr bush , for his part , maintains that all 131 inmates executed while he has been governor were unquestionably guilty of murder and had had appropriate access to the courts and few legislators share mr ellis s view people commit crimes because of bad values , not because of their race or status , said state senator david sibley , a waco republican and bush ally though mr ellis may not be in sympathy with legislative leaders on some things , he has still been effective on many issues , including indigent health care and voter registration he has earned a place among the elite of the state senate , a institution where , texas monthly magazine once said , toughness is good , shrillness and criticism are not , and humor is essential he knows how to put together coalitions , mr sibley said , before adding i do n't think he s one that says half a loaf is better than none he says , 'i 'll take half a loaf now , and come back for the rest later' mr sibley and mr ellis have already discussed legislation that would make it easier for prisoners to obtain posttrial dna testing that might prove exculpatory without commenting on specifics , mr sibley said such legislation might stand a chance of passage mr ellis already has some specifics in mind giving inmates the right to get dna testing of evidence from their case , requiring that biological evidence be preserved , setting up a commission to review and investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions , and providing more compensation to people wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated mr ellis , the son of a yardman , grew up in houston , attended texas southern university , and earned a law degree and master s in public affairs at the university of texas after serving as mr leland s chief of staff , he was elected to the houston city council at the age of 29 he now works in the houston office of a new orleans law firm , and is married with three children with mr bush and mr perry both expected to travel out of state at times later this year , the final approval for executions could fall to mr ellis again one inmate scheduled to die soon , gary graham , has drawn a lot support from those who insist he is innocent what would mr ellis do if that case were left up to him \? not sure yet , he said , but if i were a guessing man , i would guess the governor or lieutenant governor will be in town photo with the governor and lieutenant governor out of state , rodney ellis , the president pro tem of the texas senate , played a crucial role this week in deciding whether a death row inmate should be granted a reprieve \( matthew sturtevant for the new york times \)
car camping the book of desert adventures by mark sundeen illustrated by erik r bluhm 237 pp new york quill harpercollins publishers paper , 13 mark sundeen s first book could provide a valuable service for young slackers in fact , for anyone who s overly fond of kerouac s on the road and toying with the idea of taking off on an aimless crosscountry drive , car camping might well be the perfect antidote there is little adventure and little romance in sundeen s desert adventures , and the scenery he describes best in these wideopen spaces consists largely of trailer parks , junkyards , campgrounds and recreational areas here there are no largerthanlife characters , no sinnersaints or inspired madmen just listless , marginal dreamers , scavengers who seem to have become deluded by some longforgotten notion of the desert , only to find themselves eking out a hardscrabble existence among the detritus of those who 've been this way before if you do n't have enough money to buy whatever you want , it s hard to prove that you are yourself , explains sundeen s narrator \( who , we are informed , is an only slightly fictionalized version of the author \) and if you do n't get money from your parents or a trust fund then you have to get a job , and then everyone can see you 're not really yourself but some conformist instead this is not jack kerouac or hunter thompson or charles starkweather , for that matter sundeen s road warrior is decidedly unenthusiastic about the landscape , commenting with ironic detachment on what he sees through the windshield and reacting to events with an eerie , somewhat offputting submissiveness he falls in and out of love as if failure were preordained , diffidently reporting on his encounters with september , a young kleptomaniac to him , even sex is another fraudulent roadside attraction when the girl throws him over for his friend beach , the narrator is barely able to summon the energy for bitterness sundeen s dry , juiceless cynicism can sometimes be very funny a lot of people from big cities are moving into spiritual towns like sedona and telluride where they can be themself and get in touch with the earth a good spiritual town should have some indians within 100 miles and good skiing or mountain biking within 10 the stores should sell turquoise bracelets and cappuccino , and there has to be a place to hook up a modem usually , though , the irony is laid on too thick and far too relentlessly collected from a series of articles written for great god pan , a literary magazine sundeen helped found , the chapters in car camping have been cobbled together fairly well , gaining an unsettling if ultimately unsatisfying cumulative weight in what passes for the book s plot , three young men two parttime house painters and a guitarist with a failing marriage decide to head out into the desert on an illconceived road trip but their plans evaporate as quickly as the narrative pausing between mishaps and detours , the narrator gives us a little history here and there , none of it terribly compelling in his eyes , the waste , cruelty and stupidity of the past blend seamlessly into the present , a vapid continuum of goofballs , eccentrics and scroungers the prose comes truly alive only when sundeen is describing the technical satisfactions of house painting , ditch digging and pipe repair leisure time is dead time our hero always seems unsure about where to go , what to do or why his friends are n't really such good friends , and he hangs out with them mainly because they happen to turn up as the book progresses , some enthusiasm does creep into the flat expanses between paragraph breaks an account of a few hours spent racing around in powerboats makes exhilarating reading after so much lifelessness and the end of beach s relationship with september is nicely drawn but the narrator s tone is so detached , and the characters around him so unlikable , that the reader is content simply to let this driver and his passengers disappear over the horizon
prosecutors investigating allegations of collusion and price fixing by the world s largest auction houses , sotheby s and christie s , have gone to federal district court in manhattan to prevent lawyers for hundreds of angry buyers and sellers from formally interviewing people who may figure in the investigation in a letter to judge lewis a kaplan dated july 17 , federal prosecutors asked permission to file a motion to forbid lawyers in the civil case against the two auction houses to take depositions from christopher m davidge , christie s former chief executive , who resigned last dec 24 further , they will move to stop the lawyers from deposing anyone else who may be connected to their investigation until a criminal grand jury finishes its work if the motion is approved , the prospect for a quick settlement in the multimilliondollar civil cases will greatly diminish such a stay is necessary to prevent prejudice to the ongoing investigation and any subsequent prosecution , the letter said neither john l greene , the government s chief antitrust prosecutor , nor judge kaplan returned repeated phone calls seeking comment about the letter on tuesday , the day after the letter was sent , documents that christie s turned over to the government in december in exchange for government leniency were delivered to boise , schiller flexner , the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs in the classaction lawsuit , and lawyers for a alfred taubman , sotheby s former chairman , and for diana d brooks , sotheby s former chief executive judge kaplan had ordered the government to hand over the documents both mr taubman and ms brooks resigned on feb 21 as the investigation heated up the documents , which are said to number 153 pages , were given to top christie s officials by mr davidge before his departure they are said to support allegations of collusion and pricefixing by the two auction giants the documents were given to the lawyers on condition that they remain confidential , and none of the lawyers would comment on them they are said to include memos from mr davidge to sir anthony tennant , christie s former chairman , regarding secret meetings he had with mrs brooks to discuss setting commissions the documents are also said to include notes from sir anthony to mr davidge about meetings he had with mr taubman and records of discussions about new forms of financing offered to sellers by the two companies starting in about 1993
sydney , australia , sept 18 ricardo juarez , one of six american boxers to convincingly win his opening fight in the olympic boxing tournament , has a catch phrase for how the united states team prepared in the last two months train high , live low with half the team yet to fight , no american has had a close bout and each has looked stronger as his fight went on their success , they say , is attributed to two months of intensive highaltitude training at the olympic training center in colorado springs you work hard together , you eat together , you go back to your rooms , jeff lacy , the middleweight who stopped the brazilian cleiton conceicao , said today after two punishing rounds it was tough and demanding it was no summer camp with the new olympic boxing format of four twominute rounds in mind , tom mustin , the united states coach , took advantage of the colorado altitude besides the usual sparring and workouts , mustin had each boxer run a 600meter loop four times with little break between the runs they had to run the 600 meters , in altitude , in two minutes the length of a round , mustin said today everything was geared to the four rounds of a bout the boxers also consulted a sports psychologist and spent almost all their time together twelve is a big group of guys in one place doing the same thing , said juarez , who has won his last 65 fights but two months up there is a long time we became a team the work has paid off and the togetherness has been readily evident in the cozy temporary boxing site at sydney s exhibition center lacy , juarez and the welterweight dante craig amassed such commanding leads on the judges' cards that their fights were stopped under olympic rules the lightflyweight brian viloria earned a tough firstround victory over the european champion sergei kazakov , while the lightweight david jackson and the bantamweight clarence vinson won by overwhelming doubledigit margins and clamoring to get seats near the action , the american boxers have watched one another s fights , sometimes rushing from the shower to ringside to do so it s a diverse group , mustin said of the team , whose members weigh from 106 to 201 pounds and range in age from 19 to 29 and they get on each other but i see them all pulling for each other now this is a great beginning 6 for 6 i think that s going to motivate the other guys now because nobody wants to be the first one to lose they 'll fight their hearts out to help keep the streak going the featherweight juarez , the world champion in the 125pound division , shut out his iranian opponent , bijan batmani , today , registering 15 punches landed to none for batmani by early in the third round when an olympic boxer gains a 15point lead on his opponent , the referee stops the fight lacy did much the same in his bout , only in two rounds he is the hardest puncher on the united states team , with a crunching left hook but he is not one of the team s betterknown fighters , not a reigning world champion like viloria or juarez , and not generally listed as a medal contender i do n't want to be anybody s favorite , lacy said i want to catch these guys with their hands down that will be hard to do after today s intimidating performance yeah , i should strike some fear in these middleweights , lacy said every american , like the cuban boxers who have also dominated the preliminaries , will get his notice now the united states and cuba , as expected , have been the class of the tournament so far these guys have worked very seriously , mustin said i hate to say it , but every one of these guys is thinking about the gold medal the cubans , meanwhile , have intentionally kept a lower profile , their secrecy legendary in these olympic boxing tournaments but cuban newspapers reported an interesting detail about the team s final preparations last month the boxers had sought higher altitudes to train
a 48yearold bronx man who was walking near his home yesterday afternoon was struck in the head by a stray bullet during a gunfight between two police officers and a convicted robber who was released from prison six weeks ago , the police said the victim was in a coma last night the shootout , which occurred about 12 20 pm , was one frantic moment in a wild chase that began when the recently released convict stabbed two people in an apartment in bedford park , opened fire on a police cruiser as it arrived at a nearby corner and was captured scaling a fence at the metronorth railroad tracks near fordham university seven minutes later , the police said during the chase , the gunman , identified by the police as jamel hightower , 24 , briefly grabbed two hostages , including a woman on the train station platform whom he used as a shield while he fired at a pursuing detective the authorities said last night that it was not clear whether the bullet that struck the bystander , wilson ramos , of 244 east 196th street , was fired by the police or mr hightower although the police said that the direction the officers were facing as they fired made it unlikely that they had struck him , they stressed that an investigation was being conducted and that their first impression was preliminary it appears at this time that the man who was shot was an innocent bystander and was struck by a bullet fired by the suspect , said sgt brian burke , a police spokesman but that could change relatives said mr ramos , a father of three , had left his apartment to buy a soda for a family reunion and happened to stroll into the gunfight and was shot between the eyes a native of ecuador who works in a cosmetics factory , he was in critical condition and on a respirator late last

recovered , the police said mr hightower was found to have suffered a broken ankle the police and prosecutors were reviewing charges late last night none were immediately filed mr hightower s accomplices , who one police official said were his brother and sister , were found later in the day and were being questioned as well in all , nine people were taken to jacobi medical center for treatment , including four police officers with minor injuries and mr ramos ms ortiz and ms murphy were treated and released mr ortiz , who suffered stab wounds , was in stable condition and was

the rangers find themselves stuck at another crossroads to the playoffs for all the roster tinkering , they have regressed to a oneline team the confidence and momentum built from 21 magical days in january have become a distant memory freeagent spending during the offseason swelled the payroll , which exceeds 60 million , and if the rangers fail to reach the postseason for the third consecutive year , coach john muckler and neil smith , the team s president and general manager , could lose their jobs are they willing to risk their futures on acquiring mark messier , a 39yearold ranger legend whose skills are on the decline , to quickfix a season that is rapidly slipping away \? since winning nine of 10 games from jan 5 the day muckler formed the czech line to jan 25 , the rangers are 362 over the last five games , they are 131 , with a loss and a tie to two of the three worst teams in the national hockey league , the islanders and tampa bay lightning it may be unfair to brian leetch , the team captain who is almost universally recognized as the club s most talented player , but the fivegame slide has coincided with his return on feb 9 after he missed 32 games with a broken right forearm few would suggest the rangers are a better team without leetch , long one of the league s premier defensemen yet since his return , the rangers have inexplicably struggled when he went down on nov 24 , the rangers were in trouble many felt that muckler and smith were being closely scrutinized by their cablevision and madison square garden bosses but the team somehow seemingly turned its season around it does not get any easier for the rangers over the final 23 games of their regular season twentytwo games are against teams that are battling for a playoff berth over the next five days , the rangers have home games against colorado , philadelphia and pittsburgh the avalanche destroyed them , 41 , in denver on nov 5 the flyers have manhandled the rangers in their only two meetings this season , shutting them out by a combined score of 70 and the penguins are directly in front of the 24269 rangers in the eastern conference standing , by a point the top eight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs going into last night , the eighthplace rangers' cushion over the ninthplace buffalo sabres was 3 points when they were piling up points in midjanuary , the rangers had four solid forward lines with the additions of alexandre daigle and radek dvorak by trade and the return of a healthy valery kamensky lately , the only productive line has been the one with petr nedved centering dvorak and jan hlavac if they do n't score , who will \? two of the biggest disappointments have been the two biggest free agents theo fleury has 13 goals , none on the power play , and the ofteninjured kamensky has 8 the rangers knew their biggest weakness would be at center ice that flaw has manifested itself over the last five games muckler has become so disenchanted with daigle that he has tried adam graves long a fixture at left wing at center the last two games graves in the middle is something we have to think about , muckler said wednesday i'm not satisfied with that but it s the best we have now would it be better if messier returned to center his old bodyguard , graves , and perhaps reassume the team captaincy to ease some of the leadership burden off leetch \? at the allstar game break in toronto , messier seemed to signal that he was willing to waive his notrade clause to be freed from a situation in vancouver that has never worked since he left the rangers as a free agent in a messy divorce after the 1997 playoffs before this season , messier confided to friends that he would like to return to new york for one more season to finish out his career messier also indicated that he would accept a modest milliondollar salary \( compared to the 6 million he is making this season \) , skate on a third line and not cause any problems within the organization that would dissuade some of the biggest fears that some members of the rangers' organization privately voiced about his possible return it seems likely that messier , who could be bought out of his contract next season for 2 million , could be pried from the canucks before the march 14 trade deadline the rangers could use messier s attitude , leadership and presence , no matter how much his skills have fallen there are those in the rangers' organization who believe that messier is better suited to help a team in the regular season than in the postseason perhaps they are right but the rangers need to make the postseason , if only to save the jobs of muckler and smith smith , who went through an uncomfortable parting with wayne gretzky last season , seems to be in a quandary with less than a month remaining before the trade deadline photo a sight the rangers have become accustomed to sylvain lefebvre watching a shot slide past mike richter \( associated press \)

white plains on a recent sultry afternoon , fortified only with box lunches and their own passion , a dozen government officials and an equal number of housing advocates boarded a bus at the county center here and made a great loop around new york s wealthiest county , visiting affordable housing projects from peekskill to mamaroneck they were guests of the county executive , andrew j spano , who has called the lack of affordable housing westchester s no 1 problem , for reasons both practical and philosophical it weakens the fabric of communities , he said , by forcing out young adults who were raised there , retirees who ca n't afford to stay and bluecollar stalwarts who staff the volunteer fire departments and ambulance corps were that not bad enough , mr spano said , the difficulty of finding affordable housing in all but a few communities , like yonkers and new rochelle , is contributing to choking traffic on arteries like the tappan zee bridge , a conduit for those who work here but must live where it is less expensive , say in rockland or orange counties it discourages economic development and it fosters certain values that thrive in this petri dish of privilege when we talk about improving the quality of life for all our residents , we must attack the lack of affordable housing , mr spano declared in his state of the county address every study whether the subject is transportation , economic development , planning or senior services refers to it as the county s most crucial problem but the county has no power , except for the bully pulpit , when it comes to land use decisions by its 43 municipalities and so mr spano , a democrat , has begun a 250 , 000 public relations campaign to help overcome resistance from residents and elected leaders we 've got to show that the political numbers are greater for than against , said mr spano , whose initiatives include using county money to buy land for such developments , giving legal and technical assistance to municipalities and developers , and tying the distribution of discretionary funds to a community s record in building affordable housing each municipality , under authority granted by the state , drafts its own zoning regulations approves , rejects or stalls projects as it sees fit and with a few exceptions , most of westchester s towns and villages vigorously resist the idea of opening the gates of paradise to those who can not afford to enter without subsidy the problem with that attitude is that virtually nobody can afford to live here anymore , including the people who already do , since the median house price is 365 , 000 and rising a case in point is ron bianchi , the mayor and supervisor of harrison a lot of us , including myself , could n't buy the houses we 're living in now , mr bianchi said my three sons , none of them can afford to live here the irony of mr bianchi s lament may be lost on all but county insiders his community , it turns out , is the most recalcitrant in westchester when it comes to building affordable housing , refusing even to endorse a nonbinding county resolution that sets goals for each municipality harrison , a contiguous town and village , was urged to build 307 units in the last decade it built none it plans none it wants none , mr bianchi said there are few places in the united states where the gap is greater between the cost of housing and the wages of all but the fabulously rich in years gone by , the basic premise of housing policy was , if you could work you could afford a place to live , said nicolas p retsinas , director of the joint center for housing studies at harvard university , who recently viewed the situation here firsthand during a speaking engagement now , that connection is broken the numbers are eye popping , proof that westchester has pulled the welcome mat out from under people who would be solidly middle class virtually anywhere else , but for a few exceptions like silicon valley in california and fairfax county in virginia to be eligible for affordable housing , according to government regulations , an individual or family must earn less than 80 percent of the local median income in westchester , the median income for a family of four is 83 , 100 , which means that a family earning 66 , 480 would qualify for help again using a government formula , which says housing should cost 30 percent of gross income , that hypothetical family of four should spend no more that 1 , 600 a month , either in rent or mortgage payments , the ceiling for housing that meets the affordable criteria to find marketrate housing at that cost in most parts of westchester is impossible county planners say that without equity from a previous real estate investment , an income of 110 , 000 would be required to buy a typical home and apartments have all but disappeared about 40 , 000 were lost to condominium conversions in the 1980 s only 10 , 000 rental units remain , or 16 percent of the housing stock countywide , so landlords can charge premium prices

port st lucie , fla , feb 23 when mets general manager steve phillips was looking for a hitting coach last fall , manager bobby valentine brought up a name he did n't think would be considered i suppose robby s out of the question , valentine said , referring to tom robson , who was fired by phillips last june no , phillips replied he s not out of the question at all robson was so much a part of the equation that the mets never contacted anyone else that s baseball , thought robson , who has seen enough in his 33 years in the game to not be surprised by much i just wondered if steve would do it i did n't think he would , robson said but he called me and we talked and it was great it s not an ego thing it s not a hurtyourfeelings thing it s just baseball i 've been in it since 1967 i 've seen a lot of stuff but not much compares to the events of last june 5 , when robson , the pitching coach bob apodaca and the bullpen coach randy niemann were let go with the mets one game under 500 valentine gave himself the next 55 games to get the team in contention , and the mets , of course , reached the national league championship series phillips officially fired robson because of the mets' problems with situational hitting but there was another reason , harder to define , and the mets' recovery after the coaching shakeup still puzzles phillips i do n't know what to make of it , the general manager said his message was good i just think at that time , if the same message was communicated in a different way , it might have an impact but i did n't have any question about his knowledge or ability to teach the mechanics of hitting robson s replacement , mickey brantley , was reassigned over the winter , and phillips said he considered the coaching staff as a whole when thinking of a replacement that benefited robson , a valentine loyalist who served on his staff in texas from 198692 and again in new york since 1997 robson had been working with mets minor leaguers when the call came to rejoin the major league staff the main thing i like is that what he teaches is , in fact , correct , valentine said of robson proven correct not correct in theory or passed down by someone who said it could be , should be or might be he teaches what actually happens in a swing robson uses biokinetics , a tool he and valentine developed with the rangers hitters' swings are videotaped , and the tapes are sent to a salt lake city company that turns them into computer models the result , robson said , is an unmatched database that expresses precisely what the body does during a good swing there are some absolutes and some measurements there that need to be understood , robson said at his home in arizona over the winter , robson worked with a nonroster outfielder , mike kelly , a family friend and former college player of the year who has never had much success in the majors a swing starts with the legs , kelly learned from robson s tapes , and he said the adjustments could make a difference you could see exactly what the body is doing throughout the sequence of the swing , kelly said that really opened my eyes to some things robson offers no philosophy on hitting he is more matteroffact what do the good hitters do \? how do they do it \? that , he said , is his philosophy but robson himself is philosophical that figures , after a year like 1999 i'm going to be fired again at some point , too , he said that s the way it happens with everybody inside pitch left fielder rickey henderson , who reported to camp tuesday vowing to meet with manager bobby valentine to discuss his role , said he would speak with valentine soon if he does n't like what he hears , henderson may want to be traded if my role is n't right , i would n't want to be here , henderson said as far as asking to be traded , that s their decision i do n't think i want to be here unhappy , and i do n't think they want me here unhappy th 41yearold henderson started 113 games in left field last year in a season interrupted in may by a 19day stay on the disabled list for a sprained knee he said he wants to play every day this year , and does not want to be removed for defense , as he often was late in the season i'm going to be starting or sitting on the bench , henderson said there ai n't going to be no spot starting , ' none of that i do n't like it , i do n't want it general manager steve phillips said he wanted to talk to henderson before commenting , and valentine would not say what he planned to tell henderson but valentine defended his use of henderson on monday , noting that in 1999 , henderson had his best season in several years photo on the field , a bat is never far from tom robson s thoughts , or person \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \)
washington , aug 10 traveling recently through morocco , lowell w paxson marveled when he used his cell phone to view a street map enabling his driver to find an obscure restaurant there but to his critics in the telephone and regulatory worlds , mr paxson , the chairman of paxson communications , which owns a string of mostly small television stations , now seems to be one of the biggest impediments to the proliferation of such technology in the united states with the volume of internet traffic doubling every 100 days and with that traffic rapidly migrating from personal computers to wireless devices like cell phones and handheld computers , the airwaves are running out of free space and much of the airspace coveted by the makers of wireless devices is in the hands of mr paxson and a small group of other broadcasters , including barry diller of usa networks and the sinclair broadcast group , a major broadcaster based in baltimore the spectrum space controlled by the broadcasters was once viewed as virtually worthless , but it is now perhaps one of the most valuable assets in the new information age , as important as oil and coal were in the industrial revolution cell phones , handheld personal digital assistants , laptop computers and other wireless devices need spectrum space to function the broadcasters' sliver of spectrum space , occupying channels 60 to 69 in many major markets , was given to them free by congress four years ago in exchange , the broadcasters promised to make digital television widely available by 2006 and return the spectrum when they had done so but the development of digital television has stalled and since the stations do not have to give up their spectrum licenses until 85 percent of all television viewers have switched to digital tv a milestone that may be decades off a bottleneck has developed , with spectrum space in extremely short supply as a result , telephone companies , internet businesses , and the broadcasters are battling to determine which companies will control the spectrum that makes the new wireless technology work , and at what cost in britain , five licenses sold for a total of 355 billion in april and government officials estimate that the space now occupied by mr paxson and the other broadcasters could be worth billions the fight is alarming both regulators and industry executives the big story is that our spectrum policy in the united states is totally messed up , said reed hundt , a former chairman of the federal communications commission who is now on the boards of eight internet companies \( none of which is seeking a spectrum license \) and right now the fcc is really holding a handful of hot coals the broadcasters say they cannot give up their spectrum licenses until the regulators issue rules to help accelerate the transition to digital television they want the fcc to force cable television companies to carry signals for both traditional tv and the new digital tv , expanding the socalled mustcarry rules they also want the agency to move faster to impose technical standards allowing easier coordination between digital broadcasters and cable companies regulators say they are moving rapidly on some of the rules the broadcasters want but say others are unfair and , in at least one instance , probably unconstitutional william e kennard , chairman of the fcc , said this week that the broadcasters had made unreasonable demands on his agency , trying to use their leverage as holders of valuable spectrum licenses the law put the broadcasters completely in the driver s seat , he said the broadcasters made a deal with the united states congress they promised a lot of key people in congress that if you give us this spectrum , we will give the public highdefinition television but nobody really said that the american public wanted it or what the business plan was there were a lot of promises made , but none has been fulfilled for their part , the telephone and internet companies say they cannot make plans to buy the available spectrum or even draw up business plans that include the use of the spectrum until they know how and when the broadcasters will make it available and at what price the telephone companies interested in acquiring frequencies include verizon communications , voicestream , bellsouth , nextel , sprint and a joint venture of bellsouth and sbc communications the dispute has raised significant concerns that venture capitalists and investors in wireless technology will shift their attention to europe and asia officials there , unencumbered by the kinds of laws that have restricted the fcc , have been moving swiftly this year to liberate the airwaves for newer uses the effect of this would be to shift technology investment overseas , and , as a result , technology innovation and development as well congress had ordered the fcc to auction the pieces of the channel 60 to 69 spectrum that are not in the hands of the broadcasters chiefly pieces outside urban areas sometime this year but many telephone and internet companies have been unwilling to put together significant business plans or bids , preferring to wait until spectrum in major markets is available
vice president al gore moved yesterday to hitch his presidential campaign to the economic record of president clinton and called for a new retirement program to supplement social security , the elimination of the nation s debt in 12 years , modest tax cuts and systematic increases in spending on education , health care and the environment i intend to build even higher on the foundation of the clinton years , mr gore declared in a speech in a cramped auditorium at the newyork historical society on manhattan s upper west side , standing next to the very symbol of mr clinton s economic policies , robert e rubin , the former secretary of the treasury are you better off than you were eight years ago \? the vice president asked , offering a positive twist to the piercing inquiry ronald reagan presented to president jimmy carter in 1980 for most americans , i believe the answer is obvious together as a nation , we turned the biggest deficits in our history into the biggest surpluses in our history mr gore , speaking in the heart of a new york neighborhood that has long been identified with liberal political thought , urged creation of trust funds that would systematically divert parts of the nation s projected surplus to spending on education , health care and the environment , as well as to eliminate the nation s debt he called for creation of new taxfree , voluntary retirement accounts that would supplement social security benefits mr gore s speech was advertised as a major address intended to inaugurate a new thematic chapter in a campaign that many democrats have come to view as adrift for the next three weeks , he plans to deliver a series of speeches elaborating on his message of prosperity and progress , with one of the weeks devoted to environmental issues as part of the initiative , mr gore also conducted a round of news interviews in new york , including a meeting with members of the editorial board , a reporter and editors of the new york times , where he suggested that he was concerned about recent studies that showed high rates of mistakes in death penalty cases excerpts , page a20 in his economic speech , mr gore restated his support for a variety of limited tax reductions , including the elimination of the socalled marriage penalty for working couples and he urged that excess medicare funds be put into an ironclad box , preventing congress from using them for other programs , like the big tax cut being pursued by his republican opponent , gov george w bush but these presumably complicated proposals were addressed in a few quick and fleeting sentences instead of offering details , mr gore , speaking broadly , sought to wrap himself in the legacy of mr clinton s economic accomplishments , while offering his general views on how the nation should best use the surpluses that are being projected for the years ahead none of this boom happened by accident , he declared , adding to those who say prosperity has achieved its full reach , i say just watch us we will deepen prosperity , and extend it to the homes and hearts of every family although he did not mention mr bush by name , he offered clear criticism of mr bush s advocacy for large tax cuts , and for allowing the private investment of some social security funds mr gore s advisers declined to offer much elaboration on any of the proposals , saying that the vice president would instead seek to stretch out this repackaging of his candidacy by returning to each of these subjects in coming days most of the proposals mr gore said would provide the foundation of his campaign through the summer came as a result of the projected surpluses that have allowed him to advocate new spending without calling for new taxes or cuts in other programs his call for new spending on traditionally democratic issues health care , education and the environment marked a sharp shift both for the candidate himself , who has spent much of this campaign criticizing republican initiatives , as well as for democratic presidential candidates over the past decade , who have refrained from offering the kind of spending programs that might open them to attack from republicans mr bush s spokesman , ari fleischer , criticized the speech , describing it as representative of an activist view of government by offering new ways the federal government can gain more control , apparently al gore does not trust individual americans to make decisions regarding their own retirement , health care needs , education , and finances , mr fleischer said just as hardworking americans deserve credit for our economic prosperity , governor bush believes americans should have more control over saving for their retirement , planning for their children s education there were numerous indications of the importance that mr gore and his aides attached to a speech that his campaign hopes will shift the terms of debate in his contest with mr bush the vice president tinkered with the text until the very last minute , and then read from a teleprompter , with barely a variation , when delivering it to his invited audience to make sure that no one missed the point , the stage was festooned with a banner reading prosperity and progress his aides arranged for him to spend much of the afternoon giving interviews for the nightly television news the speech was also taped for possible campaign advertisements as has been fairly standard in recent weeks , mr gore avoided mentioning mr bush by name which is not to say he was not critical of his opponent
in san francisco , defensive players apologized to the team and fans on sunday for falling behind the carolina panthers , 140 , at the end of the first quarter , and 280 by the end of the first half when 49ers quarterback jeff garcia was benched in favor of rick mirer , as big a bust on the west coast as he was in the east , joe montana must have been considering a comeback the 49ers play st louis this week the rams might score 50 in one quarter meanwhile , the proud green bay franchise lost to buffalo and fell to 02 for the first time since 1992 there s nothing worse than being 02 when you 're playing football , said packers offensive tackle mark tauscher yes , there is it is being 02 and a member of the dallas cowboys , a team that was once the most feared franchise in football on sunday night in the desert , the cowboys lost to the arizona cardinals at the end of the game , offensive lineman larry allen and safety darren woodson threw their helmets in disgust while standing on the sideline they must have thought helmettossing was a new olympic event in recent times , san francisco , green bay and dallas have been rolemodel franchises in the national football league the 49ers won with montana , young and rice , and the packers with the arm of brett favre , while the dallas trio of troy aikman , emmitt smith and michael irvin resurrected a winning tradition that was started by tom landry the success of these teams , in a way , helped to further glamorize the nfl and bolster pro football s status as the country s most popular professional sport but now the teams that were the toast of the league staying on top by manipulating the salarycap system , massaging it , stretching it , even sometimes abusing it are suddenly victims of it , and the punch line of jokes \( question how many 49ers does it take to screw in a light bulb \? answer none , because the team ca n't fit the cost of electricity under the cap \) the 49ers , packers and cowboys have won seven of the past 12 super bowls , and some of those were captured because these three franchises skillfully worked the salary cap now the system is nipping at their heels for the first time in 40 years , the three teams have started 02 in the same season that is a stunning statistic and a sign that the mighty have truly fallen , choked by the cap the more you beat the 62 million salary cap by spreading out high signing bonuses deep into the future to avoid paying the price now , the more the cap fights back in the long run teams give players fat bonuses and low base salaries as a way to temporarily exceed the cap limit , but eventually the back ends of those contracts grow to the point where teams cannot keep other players the franchise caps out , cuts talent and takes several steps backward the system has caught up with those three teams , said ernie accorsi , the giants' general manager they worked it to perfection now they 're paying the price some team executives talk of the cap as if it is a living thing , a beast than can wreck teams like a giant sea squid in a jules verne novel , or an angel that can deliver them from last place and empty stadiums older players , usually salarycap victims because of their age , curse it worse than a steaming training camp day the nfl office loves the cap , because it levels the playing field , allowing practically any team , in any year , to win a super bowl , something that cannot be said about major league baseball or the national basketball association if the giants and jets win this week , it will be the first time both teams begin the same season at 30 the giants are a playoff team , and maybe with a lucky bounce or two in the postseason like the kind the tennessee titans got last year they could get to the super bowl same with the jets the salary cap can grind great teams into dust and turn betterthanaverage ones into champions and if the giants and jets do somehow get to the super bowl , they would face their own cap nightmares in the years to come the trick is to do everything you can in as short a period of time to win a championship , said accorsi , but if you do , the slip will come you ca n't avoid it san francisco , dallas and green bay the three salarycap amigos won three consecutive super bowls , from 1995 to 1997 , using the salarycap system to their advantage yet only a short time later , they 're in salarycap jail and there is no presidential pardon for this offense photo troy aikman \( associated press \)
the director of the highly regarded spoleto festival usa in charleston , sc , says he is determined to put on this year s event despite an economic boycott organized to protest the flying of the confederate battle flag over the state capitol and his own abhorrence of the flag because of the boycott , called by the state branch of the naacp , one of the festival s marquee performers , bill t jones , has withdrawn his dance company from the festival in addition at least half a dozen performers , including patti labelle and the o'jays , have canceled other concerts in the state in the last month still , nigel redden , spoleto s general director , said that despite his personal opposition to the flying of the flag , the 18day festival , which runs from may 25 to june 11 and is the preeminent arts event in the southeast , would go on he also said that he hoped that the flag , which the naacp and its allies regard as a symbol of racism , would be removed before the end of the legislative session , which runs until june 1 and overlaps with spoleto if it is removed and the boycott is ended , mr jones will perform , both the dancer and mr redden said but we ca n't plan on that , mr redden added in an interview , mr jones said of his cancellation , it was the only decision i could make on friday mr redden and the spoleto board s executive committee issued a statement saying that while they supported the flag s removal , all the artists scheduled to appear had been asked to do so in spite of the boycott because the festival strongly believes that the arts have a unique ability to stimulate debate , draw people together and ultimately to change them in ways nothing else can mr redden said that no corporations or foundations had withdrawn their support because of the boycott , but that two corporations we had been courting said it would be difficult at this time he said it was too early to determine what impact the boycott might have on ticket sales , which are slightly up from this time last year however , mr redden added , we are receiving letters from people saying they will not come if the boycott continues spoleto usa has a major impact on the south carolina economy last year the state estimated that the festival had generated 1 billion in local spending since it began in 1977 as the american counterpart of the festival founded in spoleto , italy , by giancarlo menotti ms labelle had been scheduled to give a concert at the carolina coliseum on the campus of the university of south carolina in columbia on april 8 after she canceled , the concert s producer , woody johnston , lined up five rhythmandblues acts , including the o'jays , to replace her but they also withdrew mr johnston said he agreed with the singers' decision to adhere to the boycott , which several sports organizations are also supporting they include the new york knicks , who are to stop using the college of charleston as a training site it s only going to get worse until the flag comes down , mr johnston said the speaker of the south carolina house , david h wilkins , who defends the battle flag as a symbol of tradition , said , i would like very much to resolve this issue with dignity and finality he has proposed removing the flag to the confederate soldiers monument in front of the capitol , but the naacp has rejected the idea , and both sides appear to be hardening their positions dwight c james , the executive director of the naacp branches in south carolina , said he was pleased by mr jones s withdrawal from the festival it speaks well of mr jones s character , he said , that he has the courage to take an individual stand when he sees something that s wrong , to have this symbol of bigotry and oppression removed from the state capitol of south carolina mr james added that he hoped others would follow mr jones s example , forcing a cancellation of the festival the festival , because of its impact on the tourism industry , is a prime target , mr james said we have reached a lot of folks who make up the audience since mr jones first approached the naacp when he heard about the boycott , the organization has been trying to persuade other performers to cancel their appearances at spoleto so far none have , mr james said , adding that he remained hopeful mr redden said he would allow any performer to cancel a contract because of the boycott with no ill feelings both he and mr jones said they hoped the dispute would end in time for mr jones to appear at the festival , and mr redden said , i am already talking to bill about future engagements most performers scheduled to appear at spoleto did not respond to phone calls about their plans one that did was the american music theater group of new york , which is to perform running man , a jazzinspired opera written by a black composer and performed by an allblack cast to the music of a mostly black band diane wondisford , the group s general director , said the company had decided to go ahead with its performances i have had discussions with the composer , deirdre murray , and others , she said , and they are respectful of the position taken by bill t jones and are confident that the spoleto festival , working on behalf of the participants and south carolina , will do the right thing joseph flummerfelt , artistic director for choral activities at the festival , said the westminster choir college at rider university in princeton , nj , of which he is artistic director and principal conductor , would also appear even though he is adamantly opposed to the flag s remaining it s a big opportunity for the students , he said none of us like this , but we have not considered withdrawing from the festival if the flag does not come down and the boycott continues , it could impinge upon the life of the festival , mr flummerfelt said mr johnston , the producer of the canceled labelle show , said the artists who would have performed at the carolina coliseum as her substitutes had they not canceled as well were destiny s child , a rhythmandblues group , and the singers eric benet , brian mcknight and gerald levert , as well as the o'jays i know that other promoters are n't going in there because of the boycott , mr johnston said it will be a unison situation photo a dispute in south carolina over the confederate battle flag has led

when president clinton walked into a room filled with the old people who live at the washington home , in the district of columbia , on a recent saturday , alice gavin , who is 105 , stood up it was , she thought , the respectful thing to do , and mr clinton was about to deliver his weekly radio address , proposing a package of federal grants , punishments and rewards to try to improve the quality of care in the nation s nursing homes he called for a billion dollars in new federal grants to hire more health care workers and better train them so each resident would have at least two hours of individual care each day his announcement came as a surprise the clinton administration has a record of toughening the standards and inspections of nursing homes , and it recently issued a report that showed what anyone in health care has long known good care is a function of the number of people available and trained to give it the fewer nurses and nurses' aides on staff , the less individual attention the 16 million frail elderly residents get , the more bedsores , malnutrition , abnormal weight loss and depression they suffer , and , in all probability , the faster they die there are no federal requirements for staffpatient ratios , but 54 percent of homes , the report found , are understaffed to the point that residents do not get the minimal two hours of care by nurses' aides per day necessary to keep them from being endangered the president could have let that study by the health care financing administration simply feed the bipartisan interest in passing some kind of nursing home support bill before this session of congress ends he has chosen instead to try to shape that debate , and he has focused on the single most important element for the welfare of the vulnerable , often indigent older women who make up most of the nursing home population he is right to do so congress , which spends 39 billion a year on nursing home care , seems inclined to restore some of the medicare funds it cut three years ago , in part because six of the nation s largest forprofit nursing home chains have gone bankrupt as those cuts have taken effect in the last year restoring the medicare money might improve the financial health of those chains , and if congress also restored the medicare funds cut from home health care , more older americans might be able to remain in their own homes that is desirable most people do not need or want to be in nursing homes but none of that touches the issue of inadequate staff the study reported that good care requires 45 hours per resident per day congress needs to mandate staff ratios and be willing to help pay for them enough staff to meet the standard of two hours of care a day is a worthwhile start congress should also instruct the health care financing administration to arrive at meaningful longterm staff ratios within two years to ensure quality care for all the residents of nursing homes miss gavin still bathes and dresses and feeds herself , but most residents of nursing homes need a lot more help than she does
bat yam , israel , sept 27 in her immaculate apartment here , farahnaz rabizade , an iranian immigrant , was tempted to set an extra place at the rosh hashana table for her missing husband but she did not let herself be that maudlin , she said , because she did not want to upset her children , who have been waiting four years for their father to show up in israel for the jewish new year mrs rabizade s husband is one of 11 iranian jews who disappeared while emigrating the men set off from iran at different times three groups in 1994 and mr rabizade s group in 1997 lacking travel documents , they all chose to leave illegally , presumably by hiring smugglers to help them across the perilous iranian border , where many travelers disappear in kidnappings none of the jews have been heard from since my father sacrificed himself for us , dahlia rabizade wrote in a 10thgrade essay at her new israeli school he was like a candle that lights the way while he himself is the wax that melts the 11 missing men came to the attention of human rights and american jewish groups only in the last month until then , iranian jews , who prefer to handle sensitive issues with the iranian government very quietly , had used back channels to search for the men recently , israeli officials , frustrated by the lack of response , decided to push for an international campaign on behalf of the 11 men given iranian governmental hostility toward israel , some jewish groups and experts on iran did not think that this was wise one expert here said that he was personally told by a jewish member of the iranian parliament that the government was working hard to locate the men i think they might get some good results , the expert said , and maybe the israeli authorities should be a little more patient but the israeli officials believe that , on the heels of the recent convictions of 10 iranian jews on espionage charges , which the american government and others condemned as unjust , the time was ripe to develop international sympathy for the men iran might be more receptive than imagined , the officials added , having become more sensitive about its image and eager to portray itself as tolerant of minorities the original assumption was that it would be easier for the iranians to respond positively when they were approached discreetly , said sallai meridor , chairman of the jewish agency but this assumption has not been proven correct and we do n't think the families should have to wait any longer it s time for answers whether the men were arrested and imprisoned by the authorities or fell prey to the violence of the no man s land that exists in iran s border zones is unclear the frontier with pakistan , in particular , is treacherous territory for a stranger , with tourists and others including many bahais from iran disappearing in kidnappings but israeli officials and iranian jewish leaders outside israel say they have reason to believe that at least some of the men are alive and in prison there have been recent reports of sightings by other prisoners , they said if they were behind bars , the men would be in the company of thousands of muslims and other iranians who have also been apprehended while fleeing the country a senior clinton administration official told an american jewish leader that the case of the 11 men should be treated as part of a broader human rights problem emigration from iran is restricted in general and , an amnesty international official noted , record numbers of iranians are seeking political asylum elsewhere , even in this time of peace and relative openness in iran but world jewish leaders say the issue of emigration is particularly resonant for jews because of a history of flights from peril the idea of jews in this day and age seeking safety and being intercepted is a horror story and even worse , said a senior official at an american jewish organization , who requested anonymity because he has not decided that going public with the case is a good idea mrs rabizade , 37 , has taken a hebrew first name , urit , a job as a nanny , and an apartment in this immigrantfilled town near tel aviv her children have assimilated very rapidly but the whole idea of coming to israel was her husband s dream , not hers so , she said , she cannot help but feel displaced in her new life , especially when her old one , in the southern iranian city of shiraz , was quite nice her husband owned a clothing shop , and she was a sales clerk , she said their jewish life was open and free , she said , with plenty of kosher food available and a lovely old synagogue in walking distance from their home jews are a protected minority in iran although they do suffer official discrimination , the case of the 13 convicted of spying for israel on what many believe were trumpedup charges was an anomaly in their history still , mrs rabizade s husband , who is 18 years older than she is , set his sights on a life in israel after several trips here , and she , too , believed it was our land generally , the iranian government did not permit all members of a jewish family to travel abroad at once but in late 1996 the rabizades decided to try
washington , nov 21 the members of the florida supreme court held not only the presidential election in their hands tonight but also their own reputations and that of the institution they serve so they did what judges often try to do at such moments of institutional urgency they found strength in unanimity , comfort in their own precedents , and authority in a set of guiding principles on which they built their conclusion that at least five more days of counting the vote was required by florida s constitution and election law the result in the most consequential and closely watched state court proceeding in memory was a window into a judicial approach that disdained hypertechnical reliance upon statutory provisions , in the words of the unsigned 42page opinion , and looked instead to give effect to the will of the people this is an approach much less in evidence in courts around the country notably in the united states supreme court than it once was republicans , angry and disappointed , but perhaps not surprised by a court they had tried to discredit in advance for the democratic affiliation of its members , made plans tonight to take an immediate appeal to the justices in washington whether the united states supreme court is inclined to secondguess a state court s interpretation of state law remains to be seen , but the florida court took some care to make that option even less attractive than it otherwise might be by addressing none of the federal legal and constitutional issues that gov george w bush s legal team had tried over the weekend to inject into the case in fact , the opinion hewed quite closely to the analysis proposed by the gore legal team , which urged the court to step back from the confusing and internally contradictory provisions of florida law and look instead at the bigger picture that is what the court did tonight in declaring that the florida election code must be construed as a whole and in light of the state s constitution that makes the right to vote the preeminent right the court acknowledged , as it had to , that florida law sets a sevenday deadline after election day for counties to transmit their returns to the secretary of state but while that deadline was essentially the end of the matter for secretary of state katherine harris , whose refusal to accept laterfiled results of manual recounts was the subject of the appeal , it was only the beginning for the state supreme court noting that state law also provided for manual recounts , and for such recounts to begin up until the time the county canvassing board certifies the returns , the court said it was not logical to assume that the legislature intended the deadline as a tool to permit the secretary of state to summarily disenfranchise innocent electors by refusing to count latefiled returns to ignore the latefiled returns , the court said , was a drastic measure that could be upheld only if it was both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances of this case , it was unreasonable , unnecessary and contrary to longstanding law , the court concluded the court was highly specific in setting its own deadline of sunday at 5 pm , but much less explicit about an aspect of the case that has grown in importance as the hand counting has gone on for the last few days how the votes should actually be counted disputes have been raging over whether unperforated dimpled chads should be counted , and one such case is before a state court in palm beach county the decision tonight did not directly address this question , instead doing so by implication in a quotation from an illinois court opinion that was cited in the gore legal brief where the intention of the voter can be fairly and satisfactorily ascertained , that intention should be given effect , the illinois court said in a 1990 opinion that the decision tonight called particularly apt the florida justices may well have to rule on this question , much as they will probably have to decide the postcertification challenges that the deadline they set tonight contemplated and tried to leave time for before the electoral college clock runs out their goal in getting the opinion out tonight was to move the process forward , not to resolve every open question , to settle the big picture and not wait for all the details to come into focus
unidentified intruders had access to microsoft computers for about six weeks and were able to view some of the source code a programmer s basic instructions for a future software product , the company

said the spokesman , mark murray the investigation shows no evidence that the intruder gained any access to our windows or office products microsoft was aware of aspects of the attack for some time , those close to the investigation said , but pieced the situation together only this week the company said it had contacted the federal bureau of investigation for help we 've received information from microsoft that we are evaluating at this time , and it s premature to say anything else , said roberta burroughs , spokeswoman for the seattle field office of the fbi speaking to reporters at a seminar in stockholm , steven a ballmer , the company s chief executive , said , it is clear that hackers did see some of our source code , reuters and the associated press reported mr ballmer said the burglars had not changed any software programs , and he sought to dispel any concern that a virus might have been hidden inside future versions of microsoft products i can assure you that we know that there has been no compromise of the integrity of the source code , that it has not been modified or tampered with in any way , he added microsoft shares some source code with partner companies , but in general vigorously guards that information from outsiders to do otherwise , it has argued , would hurt its business and curtail its incentives to develop new products microsoft s source code would be a huge trophy for a member of the computer underground examining the original programmer s instructions can permit a vandal to find flaws or vulnerabilities not publicly known it is also possible to compile a version of a program from the source code that could contain a hidden vulnerability , making the program a trojan horse and actually manipulating the code within microsoft s own system could have allowed an intruder to insert additional code , either benign producing messages or functions that software pranksters call easter eggs or malicious even though the company said none of its code was tampered with , computer security professionals made much of the fact that even microsoft could be the victim of such a breakin if this can happen to microsoft , this could happen to anybody , said sandra k england , president of pgp security , a business unit of network associates , which sells encryption and intrusion detection products i think this will cause companies to reevaluate their own security policies and their own security infrastructure the method used in the intrusion was not highly sophisticated , according to a person close to the microsoft investigation that may have allowed the breakin to be detected more easily , though it made the intrusion itself all the more alarming microsoft said yesterday that the recent episode was the first in which its computer network had been penetrated , though in at least one previous case a company web site had been defaced and one expert said microsoft s reputation for internal security was strong , especially considering its prominence as a target microsoft is at the top of every hacker s list of networks they want to break into , said amit yoran , the chief executive of riptech inc of alexandria , va , which monitors computer networks for corporate clients the job the security people have to do is tremendous to secure its network microsoft allows employees to work remotely on computers and then gain access to the corporate network using one of two technologies , remote access service or virtual private network those are software protocols that create a secure channel between a remote computer and the company s network in addition , microsoft s computer system , like any corporate network , has a software barrier known as a fire wall , which tightly regulates the flow of data between the internal network and the open internet the lack of a similar fire wall on the computer system of a remote user , however , could allow an outsider to piggyback on that user s authorized connection according to several of the company s programmers , however , microsoft does not use an added layer of security , a special card that transmits a unique identifying number each time a user logs in as a result , a commandeered computer could more easily be prompted to establish a connection a person close to the company s investigation said the breakin had led microsoft to reevaluate its security system for remote workers a company spokesman said microsoft had shut down the connection using remote access service for at least 24 hours as a precaution that move suggested that the intruders had gained access to the company s computers through a remote worker s slower dialup connection rather than a highspeed internet link , making it more difficult to download the company s source code a person close to the investigation said the intruders had used a program called qaz trojan , which relies on what members of the computer underground call social engineering the ability to fool a computer user into running a seemingly benign program that performs a furtive task , undetected such a program , once installed , opens an electronic backdoor on the infected computer and then searches the local network for other machines to infect it also sends the network addresses of all the infected machines to a designated location on the internet , permitting those machines to be commandeered remotely the wall street journal reported that such a program had been used to send the address of a microsoft employee s computer to an internet address in st petersburg , russia but those close to the investigation said they could not confirm that report computer security professionals say st petersburg appears to be a stronghold of the russian computer underground it was the city from which a young programmer , vladimir levin , infiltrated the computers of citibank s electronic funds transfer system in 1995 although he was able to steal some money from the bank , he was arrested by interpol at heathrow airport in england
camp zeist , the netherlands , may 4 a noise that kept growing louder a dark mass just clearing the rooftops a fireball like a mushroom cloud the flannigans' house not there anymore , replaced by a pile of rubble as high as a kitchen window great gouts of fire raining down , the reek of jet fuel , and things lying in the street that , in the light of the flames , slowly became recognizable as bodies the residents of the sherwood park section of lockerbie , scotland , took the witness stand today in the trial of two libyans accused of blowing up pan am flight 103 , and described a hellish scene exactly what each of them saw just after 7 pm on dec 21 , 1988 , when most of a boeing 747 smashed down in their midst and exploded all 259 people on the plane died the 11 lockerbie residents killed that night all lived at nos 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 or 16 sherwood crescent , a group of row houses wiped out by the crash most of the survivors who testified today were their nearest neighbors , who leapt up from an episode of this is your life to run outside and see those of others ending but the prosecution in the case of abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi and al amin khalifa fhimah , the two former libyan airline officials who are accused of being intelligence agents and of blowing up the plane in an act of terrorism , did not start so intimately rather , it focused the day s testimony like a zoom lens , starting from far off and moving in the first witness was stephen c teagle , a food plant manager who saw the blast from an empty highway , drove home , ate dinner and learned what it was from the late news it led to witnesses like jasmine anne bell , who dodged streaks of flaming jet fuel raining down on her brother s driveway , stepping back and back and back till i could n't go any further because my back was against the wall the only witness the defense crossexamined was the last , geoffrey john carpenter , 56 , who was then a police superintendent and a regional traffic specialist he lived in lockerbie and for some hours was the senior officer at the scene the prosecution questioned him about the flying debris and huge crater he saw , and about how he had gotten roads cleared for fire engines and shelters set up for the homeless in its turn , the defense asked several apparently disjointed questions one was about whether it was possible to completely secure a crime scene when debris had rained down in a plume stretching for miles to the north sea he said it was not a second was about how quickly journalists appeared on the scene he estimated 90 minutes a third was about how quickly american citizens began to arrive , particularly an fbi team with modern , sophisticated equipment such as satellite systems and digital cameras , and more particularly an agent named hal hendershot mr carpenter said that he thought airline representatives arrived the next day , and that he later met fbi agents with cameras of a type he had never seen agent hendershot was the fbi s first liaison to the investigation , and federal agents often have satellite telephones and sophisticated cameras the defense made no opening statement , so the point of the questions was unclear but it has already announced that it may blame two palestinian groups the popular front for the liberation of palestine , based in syria , and the palestinian popular struggle front , based in the west bank for the explosion today , in conversations with a french news agency , representatives of both groups denied responsibility there have been suggestions in the past that a crucial piece of evidence against the libyans , shreds of a bomb detonator , had been discovered too conveniently and could have been planted the first question could have been directed at that but much more complex theories about the crash of pan am 103 have made the conspiracy circuit for years , including one that says the fbi and united states navy seals raced to the scene in a white helicopter to hunt for a box that contained a tape about the irancontra scandal or a drugsforhostages swap that would have that brought down the american government others ask whether the plane was shot down by a missile to cover a scandal it appeared possible that the defense might be opening such routes to create doubts about the theory advanced in the indictment that the two men packed a toshiba boom box with explosives , stole luggage tags and checked the bomb through from malta to new york , knowing that it would explode en route among the witnesses , it was mrs bell who described the day s most horrifying image she had just helped a couple who had fled their house barefoot find some shoes , and she and her 19yearold son were looking for other injured residents i went up the driveway with the gentleman with the cut head , she said and i looked down at something , and my son said 'what s that , mom \? ' my first reaction was 'it s ok , it s just meat' but then it registered it was n't just meat the point of the hours of grisly testimony was not explained by the prosecution , nor questioned by the court or the defense legally , describing the terror and gore might have been skipped , because the defense does not dispute that the plane crashed and people died
an exciting time an exciting result ! declared msnbc s anchor , brian williams , on monday night as he broke the news that alan keyes has rocketed to third place in the iowa caucuses talk about excitement ! a man who has never been elected to anything , a man whose thirdplace finish amounted to only 14 percent \( some 12 , 000 votes \) of a lowerthanhyped iowa gop turnout , a man who is less likely to be elected president than bill belichick , is rocketing ! what does it matter that his rocket s destination unless it s as a permanent talking head at a place like msnbc may be oblivion \? this is history in the making the only problem is , despite the hard sell , the country is n't buying even as the caucuses were meeting in iowa , harvard s kennedy school was tabulating its latest polls for its new worrywart project on the vanishing voter the numbers showed that despite weeks of iowa and new hampshire headlines , and despite the likelihood the whole nominating process will be over by march 7 , only 26 percent of the public is paying attention to the campaign a mere 6 percent of those polled describe themselves as paying a great deal of attention which is astounding , given that more than 6 percent of the country is either employed by government or a major media organization and therefore might be thought to have a vested interest in election 2000 what s more , 66 percent do n't support any candidate in any party , and 56 percent pronounce the campaign boring boring \? that s the unkindest cut of all , especially given the competition offered this week by professional show business barbra streisand s numbing state of her union filibuster at the golden globes if anything , our political culture has been in overdrive , trying to cook up creative story lines there were the sagas of george w bush s smirks \( and alleged snorts \) , al gore s sighs \( and alleged tokes \) , john mccain s tantrums , bill bradley s heart flips , warren beatty s mind games and , of course , donald trump s sex life there was the naomi wolf alpha male flap and the spirited debate over the true meaning of the confederate flag there have been the fascinating colloquies over the differences between the democrats' health care plans and the republicans' taxcut plans not to mention the touching spiritual pageant of candidates publicly embracing jesus even the fringe acts have been worthy of barnum bailey in their heyday gary bauer , the forwardtothepast familyvalues candidate , actually did arouse nostalgia for the sideshow era of the dionne quintuplets by arranging for his donors to gawk at iowa s mccaughey septuplets in exchange for a 250 campaign contribution nearly as bizarre was mr keyes s accusation that senator mccain , a man who risked his own young life in war , was in peacetime guilty of aiding and abetting the cultural murder of our young people because he made a joke about liking the music of nine inch nails surely , though , the most spectacular geek show is that of steve forbes , who has spent 60 million of his own money to act out his delusions on the public stage no one will say the poignant truth about this guy that even if he were a better speaker , or less of a hypocrite \( how can the billionaire owner of forbes magazine inveigh repeatedly against the media elites \? \) , there would still be the insurmountable problem of his giggly peeping tom grin and popeyed spectacles the most virulent , if least acknowledged , bigotry in this country far more widespread than sexism or racism and practiced by all genders and ethnic groups is looksism even in the prehdtv era , no one is going to be elected president who does n't meet the minimal physical standard required of a gameshow host that the majority of the public choose to ignore all the year s political players is , professors might tell us , a sorry commentary on the state of both the electorate and american politics we 're lousy citizens young voters are selfish , illinformed slackers bill clinton has made all politicians look like dirt everyone hates the media but a case could also be made that the people in this country , far from being stupid or unpatriotic , are disengaged for good reason at a time of boom polls show that 73 percent say they are better off than eight years ago , and 81 percent want steady progress rather than big , bold ideas from the next administration americans recognize that the two democrats and the two republicans who actually have a shot at being president will not rock the boat they may also realize that the four men s quarrels on the issues voters care most about \( health care , education , social security , medicare \) are mostly modest differences about highly incremental means , not ends the old , bold ideological polarities big government programs from democrats , big government cutbacks from republicans have been sanded down in the clinton era foreignpolicy issues are n't even on the table no wonder the lowrated debates generate sparks only when they resemble saturday night live skits , as witness mr keyes s recounting of his excellent adventure in a mosh pit
dakar , senegal , feb 26 the presidential election on sunday in senegal has one critical difference that sets it apart from past votes and that offers a snapshot of the evolution of democracy in subsaharan africa no one knows who will win the race offers senegalese the choice among four credible candidates president abdou diouf , who is seeking a fourth consecutive term , could become what was once the rarity of rarities in africa a sitting leader who loses power , not in a coup , but through the ballot box he would not be the first but because he is the head of the party that has governed senegal since independence from france in 1960 , his loss would be significant on a continent that has become increasingly impatient with democracies that offer no real choices the outcome of the election in senegal is extremely important for all of africa , said chris fomunyoh , who follows africa for the national democratic institute , an american organization that promotes democracy and monitors elections given the political history of africa , events in one country have had contagious effects elsewhere after ghana gained independence , everyone else wanted it then military coups came into fashion in the 1970 s , the single party state in the 1980 s , and the beginning of democratization in the 1990 s so a lot of people are watching the elections in senegal , which are the first competitive elections in africa in the year 2000 , to see what trends might emerge , mr fomunyoh added if the election runs relatively smoothly , it would also lengthen the list of african countries that have recently undergone change , more or less peacefully and fairly , through elections positive developments in africa that have been overshadowed by the chaos swirling around the war in congo and the december coup in the ivory coast in the last year , subsaharan africa s two giants , nigeria and south africa , held elections , and their new presidents have been pressing for more democracy in their regions in recent months , namibia and mozambique in southern africa held elections that international observers judged free and fair in west africa , niger and guinea bissau two countries whose former leaders had been removed by force successfully chose new presidents in elections that included runoffs and two weeks ago , the power of the ballot box asserted itself unexpectedly in zimbabwe voters there rejected a proposal by president robert mugabe , whose government has been ruining the economy while plundering the congo , to seize lands without compensation and place still more power in his hands a decade after the end of the cold war brought multiparty systems across africa , 32 out of its current 54 heads of states have been chosen in elections against rivals a quarter of a century ago , the figure was only 3 what is more , the pressure toward democratization has grown inside and outside the continent what once left people with mouths agape a leader voluntarily giving up power is no longer so surprising mali s president , alpha oumar konare , has said he would not follow the urging of some of his backers to change the constitution to allow for a third term , instead pledging to retire in two years this december , ghana is scheduled to have a presidential election without president jerry j rawlings a former flight lieutenant who seized power in 1981 , mr rawlings said he would also respect the constitution , which limits presidents to two terms , and step down in frenchspeaking africa , recent events are being interpreted to mean that france will no longer unconditionally support loyal but corrupt leaders in its former colonies and that it may be shifting toward demanding more accountability foremost , france did not intervene to save ivory coast s president , henri konan bedie , whose party cheated in the 1995 presidential elections and who in recent years arbitrarily changed the constitution to thwart his main rival after mutinous soldiers cast mr bedie out of power in december , the only thing the french government offered him was exile in paris the new ruler , gen robert guei , has pledged to hold elections , though he has yet to announce a date if the french did not intervene in the ivory coast , their most important economic partner in africa , africa experts say it is unlikely that they would do so to support president omar bongo of gabon or president gnassingbe eyadema of togo both men have succeeded in remaining in power for three decades with french support but are increasingly regarded as embarrassments under pressure , mr eyadema , who has led the tiny country of togo for 33 years and is africa s longestruling leader , has agreed to hold legislative elections this year and has announced that he will not run for reelection in 2003 these events have intensified the campaign here in senegal this country of nine million , which has never experienced military rule , has long been considered one of the more politically open in africa , especially since its first president , the politician and poet leopold senghor , introduced multiparty politics in 1976 and resigned voluntarily in 1980
bruce j teitelbaum , the chief fundraiser for mayor rudolph w giuliani s aborted campaign for united states senate , is moving to set up an independent committee to tap money from mr giuliani s national network of contributors , and finance television advertisements on behalf of representative rick a lazio s campaign , said political leaders knowledgeable about the discussions one republican said it was 90 percent certain that mr teitelbaum would go ahead with creating the committee although some details of its structure were still being worked out , the committee would be set up independently of mr lazio , and would be exempt from most restrictions on campaign contributions , one official said as contemplated , the independent committee would provide a muchneeded assist for mr lazio , the suffolk county republican who entered the race only three months ago to replace mr giuliani , who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer mr lazio has been under intense pressure to raise money fast in order to catch up with his opponent , hillary rodham clinton the democratic candidate for senate has collected 186 million , compared with the 85 million accumulated by mr lazio , who has said he needs at least 15 million to be competitive in the race mr teitelbaum is reported to have said he thought he could raise several million dollars from the network of mr giuliani s supporters or , perhaps more accurately , opponents of mrs clinton the money would probably go to finance television advertisements and other activities , like a getoutthevote drive , one official said that said , there are some risks here for mr lazio he has repeatedly criticized mrs clinton for what he has described as campaign finance abuses , in particular , her use of socalled socalled softmoney committees to collect largely unregulated contributions with much fanfare , he signed a new york freedom from soft money pact , while mrs clinton was collecting softmoney contributions in california and he has also campaigned with senator john s mccain , who has led the effort in washington to eliminate soft money , and who is expected to make a television advertisement on mr lazio s behalf mr teitelbaum helped mr giuliani raise 23 million before he quit the race , an amount that stunned mrs clinton and her supporters mr teitelbaum declined to comment this week mr lazio s campaign manager , bill dal col , did not return several calls seeking comment on the committee soft money is largely unregulated contributions raised by political party committees and outside groups by law , it is not supposed to be used to directly promote a candidacy , but parties in general and president clinton in particular have found ways to work around that donations to the official campaign committees , like those set up for mr lazio and mrs clinton , are limited to 2 , 000 mrs clinton s campaign says she has two softmoney accounts set up with outside committees mr lazio has none , according to his aides one official familiar with the negotiations to set up the new committee said that in order to avoid such criticism , the committee being set up would not technically be a softmoney committee , but rather an independent entity that would raise and spend money on its own and , at least officially , without mr lazio s knowledge , to make certain that the committee does not run afoul of election laws that said , aides to mr lazio acknowledged this week that they were aware of what mr teitelbaum , and a small group of other lazio supporters , were trying to do the effort by mr teitelbaum is notable for political , as well as financial , reasons until now , mr giuliani has seemed to offer what many republicans have viewed as perfunctory support for mr lazio , although he did urge his donors to turn over contributions to the congressman photo bruce j teitelbaum , mayor giuliani s chief campaign fundraiser \( richard perry the new york times \)
slimming soaps that slough off fat in the shower miracle pills that get rid of excess pounds without dieting or exercise plastic earplugs that curb the appetite even a glittering ring called fatbegone that when slipped on a finger trims hips , buttocks and thighs after her second baby was born , april mankowsky got to know all the latest weight loss gimmicks and tried her fair share of them , too i'm a fool , said mrs mankowsky , of blue ridge , tex , who recently bought a month s supply of aoqili defat seaweed soap on the internet i knew it was n't going to work but i'm desperate , and the ad said , 'watch the fat go down the drain' since fenfluramine , part of the popular prescription drug combination known as fenphen , was pulled from pharmacy shelves in 1997 for causing dangerous and potentially fatal side effects , dieters have scrambled for a substitute that offers the same dramatic results with as little effort in their search , they have turned quickfix , overthecounter weight loss products from a tiny sliver of the diet industry into its fastestgrowing segment but the surging demand for a weight loss silver bullet has fueled a rapid rise in fraudulent advertising , industry groups and regulators say with increasing bravado , diet companies are flouting federal guidelines to promise the easy solutions consumers have come to expect , even though their products may have no effect on weight loss or may even be harmful in fact , no sooner had fenfluramine been yanked from the market than the indicators of deceptive weight loss marketing began to climb consumer complaints about misleading diet advertisements have more than tripled at the federal trade commission , to 607 last year from 161 in 1997 and , after pursuing only four cases in the first half of the 1990 s , the better business bureau has investigated 24 diet companies in the last five years we 're in the wild west of advertising right now , said andrea levine , director of the bureau s national advertising division we 're seeing claims being made on a whim without a scintilla of evidence , and there s such a huge proliferation of products it s very hard for the regulatory world to get hold of it over all , the 34 billion market for diet products and services has shrunk slightly in the last four years , shaken by fundamental changes in the way americans try to lose weight sales of lowcalorie foods and snacks have dropped 40 percent since 1996 , according to marketdata enterprises , a tampa , fla , research firm sales of diet soft drinks have withered to pre1990 levels weight watchers has been successful , but revenue for commercial weight loss centers as a group has declined by nearly 1 billion in the last decade , pushing jenny craig to the verge of being delisted from the new york stock exchange and though slimfast still sells well , the market for diet shakes and other meal replacements has fallen by half in the last 10 years , reflecting a growing frustration with diets criticized for being slow to work and hard to maintain yet nonprescription pills , dietary supplements and other overthecounter weight loss agents have never been more popular after years of little change , sales of diet pills and supplements have more than quadrupled since 1996 to 782 million this year from 168 million invigorated by the broad retreat from conventional weight loss regimens that require sweat and sacrifice the food and drug administration is considering whether to ban overthecounter access to phenylpropanolamine , a common ingredient in appetite suppressants like acutrim and dexatrim that may increase the risk of stroke in young women but even if it does , the sale of nonprescription diet pills is not likely to slow most of the growth in that market is being driven by dietary supplements whose active ingredients include herbs like ephedra and chitosan , a fiberlike substance derived from shellfish diet industry groups and federal officials say the growing appetite for quickfix weight loss products gives rogue companies ever more incentive to stoke their claims each time a manufacturer succeeds with exaggerated promises , regulators say , several more follow suit , plastering the airwaves and the internet with invitations to drop weight while driving , lose 10 pounds in a weekend and , of course , never diet again take the fatbegone ring , sold on the web by american design , a st louis jewelry maker , and in retail chains like walgreens by tapping into the principles of acupuncture and acupressure , the company s online advertisement said , the coillike trinket can have the same effect as jogging up to six miles a day the ad promised that when worn on the little finger , the ring slims the thighs the ring finger is for the stomach , thumb for the face and so on all with no drugs , no starving , no sweating after repeated interview requests by the new york times , the company removed the web site on which the claims were made and declined to comment
james s jones , an architect whose passion was following packs of basset hounds on foot in pursuit of elusive hares , died nov 13 at a nursing home in chester , nj he was 86 the son of a real estate developer who in the 1920 s sold new yorkers estates in the rolling countryside of central new jersey , he became a fixture in what is now known as the state s horse country but early in his career he could not afford a horse , his friend and fellow hunter joseph b wiley jr said so he did the next best thing he followed the bellowing hounds on foot almost a roughhewn ralph lauren creation , wearing a green not red coat with a robin s eggblue collar , tan shorts and prussian blue stockings , mr jones led a flock of similarly attired adventurers as master of the hunt , he carried the horn to signal the hounds the chronicle of the horse magazine called him dean of the american foot hound hunters in 1953 , he and a friend , haliburton fales ii , started what many aficionados considered the finest foot hunter organization in the united states , the tewksbury foot bassets in pottersville , nj the group was written about in one of the first issues of sports illustrated in the 1960 s , the duke of windsor judged the new jersey club s annual puppy show , and in the 1980 s mr jones judged the prestigious peterborough royal foxhound show in england the masters of basset hounds association in england stood in silence for a few minutes in mr jones s honor at a nov 19 meeting his architectural achievements with several new york city firms and several firms he headed in morristown , nj , included houses , office buildings and churches all along the east coast , his son , f macy jones , said among them is the chapel at rutgers university but for him , all else paled before the floppyeared dogs his highest priority was always the hounds , mr wiley said if longevity conveys credibility , foot hound hunting is not as odd as it may sound xenophon , the greek historian , wrote about the sport in the fifth century bc , and shakespeare referred to what were almost surely basset hounds in a midsummer night s dream in new jersey , the sport long ago reached a level of respectability it is more than tolerated by mounted fox hunters , who , after all , also depend on hounds' sense of smell they think we 're a little funny , said mr wiley , who began hunting with mr jones in 1953 but they tolerate us and always have mr wiley said the satisfaction comes partly from walking with a lowslung , pendulouseared canine with which even he , at 82 , can more or less keep up most inspiring to aficionados is the music of the hounds , when they howl in a range of notes when they catch the scent but the hounds catch the hare only about a quarter of the time mr wiley said a hunt goes pretty much like the fable of the tortoise and the hare the hare darts hundreds of yards ahead , then stops to rest when the hounds approach , the hare , if still awake , takes off mr wiley said the best hunts end with the hare finally going down its hole after a day s chase the hounds feel happy to have brought the hare to the end of its run , he said let s go look for another one james suydam jones was born in far hills , nj , on jan 10 , 1914 he attended the choate school , yale university and the yale school of architecture but hounds were his first love his father , frederick w jones jr , bought two pairs of beagles for him when he was 8 he relished the memory in all its colorful detail in 1971 , in a selfpublished history of hounds in new jersey , he said the hounds were bought from a great character who had become rich selling bootleg liquor to sporting people on wall street the man s wife would attend hound shows with a big box of chocolates on her lap , occasionally tossing candy to the hounds in the ring , causing great confusion mr jones dropped out of architecture school for several years to become master of the hunt with the spring valley hounds , eventually returning to school hounds , it was clear , were his calling he had a natural instinct and hounds were able to detect that , mr wiley said as a beginning architect , he found that he could no longer afford to ride a horse behind foxhounds but he always remained a member of the essex hunt , his father s pride and joy it was the dollar sign that put him on his feet , mr wiley said in 1938 , he married elizabeth macy , an event that drastically reduced my hunting activities , according to his memoir their honeymoon was spent in england , hunting with the westerby pack , known for its highquality basset hounds his wife died in 1985 he is survived by mr jones of wenham , mass his daughter , elizabeth jones dennis of santa fe , nm four grandchildren and three greatgrandchildren ms dennis said her mother was supportive of the hunting but hated sunday nights , when her husband would return with dirty clothing and boots that had to be cleaned others had their troubles with mr jones while hunting indeed , mr wiley said mr jones s nonetoopolite instructions to fellow hunters sometimes caused them to yank off their green jackets and throw them on the ground rex hudson , president of the english basset hounds association , said , he was bawling you out for not being three miles ahead , when at the time you were sitting absolutely exhausted on a tree stump , unable to run another yard in 1967 , mr jones and mr wiley went to england to buy nine basset hounds , which they took home to replenish the genes of the tewksbury pack the english dogs , which are bred for hunting , not a cute appearance , have slightly longer legs and smaller ears known as jimmy , mr jones habitually wore tattered clothes , but only ones that had been of exceptionally high quality when purchased even when he could no longer keep up on hunts , he would occasionally come as a spectator wearing a hacking jacket with scarf fluttering in the breeze , britches and knee socks stuffed into desert boots , dangling pipe and walking stick in hand at hound shows , he wore a top hat about 20 hounds , the best hunters , are expected to be in attendance at his memorial service on friday at st luke s church in gladstone , nj , where he designed the parish house and other architectural features he did n't think he was eccentric , mr wiley said he tried to be normal , but did n't quite make it photo james s jones , front left , during a hunt in the early 1950 s eschewing horses , he was considered the dean of american foot hound hunters

washington it was sheer woman power secretary power , actually that got marcia d greenberger the job as the first fulltime women s rights lawyer in washington back in the early 1970 s , the headiest days of the women s movement , the secretaries at the center for law and social policy went to the male lawyers who founded the group and presented a list of demands they did not want to serve coffee anymore they wanted raises they wanted the center to start a women s rights project and they wanted a female lawyer hired for it enter ms greenberger , two years out of the university of pennsylvania law school and working , with something less than passion , as a tax lawyer in a private firm her first case at the center challenged a company policy excluding pregnancy from disability coverage , and paved the way for the pregnancy discrimination act as well as wednesday s decision by the equal employment opportunity commission that employers whose health plans cover other preventive care must also cover prescription contraceptives but that is skipping a quartercentury ahead of the story when ms greenberger went to interview at the center , the male lawyers were not sure there was enough women s rights work to keep a fulltime lawyer busy she had no doubts , given the array of new federal antidiscrimination laws and her own experiences remember , i went to law school and looked for my first job at a time when there was no law giving women any right to equal treatment , said ms greenberger , now 54 , in her sunny office at the national women s law center , which became independent from the center for law and social policy in 1981 in law school , it was just accepted that they called on women when they got to the rape cases there were about 10 women in her class of 200 , she said , and they were not allowed to live in the law student s dorm but she got to know one dorm resident very well the class was divided alphabetically , and marcia devins was in the same section as michael greenberger they got married after second year mr greenberger now works at the justice department at graduation , he got a clerkship with a washington judge , but the professors discouraged her from applying for one , telling her that most judges did not take women clerks , and no one would want a woman with a husband in another judge s chambers many law firms were none too eager , either one firm told me that they would n't hire women lawyers , because washington was not a safe city , they worked late hours , and they would feel just terrible if anything happened to a young woman going home , ms greenberger said in her measured , lawyerly way i'm still sorry that it was n't until i was out the door that i realized i should have asked what they did for all the women who worked there as assistants ms greenberger , who grew up in philadelphia , was always interested in social justice and policy my father was a teacher and my mother , as we say now , worked in the home , she said they were very politically aware i grew up watching the mccarthy hearings and i was completely swept away by john kennedy when i was finishing law school , i wrote to ask about jobs on capitol hill but i did n't know anyone , i did n't know anyone who knew anyone , and i did n't even know enough to know i should try to make those connections these days , ms greenberger has connections aplenty starting with that first case at the center , she put together a coalition of women s groups there were fewer then to support a union woman challenging general electric s exclusion of pregnancy from disability coverage pregnancy discrimination was common back then , she said pregnancy , or the capacity to become pregnant , was used as a reason not to hire women , or to give them lower pay and not only did ge not cover disability for the recovery period after a normal pregnancy , it did n't even pay for women who were disabled from complications of pregnancy men injured in skiing accidents or bar brawls got disability , but ge said that pregnancy was unique , so different that it was n't covered under title vii s prohibition of sex discrimination in the workplace the case went to the united states supreme court , which in 1976 sided with general electric prompting such a furor that two years later , congress passed the pregnancy discrimination act that law , this week , was the basis for the eeoc s ruling on contraceptive coverage and this time , too , ms greenberger had put together a coalition of women s groups , health groups and civil rights groups to press the issue , laying the groundwork for this week s decision i think women now understand that the law can protect them and that their childbearing capacity is something positive , for which they should not be penalized , ms greenberger said women s rights have come a long way of course , ms greenberger and her causes have their critics business groups say that her efforts to mandate new insurance coverage costs too much and the catholic church and others who oppose abortion are natural opponents and while her two daughters sarah , teaching in the bronx , and anne , in college at her parents' alma mater , penn have broader opportunities than she did , ms greenberger says , the job is by no means finished we have to be very vigilant to defend the rights we 've won , said ms greenberger , who for two decades has shared the copresidency of the center with duffy campbell , an arrangement that lets both women do substantive law and administrative work the center now has a staff of 39 , including 22 lawyers and ms greenberger admits shamefacedly only one man he is a secretary \? administrative assistant , she said photo marcia d greenberger , a lawyer for women \(

yesterday turned out to be a day to kick the tires , check the oil and generally make sure everything was ready for the big event and to see how many times on how many channels dick cheney could be asked the same halfdozen questions before he would reach over and strangle his interrogator with his microphone cord many of the web sites threatening roundtheclock coverage of the 2000 republican national convention in philadelphia had not yet begun streaming , but the sunday morning television talk shows were filled with nothing else and already there was not an hour in the day when some sort of conventionrelated snippet could not be found on one or another channel philadelphia , you know , is home to cheesesteaks its downtown has had a major renaissance under democrats ! cheesesteaks are made with thinly sliced ribeye steak and served with or without onions the first televised presidential convention was also held in philadelphia , 52 years ago and now , the city is host to the first convention to be given the full internet treatment this point was made several times , on several channels indeed , a whole new news media area has been set up for web journalists at the convention it is being called internet alley tours were available on at least two networks gov george w bush s vicepresidential choice , mr cheney , was on meet the press on nbc , face the nation on cbs , this week on abc , fox news sunday and late edition with wolf blitzer on cnn \( which bills itself as the last word in sunday talk , would that it were true \) displaying none of the puppydog enthusiasm that former vice president dan quayle exhibited when chosen by governor bush s father in 1988 , mr cheney was an ostentatiously subdued presence in his marathon of interviews on fox , he described president clinton as an enormous embarrassment to the country , who was also a tragic figure with fundamental flaws this was about as close to controversy as mr cheney allowed himself to get he complained about being interrogated about congressional votes he had cast two decades ago opposing bans on plastic guns , for example , and against the clean water act and said it was all part of a democratic plan to demonize him this is exactly the sort of thing we 've seen in the gore campaign , mr cheney told the host of meet the press , tim russert attack , attack meet the press had the democratic strategist james carville and the republican strategist william j bennett to kick things around mr bennett said that the soontobe democratic nominee , vice president al gore , had been exhibiting several personalities in recent months , including affable al and uncle al the kiddies' pal , none of which were catching on with voters unfair , mr carville said , the vice president has not yet had a chance to emerge on this week , they went with a tagteam format first , sam donaldson did a semiaggressive number on mr cheney , to little effect so far , i am not bleeding from any part of my body , mr cheney observed then , cokie roberts was ingratiating and chatty with lynne cheney , the candidate s wife , who got her back up when the questions turned to the sexual orientation of one of their daughters i am appalled at the media interest in my two daughters , she said face the nation had what it called an exclusive talk with senator john mccain , governor bush s chief opponent in the primaries \( although mr mccain had already been heard from on sunday morning s edition of today \) some had wondered , somewhat optimistically , whether mr mccain would enliven the otherwise cutanddried convention by saying something intemperate , but he made it clear he would be a good boy governor bush has been running exactly the sort of campaign i would be running , he said the biggest display of emotion came during late edition , when a democratic strategist , robert shrum , and the former republican party chief haley barbour took each other on for a few moments , there was such partisan rancor that it was like a blast from a previous decade otherwise , even the internet offered little escape from dramafree reasonableness the party s official convention site , www gopconvention com , included items like a test your gop iq quiz \( how many times has the party met in philadelphia \?

there are two bloodlines in modern puppetry the low subversive tradition of punch and judy , which is sometimes called marketplace puppetry and the high tradition of asian religious ritual and court ceremony , including indonesian shadow puppets and japanese bunraku punch and judy tend to bang into each other the movement is bawdy and slapstick , and the action and speech are often explicit and violent in a way that would not be tolerable or feasible in human theater high puppetry \( which is not necessarily better than low puppetry \) is gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful in ballet it is a language for the superhuman , for gods and heroes , for stories told time out of mind to audiences that frequently know the narrative by heart the task facing organizers of the first international festival of puppet theater , in 1992 , was to win adult audiences to the art form that was accomplished to some extent by presenting the political and marketplace puppetry that used to dominate the american scene \( examples range from the bread and puppet theater of vermont to the halloween parade in greenwich village \) the work proved its seriousness with its urgent themes but now that the festival has become an established part of the new york theater world , its organizers are less constrained they have the leeway to examine other boundaries of puppetry and that is what they are doing in this year s festival , which starts on wednesday and runs though sept 24 many performances \( among more than 200 by 26 companies on 14 stages \) are clearly indebted to the high tradition , and many of them could be featured in an international festival of dance one day recently , cheryl henson , the festival s executive producer , spoke about the evolution of puppetry over the last few years and of the illusion that lies at the heart of the art as she described the performances , her long and beautiful fingers became a pair of amazing legs then an indrawn hand became a face then her palms spread wide to comment on the movement of a bird the motions were dancerly when this was pointed out to her , she replied that she was unaware of it but said you see , we have both the object as body and the body as object the popular image of the puppeteer is that he manipulates his characters , as though they existed in time and were being pushed into his purposes but that s a literary construct you are bringing the object to life and it becomes a puppet when it is animated the magic of transcendence is in the details the french compagnie philippe genty , which played to standingroom audiences in 1992 , is returning with a piece , stowaways , in which people , puppets and complex poetic props and sets are all conflated in a confabulation of gesture you forget , watching this material , that humans and objects are different from each other in salome , the new york performance artist hanne tierny uses disembodied pieces of fabric , metal and live improvised music to mesmeric effect in her presentation of oscar wilde s play in echo trace , heather henson , cheryl s younger sister who works out of orlando , fla , uses light and motion to create a whirling reality as fluid as the refracted planes seen through a kaleidoscope she reduces human and nonhuman forms to pattern the festival also includes variants on more traditional high puppet work , including an allfemale bunraku troupe from japan \( a complete schedule can be found at www hensonfestival org \) dance is an art of controlled movement , and so is puppetry the two fields have become increasingly intimate yet , while dance pushes the body to its limits , puppetry can explore what lies beyond those limits both dance and puppetry use movement as a means of communication , says the performance artist dan hurlin , who teaches dance and puppetry at sarah lawrence college and who will be presenting two new works in this year s festival i always tell my students not to use the puppet like a microphone is it really necessary that your puppets talk \? any given puppet can do only a limited number of things , and if you do n't have to waste precision on the jaw , you can do far more with the figure like many others who are performing this year , mr hurlin visibly shares the stage with his puppets the miracle here is that you so believe in the life of the inanimate object that you keep your eye fixed there rather than on the puppeteer increasingly , the performer uses his own body and the body of the puppet , giving an object motions he cannot make himself in what cheryl henson calls a gestural ventriloquy you have a kind of freedom , practical and aesthetic , that has parallels in film but none in live performance , she explains david r white , who has presented puppetry at dance theater workshop , where he is the director , has also worked closely with festival organizers there s always a kind of uncertainty in dance about who s in charge , he says dancers talk about what they contributed and whether they get credit puppets do n't talk about that they reveal a kind of godinthemachine aspect of the social contract choreographers have given human beings a grace that lifts them above the human , and puppeteers give human grace to inanimate objects at a great dance performance , ms henson says , you are often distracted from a dancer s humanity mr white says you are already suspending disbelief when you accept a toe shoe as a foot , when you allow for the proscenium puppetry goes the rest of the way it allows you to examine what life can exist when the humanity is eliminated in this time of rapidly developing technologies , puppets are engineering with a human face puppetry is a mechanics of being and mr hurlin adds , puppetry is a threeway mirror of design , engineering and dramaturgy in his aesthetics , friedrich schiller speaks of how the shapeless gesture and the confused noises of perception begin to obey a rhythm and weld themselves into a song gesture is the most popular word among practitioners of high puppet arts , and it is the honing of gesture into a series of astonishing rhythms that makes for the success of this work though they can appear compellingly fragile , figurative puppetry and nonfigurativeobject theater are robust media for formal abstraction this year s festival is full of meanings and stories , but it is also a cavalcade of beautiful movement for much of which language is only a backdrop it is a great leap outward , startlingly different from and enchantingly similar to the conventions of modern dance as radical and fresh as the first inventions of martha graham or isadora duncan photos at top , compagnie philippe genty presents the surreal puppet show stowaways above , the heather henson troupe of orlando offers echo trace , a celebration of universal rhythms \( glen turner \) \( philippe genty \)
the commercial opens on a picturesque shot of smoky mountains , followed by a montage of simple country scenes a flatbed truck filled with barrels rambling down a country lane and a closeup of a weathered and lined old man all set to a countrystyle instrumental it is a familiar image that has been used to sell jack daniel s tennessee whiskey in magazine advertising since the 1950 s but it is now appearing in an unfamiliar but more powerful setting on television the hard liquor industry , which has operated under a selfimposed radio and television advertising ban since shortly after the repeal of prohibition , quietly dropped its own broadcast prohibition in 1996 and since then , slowly and with little fanfare , the nation s top distilled spirits companies those that make vodka , gin , whiskey , rum and the like have turned to the airwaves to promote their products though acceptance , especially on television , is sporadic and still limited nationally , such ads are the first signs of the industry s attempt to use all the methods of modern marketing to reverse years of declining sales in the united states liquor companies say their absence from television had become a relic , placing them at a competitive disadvantage against beer and wine , which have advertised on the air for years distillers say the united states despite its puritan heritage is becoming more european in attitude , and the public is now willing to accept liquor advertising on television and radio but critics disagree , arguing that there is no public benefit in advertising hard liquor on the airwaves instead , they say , to avoid encouraging underage drinking and to protect public health , all alcoholic beverage promotions beer and wine advertising included should be limited and more carefully regulated with this in mind , the industry appears to be moving carefully to avoid attacks the national television networks including most cable networks continue to ban liquor advertising and drinking in general is something that television programming tries hard not to glamorize , said robert j thompson , director of the center for the study of popular television at syracuse university but beer drinking , he added , has always been more acceptable in the past decade especially , television has been really careful about showing drinking , he said in 'cheers , ' for example , there was virtually no reference to hard liquor it was barely served there but beer has a social lubricant quality to it think of drew carey or norm take away beer and you would n't have the same character last year , liquor advertising on television and radio totaled some 18 million , up from virtually nothing in 1995 compared with the estimated 255 million the liquor industry spent in print advertising , broadcast advertising of liquor is a drop in the bottle but that is changing this year two major brands , captain morgan spiced rum , and bacardi , began multimilliondollar campaigns that included television other popular brands , like allied domecq s kahlua and crown royal and chivas regal , both owned by joseph e seagram sons inc , continued their nascent tv campaigns tv is the quickest way to build a brand , said joe tripodi , chief marketing officer at the seagram spirits and wine group in new york industry officials said television would help make mixed drinks as socially acceptable as , say , having a beer our kahlua ads build brand awareness and reinforce the fact that responsible , moderate consumption of distilled spirits is socially acceptable , said matt wiant , a marketing vice president at allied domecq spirits and wine north america today , mr tripodi said , it is possible to advertise on television and reach an overwhelmingly adult audience something that was impossible to do years ago when the three major networks reached a mass audience and the market was difficult to segment the growth of a diverse media marketplace , where programs and whole networks are tailored to adults , is the main reason the industry says it was able to drop its broadcast ad ban at the same time , just about every major liquor brand in the country has now adopted radio advertising , said judy blatman , spokeswoman at the distilled spirits council of the united states , a washington trade group known as discus for years , distillers were resentful that beer and wine could advertise on television and radio with little restriction during the 1980 s and much of the 1990 s , liquor sales lost a substantial portion of the overall market for alcoholic beverages to wine and beer , though lately liquor sales have risen slightly we vie for market share with beer and wine and yet we 're being discriminated against , ms blatman said all forms of beverage alcohol should be judged by the same criteria there s no such thing as soft and hard alcohol alcohol is alcohol there is a long precedent in american culture , however , for treating the forms of alcohol differently , said mr thompson of syracuse distillers have found that getting the media to agree to equivalency has not been easy the national association of broadcasters said none of the broadcast television and radio networks accept hard liquor advertising most local affiliate and independent stations , which are free to make their own decisions , continue to refuse liquor ads , said dennis wharton , an association spokesman in washington the cabletelevision advertising bureau said nearly all the cable networks had similar exclusionary policies for hard liquor marketers want to make it look like there s a huge upswing when we are not hearing that at all , mr wharton said certainly there s been no huge uptick
it s 2 30 on a monday morning , and things are just getting under way a jazz quintet is playing up in front of the small subterranean room , which is filled nearly to capacity candlelight reflects from the decorations on the wall dim photographs of jazz legends from days gone by , odd sections of brass instruments oxidized by years of smoky air seated around small round tables or on padded benches along the wall , people bob in time to the music , smiling and humming between sips of beer no clear line divides performance from audience instead of playing on a stage , the musicians squeeze into a tiny area cleared around the beatup baby grand piano even the band has blurry boundaries halfway through a song , the tenor sax player hands his instrument to a man sitting on the sidelines the man takes a solo without leaving his seat , then hands the sax back to his friend , who finishes the song with a reprise of the melody this is the eighth consecutive hour of music , and the fourth band when the final set ends around 3 30 am , the last barrier between band and audience will fall there will be an open jam session , and all comers are welcome to test their jazz mettle in public the jam will continue until the music peters out or until dawn , whichever comes first when the session finally ends , 12 straight hours of music will come to a close it is a marathon at most clubs , but just another night at smalls in an age and a city where jazz is increasingly considered the realm of the elite , a quaint relic of a bygone era best preserved in the rarefied air of lincoln center or nearmuseums like birdland and played only by a handful of revered masters and their humble acolytes , smalls stands out like a blue note in a major scale few famous names grace its roster , and most of the players are under 30 and in the wee hours of a weekday night , when the band is hot and the air is full of smoke and sweat , the atmosphere is anything but rarefied if smalls sounds like a bit of an anachronism , it is alive and real for the musicians who play there in the five years since the club opened on west 10th street , a block away from the noise and traffic of seventh avenue south , smalls has become something of an institution among young jazz players and a growing number of jazz fanatics and although the quality of the music varies from night to night , the club is , in the words of ehud asherie , a 20yearold pianist who is one of the club s denizens , unique in the whole world there s no other jazz club like it , really , adds mr asherie , who got his start at smalls as a high school sophomore it is paradoxical that a club like smalls should be such a rarity for more than half a century , new york was the crucible where jazz was forged like an alloy of the city s many cultures , jazz was continually remolded into something new , thrown back into the furnace before it got a chance to harden change was the only constant , and experimentation was the key to change from harlem down to midtown manhattan and the village , in clubs like minton s playhouse and the onyx , musicians poured in when their money gigs were over , and then the real music would begin mainstream acceptance of jazz contributed to the decline of this tradition as musicians flocked to university jazz programs and audiences to upscale venues , most jam sessions were relegated to the status of amateur night smalls turns this equation on its head while no other club in new york city today offers the sheer volume of scheduled music smalls does , it also far exceeds other jazz clubs in the amount of time dedicated to jam sessions the four or five hours of music available at the more famous jazz spots in the neighborhood , like sweet basil and the village vanguard , pale in comparison to smalls' allnighters while more established clubs often charge upward of 25 for an hourlong set , smalls charges a flat fee for a night of music 10 and while weekly jam sessions are virtually a given at jazz clubs of any size , only smalls allows its guests to bring their instruments and play seven nights a week the scores of young jazz fans who line up around the block on a chilly friday night to get into smalls probably are n't thinking about a dying new york tradition but they do sense an aura of history about the club that belies its tender age it s like the musicians are still here in spirit , says amelie develay , a slight , waifishlooking brunette who moved to new york from france last spring , as she scans the images of jazz greats enshrined on the wall for ms develay , 24 , a freelance journalist , it s her first visit to smalls , and she s entranced by the dinginess it s nice because it s not a clean place , she says one table away , phil cappello , 22 , a television reporter for rnn , a cable news network that serves the new york area , sits nursing a beer this place has a pretty rich history , says mr cappello , who has been a regular at smalls

it did not take city inspectors long to figure out why an apartment building being constructed in williamsburg , brooklyn , collapsed on nov 23 , killing a laborer in the debris they said poorly braced beams gave way as concrete was poured to create the building s third floor but if there was no mystery about the collapse , at 50 middleton street , there was plenty of disbelief , even fury for nearly four years , documents show , the fire department had been warning the city s buildings department about the dangerous practices of the project s owner and builder , eugene ostreicher fire inspectors had responded to four similar collapses involving ostreicher projects in williamsburg , including one three months earlier in the complex where the final , fatal accident occurred they had pleaded with the buildings department to intervene , fearing that someone would be killed they had filed reports , requested inspections and highlighted the easily correctable nature of the accidents the buildings department , however , had chosen at nearly every stage to allow mr ostreicher who had already settled a suit filed by the state attorney general over another faulty project to continue building , accepting promises from his engineer that safety at the sites would be checked in doing so , the agency was following a policy it contends had become increasingly necessary turning over much of the responsibility for inspections and safety monitoring to engineers and architects hired by the developers themselves looking at it all , it made you wonder does the builder know what he s doing \? deputy fire chief charles r blaich said in an interview but , he added the fire department was so frustrated we could n't get the buildings department to do squat indeed , interviews and documents , including more than 1 , 000 pages of city records recently released in mr ostreicher s case , suggest that at a time when construction is booming across the city , this selfpolicing policy can be disastrous through his lawyer , mr ostreicher denied wrongdoing , and the extent of his culpability in the fatal collapse is under investigation earlier this month , the federal occupational safety and health administration cited one of his companies for willfully violating workersafety laws at 50 middleton street and proposed a 118 , 000 fine , and federal prosecutors are considering criminal charges investigators , prompted in part by a former senior buildings department official s contention that city hall had forced him to resign because he was too tough on hasidic builders in brooklyn , are also exploring whether mr ostreicher , who is hasidic , ever benefited from political favoritism from the giuliani administration but for many , the lost opportunities for aggressive action , combined with mr ostreicher s ability to keep building with minimal oversight by the buildings department , underscore the potential problems with the shift to selfpolicing as budget cuts have reduced the number of inspectors in recent years , building officials say they have had to depend more than ever on commercial engineers and architects to keep contractors in line this system had been used to a limited extent for decades but under the giuliani administration , new york has moved much further in this direction than any other large american city in theory , the architects and engineers have little reason to tolerate shoddy practices because they could lose their licenses if a calamity occurs but because the developers pay their fees , and there is intense pressure to stick to construction schedules , critics say this approach is ripe for abuse in the eyes of some cornercutting builders and developers , the odds are in their favor , so they roll the dice , said archie spigner , a queens democrat who is chairman of the city council s housing and buildings committee mr ostreicher , a 67yearold hungarian immigrant , and his son , chaim , who runs part of the family s construction business , declined to be interviewed their engineer , abraham hertzberg , also would not comment frank b mandel , the ostreichers' lawyer , said the collapses did not occur because of bad building practices , but were the kind of things that can happen at construction sites mr mandel denied city regulators' contentions that there had been serious problems in bracing the beams and said that one collapse occurred because of a relatively minor mistake by a worker he said that mr ostreicher had relied on mr hertzberg , who had inspected the sites regularly , and there was absolutely nothing done here that was improper by mr ostreicher but while buildings department officials also defend their actions , some fire officials say the ostreicher case provides a stepbystep guide to what has gone wrong in safety enforcement in recent years , a few noteworthy instances of selfpolicing failures have come to light with skyscrapers in manhattan in one case , repairs were belatedly made at donald j trump s riverside south project after a contractor ignored an engineer s order to reject weak concrete and erected new floors on top of it
decades from now it will be said that in the late 20th century the world saw an odd and wonderful artistic phenomenon it will be added in wistful tones that it was a pity it did n't last , but not a surprise historians will be speaking of chinese brother artist teams , two pairs and a trio who lived either in mainland china or in the united states and spent their lifetimes living and working together as if they were one person , putting their collective energies into the creation of \( what was then \) very contemporary art even in china , where the political risk of creating art has demanded the insularity of tightknit cliques \( able to commiserate or jointly shoulder crackdowns or backlashes \) , brother artists teams are an anomaly some doubters in the future may question whether the gao , zhou and luo brothers ever really existed they did they do they flourish , for now one of the first pairs to appear was zhou shanzuo and zhou dahuang , from guangxi province in southern china painters and sculptors who emigrated to chicago in the 80 s , the zhou brothers work simultaneously on giant canvases and lifesize sculptures wordlessly enacting what they call a dream dialogue the younger , dahuang , is ambidextrous , and the two are able to paint standing next to each other , as if they were one body using both hands the zhou brothers started collaborating in 1973 shanzuo was 21 and dahuang was 16 since then they have been nearly inseparable working , traveling and even living together at one point they were even married to sisters when asked why they work together instead of individually shanzuo explained , in a telephone interview , that it was because they both had the same childhood dream of art but dahuang explained it differently i 've always believed destruction is the meaning of new creation , he said i may go to get a coffee and find that my brother has covered a part of a painting i did for one artist it would not be so easy to keep things this interesting oscar friedl , the director of the oscar friedl gallery in chicago as well as an agent for and longtime friend of the zhou brothers , elaborated on dahuang s explanation their art is about being able to take yourself back to the extent that you serve the creative process rather than your own ego if it s a tolerant team , the exchange , the evaluation between good and bad , is so much quicker it goes bang , bang , bang it slides back and forth the creative process is speeded up , almost doubled they are just the beginning of the real potential of collaborative art mr friedl envisions that the next phase of art history will be populated with collaborative teams i think the separation between viewer and artist will get thinner and thinner and eventually disappear , he said reclusive thinking wo n't work in the future certainly vitaly komar of the wellknown russian artist team komar and melamid \( friends , not brothers \) agrees in painting by numbers komar and melamid s scientific guide to art , a book by joann wypijewski about their work , mr komar declares the old romantic view of artist is a travesty of monotheism and now i would say , conscious coauthorship is the only fundamentally new direction in art since the discovery of the abstract if coauthorship is a new direction , it will probably be the road less traveled teamwork is about the subversion of the ego , as zhou dahuang attested , and it is unlikely that the future of art will embrace this sort of selflessness any more than the history of art has to this point , although it is a nice vision speaking with the luo , gao and zhou brothers reveals that there are decidedly unromantic practicalities and very strong family ties rather than ideologies driving them to work together luo weidong , luo weiguo and luo weibing make up the luo brothers , a trio from guangxi like the zhous , they also live and work together , sharing a typical chinese courtyard home in the suburbs of beijing the team uses a traditional lacquer technique to create images of bright red chinese calendars with all the common symbols of luck and prosperity , like chubby babies , ripe peaches or fat fish they paint images of famous brands names like cocacola or fanta , casio or motorola into these standard scenes it s a very laborintensive process , says yvonne force , who is the president of her own curatorial consulting firm , referring to the luo brothers' layered lacquer technique ms force included the work of the luo brothers in a 1998 show at the lehman maupin gallery in soho they are like a studio , all working together , she added it s like an artist with assistants the work of the luo brothers has been described by the chinese art critic li xianting as being part of a beijingbased trend called gaudy art the paintings depict brandname items within a scene that is the chinese equivalent of a velvet poster of dogs playing cards , thereby revealing the inherent tackiness of the rampant consumerism that has emerged out of the ashes of communist china but there is no nostalgia in their work for the mao era on the contrary , consumerism is depicted as the rightful heir to a corrupt and morally bankrupt system
on election day all across america , nearly every candidate for major office will be photographed casting an early morning ballot at the local polling place those photographs and film clips have become a ritual over time , a portrait of the politician alone in the one truly transitive moment of the election it makes you wonder what it means to people so used to seeing their names in print to see them in print in the one place that matters on the ballot certainly , the candidates stride out of the booths with practiced zeal , the curtains shot back , other voters perhaps startled by the sound , by the brisk ceremony , the sense of a duty discharged this is the most precisely level moment in the election , the moment when the candidate , no matter who , is just another voter , no different in any respect from the other voters who will drop by during polling hours otherwise , the day could not be less scenic the kind of crowd found in the county election , painted by george caleb bingham in 1851 , is absent at the polling place , for better and worse the lastminute placardbearers and leafleteers keep their distance , and as a result most voters feel , when they walk into the school building or community center or town hall where they vote , that they are entering a protected zone , at whose center is the booth itself in bingham s painting , that protected electoral zone is very small just the space defined by an official swearing a voter to his oath on an outstretched bible the ordinary uses of the world the horsetrading and beerselling , the sales pitches and ribald jokes begin just a step away the only privacy in bingham s painting lies in the voter s conscience in our modern democracy , the emblem of that privacy a public privacy is the voting booth , and a less picturesque apparatus it is hard to imagine the pageantry and the punditry of the long campaign season lead , for each individual voter , to a few solitary moments in a bland , utilitarian confessional whose purpose is to conceal the details of the confession the electoral history of the united states is full of vivid campaign paraphernalia knownothing bandannas , zachary taylor chintzes , bull moose lapel pins , punchedtin mckinley lanterns , each of them an avowal of political affiliation none of them picture the act of voting it is very hard , after all , to portray a right but there is something grand , something memorable and moving , in the execution of that right the poll watchers check us off their lists , watch us enter one by one they hear the shuttle of our votes being thrown , the curtains drawn back as we step out of the booth they sense the pause as each of us stands before the ballot and believes whatever it is we need to believe to cast a vote an ideal republic forms in the heads of some voters others vote their pocketbooks , their prejudices some of us vote the way our parents did , the ways we wish our children might we vote on single interests and on abstract principles , for reasons that are sometimes cogent , sometimes not even if there were no more pressing reason to vote , there is always the one inviolable reason , which is to preserve the possibility of voting verlyn klinkenborg
the state legislature voted yesterday to notify the public about malpractice judgments and disciplinary actions against doctors practicing in new york state the information would be posted on the internet and available through a tollfree telephone number the measure , which gov george e pataki said he was studying , would put new york among a handful of states that give consumers extensive information about the practice histories of doctors and the quality of hospitals the state already provides a web site listing the names of doctors it has taken disciplinary action against , but it contains much less information than the new law would require also , few new yorkers know about the site , health care policy experts say the bill would require the department of health to post on its web site everything from the mundane doctors' education , hospital affiliations , professional awards to the damning malpractice history and hospital dismissals that stemmed from harm to patients the measure would also require the state health commissioner to develop a notice to be posted in hospital and doctors' offices alerting patients to the site , and to an 800 number that they might also call to get the listings in another lastminute agreement early thursday morning , the assembly and the senate resolved a procedural squabble and passed a hate crimes bill that mr pataki said he intended to sign the bill provides tougher penalties for a variety of crimes when the victims are singled out on the basis of race , religion , sex , sexual orientation , age or disability the assembly had passed it , in various forms , 11 years in a row , but the senate had refused until this year , balking in particular at the inclusion of sexual orientation in the list of victim classes the malpractice notification bill had been foundering in the senate earlier this year , but it gained momentum late in the session after several charges of egregious negligence were brought by the state against doctors and hospitals it was further bolstered by an order to all 50 states by president clinton to improve the reporting of medical errors the president s decree followed a report that 44 , 000 to 98 , 000 hospital patients per year die because of medical mistakes the bill was strongly opposed by doctors but was supported by an unusual coalition of insurance companies and consumer groups empire blue cross and blue shield placed several fullpage newspaper advertisements in favor of the bill , and patients' rights groups , many formed by people harmed by doctors with records of malpractice , haunted albany awaiting an outcome we have been strongly advocating for a law that will provide important information and reduce medical errors , said leslie moran , a spokeswoman for the new york health plan association my belief is this bill points us in the right direction the measure , known as the health information and quality improvement bill , would also require the state to develop other qualityassurance measures for the public , such as regularly published hospital report cards and data about the outcomes of various procedures , like the state s current statistics on heart surgery survival rates in the end , we will have the most extensive information among the states that consumers can use , said state senator kemp hannon , the health committee chairman other states with aggressive reporting laws include massachusetts , which was the assembly s model for its bill , and florida it is still unclear whether governor pataki will ultimately sign the bill , which he has voiced measured support for all year at a news conference yesterday , he said he was not familiar enough with the details of the bill to make a commitment five versions of the bill , some from the state senate and others from the assembly , wound their way through negotiations until the senate finally approved a version early yesterday morning the assembly , loath to surrender parts of the bill that its members had considered crucial , finally voted to approve the bill before lunch yesterday among the assembly s concessions was a clause that ensures doctors that lawsuit settlements would normally be disclosed on the state s web site only if a doctor settled more than two suits in a 10year period but even if there were just one or two settlements , the state could disclose them if the health commissioner found that they were of great interest to public health the assembly had wanted all such settlements over 10 years listed a separate bill that would have required officebased surgical centers to report errors died on the senate floor hospitals are required to report incidents in which patients are harmed the assembly s version of the bill would have held surgeries performed in doctors' offices to the same reporting standards but doctors , who hated that provision , found a way to defeat it , albeit at a price legislators lifted an old cap on the amount that lawyers could reap from malpractice suits , and some lawmakers said that this gave the doctors enough leverage to block the officebased surgery bill the senate took care of the lawyers and doctors and left patients hanging , said assemblyman richard n gottfried , chairman of the assembly s health committee but , he added , this is clearly at least twothirds of a loaf , which is a lot better than none doctors have long asserted that malpractice judgments were often misleading , and that patients did not understand , for instance , that some specialties , like obstetrics and neurosurgery , generate a disproportionate number of cases frankly , we continue to oppose the agreement , said michael s murphy , a spokesman for the state medical society , which had lobbied hard against the bill he added that doctors took some consolation that the legislature recognized that new york s tort system cannot be an absolute measure of physician competence many parts of the bill address highprofile cases brought by the state against doctors in the last two years the case that set the assembly in motion was the death of lisa smart , who died during a normally routine gynecological surgery at beth israel medical center in manhattan an assisting surgeon in the operation , dr marc sklar , was on probation with the state at the time , as was another doctor in his practice under the new law , the web site , http www health state ny us nysdoh opmc mainhtm , would post the names of other doctors in practice with the doctor in question the new requirement of listing the hospitals where doctors have lost their right to practice was apparently in response to the case earlier this year of dr allan zarkin , who carved his initials into a patient s skin after delivering her baby dr zarkin was fired from the hospital where the baby was delivered , but he went on to work at an abortion clinic for several months while the state investigated this is an excellent beginning , said connie wynne , whose son alexander died last year of complications that stemmed from what she contends was a botched delivery by a doctor with a history of malpractice judgments and settlements and state disciplinary actions she did not know about the existing web site when her son was born in 1998 , but the site would not have mentioned the malpractice history anyway if people have access to information , then that will be great , ms wynn said i believe my son would be alive had this been passed earlier
sigmund freud s theory of psychoanalysis has been challenged and revised from the moment it was conceived now freud s very words \( at least as they have been rendered in english \) are being revised in several new translations that will appear in the next few years like all things psychoanalytic , the freud dispute over copyright law , the fine points of translation and the meaning of freud s work itself admits of several conflicting interpretations what is not in dispute , however , is that at the end of next year penguin books will begin releasing the first parts of a newly translated 16volume edition of freud s works and in 2002 , the hogarth press will publish a revised version of the 24volume standard edition of freud , translated by james strachey and published between 1955 and 1967 with the copyright to the original translation expiring , penguin books sensed an opportunity for a more modern edition emphasizing freud the humanist rather than freud the clinician and scientist \( the perspective that strachey s translation favored \) the task of editing the penguin project fell to adam phillips , the writer and psychoanalyst the author of a series of slender philosophical investigations into the vagaries of the human condition \( on kissing , tickling and being bored , the beast in the nursery , terrors and experts , on flirtation , monogamy , darwin s worms \) , mr phillips is a significant literary presence in britain he is a regular contributor to the london review of books and has been described by the times of london as the martin amis of british psychoanalysis , for his brilliantly amusing and often profoundly unsettling work but in many respects , mr phillips is an unlikely candidate to edit a major new edition of freud a selfdescribed expert in the truths of uncertainty , he writes enigmatic essays replete with quietly subversive aphorisms \( the psychoanalyst sustains his competence by resisting his own authority he learns how not to know what he is doing and how to go on doing it \) that have led some to label him the antifreudian freudian gazing down at st patrick s cathedral from a 44thfloor hotel room during a recent trip to new york , mr phillips , 45 , has the sad eyes and shaggy rockstar mane that make him resemble a poet more than a revolutionary he says his misgivings about psychoanalysis are directed less at freud than at those who have reduced his creation to a science of sensible passions , a therapeutic form of conformism psychoanalysis has become a very dreary profession indeed , he says it is terribly puritanical , moralistic and coercive the institutionalization of analysis has killed its wilder spirit the craving for academic respectability has made analysts want to be recognized either as real scientists or real artists they are n't comfortable sustaining the ambiguity that comes with being neither an entirely different atmosphere surrounded the original , authorized translation advised by anna freud and a committee of her father s colleagues , strachey had no doubts that psychoanalysis was a thoroughly scientific undertaking although his translation has been consistently praised for its magisterial victorian prose , strachey has been criticized for concocting an awkward vocabulary \( the greek cathexis and parapraxis , for example , or the latin ego and id for freud s unpretentious das ich and das es \) strachey is also said to have medicalized psychoanalysis by imposing a spurious scientific consistency on freud s sprawling works what made the strachey translation totally acceptable in the englishspeaking world for over two decades is precisely what makes it problematic today , wrote sander gilman in a 1991 article in the international review of psychoanalysis in contrast , mr phillips says he intends to present a freud for our times , a secular , literary freud who is seen to be like every other writer endlessly redescribable and retranslatable to this end , the penguin freud will be part of the modern masters series , which includes such writers as joyce and proust to underscore the project s iconoclasm , mr phillips has organized the books thematically rather than chronologically , and hired a group of literary translators , none of whom has a connection to psychoanalysis or are expected to use a uniform set of psychoanalytic terms rather than impose his editorial voice on the entire project , mr phillips is writing the introduction for only one volume \( on wild analysis \) and commissioning prefaces for the others from a distinguished group of academics , none of whom has a clinical psychoanalytic background for example , mark edmundson , a professor of english at the university of virginia , is introducing the repetition volume \( which includes beyond the pleasure principle , inhibition , symptom and anxiety and on narcissism \) with an essay on freud and shakespeare i think a literary translation will capture some of what has been lost in freud an unconscious and a conscious ambiguity in the writing , and an interest in sentences , in the fact that language is evocative as well as informative , mr phillips observes
austin , tex , may 6 the oncemighty texas democratic party , whose fabled leaders lyndon b johnson and sam rayburn dominated not just the state but also the nation , has fallen on very hard times of today s 29 officials elected statewide in texas , none are democrats senator kay bailey hutchison , a republican , faces only token democratic opposition in her reelection campaign this year , which is more opposition than the party is providing in most statewide races and much to the chagrin of the democratic state chairwoman , molly beth malcolm , several democratic legislators are out campaigning with none other than the secondterm governor , george w bush , soon to be the republican presidential nominee i'm disappointed they would do that , said ms malcolm , who returned from vacation in italy to find that her members were consorting with the enemy they are not representing the democratic party other than the most partisan republicans , few people in texas would argue that democrats are powerless or obsolete , particularly since the party still controls the congressional delegation and the texas house of representatives but as mr bush campaigns for the white house , democrats are consumed by a parochial , less glamorous electoral agenda , including legislative races and preparing for the 2002 run for governor and few elected democrats are willing to make trouble for the popular mr bush the state s most famous democrat , former gov ann w richards , who spends much of her time as a washington lobbyist , is among those who have refrained from attacking the man who defeated her in 1994 the state s most powerful democrat , pete laney , speaker of the texas house , has so far stayed out of the presidential race other conservative democrats in the legislature either like mr bush personally or are wary of antagonizing him as their districts become increasingly republican there s no percentage in giving bush a hard time , said harvey kronberg , publisher of the quorum report , a widely read online newsletter covering texas politics that detente is a timely gift for mr bush as he positions himself as a coalition builder who would foster bipartisanship in washington by contrast , arkansas republicans tried to crush bill clinton in 1992 , maligning his record and his character and leaving little doubt of their goal defeating the enemy at all costs , recalled richard bearden , then the executive director of the arkansas republican party , and bill clinton was the enemy unlike arkansas , where republicans felt little incentive to play nice with mr clinton , texas has a tradition of bipartisanship and chauvinism that for some democrats outweighs any national party loyalties for most texans , it s a nobrainer , one texas democrat , george christian , press secretary to president johnson , said of the 2000 race it s an acceptable , bipartisan texan running for president merle black , a political scientist at emory university , said testimonials from homestate allies whom many voters across the country might find unexpected could provide credibility for presidential candidates introducing themselves to a national audience coming out of georgia in 1976 , jimmy carter enlisted the civil rights leader andrew young to help demonstrate that he was a southern democrat of a sort different from the racebaiting george c wallace in the same vein , mr black said , mr bush is enlisting texas democrats to help reassure voters that he is different from the combative congressional republicans of the 1990 s bush is trying to show that he s not newt gingrich , he s not tom delay , he s not dick armey , mr black said though the decline of the texas democrats has roots in the 1960 s , the unequivocal slap in the face from the voters came in 1998 , when the party lost every one of more than a dozen statewide races , from governor to lieutenant governor to land commissioner , and mr bush won with nearly 70 percent of the vote so when democratic officials announced last year that they would not field candidates for six of the eight statewide races this november , republicans happily began writing obituaries in april , democratic officials were further embarrassed when a perennially losing candidate best known for his name , gene kelly , sought and won the party s nomination to challenge ms hutchison , an overwhelming favorite democrats point out that they still dominate local politics in much of the state the mayors of dallas , austin , houston and san antonio are democrats , and the party still controls a large majority of county governments , particularly in south texas but robert black , spokesman for the texas republican party , notes that while republicans control local government in only 57 of the state s 254 counties , those 57 counties account for 56 percent of the population an autopsy of recent democratic misfortunes would point to money and demographics as the chief problems texas' huge size requires statewide candidates to raise millions upon millions of dollars in order to compete in every media market with corporate interests favoring republicans , said mr kronberg , the online analyst , democrats often depend on contributions from trial lawyers and republicans , led by mr bush , have demonized the trial bar as greedy pushers of unnecessary lawsuits democrats going statewide , mr kronberg said , have to prove they 're not pawns to trial lawyers
photographed last august in malibu , the 30second spot is in black and white and entitled couple , and it leaves little to the imagination , to say the least as it begins , the ocean roars a young man s face appears he has a model s looks and is fashionably unshaven there is a distinct comehither glimmer in his eye , as there is in that of the young woman who is shown next , equally goodlooking like that of her companion , her countenance is smoldering the action unfolds in quick , arthouselike cuts where only parts of their scantily clothed possibly unclothed bodies are seen hands clasp , unclasp eyes and mouths open , then close the wind blows her hair he kisses her neck , as she appears to lie prone , his upper body apparently atop hers they seem to switch positions a kiss , then another toes curl , and breathing becomes heavy leave the phone , say the titles that are superimposed for a second or two on the screen , as the couple s intertwined bodies tumble toward the beach and the pounding surf avoid the fax , orders another line of text ignore work , demands a third are these outtakes from from here to eternity \? no a hand is elevated , its index finger extended , and at last the advertiser s message is given , in red titles one one as in take one hour away from work to , well , enjoy yourself and as in oneredcube , the commercial s sponsor , a socalled unified messaging service that , for a fee , will allow all calls faxes , email messages and other sundry forms of communication sent your way to be directed to one telephone number and one central location , where you can pick them up whenever you want or not , if you are otherwise engaged suddenly , leaving a message is sexy it is very difficult today to find any communications product that provides any emotional bond to the consumer , said the commercial s writer and director , peter arnell , explaining the logic of the campaign , which is all about relationships , which are the essence of our business mr arnell is the chairman and executive creative director of ag worldwide , part of the draft worldwide unit of the interpublic group of companies best known for fashion advertising for clients like tommy hilfiger and donna karan , and for brandbuilding for clients like samsung , jose cuervo tequila and rockport shoes , mr arnell said that the ads are meant to convey to people what it s like to have your time given back to you by contrast , he said , most competitors' ads are just lists of benefits or explanations of pricing structure this will change all that , he said perhaps at the very least , mr arnell and his client , a division of red cube , an internet communications service provider based in zurich , hope that the commercials will distinguish oneredcube from the numerous other unified messaging services now glutting the marketplace , none of which have thus far proved to be particularly successful , according to amanda mccarthy , a telecommunications analyst at the massachusettsbased forrester research inc , who calls them an extremely hard sell people are already managing their messages , said ms mccarthy , with answering machines , email , whatever that s why these services have n't taken off besides , the technology is n't that hard , so anyone can do it still , with an integrated communications portal that he says can do more than competing systems , including providing cheap domestic and international longdistance calls for subscribers , oneredcube is betting that it will be seen as being different , said richard lin , oneredcube s executive vice president for american operations hence the advertising , which will use the same visuals worldwide the media budget of about 20 million for the fourth quarter alone , is split roughly equally between europe and north america , where the service has been around since last summer domestically , the campaign starts this week , beginning with spots on cable channels including cnn , a e , cnbc , msnbc \( the discovery channel turned it down , said mr arnell , presumably because it deemed it too racy for its family viewers \) there will also be bus ads , taxitop ads and kiosks in public places \( like grand central terminal and union square in san francisco , beginning early next year \) and there is also a print campaign that will start today with ads in the wall street journal and the new york times and will continue in periodicals that include fortune , business week , red herring , the industry standard and vanity fair most of the print ads include headlines and text expanding on the concept of using a messaging service as a better way to manage your time , mr arnell said they also feature still photographs taken from the commercial , he said , except for the one that makes its debut in the times today page c11 that ad features the female model , nude in profile , holding a wooden box , or cube although the box covers all the right places , mr arnell said , the ad was nevertheless rejected by the wall street journal , where another will be running in its place will the ads make oneredcube a success \?

vivien leigh lights a cigarette sigmund freud lights a cigar that s what they should be doing , is n't it \? miss leigh is a glamorous movie star of a bygone era , and everyone knows about dr freud and cigars still , when you consider that both are ill with only a short time to live , smoking is probably the last thing they should be doing and that s exactly why , in this context , smoking becomes an oddly heroic gesture , an assertion of personality in the impassive face of fate the sort of moment , in short , made for the live theater the woman who played scarlett o'hara and the founder of psychoanalysis showed up on separate stages in chicago last week , less than a block apart and both under the umbrella of the steppenwolf theater company freud appeared as the befuddled central figure in john malkovich s vivacious production of terry johnson s hysteria , at steppenwolf s main stage , a rumination on the doctor s last days leigh is only a supporting character , though a heartbreakingly vivid one , in orson s shadow , austin pendleton s seductive story of clashing theatrical titans at the nearby steppenwolf garage you should know , by the way , that freud was swapping dialogue with salvador dali while leigh was interacting with such illustrious contemporaries as orson welles the critic kenneth tynan leigh s husband , laurence olivier and his lover \( and soontobe wife \) , joan plowright now , what kind of shiver runs up your spine on hearing of these dramatis personae one of delight or disgust \? before you pass judgment , be aware that neither of these works is simply an exercise in vulturelike biographical bone picking mr johnson and mr pendleton , who have been this way before in previous works , are aboveboard in pointing out that their plays are only fabrications , speculations inspired by a smattering of known facts and though you would expect orson s shadow , in particular , to drip with lipsmacking prurience , the emotion that seems most to shape it is a deep and knowing compassion both works consciously use the conventions of theater to point out their own artificiality yet in so doing , they forge a bond with the lives under examination seldom achieved in more straightforward biographies hysteria , which ended its chicago run last weekend , and orson s shadow , which continues at the garage through feb 6 , are imperfect but winning examples of a breed of play that is especially in vogue now it s theater as metabiography , in which real lives are transformed , abstracted and mythologized in pursuit of more essential truths or loopy intellectual gamesmanship the most anticipated new drama on broadway this season is michael frayn s copenhagen , a rashomonlike presentation of what might have happened at a meeting between the physicists niels bohr and werner heisenberg during world war ii the invention of love , a portrait of the poet a e housman by tom stoppard , a longtime master of the metabiographical play , has just received its premiere in the united states at the american conservatory theater in san francisco and recent and current off broadway productions present dali \( in kyra obolensky s lobster alice \) and mae west \( in claudia shear s dirty blonde \) as liberating catalysts in the more ordinary lives they touch this all seems appropriate to an age in which the idea of fame rules civilization as never before , when celebrities are accorded the stature of homeric gods and heroes \( the idea being they 're just like us , only more so \) and when the line between fact and fabrication is deliberately blurred this last trend was most notoriously manifested in recent months by edmund morris s book dutch , the story of ronald reagan told by a narrator who never existed but you can also find it in the reenactments regularly featured on television tabloid biographies \( what really happened on the night lana turner s gangster lover was stabbed to death \? \) and it s worth remembering that two of the most notable cultural prizetakers of last year were the oscargarlanded shakespeare in love , in which gwyneth paltrow turns out to have inspired romeo and juliet , and the pulitzer prizewinning novel the hours , in which michael cunningham peeps into the mind of virginia woolf woolf is a relevant name here since from the beginning of her literary career she was pondering the impossibility of truly knowing anyone and hence the impossibility of truthful biography a quotation from mr stoppard s invention of love comes to mind , uttered by a character named , for the record , oscar wilde biography is the mesh through which our real life escapes mr stoppard is today s most fluent practitioner of the theater of conjectural biography , starting with his travesties \( 1974 \) , which brought lenin , tristan tzara and james joyce together during a production of wilde s importance of being earnest in zurich with wit and bravado travesties made a case for finding expressly theatrical embodiments of intellectual styles and for bringing legendary cultural sensibilities together to strike sparks off one another it was more than pastiche it used the documented thought and language of its reallife prototypes to shape the play s form
there are easier things to do than run a community theater , especially one with a native american theme it s a concept that escapes most people , said marty black eagle carl , founder , president and producing artistic director of algonkuin theater company in hamden they have no clue , said mr carl , who bills the algonkuin as the only native american theater in connecticut really some would guess that we do only native shows or that we 're connected to one of the casinos and have money or that we do cowboy and indian shows algonkuin theater company has existed since 1993 after mr carl directed his own adaptation of gaston leroux s phantom of the opera for talent hut players in seymour , he and a handful of friends decided to start their own company we based it around the idea of promoting native theater when we could find it , mr carl said also , to do other interesting plays that we enjoyed or would like to direct and act in because there is not exactly a surplus of native american plays , algonkuin stages a shakespeare production every summer of the group s four to five annual productions , one or two are native american plays since the algonkuin has no permanent home , it presents plays in new haven at the church of the redeemer , the educational center for the arts and the little theater , and in hamden at the miller memorial library and the eli whitney barn mr carl , who claims blackfoot , african and european heritage , said his aim was to bridge the gap of understanding of native american culture by producing plays by and about native americans so far , mr carl said that most of the native shows have been historic in essence , including elegy for an icon and please do not touch the indians this year we doing a modern time frame native play called someday' by drew hayden taylor , said mr carl marty has always been very into his native american background , said peggy hackett , a longtime friend of mr carl who has helped with set design and lighting since the company was founded as it turned out , most of us that formed the original board had native american blood in us also , so we thought that would be a neat way to go since there did n't seem to be many other native american theater companies around once the algonkuin s founders committed to a native american agenda , they had difficulty finding accessible plays we did n't have plays like the euros did , mr carl said but there was native theater , mostly being religious in content as all theater none of it survives except what s still used in religious practices ms hackett added that most native american plays she is familiar with are not exactly comedies either they usually center around the problems that native americans have gone through such as alcoholism , depression , rape , suicide and of course the mass destruction of their way of life it s stuff that needs to be said and remembered but a more upbeat show would probably draw more people in but the algonkuin might still have a tough time marketing them if they have not run on broadway , which very few have and so the company survives on a calculated mix of popular plays and native work \( its first production , in 1993 , was phantom of the opera with a native spin \) small theater is tough outside of new york because most people wo n't come out to see plays that they 've never heard about , mr carl said people who have seen our work know that we do a wide range of shows , so that s how we get the audiences who come back they 've seen our shakespeare or our neil simon , and some will come back for our artsy shows , or our obscure native shows , because they know they 'll see something good since new haven is n't known for having a large native community , we just try to keep producing good , professional shows all the way around , he said we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today the algonkuin theatre welcomes anyone wishing to work on productions tanya feduiksmith started volunteering last summer when her husband played the title role in hamlet she directed the algonkuin s most recent production of much ado about nothing , which was presented last month at the eli whitney barn i 'd gotten really interested in directing and marty gave me the chance to direct a couple of shows for the company , which i really enjoyed doing , she said mr carl s wife , margaret , stage manager for many of the theater s productions , said the company s financial constraints have not been all bad it really forces us to be creative , and we are fortunate to find actors who are willing to put their best efforts into a project they do n't get paid for it s great when we get people , especially friends and relatives of the actors , who rarely or never go to live theater and tell us how much they enjoyed it , she said algonkuin theater s next production is the area premiere of someday , by drew hayden taylor , running nov 3 to 18 the production , directed by mr carl , will be presented at the black box theater at church of the redeemer , whitney avenue and cold spring , new haven the algonkuin theater s web site is www algonkuin org photos props for the latest show by the algonkuin theater company at right , marty black eagle carl , left , the group s founder , talking to john benedetto , an actor we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today , mr carl said \( photographs by michael doolittle for the new york times \)
a longforgotten actor , the toast of 1900 s broadway and a star of silent films , will soon retake his rightful place in the times square theater that bore his name for decades and , fittingly , he 'll be in drag when the new 25screen amc empire multiplex opens next month on 42nd street , moviegoers will buy their tickets beneath a huge mural showing three female muses in long flowing robes lost for 60 years under layers of paint , the mural has been painstakingly restored at the insistence of historic preservationists and those who did the restoration are fairly certain that all three women are in fact the same man , none other than julian eltinge , the oncefamous female impersonator for whom the theater was first named in 1912 we think the faces were done from publicity stills , said harriet irgang , the director of rustin levenson art conservation , which restored the mural ms irgang admits that there is no surviving documentation to prove such a connection , but she said old photographs of mr eltinge as a woman strongly resemble the faces on the mural the makeup , the wigs and the gestures looked like julian in costume , she said it appears that mr eltinge never performed at the theater that bore his name , but he played nearby , starring for four years in the fascinating widow at the liberty theater just to the east on 42nd street pooling profits from that show , al h woods , the producer , and mr eltinge built the eltinge theater , with a third partner , sol bloom , who later served in congress owning a theater is n't acting , mr eltinge told the new york worldtelegram years later , in a june 1940 interview , so as usual i lost money on it , and i finally sold my share to my partners the actor grew rich performing in plays , reviews , silent films and even a few talkies , sometimes playing both male and female parts in the same production but he was mostly noted for his depiction of women , with one review of a 1919 new york stage production observing that eltinge s impersonations are always a subtle and goodhumored satire on feminine mannerisms and foibles though hardly known today , he was popular enough in the early part of the century to have his own magazine , with articles on how to apply makeup , and his own line of cold cream , which came with a free picture of mr eltinge at the height of his fame , he played at windsor castle for king edward vii , who presented him with a white bulldog he was born william dalton in 1883 in newtonville , mass , and his life s work seemed to be set at age 10 , after he played a girl in an annual revue in boston he was such a hit , he told interviewers , that the next year a female part was written for him julian eltinge , as virile as anybody virile , contributed to the gaiety of nations by playing fascinating widows more fascinatingly than if fascinating real widows played them , the actress ruth gordon wrote in the new york times on aug 31 , 1969 others were not so complimentary women went into ecstasy about him , the comedian w c fields once remarked men went into the smoking room his antics were a staple in the press his frequent pronouncements that he was hanging up his gowns \( all 64 of them \) for good , his building of a virtual castle on a ranch in southern california , his arrest at the canadian border with liquor during prohibition , a collision with a police car in los angeles , and a 1931 boating accident in which , the times reported , a marlin swordfish lunged through the bottom of the boat and wounded him in the abdomen even his appendectomy received notices a connoisseur of women s apparel who designed many of his own outfits , he was something of an advocate on the subject , wondering , in one interview , whether there is any such thing as a comfortable gown for a woman comfortable in the sense of being free and easy , as a man s clothes are he also shared some secrets if i shave just before the matinees , that takes me through the performance reassured , but by the time the night performance is over , i 've got a heavy beard , he told the new york press in 1914 while he was appearing in the crinoline girl , one of his bestknown roles my life is one close shave after another mr eltinge went to unusual lengths to stress his masculinity contemporary accounts contain stories of his beating up stage hands , members of the audience and fellow performers who made remarks about his sexual preferences he never married and , as his looks faded , he lived many years in seclusion with his mother on his california ranch but when he died of a kidney ailment in 1941 , he had been performing again at a new york nightclub , the times reported he was 57 his theater renamed the empire theater in 1954 after his celebrity faded will reopen on april 21 as the ticket lobby of the new amc empire multiplex the 74millionpound building is the same one that was moved 168 feet closer to the hudson river in 1998

there were bunches of world champions in action at the international olympic committee s museum in lausanne , switzerland , last week , but none of them were able to win the ioc cup was captured by indonesia , a country that had come close to world titles on several occasions but had never had a victory the winning foursome of denny sacul , franky karwur , henky lasut and eddy manoppo won the semifinal against the american team that captured the bermuda bowl in january in the final on friday , a stretch drive brought them a 10imp victory over the italian team that won the world olympiad title in september they will now feel confident of their prospects when the next bermuda bowl is played on their own turf , in bali next october in the semifinal , indonesia built up a big lead against the united states with help from the diagramed deal both teams reached three notrump from the south side after a strong oneclub opening manoppo was south , with eric rodwell and jeff meckstroth in the eastwest seats the opening lead of the spade queen was allowed to win , and the jack followed south won this and led the club king the defense would have had fair chances if west had taken this and returned the suit as it was , west held up his ace and had to win when the club queen was continued west shifted to a low diamond south played the nine from the dummy , and east did well to hold up his ace south continued the diamond six , and won with the queen when east ducked again dummy s two club winners were cashed , and a third diamond lead put east on play in this position \( diagram \) south needed three more tricks if rodwell had led a heart , it would have been obvious that west held the king south would have taken the ace and returned a heart , scoring two tricks at the finish in one way or another instead east led his remaining spade manoppo took his ace and led a spade , forcing west to lead the heart seven at the 12th trick a guess at this late stage is usually easy , but this was not south got it right by calling from the queen from dummy , making his game in the replay the declarer had a similar guess in the heart suit , but at an earlier stage he guessedwrong , and indonesia gained 10 imps en route to victory in a women s match between europe and the united states , europe won by 12 victory points , 245233 more information about the tournament is available on the internet at www ebridgemaster com
washington , dec 14 clearly it was going to be an important meeting , important enough that vice president al gore thought his running mate , senator joseph i lieberman , should breach the sabbath to be there it was a saturday afternoon in november , the first saturday after the most remarkable election night in american history mr gore and his top aides were meeting at the naval observatory , the vice president s official residence , and as the discussion got serious they dispatched tom nides , mr lieberman s campaign manager , to persuade his boss to join them he found him at a neighbor s house , enjoying a sabbath luncheon the veep wants you to come , mr nides remembered telling him some tough decisions need to be made and we need to go mr lieberman , a deeply observant jew , had tried to reassure voters during the campaign that he would bend religious laws prohibiting work on the sabbath if the national interest was at stake this meeting , he concluded , would seem to pass the test can we drive \? asked mr nides , a decidedly less observant jew he knew the answer before he asked and so mr lieberman and mr nides began a twomile hike to the residence navobs as it is known surrounded by secret service agents and trailed by a creeping , fivecar motorcade as they strolled up wisconsin avenue , passing motorists honked their horns and rolled down their windows to yell go , joe , go ! inside the house , a number of gore aides and family members had gathered at the dining room table , where two easels with beige butcher paper stood behind the vice president s chair the issue was whether mr gore should join a lawsuit challenging palm beach county s butterfly ballot , which the vice president s aides believed had cost him hundreds , if not thousands , of votes and possibly the presidency as the discussion proceeded , it became clear that the gore team would have to fight its postelection battle on several fronts legal , political and public relations and that its various strategies would sometimes conflict there would be inherent tensions , mr gore and his aides realized , among the legal imperative of capturing every democratic vote in florida , the communications mission of presenting mr gore as reasonable and dignified , and the political goal of keeping supporters on board while buying time for the lawyers those tensions flared repeatedly throughout the next four weeks as the gore camp searched for a balance inevitably , mr gore made the final decisions , and at key moments he consistently chose to safeguard his image , sometimes at the expense of legal aggressiveness he backed away , for instance , from his lawyers' determination to try to disqualify overseas absentee ballots , many of them cast by members of the armed forces who were presumed to favor gov george w bush his guiding principle , mr gore said publicly , was to fight for the inclusion of votes , not for their exclusion he also ruled against the advisers who urged him to contest improper republican absentee ballots in seminole county that too , mr gore reasoned , would undermine his public relations position , though he did not discourage lawsuits filed by supporters challenging the seminole ballots the lawyers always wanted to be aggressive and do the seminole thing or the military ballot thing , said william m daley , mr gore s campaign chairman but he had to look at the public relations , at how do you govern if you win , what do you look like you had those conflicts through this whole thing regarding the butterfly ballots , democratic field workers were collecting some 8 , 000 affidavits from confused voters , and mr gore s lawyers were eager to litigate but some in mr gore s dining room that first saturday worried that the proposed remedy presumably a new vote of some kind would make him seem unreasonable and extreme , testing the patience of both his partisans and the public he wanted to be striking a reasonable stance , said former secretary of state warren christopher , whom mr gore had appointed as his emissary to tallahassee at the same time , he did n't want to compromise legitimate legal issues ever the voice of moderation and propriety , mr christopher urged caution at the end of this struggle , he said , i hoped his reputation would be fully intact complicating the decision , several aides said , was mr gore s desire to make a public statement that weekend except for photo opportunities of him jogging and playing touch football , the vice president had been largely invisible , and completely inaudible , since the day after the election it was time , mr gore believed , to let the country know how he planned to proceed , to plea for patience and to reassure americans that he was only seeking fairness his vehicle , he decided , would be a brief televised speech , delivered on sunday , nov 12 , after the pro football games ended he would tell the country of his proposal to the republicans that he would not pursue litigation to challenge voting irregularities like the butterfly ballots if mr bush would abide by the results of manual recounts , either statewide or in the four counties where mr gore had requested them
burlington , vt at first glance , it seems like a typical first month of school in this bustling college town alongside a lovely lake the sign on the diner says welcome back , students the bookstore hours are posted students stroll under trees that show hints of colorful foliage at the athletic complex , hockey players work out informally in anticipation of official practice , which begins late next week but all is not quite back to normal at the university of vermont , especially in hockey the team s opening game on oct 14 against new hampshire will be its first game of any kind since last january , when the 19992000 season was canceled in midschedule because players had lied about a hazing incident the initiation ceremony had resulted in a federal lawsuit filed by a freshman goalie public outrage over the detailed accusations in the suit caused the state s attorney general to begin an investigation the uproar eventually led university officials to cancel the second half of the hockey season , prompting a broad debate about the pervasiveness and propriety of hazing in college sports eight months have now gone by and players are back , getting ready for a new season late last month , the case filed by the freshman goalie , corey latulippe , was settled , with latulippe expected to get 80 , 000 from the university and smaller sums from some former teammates but it will take more than money and signed legal documents to heal the emotional wounds and the damaged reputations the university has suffered , said david nestor , the vice president for student affairs we have experienced a drop in vermont students enrolling at the university of vermont , he said recently in a conference room at gutterson field house as he spoke , the sounds of sticks and pucks echoed up from the ice i understand we have had about a 5 percent dip from what is typical some of that has to do with the hockey issue of the legal settlement , nestor said it s maybe putting an end to a chapter , but it s not the end to the book this issue is not just specific to athletics it includes fraternities , sororities , even academic honorary organizations , not necessarily specific to this campus the process has become highly ritualized within the youth culture itself without much adult supervision and sometimes not much adult awareness latulippe left school after the hazing incident and after he failed to make the team now 20 years old , he plays for a junior team in cleveland in his lawsuit , latulippe said that the team s new players , at an alcoholdrenched party last october in an offcampus house , had been coerced into parading naked while holding each other s genitals he also said they had been told to do pushups while dipping their private parts into glasses of beer , after which they had to drink the beer and he said that the young players had been blindfolded and fondled by strippers to amuse the veteran hockey players it should not have occurred , hazing should n't have happened , latulippe said in a deposition last may i want hazing to never take place latulippe , who declined requests for an interview , ultimately withdrew other allegations from his lawsuit , particularly those blaming leaders in the athletic department for what took place he said under questioning at the deposition that the university s hockey coach , mike gilligan , had not been at fault in addition , latulippe himself underwent three days of questioning last may from defense lawyers representing the college and his former teammates during the deposition , latulippe was asked about his own behavior before the initiation among many other things , he was asked about accusations that he had urinated on teammates in the shower while in high school and that he had exposed a swollen and injured testicle to women he did not dispute the accusations gilligan , who attended the deposition , shook his head in wonder when recalling it last week i was amazed at how things happen , and how nasty they can get , he said latulippe suffered emotional distress and needed psychological counseling last winter after he learned that vermont s season had been canceled as the affair accelerated beyond anyone s control , people close to him said the monetary settlement is considerably less than the 350 , 000 latulippe s lawyers first suggested neither side has apologized and both still present themselves as victims but gilligan and university administrators hope to start the school year fresh i wanted to go in this season not worrying about depositions for myself , my players , my staff , he said enough is enough we 've got to start mending some of the wounds most of his players have returned , still on scholarship , which rankles some critics of the university one of those critics is ken squire , an auto racing executive who operates an influential radio station in the area in an editorial broadcast recently , squire called some of the returning hockey players perverts and liars and said they should have been expelled from school he also said the university needed a change of administration to alter the perception that vermont is a party school
william parker s little huey creative music orchestra usually sounds incantatory organized melodic motifs swim through a giant body of expressive honking , squealing , crashing sounds mr parker s bass playing has acted as the anchor for all of the group s work since it started in 1994 but the music he performed at merkin hall on thursday , songs for mary lou , thomas and bessie a suite that is part of the hall s interpretations series had an altogether different personality the suite is a set of sincere songs about love of family and religion and nature , with highly poetic lyrics mr parker conducted and played the flute far more than he played the bass , and the battalion of horns at his disposal lay silent for a great deal of the evening one way to describe songs for mary lou , thomas and bessie would be as pastoral music , but for a lower east side community garden instead of a wheat field brief hyperromantic expanses thick piano chords , unison melodies emanated from the 19piece band , jostling for space with tension , eccentricity , even ugliness some parts were naive other parts were hardbitten dean bowman sang lines like the greatest revolutionary is a rose and leena conquest sang all i ever want is a sunny day then , after a paean to the crocus , brass and reed lines were layered on top of each other , sonorous and clashing some of the best music was achieved without the rhythm section , in a part called corot s pool a tuba and baritone saxophone created long , shifting chords , and saxophones chattered over unison trumpet lines but a pious sincerity finally won out , especially in the last song , with a refrain of the word happiness and a vamp that could have come from a 1960 s soulrock musical the evening started with some works by stuart saunders smith , a composer who works in the medium of free jazz as well as new music for percussion and piano except here the term free jazz is more of a misnomer than usual his blue , for trumpet , drums and bass , which sounded for all the world like improvisation , was mostly composed threaded with large intervallic leaps and lacking a perceivable tonal center , the music was surprisingly conventional michael cerri s trumpet phrases were all too typical of the last 40 years in outside jazz , alternating staccato bursts with long tones more successful was when music is missing , music sings , a percussion work written for household objects like a wine bottle , a salad bowl and an overturned plastic dish though the piece was n't too dynamic none of the objects had any natural resonance and none of mr smith s pieces on the program concerned themselves with ebb and flow it was clearer and freer as an artistic gesture photo william parker performed a suite of songs with his little huey creative music orchestra \( jack vartoogian for the new york times \)
boston , july 17 he has been criticized for everything from his wind to his lack of toughness , and knowledgeable basketball people question whether the 7foot2inch frederic weis will ever be good enough to move into the rotation of a national basketball association team but when the knicks and nine other clubs began the shaw s pro summer league at the university of massachusettsboston today , weis was the most soughtafter and intriguing player on any roster despite the many doubts about his ability , weis has become a mystery man , one that even his american agent , the bewildered frank catapano , cannot solve like knicks general manager scott layden , catapano has no idea why weis did not arrive in new york on an airplane sunday afternoon he spoke with weis s european agent , didier rose , an hour before the plane was supposed to land and was told that weis was on it since then , he has not been able to contact rose they 're coming here by air balloon , catapano joked today really , i have no idea why he s not here none at all theories abound as to why weis , who averaged just 81 points and 62 rebounds a game in france last season , has remained in europe his story since june has been that he is tending to his sick father there is also the belief that he may be close to signing a deal with a team in europe , perhaps olympiakos of the greek league then , there is the speculation that rose is playing hardball with the knicks in hopes of getting them to tender his client a contract before sept 1 i have n't been told that he has a deal with another team , said catapano , who insisted that weis wanted to play in new york from my standpoint , that s not why he s not here if weis , the 15th selection of the 1999 draft , signs with a european team before sept 1 , the knicks retain his rights once the contract ends if he signs after sept 1 and the knicks do not offer him a contract , they lose their rights to him i 've talked at length to frank catapano and we 've put in calls to his french agent , didier , but we 're not sure why he has n't shown up , layden said so we 'll just have to wait and see after extravagantly entertaining brian grant last week , the knicks continue to hold out hope for pulling off a signandtrade deal with portland while grant closed his new york visit by saying he could see himself playing for the knicks , it is highly doubtful that he will end up calling madison square garden home the blazers are demanding either latrell sprewell or allan houston from the knicks , who are trying fruitlessly to entice them with a package involving marcus camby mark bartelstein , grant s agent , said his client , who is being courted by several other teams and will soon visit detroit , will not sign for the 225 million midlevel exception , which is all the knicks can offer him as a free agent it is also beginning to look as if boston s danny fortson , the other player at the top of the knicks' list of power forward hopefuls , could also wind up elsewhere the los angeles lakers , golden state , orlando and atlanta are looking into signandtrade deals with boston , which is believed to have offered fortson a sevenyear deal worth close to 42 million fortson is expected to visit golden state soon , and the lakers may have replaced the knicks as his top choice it is not out of the question that the knicks may try to rekindle talks with grant hill , whom they tried to woo heavily two weeks ago hill has orally committed to playing in orlando next season , but with tim duncan s recent announcement that he will remain in san antonio , there is the possibility that he may reconsider no contracts can be signed before aug 1 , so the knicks have two weeks to try and sell him on their team layden would not discuss hill , but neither would he rule out anything everything i 've seen reported is that he s going to orlando , he said rebounds the knicks lost their opening game of the tournament , 6962 , to the milwaukee bucks , but the former st john s standout lavor postell was a bright spot impressing everyone but himself , postell made 8 of 15 shots in leading all scorers with 20 points he showed aggressiveness , skill off the dribble and with the jump shot he converted two of four 3point shots , but was disappointed because he had no assists , one rebound and two turnovers it was horrible , postell said i did n't have an allaround game i did n't get any rebounds , any assists and my man scored too many points postell was guarding michael reed , who scored 13 points
gypsies and jews were the only two groups that the nazi regime sought to exterminate completely six million jews were murdered , and perhaps half of europe s one million gypsies yet of the 60 billion the german government has paid in reparations since world war ii to holocaust victims , only a tiny percentage has gone to gypsies the german government and german companies who employed slave or forced labor recently set up a 5 billion fund for these workers and other victims gypsies are eligible , and the fund also provides 12 million for social programs to benefit them but the fund administrators must take special care to see that the money reaches gypsies , lest this group be slighted again gypsies , who call themselves roma , were left uncompensated after world war ii largely because of their low social status after the war , chancellor konrad adenauer of west germany invited the government of the new nation of israel and leaders of jewish organizations worldwide to negotiate for restitution the organization they established , the claims conference , had political clout and could find victims and administer payments the gypsies , long the objects of scorn in europe , had no organization and no political champions west german laws discriminated against them the german supreme court in 1956 even ruled that gypsies deported before 1943 were taken because they were antisocial and so were not entitled to compensation the new fund is mainly for those pressed into labor , principally nonjews from eastern and central europe the negotiators are conscious of the need to reach gypsies but the deal contains problems that may leave many deserving gypsies out one obstacle is infighting in the gypsy community about who should represent them but in addition , no one was present at some crucial meetings to speak for gypsy interests negotiators decided to speed the payment process by working through groups that had already been administering holocaust claims , which meant the claims conference , and for nonjews , special partner organizations in russia , belarus , ukraine , poland and the czech republic these groups will have the job of advertising the new fund , finding victims and setting up the social programs for gypsies some of these partner organizations have been tainted by corruption in the past moreover , there will be but one gypsy leader on the board of directors of the fund , and there may be none on the staffs of the five partner organizations , which may be tempted to concentrate on majority ethnic groups the german finance ministry , which ultimately will oversee payments , must ensure that the organizations in the five countries take seriously the expensive and difficult task of reaching an unpopular minority
as television learned early , there is inherent drama in medicine the human body at war against alien invaders or even against itself , doctors marshaling the forces of modern science and technology to combat disease and save lives but it s a drama that seldom transfers to the stage while the camera can transport an audience into the corridors of big city hospitals or mobile army field stations , into operating theaters and emergency rooms , creating a verisimilitude of bloodandguts action that captures the lifeanddeath struggle being played out , the stage can take us , at best , into a hospital room in which a patient is hooked up to an iv drip handshake , a play by julie gilbert and robert a brodner , a neurosurgeon , about an ophthalmologist named bill ford who is suffering from parkinson s disease , tries to recreate a surgical procedure called pallidotomy but in the staging at the miranda theater it looks more like an execution in the electric chair and serves as a testament that brain surgery is not playwriting in fact , handshake is less a real play than a staged case history of one parkinson s patient and his family , with an infomercial for pallidotomy running through the whole exercise turns on whether ford will agree to undergo the new and risky operation the closest thing to a conflict is the debate within his family over whether he should have the surgery his daughter is against it , his son is for it , and his wife wavers back and forth since dr brodner is a strong advocate of the procedure , there are no surprises in the outcome the rest of the two hours is padded with flashbacks to ford s earlier , happier times with his wife , helen , and by cutting back and forth to a support group for families of parkinson s patients , all of whom deliver a laundry list of complaints about spouses or relatives who drool and shake and are an embarrassment at the dinner table one can only pray to be preserved from the love of such relatives the coauthors fill the rest of the two hours with peripherals a running subplot questions why the surgeon would even want to attempt the operation it takes two long scenes to persuade an hmo doctor to approve the surgery and two early scenes deal with a malpractice suit against ford that never figures again in the plot in plays in which the drama is internal as when disease is the protagonist it is the characters who must maintain an audience s interest , as in successful medical dramas like wit , as is and whose life is it anyway \? although there is biographical data about ford and his family \( and the surgeon \) strewn through handshake , one never really gets to know any of them when helen , for example , relates having a brief sexual fling in a hotel room , then coming home to find her husband sitting in a chair waiting for her , she simply stands downstage and recites the facts a scene with helen and her lover in the hotel room , followed by the one in which she opens the door to find her husband awaiting her return would give both helen and ford a chance to examine exactly what the disease had done to each of them for a play about a disease that is supposed to produce such extreme emotion , the production , under yanna kroytbrandt s direction , is curiously listless none of the performances rise much above scenestudy level m j karmi delivers a credible reading as helen , and oliver vaquer brings some energy to the role of ford s son as ford , brian delate is oddly lowkey , and it is only in the final scene that his slurred speech and shaking find find a consistency that arouses some sympathy handshake by julie gilbert and robert a brodner directed by yanna kroytbrandt sets by daniella galli lighting by matthew adelson costumes by mattie ulrich sound by david wright production stage manager , j andrew burgreen presented by patrice samara and pam koslow in association with strut and fret inc at the miranda theater , 259 west 30th street , chelsea with dan pinto \( dr ben roberts \) , brian delate \( dr bill ford \) , m j karmi \( helen ford \) , ariane brandt \( dr hope fordweiler , wendy roberts and michelle findler \) , oliver vaquer \( rick ford and jason greenhut \) and donald symington \( dr greer \) photo ariane brandt , left , brian delate and m j karmi in handshake \( jonathan slaff handshake \)
this year s toronto film festival , which ended last weekend , highlighted at least one trend worth noting women directing women in movies that are openly about sex not lyrical playhouse lovemaking , but extreme behavior that makes the participants come to grips with the way that sex can ruin lives no one is completed by physical relations in baisemoi \( rape me \) , une vraie jeune fille \( a real young girl \) or scarlet diva none of which have release dates yet in the united states the french film baisemoi , codirected by virginie despentes and coralie trinh thi , had to be the most talked about picture at the festival it happens to be one of the most talked about movies in europe this year as well when manu \( raffaela anderson \) and nadine \( karen lancoume \) , a pair of young frenchwomen , are raped together , their violation is shown in explicit detail there is no being spared the horrific act of penetration because the filmmakers do n't cut away probably the most awful onscreen moment in years is seeing manu , her face distant and impassive as she s being brutalized because she does n't react , this scene burrows into the most primal fear during this scene , a gasp the kind that the extras in movie crowd scenes never get right erupted in the theater , and a number of people rose shakily to their feet to exit it is such a powerful sequence that one strains to imagine what could follow it , and , unfortunately , the directors did not strain their imaginations enough after the repellent cruelty , the stars of baisemoi chase thrills and wreak their vengeance on men the movie could be described as thelma and louise get busy when the movie plops into the grinding ordinariness of a porno film , complete with a secondrate score with chittering wahwah guitars and bleating horns , all the horror that the film conjured up is lost the real shock of this film is the inability of the directors to seize upon the discomfort of the audience and expose them to manu and nadine s suffering as a result , the slender border between art and exploitation is quickly destroyed , and when the two women begin their violent spree , the cheaplooking splatter of viscera distracts the audience with its cheesy violence something raw and haunted has been squandered , and it s understandable that by following this trail of gore , these characters are chasing what little selfesteem they had in the first place asia argento , the daughter of the italian genre filmmaker dario argento , starred in , wrote and directed scarlet diva in it she seeks to expose the yearning consuming her parts of her depiction of gasp the violence coursing through her psyche in a roaring version of her own life seem sophomoric and halfbaked the bpicture as therapy ms argento s presence and inchoate quality as an actress occasionally move the picture from caricature into something more threedimensional with her dazed eyes and strong shoulders , she has the look of a model who turns a stroll down a fashion runway into a march along the perp walk she s an arresting combination of fear and arrogance , and her story almost functions as an addled version of candide without dr pangloss to lend a whiff of optimism she seems to be trying to say something about the emptiness of her life , and the onslaught of cliches of meaningless sex and drugs leaves even her bored she s still finding her way as a performer , trying on american hiphop dialect and then bouncing from french to italian it s like she s going through exercises for an acting class she s not exactly in control of the material , and diva lurches from humid sex scenes to meaningful stares into space to slipshod indictments of the american film industry , as evidenced by a scene in which a loutish producer comes on to her like a pig digging around for truffles une vraie jeune fille , the first film from the french novelistturneddirector catherine breillat , about a young woman s discovery of herself as a sexual being , made its north american debut at this year s festival the jeune fille screenings provoked interest because of romance , ms breillat s mournful treatise on sexual encounters , which was released last year and stirred a sensation of its own because of its explicit sex although her directing technique in jeune fille \( 1976 \) was primitive and attenuated , there was an aura of heartache which added a depth of feeling missing in her more recent work the american director kathryn bigelow showed up at toronto with her newest work , a film adaptation of anita shreve s weight of water that stars catherine mccormack and sarah polley the gothic and allusive water has parallel stories that shift back and forth in time over the course of 100 years the events surrounding the murders of the sister and sisterinlaw of a young woman \( ms polley \) are being investigated by a modernday writer \( ms mccormack \) , as contemporary and period sexual politics come into play in discussing her film , ms bigelow posed a question that could serve as the theme for all of these women s works if a woman is pushed to the edge , how would she behave \? i hate to put it in gender specific terms , but women internalize , said ms bigelow , whose previous films include near dark and blue steel her movies trade on the frighteningly close relationship between intimacy and violence , and her films illustrate how quickly one can cross the line into the other filmmaking is an opportunity to externalize , she continued i started as a painter , an abstract expressionist , dealing with the visceral painting can be a fairly elitist medium , and film is accessible to all , it cuts across all cultural and social lines what you can do in movies what i did in 'weight of water' is have the characters commit heinous acts , and you can feel sympathy for them , sympathy for marginal acts photo asia argento , left , and selen in scarlet diva , a semiautobiographical film directed by ms argento \( toronto international film festival \)
in the combustible aftermath of the second game of the world series , the insistent matter on the minds of opinionated new yorkers yesterday was the deeper meaning or , in fact , any meaning of a thrown piece of splintered wood in weighing why roger clemens hurled a stump of a broken bat in the vicinity of his nemesis , mike piazza , during the first inning of sunday s game , fans of both teams found themselves examining ticklish questions of neuroses and courage and retribution , not to mention instructive ways to control anger mets fans , in reacting to the continuing morality play starring the pitcher and slugger , were largely unwilling to allow that the bat fragment was thrown by accident how could it have been , they reasoned , after clemens had already clunked piazza in the head with a baseball during the regular season \? as far as they could see , clemens must have a demented obsession with tossing things at piazza balls , bats , hula hoops it was intentional , said richard meadows , 37 , a police officer who had been working at the game you could see the anger in his face by watching roger clemens s mouth , he could also see him mumbling to mike piazza that he thought the bat piece was the ball that s ludicrous , he said the officer said that pitchers , more so than even the other position players , easily knew the difference between a ball and a chunk of bat with a jagged edge to it you know , like one is round and one is not , he pointed out there is no need for a pitcher to ever hit anybody , said maria mier , 38 , an account executive at a copier company , who roots for the mets this is what they do when a surgeon goes in and does a heart operation , he does n't go , 'oh i'm sorry , i attached the wrong artery' you do n't do that what clemens did was deliberate so what was he thinking \? if i had to guess , she said , maybe the fact that piazza is so liked and so popular and outspoken maybe he was thinking , i want to shut this guy up joe abrams , 42 , a steam fitter and mets fan , said , clemens is a hell of a pitcher and not much of a human being a lot of met fans were outraged that clemens was not ejected from the game now they had alternative ideas for suitable punishment clemens should be clubbed like a baby seal , said larry blatt , 37 , who drives the iceresurfacing machine at chelsea piers he s a gutless player jimmy mchugh , 68 , a bartender in queens , said , i 'd love to see piazza walk into a bar and see clemens and rap him piazza is a man and clemens is a creep wherever you mentioned the yankee pitcher on the street yesterday , you got a reaction unasked , people put in their ideas eric skoy , 41 , a waiter and actor and committed yankee fan , was expressing himself on a midtown manhattan corner i think roger clemens intentionally threw the bat at piazza the tension had built up but at that split moment , i think what clemens thought was that somehow piazza was deliberately sending that bat at him this was a popular attempt at explanation subscribed to by certain yankee fans that in the unimaginable pressure of a world series game , or at least in the unimaginable workings of roger clemens s brain , the pitcher concluded that piazza had somehow schemed to have his bat explode so that one pointy piece of it would whip toward the mound some yankee fans took this a step further they suggested that piazza actually came to the plate with a bat that he knew was already cracked so that it was sure to burst in just that fashion and if someone fires a bat at you , they pointed out , it s only fair that you get to fling it back gus miliotis , a 63yearold financial consultant , was passing by passing by , in fact , from st louis , where he lives what , you 're defending clemens \? he said to eric skoy , giving him a hard stare worthy of clemens himself clemens humiliated new york he humiliated the sport he humiliated the country i'm not saying it was right , mr skoy said mr miliotis said the guy is senile he has a disease mr skoy i would n't go that far mr miliotis he could n't control his emotions , so he became an animal mr skoy gave a really disgusted look this guy does n't know what he s talking about , he said clemens is 38 years old what do you mean , senility \? mr miliotis that is bush league the guy should be thrown out of the world series mr skoy will you please give me a break there are any number of yankee fans who agree that mr clemens did a rather bad thing on purpose , and they openly deplored the behavior i was hoping torre would take clemens out , said kimberly smith , 28 , an artist , referring to the yankees' manager , joe torre i was very impressed with piazza s behavior i think the incident took him off guard a little i think he would have been well within his rights to go crazy i think he had the right to take clemens out at that point carlos mojica , 22 , a building engineer , said he had never gotten over roger clemens s coming to the team in the first place he is basically a mercenary , he said i never considered him a real yankee and i never will where many other yankee fans differ from met fans , however , is that they still really like roger clemens any guy who can throw like that in such a crucial situation is a guy i want on my team , said chris horgan , a hotel company executive and yankee devotee if being a tough , mean guy helps him do it , so be it in the minds of many fans , the problem was entirely a temper issue roger came out looking like someone who does n't have much control over himself , and he needs to work on that , said noelle barbera , 25 , an opera singer a number of people took the occasion to be helpful they suggested ways that clemens could learn to keep his anger in check these included protracted psychotherapy , working with disadvantaged children , prozac , writing over and over , i am a calm person , and giving up baseball for something like fishing pressed hard , no one thought there was a very high likelihood that he would follow any of these courses of action there was a companion issue in this morality play was it good or bad that piazza did n't slug clemens \? was it good or bad that the mets did n't start a brawl \? any number of mets fans were disappointed that the mets did n't beat up the yankees some questioned the team s courage yankee fans did n't feel the need to question the mets' courage they already knew they had none piazza should have gone after him , said henry fiol , 21 , a teacher s aide and mets fan someone throws a bat at him , he should have hit him other mets fans were rational about it the game , they pointed out , was in the bronx , before yankee fans the mets did want to live to play game 3 there were other ways to frame it i think the mets showed their courage in not fighting , said jim allen , 79 , a messenger and mets fan these guys are not boxers photo eric skoy , left , an actor and waiter , and gus miliotis , a financial consultant , debated the theory that roger clemens might be senile \( librado romero the new york times \) \( pg d4 \)
when salam almarayati read yesterday that hillary rodham clinton would return 50 , 000 in political contributions from members of the american muslim alliance , he got a sinking feeling it was happening again , mr almarayati said a prominent muslim american in this case , agha saeed , who is president of the alliance was being punished for pushing muslim americans into the political mainstream , he said agha saeed was successful in unifying the muslim vote and for the first time in creating a voting bloc , mr almarayati said it is no surprise that he is now the target it happens to any of us who is successful in gaining access for muslims mr almarayati , who is executive director of the muslim public affairs council in los angeles , an advocacy and educational organization , is not regarded as a man who sees a conspiracy around every corner but he has been there before himself last year , mr almarayati was appointed by representative richard a gephardt , the house minority leader , to a congressional counterterrorism commission in what had been considered a political breakthrough for muslim americans his appointment , however , was withdrawn after he was denounced by jewish organizations that accused him of condoning terrorism against israel they cited statements that blamed the israeli government for provoking palestinian anger and violence a christian arabamerican was named in his place yesterday , as mrs clinton s campaign aides began returning about 100 checks from members of the american muslim alliance , muslims across the country were reminded of how difficult it remains for them to make inroads into american politics and how disputed remarks about other parts of the world can derail the acceptance of muslim americans here they also contend that extremist views by muslims carry far greater negative consequences for muslim americans than extremist remarks in support of israel do for jewish americans at the center of the muslim americans' frustration in new york , perhaps more so than in any other part of the country , is one issue their overriding sympathy for the palestinians in the middle east troubles , which is out of step with mainstream political sentiment and longtime political realities here mrs clinton said on wednesday that the checks , from a fundraising event in june , were being returned because of offensive and outrageous statements attributed to members of the american muslim alliance , including support expressed by mr saeed for the right of palestinians to use armed resistance against the israelis she has been supported in her views by a variety of jewish organizations mrs clinton s opponent , representative rick a lazio called the donations blood money on wednesday , and he did not publicly raise the topic yesterday but mr saeed insists he was expressing a commonly held view among muslims about the middle east one that has been advanced by members of the united nations and not advocating violence or terrorism i am propalestinian , but at the same time i am willing to have a reasonable settlement with the israelis , said mr saeed , who teaches ethnic studies and political science at the university of california , berkeley , and california state university , hayward i have also said that i support the peace process and that the conflict there was political , not theological but none of those things are being mentioned the fundraising event sponsored by mr saeed s group for mrs clinton and the endorsement this week of gov george w bush of texas by an umbrella muslim american organization that includes the american muslim alliance were political activities gleaned from the basic textbook of american politics irishamericans , italianamericans , blacks , asianamericans and jewish americans have all read the same chapters and plotted the course to mainstream influence , but not with equal success for example , asianamericans felt particularly maligned by the campaign finance investigations of president clinton s reelection campaign in 1996 mr saeed , mr almarayati and a growing number of muslim americans across the country have spent much of the past decade trying to make inroads in politics and to avoid those pitfalls four of the biggest groups recently formed a joint political organization , the american muslim political coordination council political action committee , which made its first major muslim american presidential endorsement this week for mr bush but like other immigrant and ethnic groups before them , muslim americans have seen their efforts rebuffed , resisted and blocked by the groups that came before them there is still no muslim member of congress there are more than six million muslim americans , but a crescentandstar sculpture did not join the christmas tree and menorah in the park in front of the white house until 1997 it was only during the clinton administration that the white house began holding dinners for muslim americans celebrating the end of the ramadan fast
two thoughts came to mind when gov george pataki announced last week that nearly all the money had been found to complete the purchase of sterling forest , some 19 , 000 acres of unspoiled woodlands , streams and lakes 40 miles northwest of new york city that were very nearly lost to residential and commercial development one was that the citizens who supported the cause of sterling forest deserve great credit for sticking with an endlessly frustrating project over the years the second was that there must be an easier way of doing business this saga would have been concluded much more expeditiously had congress honored a promise made back in the johnson administration to provide a reliable annual stream of money for open space acquisition the fight to raise the 65 million or so necessary to buy the land from a swiss company mr pataki s announcement involved only the 9 million needed to buy the final 2 , 200 acres began back in the 1980 s and eventually engaged the governors of new york and new jersey , the united state congress , the federal forest service , various quasipublic commissions , at least 20 private foundations and hundreds of individual donors the biggest chunks of money were 13 million raised by two nonprofit groups , the open space institute and the trust for public land , 16 million from new york state and 175 million from congress the congressional contribution , the linchpin of the deal , was the hardest to get because western republicans kept holding it hostage to all manner of truly awful legislation in one case , the utah delegation attached the sterling forest authorization to a bill that would have denied wilderness protection to millions of acres of public land in utah with the help of a political odd couple , bill bradley in the senate and newt gingrich in the house , sterling forest was delinked from this and other antienvironmental bills and the authorization was eventually passed as a freestanding measure most public land purchases involve a certain amount of scurrying around for bits and pieces of money but preserving sterling forest would have been easier if congress had been fully financing the federal land and water conservation fund as originally conceived , the fund , which is supported by a tax on offshore oil , was to provide about 350 million a year for federal land purchases and a like amount for open space purchases by the states in most years , congress has provided less than half the money for federal projects and almost none for the states president clinton intends to remedy this his new budget would provide nearly 250 million that could be tapped by the states for projects like sterling forest congress should approve this request to make up for its longstanding indifference
prague , sept 22 shaken by the relentless decline of europe s unified currency , the euro , the european , american and japanese central banks undertook a surprise rescue attempt today to fight what they called a threat to the world economy their move , announced as financial ministers from the group of 7 industrialized nations arrived here in advance of a meeting saturday , was the first time in two years that central banks had staged a coordinated currency intervention and the first time ever that they had done so in support of a european currency the action also represented a shift by the united states treasury secretary , lawrence h summers , who had consistently opposed calls for intervention and as recently as thursday had reiterated support for a strong dollar his comments were widely interpreted at the time as ruling out united states participation in any attempt to strengthen the euro against the dollar the banks bought billions of euros with dollars , yen and british pounds in the intervention , pushing the euro s value up to 90 cents from 85 cents the euro later slipped back to settle at 8787 cents the currency had fallen below 85 cents from its initial price of 118 in january 1999 , a decline of almost 30 percent that disheartened euro supporters , who had seen the new currency as a symbol of their broader ambitions for european unity the intervention underlined fears that europe faces a potential economic shock from the combination of a sinking common currency and soaring oil prices because oil is bought and sold in dollars , the recent rise in the price of oil has hurt european consumers much more than those in the united states this has heightened inflation pressure across europe and could force the european central bank to raise interest rates enough to slow the european economy robust european growth , in turn , has helped extend the recordlong american expansion , so any slowdown in europe could directly hurt the united states explaining united states participation in the currency action today , mr summers cited risks to the global economy the united states and japan joined with the european central bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy , he said in a statement the european central bank released an almost identical statement to explain its action none of the central banks disclosed how much they spent to buy euros , but some currency market analysts speculated the total was as much as 10 billion the success of today s intervention will depend on whether the euro climbs further or resumes its decline , and that may not be clear for weeks or even months but the banks as a group have much more money at their disposal to buy euros , and the action today raised the prospect they could swoop in again if they decide the euro is too weak we did n't have a particular level in mind , said otmar issing , the european central bank s chief economist that was n't the goal moreover , the united states decision to come to the aid of the europeans made the joint action far more likely to restore some luster to the tarnished euro , several traders and analysts said the united states so rarely seeks to interfere in currency markets that it carries considerable influence when it does the global action also represents the first time that central banks of japan , canada and britain joined the new european central bank in defending the euro , a vote of support as the european bank faces the toughest test of its short existence the move is risky for the clinton administration the strong dollar has been an important ingredient of the recordbreaking united states economic expansion by helping keep imports relatively inexpensive and inflation low if today s market action were to help restore the euro to what many economists consider its value based on economic fundamentals , that would mean an increase of at least 15 percent , making a euro roughly equivalent to 1 any sharp decline in the dollar would raise the cost of imports in the united states , add to the already enormous trade deficit , and possibly force the federal reserve board to raise interest rates faster or higher than it otherwise would one reason international financial officials had considered active american support for the euro unlikely is that the clinton administration has generally avoided taking actions that might prove detrimental to vice president al gore s presidential campaign , which depends in part on the continued robustness of the american economy speaking to reporters in washington today , mr summers sought to navigate an apparent contradiction between his oftrepeated stance in favor of a strong dollar and the decision to sell dollars and buy euros on the global market he said there had been no change in policy as i have said many times , a strong dollar is in the national interest of the united states , he said currency market analysts generally viewed the intervention as a good thing
west palm beach , fla , oct 20 i hope you come to find that which gives life a deep meaning for you , sister ita ford once wrote to a teenage niece something worth living for , maybe even dying for those words remind her family and friends of the faith that led sister ita and three other roman catholic churchwomen to el salvador and , ultimately , to their deaths at the hands of the salvadoran national guard in 1980 faith has sustained their survivors , as they waited for the day when they could face the generals they say were responsible for the climate of violence that led to the rapes and killings of the four for two weeks , the families have gone to the federal courthouse here to watch two retired generals , jose guillermo garcia and carlos eugenio vides casanova , defend themselves in a wrongfuldeath suit brought by the families of sister ita , sisters maura clarke and dorothy kazel , and a lay missionary , jean donovan each day , friends and relatives follow the case , looking for justice , truth or some sense to emerge from a faraway war and a complicated time you live with the question and hope the answers will come out here , said sister madeline dorsey , a maryknoll nun who also worked in el salvador we see so many connections with the victims and the causes of violence , and you hope the truth this time will come blasting out i guess the hope is that the truth will be revealed and there will be an end to impunity five national guard members were convicted in the murders no higherranking officer has been held accountable the trial has been fraught with details about the 12year civil war that claimed 75 , 000 lives how death squads singled out priests , doctors , political opponents and villagers caught between the two sides the generals , now living here , have testified that they lamented the violence , but that never knew who was behind it they insisted that they never obstructed investigations , even though international reports and embassy cables said they knew much and did little the suit is one of the few under the torture victims protection act in which the defendants have faced the charges the former generals arrive together each day , without friends or family , because , as one of them said , they saw no need to subject them to the proceedings although interest in the trial has not been overwhelming in el salvador , there are signs that it has had some effects this week , prosecutors said they might reopen the case of six jesuits who were slain , along with their housekeeper and her daughter , by soldiers in 1989 the major salvadoran dailies have reported from the trial , but the rightwing el diario de hoy has often omitted references to death squads it has recently preferred to run articles on how the leftist sandinistas of nicaragua helped the salvadoran rebels echoes of anticommunist arguments have also come from the family of mr vides casanova , who was director of the guard when the women were killed in paid newspaper advertisements , they disparagingly call the women the little nuns , while likening the generals to davids who will ultimately triumph against the goliaths who brought the case human rights advocates said the case was being closely watched by officers in el salvador , guatemala and elsewhere who are concerned that although the conflicts ended with amnesties they could still be prosecuted for atrocities at the same time , it is an important part of the postwar reconciliation many people i talked to in el salvador stressed the goal is not to punish , said ken hurwitz , a consultant to the lawyers committee for human rights , which helped build the case against the generals the goal is to have the truth that hope brought several people from el salvador to watch the trial some of them have their own cases pending here against the military to them , the case gives them the encouragement that they never had in el salvador , where the courts and politicians have been reluctant to pursue any such trials the international aspects have always been a concern for the women s families they questioned why the united states sent so much aid to a country whose military killed civilians and they were astonished to learn a few years ago that the two generals had retired to florida in 1989 none of us had any idea they were living in the united states , jean donovan s brother mike said i guess our government had other priorities than resolving the murder of my sister
on the grounds of the naval undersea warfare center in new london , where scientists invented sonar , stands an exotic artifact that seems as if it lost its way but 34 years ago , someone did indeed plant a giant sequoia tree at the center with not a mountain in sight , its usual habitat , the tree thrived and now stands 40 feet tall connecticut is an odd place to find such a legendary tree , but there are isolated sequoias around the state there are not enough to qualify as a forest and none big enough to drive through , like some of the giants in california , and they are still curiosities in a state more known for white oaks the conifer , sequoiadendron giganteum , is related to the california redwood tree both are cypress trees with reddish bark and scales on their leaves and can grow hundreds of feet tall in connecticut , there is a giant sequoia in greenwich , another in new london and one in waterbury there used to be two in stonington , but one died last year east haven has two , and one is the state champion giant sequoia , standing 65 feet tall the tallest giant sequoia \( at 82 feet \) in new england is in bristol , ri none of connecticut s giant sequoias grew here naturally they were all planted by someone , sometimes in the backyard glenn dreyer , director of the connecticut college arboretum , said trees such as sequoias were not meant to spread naturally into the forest in a place like southern new england because the elevation was much lower and the climate colder than where they thrive in the sierra nevada but mr dreyer said the weather in southern new england was not too harsh for them there are an awful lot of exotic plants that we bring in that do n't take root , mr dreyer said but not so the giant sequoia the champion sequoia in east haven , on laurel street , almost did not survive , when it ended up in the way of new housing there , a developer was confronted with the 65foothigh tree and found a way to keep it where it was i worked around it , said frank frumento , of new haven the second sequoia in east haven was planted in 1967 by former owners of a house on andrews court susan giangreco , the current property owner , said the tree continued to grow at the back of her property it is beneath a silver maple and leans a bit to reach the light , mr dreyer said in greenwich , about 40 years ago , a nursery worker for the town planted a giant sequoia in the municipal tree nursery there , among trees cultured for use in town parks , the sequoia grew from 4 feet to nearly 40 feet , its height today , said robert wagner , assistant superintendent of parks and trees it was nothing special at the time , she said it was ordered in , probably more or less to see if it would survive greenwich does not grow its own trees anymore its sequoia was left to grow near the maintenance building in bruce park on davis avenue a splitrail fence protects it mr wagner said he learned from trips out west that the trees suffered if footsteps compacted the soil around them when andrew and amy hallberg moved into his grandmother s former house on stanton lane in stonington four years ago , they found a giant sequoia and another redwood species , the meta sequoia \( also called the dawn sequoia \) , thriving in the yard both trees came from the brooklyn botanic garden about 45 years ago , dr hallberg said dr and mrs hallberg like the dawn sequoia with its deciduous needles so much that they planted another one they got at a nursery in four years it grew from 12 to 24 feet tall , he said the two older trees , the giant sequoia and the dawn sequoia , are about 70 feet tall a giant sequoia grew to about 20 feet tall before it died last year on river road in the pawcatuck section of stonington , said john parker , who lives there with his brother , david the two men believe the tree was a wild seedling when they planted it in 1965 , although they were not certain where it originally grew they got the tree as a gift margarett jones , the director of the denison pequotsepos nature center in stonington , saw the tree before it died , and noted , the conditions are not ideal for it here , so they 're not totally happy sequoias also grow in private yards in waterbury and new london , and a meta sequoia is thriving in wilcox park in the pawcatuck section of stonington new london s giant sequoia still looks more like someone s overgrown christmas tree , but it could someday live up to its name it has a thick trunk and healthy branches with just a few spots near the top with brown needles weather might have damaged the top , where a new primary shoot is sticking up it looks a lot better than two diseased black pines next to it mr dreyer of the connecticut college arboretum visited the tree this spring for the first time i 'd never been down to fort trumbull , he said , adding that he had no idea there was a sequoia only a few miles from the arboretum staff members of the former warfare center planted their new london sequoia in april 1966 it was one and a half feet tall the sequoia rode east on an airplane with the lab s former technical director , harold e nash the donation was the first ornament planted next to a memorial to world war ii merchant mariners the center s campus has sat empty since the early 1990 s today , the land is owned by the new london development corporation , which for the last several years has been planning what will be new london s most expansive redevelopment effort in decades the fort trumbull neighborhood is being transformed from a littleknown section that , besides the sound lab , was best known for a scrapmetal yard and the city s sewagetreatment plant the centerpiece of the new development will be pfizer s new research center , a public park and fort trumbull state park , all on the banks of the thames river the giant sequoia will stand untouched while the corporation builds a hotel on its shore side and a condominium complex to its west , said damon hemmerdinger , director of real estate development for the corporation the war memorial around the tree will also stay , he said we have been working on how to be sure that both the memorial and the tree are treated appropriately over time , mr hemmerdinger said rest assured that for the last nine months , or longer , we 've been very aware that there s a tree there that deserves special attention members of new london landmarks , a preservation organization , have only recently learned about the sequoia and paid a visit to the former sound lab property they want it to remain a centerpiece of the transformed campus , said stephen hallquist , a new london resident who is a member this is definitely unique , mr hallquist said it s not something you find in everybody s neighborhood photos the sequoia at fort trumbull park , above , and a tree on a private residence in east haven , below \( c m glover for the new york times \) \( pg 9 \) bob newman , a security guard , stood near a giant sequoia that looks much like an overgrown christmas tree , in fort trumbull state park \( c m glover for the new york times \) \( pg 8 \) the state has at least a half dozen giant sequoia trees , including a 65footer in east haven , at left , that is the state champion a developer worked around the tree so it could remain where it was \( c m glover for the new york times \) \(

to the editor in his review of the circus fire , by stewart o'nan \( july 2 \) , edward hoagland says that there are a number of estimable circus books by authors like john culhane , bill ballantine and john and alice durant , but none until now have been devoted to the biggest of american bigshow disasters he neglected to mention the great hartford circus fire \( 1991 \) , by henry s cohn and david bollier surely this volume , which anticipates o'nan s , ought to have been acknowledged stephen joel trachtenberg washington
the nazi olympics berlin 1936 by susan d bachrach illustrated 136 pp boston little , brown company 2195 \( ages 10 and up \) the sepia photograph on the jacket of the nazi olympics berlin 1936 shows a formation of hundreds of smiling uniformed boys with eyes fixed on a lone torchbearing runner as he approaches the olympic flame the scene is typical of many olympic ceremonies , but these boys are members of the hitler youth and this was the 1936 berlin summer games , hitler s paean to aryan superiority many serious analyses have been published about this key event in nazi germany s quest for legitimacy , but this volume , based on a 1996 exhibition at the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington , is not for scholars but for children 10 years old and up it should be in every school library in september many children will watch on television the truly remarkable feats taking place in australia during the 2000 olympics they will see athletes of all races , nationalities and creeds competing for medals most youngsters do n't know that the games were once held in a nation that prohibited a segment of its population from participating , let alone attending the history of the olympics was marred by various tragedies throughout the 20th century , but the 1936 games were a stage on which sanctioned racism and antisemitism were played out for the world to see children today who view sports as a kind of melting pot , where excellence transcends prejudice , will be surprised to learn that athletics was \( and is \) sometimes used as a propaganda weapon in hitler s germany sports was a tool in the propagation of aryan culture , which forbade nonaryans to take part the nazi olympics uses sports as a lens to examine the roots of antisemitism and the holocaust of course , this is not bedtime reading susan d bachrach , a historian in the exhibitions division of the united states holocaust memorial museum , neither sugarcoats nor simplifies the issues that surrounded the olympics instead she gives a detailed , though perfectly accessible , account of what led to hitler s obsession with the games and the complicity of other nations in making them a nazi showcase it reflects the never again theme of the holocaust memorial itself the book is filled with fascinating and disturbing short items that underscore the ramifications of the event in one , under a photograph of the dutch women s gold medal gymnastic team , the caption summarizes the fate of its five jewish members in the camps all but one woman were killed in the holocaust , it reads another lists a sample of the actions taken in germany to bar jews or 'nonaryans' from sports clubs and facilities in the three years before the 1936 olympics another is about ruth langer , 15 years old , the 1936 austrian champion in the 100 and 400meter freestyle races she boycotted the olympics because of antisemitism what makes this book a very useful teaching tool for social studies and history classes is its keen account of the complex politics that infused the olympics since antisemitism was at the heart of the nazi regime , inevitably jewish participation was an issue at the games for germans and nongermans alike controversy pursued the decision by american coaches to bench their only two jewish runners , claiming they needed the fastest athletes to win the race one , sam stoller , wrote in his diary that it was the most humiliating episode in his life bachrach says that some individuals , including stoller , came to believe that antisemitism , and the desire of avery brundage , the american director of the olympics organization , not to embarrass hitler by having two jewish athletes on the winning podium , also helped explain the change it s a passage that will surely pique classroom discussions paradoxically , the 1936 olympics marked a triumph for africanamerican athletes in addition to winning numerous medals , the track stars jesse owens , mack robinson \( jackie s brother \) and john woodruff , among others , left germany with good memories of their treatment by the german public and the friendships they developed at the stadium nonetheless , bachrach also notes that the reception that africanamerican athletes received from nazi officials was chilly hitler reportedly refused to shake owens s hand and when olympic protocol officers urged the fhrer to receive all the medal winners or none , he opted for the latter propaganda minister joseph goebbels decreed that newspapers had to show due respect for africanamerican athletes as american citizens , but in his private diary after the second day of the games , he wrote we germans won a gold medal , the americans three , of which two were negroes that is a disgrace white people should be ashamed of themselves the nazi olympics is illustrated with a rich collection of rare visual material , including a selection of fullcolor nazi posters promoting the games , and a few foreign ones protesting them some of the juxtapositions of images are vivid and telling a photograph of sachsenhausen concentration camp , which accepted its first prisoners in the fall of 1936 , is on the same spread as a postcard by the british cartoonist david low , satirizing olympic courtesy , in which nazis are instructed to be courteous to jews from june 30 to sept 1 it is verboten to bump jews with iron bars without first saying 'excuse me' it is equally verboten to kick jewish women in streetcars without first rising and offering your seat as children enjoy the 2000 olympics , and perhaps learn from the team and individual accomplishments , the nazi olympics offers a chance to address the power of sports as a means to capture the public s hearts and minds the 1936 olympic games were significant though narrowcast , captured in just a few images today s spectacles are broadcast live to millions of viewers around the world via satellite perhaps the first discussion question in class might be this if hitler s games had been seen by such a huge audience , would the holocaust have still happened \?
only a week earlier kirby puckett had become baseball s first 3 millionayear player with a threeyear , 9 million contract with minnesota and now oakland was about to announce a new contract for rickey henderson that would pay him 3 million a year over four years but henderson was not happy in november 1989 , he wanted to be the highestpaid player , bar none , and he had groused to his agent , richmond bry , that he had failed to get him there they were on their way into a news conference at oakland coliseum when an electrician , working in the area , spotted the athletics star hey , rickey , the workman shouted , it better be 4 million a year turning to bry , henderson said , see , i told you with henderson , it has always been about money that attitude has made him no different from most players , most people it s just that henderson has often reacted more severely to perceived economic slights than most it was his unhappiness with his 2 million salary this year that plunged him into a preseason funk that undermined his performance and fueled his premature departure from the mets had henderson had a 315 batting average and a 423 onbase percentage , the figures he attained last season , the mets would not have released him in his 22nd year in the major leagues had the mets been winning three out of every five games , they would have given henderson more time to get back to the leadoff hitter who caused consternation every time he reached base the problem was that he was providing virtually no production \( 219 batting average \) but creating much consternation for mets management his teammates had no problem with henderson , at 41 years old a senior player always willing to help younger players but it has always been thus with rickey long before the 2000 salary fallout fell into bobby valentine s lap , tony la russa , with oakland , and lou piniella , with the yankees , endured the rickey brand of aggravation the second spring after henderson signed that 3 millionayear contract , he boycotted the early days of spring training in the interim 15 months , dozens of players had signed more lucrative contracts and henderson was n't happy i still do n't like the contract , he said i never liked the contract from the day i signed it la russa acknowledged that the athletics knew henderson , by his absence , was making a statement we can appreciate it , the manager said on the day henderson was officially late for spring training but once he makes his statement , he has to be here for the team at some point , get in camp in an attempt to lure henderson to camp , the manager and the players goodhumoredly established a rickey appreciation fund , stuffing a 10inchhigh jar several times over with dollar bills we 're just trying to make the point , la russa said , 'you 're worth more than 3 million we know it we want you' henderson had won the american league most valuable player award the year before , the first year of the contract but in 1991 , the year of his boycott , his production plunged , and he was suspected of not playing hard because he was unhappy with his contract it was a scenario that would be repeated this year people mix my business with my job , henderson said at that time it s two different things he blamed his belowaverage season on an injured body , not a disgruntled state of mind i get hurt , and the press says you 're dogging it , he said like i'm supposed to be a robot if i get hurt and i play , they say , 'why do you play \? ' but if i do n't play , they do n't believe me they say , 'why are n't you playing \? ' how can i win \? i ca n't win henderson did not win in 1987 , when he was out with a hamstring injury neither did the yankees , who had been in contention , after george steinbrenner delivered one of the most destructive acts in his ownership of the team piniella had become impatient waiting for henderson to return and made some comments privately to other club officials but piniella himself became embroiled in a dispute with steinbrenner the owner retaliated by disclosing piniella s comments , saying that the manager had called the general manager about henderson and said he s a dog i want him out of here trade him henderson has moved around in his career he has played for the athletics four different times and the yankees , toronto , san diego , anaheim and the mets once each based on his performances with the padres and the angels in 1996 and '97 and with the athletics in '98 , he appeared to be closing in on the end of a brilliant career but the mets , seeking a left fielder and a leadoff hitter , signed him for the 1999 season and added an option for this year he was a pleasant surprise for them last season , helping fire them into the playoffs his performance in the series against arizona was also exceptional but the year ended sourly , when he was accused of playing cards in the clubhouse with bobby bonilla in the final innings of the final game with atlanta the mood did n't improve in the ensuing months as he complained about the 2 million salary that vested automatically when he reached his 500th plate appearance last season the mets will formally place him on unconditionalrelease waivers today he will clear waivers wednesday , then pursue a job with another team , perhaps detroit or seattle a change of atmosphere always gives a person new life , henderson once said i'm looking to play even better than i have this year rickey has almost always responded positively to change he will surprise no one if he does it again in the coming weeks photo rickey henderson , center , in the mets' dugout at shea stadium saturday in what was to be his last game as a member of the mets \( chang w lee the new york times \)
boston , april 1 in his first major personnel decision as the rangers' de facto general manager , dave checketts , the madison square garden president , suspended defenseman stephane quintal without pay for the rest of the season late friday night for conduct deemed detrimental to the hockey club simply put , quintal was sent home because he could not keep his mouth shut the rangers made certain this afternoon that they would follow in quintal s footsteps soon capping an ominous week that began with checketts firing neil smith , the team president and general manager , and coach john muckler , the rangers were mathematically eliminated from a postseason spot for the third consecutive season despite rallying for a 22 tie with the boston bruins at a halfempty fleet center mike york s goal with 1 minute 20 seconds left in the third period prevented the sixth straight loss for the rangers , who are 182 over their last 11 games the setting of the rangers' latest mathematical elimination was fitting next door to where the boston garden used to stand the last time the rangers missed the playoffs in three consecutive seasons was in the mid1960 s , when the national hockey league had just six teams and the rangers and the bruins seemed to miss the playoffs every year the rangers have three games left until their summer break but quintal s tenure with the rangers appears to be over after one underachieving season in 75 games , quintal had 2 goals and 14 assists for 16 points with a plusminus mark of minus10 checketts , scheduled to join the rangers in washington on monday , suspended quintal on the advice of the assistant general manager , don maloney in an interview with the frenchlanguage daily la presse of montreal earlier this week , quintal said he erred in signing with the rangers last summer and wanted to return to montreal my heart is in montreal , quintal was quoted as saying quintal , 31 , is from boucherville , quebec he played with the canadiens the last four seasons before signing a fouryear , 114 million contract with the rangers all i know is he does n't want to be a ranger , john tortorella , the interim coach of the rangers , said before making his national hockey league coaching debut today what mr checketts did is right he sent him home tortorella and maloney both met with quintal on friday , after reading an english translation of the quintal interview published by the toronto star quintal had been unhappy with the way he was treated by muckler , who was fired on tuesday today was the rangers' first game since the firings in quintal s la presse interview , he was also quoted as saying we had been expecting muckler to go since october it was hell he argued with most of the veterans honestly , petr nedved is not a no 1 center in the nhl maybe there were too many chiefs and not enough indians it s like the experienced guys did n't dare take the lead in the dressing room quintal s agent , pat brisson , said today q may have gone a little too far he was somewhat relieved that john was n't going to be back anymore but by the same token , he probably unfortunately went a little too far maloney said that when checketts addressed the team the day after the firings , he said , 'we want to see who wants to be a member of the rangers' when this comes out two days later , it was intolerable to both dave and myself at least one rangers veteran expressed surprise at quintal s comments especially with the way this organization treats you , the player said slap shots don maloney , the assistant general manager , said that the rangers would love to promote some players from hartford of the american hockey league to give them some national hockey league experience in the rangers' last three games maloney mentioned three defensemen tomas kloucek , dale purinton and aleksei vasilyev , none of whom has played in the nhl the fourth name maloney mentioned was left wing daniel goneau , who has not played in the nhl since the 199798 season maloney also said the rangers would like to give both milan hnilicka and jeanfrancois labbe a game in goal before the season is through the rangers game on sunday , against the flyers , has been changed from 3 pm on abc to noon on msg the move was made because abc dropped the broadcast of the game defenseman mike mottau , a rangers draft pick , will play in the national collegiate athletic association final four for boston college next weekend the only defenseman nominated for the hobey baker award , mottau met with maloney after today s game to explore the possibility of signing a contract right after the tournament , so he could join hartford for the playoffs
eli wallach and anne jackson are old hands at being a couple , onstage and off , so it s not surprising that as they cavort together as a longmarried pair of retired comedians in anne meara s new play , down the garden paths , their chemistry feels as established as the periodic table the play , which opened at the minetta lane theater yesterday , is a dubiously contrived family drama that makes an unrevelatory point events of a moment can greatly alter whole lives but it is buoyed by the bristly and fond couplehood of the two stars , whose characters , sid and stella garden , are asked to cope with three different versions of their family that could have resulted from a single turning point as sid and stella whose love has survived , along with their relish for a rimshot joke , through each of the play s permutations of fate they preside over the show with the congealed patience of parents who love and tire of their children , whoever their children are the defining moment of their lives was a swimming accident at a lake in the catskills , where the gardens were performing while stella was pregnant with their third child but the play takes place decades later , presenting three renditions of a gathering in the apartment of their younger son , arthur \( john shea \) , a writer who has just received an award for his new book in each of the three scenes what begins as a celebration devolves into a welter of recriminations the first scenario , a hackneyed agglomeration of familial difficulties , portrays the marriage of arthur and his wife , liz \( leslie lyles \) , as strained by their childlessness arthur s selfpityingly envious older brother , max \( adam grupper \) , a philandering drunk , argues bitterly with his wife , claire \( roberta wallach \) their younger sister , sharon \( amy stiller \) , irritates everybody by urging them into therapy meanwhile sid and stella are preparing to go to the funeral of a former catskills colleague named shmeckie cabot , recollections of whom catalyze significant memories all of this eventually funnels into a discussion of that day on kiamesha lake , when 8yearold arthur saved max from drowning but what if it had n't turned out that way \? what if arthur had jumped into the lake but max drowned anyway \? or what if arthur saved his brother s life but not before he 'd suffered irreversible brain damage \? these are the suppositions of scenarios 2 and 3 , which are presented with the appropriate additions and subtractions to the cast and alterations in the characters none of the resulting relationships ever rise above the expected cliches but beyond that , ms meara s script shrugs rather willfully at logic to illustrate the idea that life is built on an evanescent foundation , its mysteries as elusive as fate , she has arthur , in one scenario , try to explain quantum physics and in another , a particular brand of new age hokum the play considers both with amused resignation the point seems to be who knows about life \? fair enough the reason of the universe is beyond most of us but the inner logic of a play should n't be if a moment can change a life , one might still accept , for the purpose of drama , that whether or not arthur saved his brother s life , he still married the same woman but why , if his brother was permanently impaired , should arthur turn out to be gay \? and let s say what happened on the lake could reasonably determine whether arthur grew up with one sibling or two \( or none \) , whether he became a serious or pseudoscientist and whether he became a father but why , in every version , does he end up getting the same award and living in the same apartment \? all things considered , within the individual segments , the actors do pretty well , particularly mr shea he manages to portray variations on arthur , with his sequential troubles , without obscuring the central spine of a character stifled by a sense of responsibility ms lyles s two versions of liz are nicely drawn , one quietly frustrated , one not so quietly mr grupper s drunken max and his braindamaged max are both a bit overblown the cast also includes angela pietropinto in the unenviably unsalvageable role of the mc of the awards banquet that introduces each of the family scenes , and ms meara s husband , jerry stiller , who appears in unfunny videotaped segments as the fruitcake scientist for whom arthur s award is named the play is a family affair in more ways than one ms stiller , who plays mr shea s irritating sister with amusing relish but is stretched as his daughter , is in fact the daughter of the playwright and mr stiller and roberta wallach , who plays two women aching for love , overplaying one for laughs , nicely understating the other , is the daughter of mr wallach and ms jackson it is mostly the two stars , though , who prevent the show from crumbling into nonsense they present sid and stella as people growing old with pride and regret , but mostly refusing to have their lives dismissed when ms jackson recalls stella s sexy younger self with a rocketteish leg kick , or mr wallach s sid lapses into an imitation of shmeckie cabot s most legendary routine a mincing drag queen that infuriates the gay arthur it does n't matter what the past has wrought on the family the actors are in the moment , and the audience is , too down the garden paths by anne meara directed by david saint sets by james youmans costumes by david murin lighting by michael lincoln sound by chris bailey video design by stan open productions production stage manager , thomas clewell production managers , kai brothers and dominic housiaux general manager , roy gabay associate producer , marjorie martin the george street playhouse long wharf theater production presented by elliot martin , max cooper , ron shapiro and sharon karmazin at the minetta lane theater , 18 minetta lane , greenwich village with eli wallach \( sid garden \) , anne jackson \( stella dempsey garden \) , john shea \( arthur garden \) , angela pietropinto \( professor cramer \) , jerry stiller \( herschel strange \) , leslie lyles \( liz garden \) , adam grupper \( max garden \) , amy stiller \( sharon garden and jodie garden \) and roberta wallach \( claire shayne and claire garden \) photo from left , anne jackson , john shea and eli wallach in down the garden paths , in which a past event haunts the uncertain present \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
washington , june 16 two advocacy groups accused the democratic and republican parties today of breaking federal election law by using large softmoney contributions to pay for television commercials now showing across the country to promote the campaigns of vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas leaders of the nonpartisan groups , common cause and democracy 21 , which both advocate the overhaul of federal election laws , said they intended to file complaints next week with the justice department and the federal election commission challenging the legality of the advertisements that began showing in 15 states last weekend there is not even an effort to hide the fact that these are ads for the candidates paid for by soft money , and that is illegal , scott harshbarger , the president of common cause and a former massachusetts attorney general , said today fred wertheimer , the president of democracy 21 , said we are charging both the presidential campaigns and the political parties with breaking the law with these ads we are going to do everything we can to make sure that the law is enforced this time , and that these violations are not given a free ride again four years ago , common cause challenged the legality of millions of dollars of similar advertising , charging that the commercials promoted specific candidates , not party issues although some lawyers and officials at the justice department and the election commission agreed , neither agency took action common cause and democracy 21 are hoping that the new complaints will be more persuasive federal election law prohibits the use of soft money , the unrestricted donations to the parties , to pay for political advertisements that promote the election of individual candidates the republican and democratic parties defended the commercials , saying they advocated particular issues and did not violate the spirit or the letter of federal election law these ads are perfectly appropriate and legal , said jenny backus , a spokeswoman for the democratic national committee our ads reflect a unified democratic message , whether it is for the presidency , the congress or key state and local races cliff may , the spokesman of the republican national committee , said party lawyers concluded that the republican issue advertisements were within the law it s very clear that our ad is about social security , mr may said , and it is appropriate to have the leader of the party talking about that in the 1996 presidential campaign , the parties challenged each other s spending of millions of dollars on similar issueadvocacy advertisements this year , without speaking to each other , the parties have settled on a set of unofficial rules of engagement the candidates can appear in the issueadvocacy commercials , even speak in them , as long as each advertisement deals with a single issue in the first flurry of party advertisements that began running last weekend , both mr gore and mr bush appear , with mr gore expressing his concern about the high cost of prescription drugs and mr bush detailing his proposals for overhauling the social security system this weekend , the democrats are introducing a new , softmoney issue advertisement timed for father s day on sunday , the advertisement features mr gore promoting responsible fatherhood , and it includes some biographical information about mr gore s relationship with his father none of the commercials contain a specific electioneering message asking voters to support or oppose either presumptive presidential nominee in 1996 , similar issue advertisements also did not contain the words vote for or vote against the party standardbearers the absence of an electioneering message helped insulate the parties from the legal challenge from common cause while some officials and lawyers at the justice department and the federal election commission believed the 1996 issue advertisements were thinly veiled candidate commercials that should not have been paid for with party funds , neither agency took action against the parties both the democratic and republican commercials are being paid for with a mix of hard money , the contributions to candidates and political parties that are limited under federal law , and soft money , the unlimited contributions made to political parties by corporations , unions and wealthy individuals campaign reform advocates said the issue advertisements now being shown amounted to commercials to promote mr bush and mr gore as proof , they say the commercials are appearing in several important battleground states in the presidential race , including florida , missouri and wisconsin it is a total fiction and a fraud to claim that these are political party issue advertisements , said mr wertheimer , the president of democracy 21 everyone involved knows they are presidential campaign ads being run for the direct purpose of influencing the presidential campaign , and therefore they cannot be financed with soft money
calgary , alberta , june 24 with the national hockey league entry draft in canada , the saddledome was filled with canadian fans who came to cheer for canadian players but midway through the first round , a man sitting in the upper deck took advantage of a quiet moment to shout toward the stage , what is this , a european draft \? his perception was at least half accurate of the 30 players chosen in the first round , 15 were europeans five others were american , and only 10 were from canada and the first canadian , dany heatley , was born in germany but grew up in calgary he plays for the university of wisconsin and was chosen by atlanta of the three teams from the new york metropolitan area , the islanders and the devils made the most noise , the islanders with deals and two picks in the top five , the devils with seven choices among the first 76 the rangers had no firstround choice , one in the second round and none in the third they were scheduled to pick 38th over all , but they traded that choice to detroit for the red wings' picks in the second and third rounds in the second round , with the 64th choice over all , the rangers drafted filip novak , a defenseman from the czech republic who played last season with regina of the western canadian junior league with their pick in the third round , 95th over all , the rangers chose dominic moore , a center from ontario who plays for harvard the nhl s central scouting service says novak is a good skater with a low and accurate shot from the blue line but needs to improve his physical game he scored seven goals in 47 games moore , according to the same service , is a smooth skater with good speed , hockey sense and backchecking intensity he scored 12 goals in 28 games
auckland , new zealand , friday , jan 14 they were jeered as they left the viaduct basin in the morning by a group of new zealanders who questioned their ethics , and what happened on the racecourse in the afternoon did little to lift the spirits of stars and stripes' experienced and ultimately beleaguered crew needing a victory against america true today to force a sailoff with the prada challenge for the second spot in the america s cup challenger finals , dennis conner s blue boat never came close to extending its season on a day when it had both light winds and another protest hanging over it the final margin of victory by america true in this makeup match was 1 minute 32 seconds , the same margin america true had built on the opening leg after the boats split at the start and america true picked the proper side of the course from then on , the two californiabased boats were often so far apart that they should have been examining different weather reports though conner and the men who have sailed america s cup yachts for him have a history of turning adversity into victory , there was to be no rousing comeback today against a team that had been eliminated and was sailing only for honor there s a thing called the wooden spoon , and we do n't want it , said america true s skipper , dawn riley , the night before the race , in reference to the booby prize awarded to the lastplace boat in 1995 , riley sailed on mighty mary , the boat with the female crew that conner s boat famously caught from way behind in the defender s trials , erasing a deficit of nearly five minutes on the last leg but today , riley and the other members of america true s maleandfemale crew had the satisfaction of hanging onto a big lead against stars and stripes the difference was that conner was not on board today , just as he has not been on board throughout the semifinals all of the women were thinking back to 1995 , but none of the guys , riley said with a laugh afterward america true , which represents the san francisco yacht club , ended up fifth among the six semifinalists , and today s victory was its fourth in five races against stars and stripes in this regatta today s race was the last of the semifinals , which featured six teams for the first time in cup history the race had been postponed earlier in the round because stars and stripes had been granted a delay to complete repairs on a damaged stern scoop at the time , riley accused conner , her nextdoor neighbor in the viaduct basin compound since last year , of stalling for time so his wider and sturdier boat would not have to sail hers in light winds but america true got such conditions today it all works out , and now we 're all in this together , riley said of eliminating her neighbors this was a race we needed to do and wanted to do earlier and had to delay it makes you wonder a bit there is momentum in sailboat racing , and i think we lost it after the delay the wind range was 9 to 11 knots and the sea was relatively calm deceptively calm in light of what had transpired in the previous 24 hours on thursday , shortly after stars and stripes had beaten america one to remain in contention for the challenger finals , prada filed a protest against conner s team , claiming that a mainsail it used in the semifinals violated the america s cup protocol because it is , in prada s words , the product of the intellectual creativity and judgment of the young america design program stars and stripes already was stripped of 1 point last week for using a rudder against nippon that breached the protocol because it was made in australia the crux of prada s argument was that the mainsail conner began using in this round bears an uncanny resemblance to one used by young america , the syndicate that represented the new york yacht club and was eliminated before the semifinals while prada accepted the notion that young america had offered no deliberate help to conner s team , it said the similarity of the thread patterns in the two sails meant that stars and stripes has in effect taken young america s sail design into its challenge bill trenkle , the operations manager for conner s team , rejected prada s protest before today s race , saying it was absolutely not true these are desperate people taking desperate measures to try and win this off the water but by the time the beaten stars and stripes crossed the finish line today , the protest was essentially moot prada finished the semifinals with 7 points , stars and stripes with 6 and now prada will face america one in the challenger fiveofninerace finals beginning on jan 25
peoria , ariz , march 4 not every manager working in the last year of his contract is unhappy about it lou piniella of the seattle mariners has no problem with his status i basically have told our people here that we got a new general manager and it s fair to him to let him work with me and make sure he s very comfortable , piniella said i told them that i could manage very , very well on a oneyear contract i 've got no concerns at all the mariners are already in a state of flux , so what is one more piece of uncertainty they finally rid themselves of the agonizing ken griffey jr problem , but alex rodriguez has them biting their nails , so a little thing like a manager is not going to faze them nor will it faze piniella i can manage very well on a oneyear deal , said piniella , who previously managed the yankees and the cincinnati reds i can manage on a oneyear deal forever it does n't bother me some people feel differently i feel if i'm doing my job correctly and well that there s an opportunity whether it s here or somewhere else pat gillick , the new general manager , had nothing but praise for piniella i think lou s an excellent manager , gillick said he handles people well , and he has a real love and passion for the game that s real important from my standpoint , lou s a solid , solid guy but just as piniella said gillick was new , gillick noted that the mariners have a new chief executive officer , too , howard lincoln he wants to see how lou and i get along , gillick said by deferring to gillick , piniella might be keeping his options open after eight seasons in seattle , he could be ready to go elsewhere , or at least consider another job , depending on the openings seven months from now he may want , like griffey , to work closer to home , which is tampa , fla he may want to be available if the reds' job becomes available he managed the reds to the world series title in 1990 , and working conditions have improved since he left two years later i did n't say that , he said in response to the idea of changing jobs i never mentioned that we 'll just wait and see what happens i have n't given it any thought i'm very happy managing just the way i am and whatever happens happens whatever happens this year , piniella said , he wants to continue managing i have some goals that i 'd like to reach , he said , so from that standpoint , yeah , i 'd like to continue managing one of his goals , he said , is to win the world series with an american league team sparky anderson , who last week was elected to the hall of fame , won it in each league , with the reds in the national league and the detroit tigers in the al unlike anderson , piniella played on world series winners , too , though in the same league it s never been done where a guy has played on a winner and managed a team in both leagues to win , piniella said there s another combination he would like to put together i 'd like to win 1 , 500 games , he said i think it s only been done once where a manager has had 1 , 500 hits and 1 , 500 wins some old guy way back when did it fifteen managers gained 1 , 500 or more victories in the 20th century , the socalled modern era of baseball of those who played , none reached the 1 , 500hit plateau in his research , bob rosen of the elias sports bureau had to dip back into the previous century to find the old guy piniella referred to fred clarke , who began playing in 1894 , finished his career with 2 , 672 hits he began managing in 1897 and ended that career with 1 , 602 victories piniella collected 1 , 705 hits as a player and has won 1 , 019 games as a manager he will need a minimum of six seasons to achieve his goal i'm not ready to retire , he said , then added , it s not going to be my choice it wo n't be my option it will be somebody else s option piniella s success as a manager has been good enough that whether he is with the mariners or with other teams he should get the seasons he needs to join fred clarke in that select circle and have the chance to win that elusive world series championship as an american league manager the underselling of gwynn another player with tony gwynn s career would possibly have earned twice the money he has in his 17year career gwynn agreed to his latest contract the other day , a nonguaranteed extension for the 2001 season , prompting a renewed assessment of the san diego star s salary history everybody says that , he readily acknowledged when he was asked if he has always undersold himself you try to figure out what you think you 're worth and try to get it a lot of times it s less than what other guys are getting because other guys are not afraid to go somewhere else with me , this is where i want to be knowing that , you find a number in your mind you feel comfortable with and hopefully that they feel comfortable with this time i wanted to get closer to what i thought i was worth on the open market gwynn thought he was worth 8 million for one year that is what he will make out of the new contract , which includes a 2 million signing bonus , if he has 502 plate appearances or if the padres exercise the option for a 6 million salary if he does n't and they do n't , they will pay him a 2 million buyout
peter oosterhuis is knocking at the masters' outhouse six years after banning gary mccord for chronic naughtiness , the masters must be readying oosterhuis s 2001 credential for a trip through the shredder how else to explain what will happen in light of oosterhuis s bill waltonlike description of vijay singh s missed putt on the eighth hole of sunday s final round that is a horrible misjudgment of the line he knew it was going to be slick , but he just got it started in the wrong direction about the worst putt we 've seen later , oosterhuis described the putt as horrid oosterhuis should be praised , of course , not condemned more often than not , he , peter kostis , bobby clampett and david feherty amply display their ability to analyze a shot before , not after , the golfer swings but by the evidence of sunday s round , ken venturi s penchant for obviousness as cbs s lead analyst is matched only by his predilection for afterthefact analysis take david duval s second shot at the 13th , one of the round s most important as duval assessed the distance and wind , venturi used his halfcentury of golf savvy to say , anything in the creek would be a mistake then he predicted , he s going to try to , i feel , put it between vijay singh s golf ball and the flagstick and not go at the flagstick the analysis conveyed what we thought he thought but he really did n't think that , or if he did , he was n't very serious about it when duval plunked the ball in the lake , venturi told us what he really thought , to fit the result look out ! look out ! wrong move i knew when he started going at the yardage to the hole , he was thinking of going straight that s a mental error if that s what he knew beforehand , why did n't he say it rather than what he said but did n't really mean \? when tiger woods lined up a birdie putt on the ninth hole , venturi did not say what he thought about how woods would strike the ball or where it should go instead , he said he s not jockeying around for position he s coming out trying to win only after the putt went wide right did venturi say what he should have offered in advance that putt is a fooler you 'd swear it has to go left with the slope of the front of the green the comments bespoke his decades of experience why not use it prospectively \? when loren roberts birdied the ninth hole , following the looping break of the green perfectly , venturi waited until the ball was nearly into the hole before saying that tells you something about the break look out ! look out ! thanks for the early warning by contrast , when roberts prepared to chip onto the 10th green , kostis said this chip will have some 15 or 20 feet of break if he chooses the right line anything reasonably direct will run on by the latter occurred before a duval putt on the 17th hole , oosterhuis said uphill , a little left to right it s a little slower than most people expect it today the putt came up short venturi remains an avuncular presence , better suited to reminiscing than to the task of lead analyst from the 18th hole any comparison of venturi to nbc s johnny miller is specious analysis requires regularly saying something surprising or unusual , or offering opinions on plays or putts before they happen now is the time for cbs to install kostis , oosterhuis , feherty or clampett at no 18 cbs came up short on singh s birdie putt at no 18 , which ended the tournament venturi and jim nantz never said he was going for a birdie , nor did they mention it after he sank it cbs also failed to provide an illustration summing up singh s final putt and score , or to show all the final results until several minutes later the angle that showed singh s shot was memorable , as the expectant gallery gradually rose as the putt neared the cup then , venturi concluded the day in this incisive fashion there s no doubt that he played the best golf of the week , and the best golfer this week won the tournament oh , the banality some other masters points the ratings when tiger woods looks as if he ca n't win , ratings suffer he faded on sunday s back nine , finished six strokes behind singh and cbs s nielsen rating fell 2 percent to a 99 from last year , when jose maria olazabal won the opening cbs teed up the final round with a gauzy , sepiatoned opener starring arnold palmer , jack nicklaus , byron nelson and sam snead that looked as spontaneous and unscripted as a world wrestling federation match who knew they allowed cue cards past the magnolia lane of augusta \? the everrosy view nantz s dramatic , whispered reverence never flagged , nor did his retelling of singh s personal story , which probably caused a global rush to locate the best fijian courses he also described snead , 87 , as being as limber as ever as he walked gingerly from the ceremonial first shots on thursday enberg underused dick enberg was underutilized in his limited role from butler cabin that first shot of him with nantz on sunday was clearly a surprise to everyone , and made both men look unprepared and darned if enberg missed a chance at looking painfully awkward beside the master of the masters , william \( hootie \) johnson , during the emotional thud of the green jacket ceremony , which nantz moderated enberg s closing essay was rife with his trademark emotional , sometimes purplish touches , none more apt than his description of augusta s leafy coiffure photo after david duval , right , failed to make an eagle on no 15 , he had little chance of catching vijay singh \( associated press \)
sydney , australia , sept 21 jenny thompson was last out of the pool after tonight s 100meter freestyle this was her final individual event in her third olympic games soon she will retire at 27 and enter medical school at columbia university she checked the giant television screen and the scoreboard to see her name in third place , tied with her teammate dara torres in 5443 seconds , behind another goldmedal effort by inge de bruijn thompson swam slowly toward the edge of the pool , as if she did not want to leave it was a somber moment , filled with condolence instead of elation her career was ending , unsurpassed but oddly unrequited no female american athlete has ever won seven gold medals in the olympics , as thompson has but all of her victories have come in relays , including two here none of the golds has come in individual races , the mark of swimming greatness the united states won eight medals tonight , including a victory in the 200meter backstroke in 1 minute 5676 seconds by lenny krayzelburg , who took the 100 backstroke tuesday all the same , tonight was an evening tinged with consolation it was evident on thompson s stoic face as she lost again to de bruijn of the netherlands it was evident in the sober way she stood on the medal podium next to torres , with whom she has had a tense relationship at 33 , torres is the only american swimmer ever to compete in four olympics returning to the sport after a sevenyear layoff , she was ecstatic about her bronze medal , matching the one she won in the 100 butterfly , but thompson clearly was not i think they were in two different places on the medal stand , said richard quick , the coach of the american women s team and the personal coach of both thompson and torres dara was celebrating the fact that she won her second individual medal jenny had just swum her last individual race there was a goal she set that she did n't accomplish maybe she was a little subdued as a result of that at the 1996 atlanta olympics , thompson did not qualify for any individual events tonight , just as she had done at the 1992 barcelona games , she failed to swim her best race in the most important moment of her career the winner , de bruijn , did not match her own world record of 5377 seconds , set a day earlier , but she won by half a second in 5383 over therese alshammar of sweden once a talented but indifferent swimmer who was kicked off the dutch team for her listless training , de bruijn has now won the 100 butterfly and the 100 freestyle at the sydney games , and will be favored in saturday s 50 freestyle she holds the world record in all three events she has been able to do what thompson has not deliver her most assertive performances in the most crucial races at a critical time , she came through with a critical performance , quick said of de bruijn i take my hat off to her he added there is a state of mind that great athletes can get into that the rest of us do n't understand they relish the pressure of the critical moment perhaps that is where thompson came up short even with two world championships and two world records , she did not thrive in the pressure of the critical moment in the relays , sure in individual events , though , she never fulfilled what she had intended even if she had swum her personal best of 5407 , however , thompson would have finished far behind de bruijn tonight the dominance of the dutch woman s performances has inevitably raised questions about their legitimacy susie o'neill , the australian olympic champion , called de bruijn s flurry of records pretty suss , or suspect , earlier this year , then apologized drug testing in olympic sports is so deficient that there is no certain way to tell whether athletes are using illicit substances to enhance their performances no tests exist , for instance , for such drugs as human growth hormone and artificial blood every remarkable performance in sports such as swimming and track and field brings immediate suspicion women s swimming has become the most tarnished of the olympic sports amid revelations about systematic east german cheating in the 70 s and 80 s , chinese drug use in the 90 s , positive tests by americans , and the 1998 banning of the irish swimmer michelle smith de bruin from international competition for four years de bruijn , who won three gold medals at the atlanta games , was found to have spiked a urine test with alcohol in 1998 the sad thing , said ad roskam , team manager for the dutch swimmers , is that innocent athletes cannot prove their innocence it does n't matter what you do you can have your whole body tested but everyone is talking about drugs , said jacco verhaeren , de bruijn s boyfriend and one of her coaches , who said the state of the sport made him furious de bruijn , who is 27 , has vehemently denied using performanceenhancing drugs her supporters point out that she has been an olympiclevel competitor since 1992 after she did not compete in the atlanta games because she lacked motivation for training , she moved to portland , ore , in 1998 to work with paul bergen , a respected coach who worked previously with the olympic champion tracy caulkins
even at a time when the working definition of opera is extremely loose , the growing body of works that the composer john moran calls operas the latest of which , book of the dead \( second avenue \) , opens tomorrow at the joseph papp public theater is likely to strain an opera fan s notions of the form it is n't just that his subjects are peculiar by operatic standards , or that his works have always been presented by theater companies after all , however odd the jack benny program \( 1989 \) might have seemed , with its streams of repeating snippets from jack benny reruns and its psychedelic imagery , it was n't that much quirkier than , say , einstein on the beach , by mr moran s mentor and professional role model , philip glass and in yoking the story of charles manson in the manson family \( 1990 \) to the characters of the television show hawaii fiveo , mr moran was in sync , however idiosyncratically , with the thennascent trend of turning news events into opera what really makes his works odd , as operas go , is that they tend not to involve live singing , surely one of the defining elements of opera as it has been practiced since 1600 actually , the outer acts of book of the dead do include a singer , and there was some live singing in the manson family but for the most part , those works \( and all of mr moran s others \) are scored not for singers but for actors who lipsync to a tape prepared by mr moran what they lipsync is mostly speech , from which mr moran teases melody by repeating phrases and fragments until the shapes of their inflections are as familiar as what is being said when he does lapse into more conventional melody , it tends not to be the acrobatic sort favored by 19thcentury italian opera composers , or the heroic vocalizing of german opera , but something simple and direct nor are there orchestral accompaniments in mr moran s operas when he needs orchestral sounds or , for that matter , rockband sounds he makes them on a synthesizer musically , he is an eclectic in book of the dead one hears passages that touch on bach , mahler , berg , puccini , retro lounge rock and salsa , without quoting particular works directly he prefers to make this music himself rather than entrust it to live musicians a live ensemble , in any case , would have to be prohibitively diverse , given the variety of music he draws on in much the same way , ambience and sound effects are not left to the vagaries of live performance anything the audience sees a character walking across the stage or opening a door , for example has a corresponding sound effect in mr moran s soundtrack because this demands a tight choreography that adds mime to lipsyncing , the works might even be more accurately called ballets than operas mr moran , an easygoing 34yearold , did not dispute that point , but while he referred to book of the dead as an opera several times during a recent conversation at the public theater , it turns out that he sees connections with another art form entirely this cast has been working on this for a year , most of them , the composer said , just after a rehearsal and it s really dense to separate your sounds from everybody else s takes enormous study but what we do is , we talk about animation a lot the whole soundtrack is made before anything else , and it s extremely specific , yet there s room for the actors to interpret it they each have to study their character and decide that , 'if the character is having such and such a thought right here , how am i going to show that physically \? ' it s like being an animator but it s not me animating the actors it s more them puppeteering their own bodies i 'd say that what s most related to what i do is disneyland , he added what i'm basically working toward , at this point , is trying to create disneylandtype rides but i want them to be featurelength , and i do n't want them to be based on a preexisting commercial product i'm not trying to make moranland , or one particular place i'm trying to make different attractions this is not really opera anymore it s an attraction in purely technical terms , it is an extraordinary undertaking for a composer who has virtually no formal schooling born in nebraska in 1965 , mr moran never completed high school , and an attempt to study informally at the university of nebraska , in lincoln , where his father was assistant dean of arts and sciences , went nowhere but he had sung children s parts in opera productions and was drawn to composition , so when the philip glass ensemble performed in town , mr moran telephoned all the hotels in lincoln until he found mr glass and told him he wanted to compose operas as i remember it , mr glass said , this skinny kid came up and gave me a tape , like all the skinny kids with tapes do , and , believe it or not , i listen to them , at least in a haphazard way and i was struck right away this was a born theater creator , even at that age , which was about 20 this is a rare thing when i think of born theater people , i mean people like robert wilson , meredith monk and richard foreman , and john was young and in nebraska
robert trent jones sr , the golf architect who designed or remodeled more than 500 courses , and who once made a hole in one to justify his redesign of a hole , died on wednesday night at his home in fort lauderdale , fla he was 93 mr jones , who had been in poor health since having a stroke last summer , had retired to florida but for most of his career he worked out of offices in montclair , nj in his seven decades as golf s most prolific architect , mr jones logged an estimated 8 million miles in creating more than 350 courses and remodeling more than 150 others , including 79 that were used for the united states open or other national championships his courses endure in 45 states and 35 foreign countries on every continent except antarctica the sun never sets , he enjoyed saying , on a robert trent jones golf course his death came on the eve of the united states open , which began yesterday in pebble beach , calif he had become connected with that championship because so many were played on courses he either designed or remodeled known as trent , he was a small , cherubfaced man , but his sometimes sadistic use of huge bunkers , ponds , creeks and undulating greens often angered the touring pros , especially during the united states open mr jones believed he was merely defending par against the evolution of golf equipment and the golf ball the shattering of par without a proper challenge is a fraud , he often said i make them play par when mr jones redesigned the fourth hole at the baltusrol golf club s lower course in springfield , nj , before the 1954 united states open , some members thought the par 3 over a pond was unfair he offered to play the hole along with johnny farrell , the club pro , and two members while other members watched playing from the 165yard members tee , mr farrell and the two members each hit balls on the green mr jones stepped up and swung his 4iron his ball landed on the green and rolled into the cup for a hole in one turning to the assembled members , he said gentlemen , the hole is fair eminently fair over the years , mr jones worked on 21 courses that would hold the united states open , notably oakland hills in birmingham , mich , in 1951 none of the world s best golfers broke par 70 that year until the final day when ben hogan , the winner , shot 67 and clayton haefner shot 69 at the presentation ceremony , hogan said , i'm glad i brought this course , this monster , to its knees at a reception later , hogan turned to mr jones s wife , ione , and said , if your husband had to play this course for a living , he 'd be on the bread line mr jones relished retelling both of hogan s comments at the 1970 united states open at hazeltine national in minnesota , the touring pro dave hill , who had shot 75 and 69 , publicly criticized mr jones s design asked what the course lacked , hill said , eighty acres of corn and a few cows asked what should be done to correct the course , hill said , plow it up and start over high winds had created high scores when the winds eased , tony jacklin won that open with 281 , seven under par hill was second at 288 , even par golf is a form of attack and counterattack , mr jones often said it offers a golfer his personal challenge of combat he attacks the course and par the architect creates fair pitfalls to defend its easy conquest the architect calls on his ingenuity to create a hole that will reward only achievement mr jones collaborated with the late bobby jones , the legendary golfer \( no relation \) , in designing peachtree in atlanta at bobby jones s request , he also redesigned the 11th and 16th holes at augusta national , the site of the masters in addition to his 21 united states open courses , mr jones worked on 12 courses that have held the professional golfers association championship and six that held the world cup he designed valderrama in spain , the site of the 1997 ryder cup matches , and the robert trent jones golf club course in manassas , va , the site of the 1994 and 1996 president s cup matches he created a putting green at the white house for president eisenhower , as well as a hole with three different tees at camp david , the president s weekend retreat in maryland mr jones s clients included the rockefeller family , the aga khan and king hassan ii of morocco but among his last designs were 18 public layouts in alabama , the robert trent jones golf trail you look at a piece of ground , he said , and you know instinctively what makes a great hole there is a flow and rhythm that you can feel you think how to stake it out , then use logic to make the right choice it s like a jigsaw puzzle but you have to play golf well , too you have to know the value of shots , how far the ball will go and what it will do mr jones is survived by his two sons , robert trent jr and rees , both prominent golf architects who have been involved in more than 250 courses his wife died in 1987 born in ince , england , on june 20 , 1906 , he was 6 when he accompanied his parents to east rochester , ny , where he later caddied at the country club of rochester he soon developed into a scratch golfer , and was the low amateur in the 1927 canadian open around that time , mr jones met and was inspired by donald ross , the scottish golf architect who was designing oak hill in rochester at cornell , mr jones studied surveying , agronomy , landscaping , horticulture , architecture and sketching he was the first architect inducted into the world golf hall of fame he was a founding member and a former president of the american society of golf course architects and the first recipient of its donald ross award he was the author of golf s magnificent challenge and edited great golf stories , an anthology golf was always in his thoughts after having one stroke , he awakened in his hospital bed to see his two sons at his bedside what are you doing here \? he asked you had a little setback , he was told you had a stroke do i have to count it \? he said photo robert trent jones sr at baltusrol golf club s fourth hole , where he hit a hole in one to justify his redesign \(

a recent story that came across the wire began with the news that although pedro astacio still faces a trial on domestic violence charges , he is scheduled to be on the mound for the colorado rockies when they open the season in atlanta on april 3 what a relief for the rockies and their fans that their 17game winner from last season will be available for starters , and at least through july 5 , when he faces possible deportation to the dominican republic on the same day astacio pitches for the rockies , absent from the same ballpark will be john rocker , beginning his 14day suspension for his offseason remarks about various ethnic groups and gays astacio , meanwhile , is free to pitch , even though he has once admitted guilt a plea that was withdrawn last week to hitting his estranged and pregnant wife in august the point is that for months after astacio received a twoyear deferred sentence in exchange for a guilty plea on charges of thirddegree assault , commissioner bud selig had nothing to say about the quickfisted pitcher he had no fine to impose , no discipline to mete out , no standard to uphold and no integrity of the game to protect in the meantime , selig the righteous has been all over darryl strawberry for abusing himself with drugs , and on top of rocker for insulting so many , while injuring nobody normally , when a crime is part of it , we let the criminal procedure take place without interfering , said richard levin of the commissioner s office then we may or may not take action that sounds fair and just , except astacio had already , in effect , admitted to hitting ana astacio in the right eye in an argument at the home they had shared until the couple separated in june the police report noted that ana astacio had swelling and a red mark on her face under federal law , immigrants convicted of domestic violence felony or misdemeanor are subject to deportation when the united states immigration and naturalization service initiated proceedings , astacio sought to withdraw his plea in littleton , colo , last week , a county judge allowed him to , on the grounds that astacio s lawyers did not adequately inform him of the consequences of his plea an ins district director , joe greene , said , our efforts to seek his deportation are suspended until the courts have spoken he explained the attempt by adding that the message should be that no matter what your station in life or public visibility , you 're not above the law compared with the rocker ruckus , this story has not been so much as a footnote should we be surprised \? this winter , an athlete who has been accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend \( rae carruth , formerly of the carolina panthers \) caused less of a national uproar than the lunkhead lefthander who sounds like a rebroadcast of howard stern s show every time he opens his mouth rocker got a standing ovation last week when he pitched in his first spring training game , which only proves that wrestling fans go to baseball games in other and more significant news , the national football league suspended three players for two games apiece , the first time it has sidelined a firsttime offender for offthefield violence under the league s violentcrime policy one of the players , denard walker of the tennessee titans , was cited after pleading guilty to assault on the mother of his son while this is no earthshattering development against the alarming trend of athletes who physically abuse women , it is a good start , and at least the nfl has a policy baseball has none , said levin , though he correctly pointed out that baseball s offthefield violence at least those cases we find out about has not been close to the plague on football yet selig s aggressiveness with rocker and his silence on astacio opens a window into baseball s soul rocker created a celebrity scandal , a media event , the south s most disparaging mouth versus the country s most diverse market something had to be done the image of the game had to be saved the notion of ballplayers as role models for children had to be preserved but when astacio beats on a pregnant woman , baseball is happy to let the courts handle it , in the hope that some judge or jury will finesse the case and the only remaining blemish will be the one on ana astacio s face the double standards are as depressing as the way we react to them , and report them while we were consumed with rocker , analyzing his words as if they were preceded by thought , an arizona relief pitcher named bobby chouinard is being accused of choking and slapping his wife on christmas for refusing to buy him more beer when that did not convince her , his wife told the police that he held a loaded pistol to her head and made her beg for her life chouinard , facing 5 to 15 years if convicted , asked to be put on waivers by the diamondbacks so he could work on difficult and regrettable problems this relieved baseball , for the time being , of any obligation to suspend him selig s inaction on the astacio case suggests that chouinard may have , no pun intended , jumped the gun
boston frederick law olmsted , the landscape architect responsible for central park in manhattan and prospect park in brooklyn , also designed the meandering greenbelt here known as the emerald necklace olmsted knew that industrialage urban life was no walk in the park his leafy respites were thoughtfully based on his beliefs that scenic pleasure in settings accessible to all would not only restore health and sanity , but bolster democracy by commingling classes toward these utopian goals , olmsted s original landscape designs were meticulously planned to engineer how people used and moved through them , with wide malls in which to gather , meandering pathways that encouraged contemplation of picturesque , naturallooking \( but often highly manufactured \) vistas , and interlacing carriage trails , bridged or sunken so as not to interrupt the leisurely pace of strollers his idealism and his orchestration of spatial movement , in fact , are similar in spirit to much of today s public art and installation art art on the emerald necklace , an outdoor exhibition sponsored by the institute of contemporary art and by vita brevis , the institute s separate program of temporary public art , is on view here through aug 20 it features temporary works by nine artists and landscape architects placed in and around the last system of urban parks olmsted designed , begun in 1876 the artworks either celebrate or beg comparison with olmsted s complex and subtle 19thcentury vision in a few cases they direct a contemporary spotlight on his lefttocrumble ideas olmsted had decamped to the boston area toward the end of his career , disillusioned with the lack of stewardship of his new york city parks paradoxically , boston has retained far fewer remnants of olmsted s original designs than new york franklin park , the largest of the links on the necklace , was never fully realized within it , olmsted s rolling country park section is now a golf course none of the rustic structures he designed and built for franklin park remain , including , sadly , his much admired playstead overlook shelter that sat near playing fields the boston parks and recreation department , the cosponsor of the exhibition , has renewed efforts to restore olmsted s vision where possible , rebuilding stone bridges and original walkways as yet unrestored are intriguing traces of the olmsted era , like a stairway to nowhere and the rusting base of a lamp post one such ruin , an abandoned and crumbling bear cage , inspired two separate works in the show , by the artist nari ward and the choreographerperformance artist ann carlson , both based in new york their works not only spotlight olmsted s abandoned ideas , but larger issues of urban politics franklin park is surrounded by lowincome neighborhoods , which for many years have been a factor in the neglect of the area ms carlson is known for working in the tradition of tableaux vivants inspired by archival photographs here , her performance titled any day now , part of a larger series that started in new york in may , uses nine performers dressed in early 20thcentury costume to reenact a photograph made sometime between 1905 and 1915 of the bear cage site when it was in use \( the piece was performed on the weekend of july 7 and will be repeated on aug 18 , 19 and 20 , from 5 pm to 7 pm \) ms carlson s costumed performers , some with oldfashioned perambulators , start out by approaching the ruined cage in slow motion , as if pushing through thick layers of time arriving at what remains of a tall fence that surrounded the cage , they strike poses mimicking the figures in the photo , looking like genteel time travelers who have wandered into the gritty urban present mr ward s contribution , titled beautiful necessity hugging post , is a stationary work made from a remnant found at the overgrown site a rusty cylindrical grill once used to protect a tree inside the cage from the bears the grill is mounted on steel supports , creating an airy tower visitors may stand inside , where it s presumed they should hug someone , mr ward s 21stcentury expression , perhaps , of olmsted s commingling olmsted would likely disapprove , however , of the flimsy flower boxes at the base of mr ward s installation , since he famously preached against ornaments like flower beds and specimen plantings espousing minimal intervention , he believed the soothing , blended texture of a natural landscape was most redemptive to the human spirit sparing no effort , meanwhile , to achieve his unfussedwith look the british artist cornelia parker has also taken a minimalist turn with her sly conceptual pieces , both titled at the bottom of this lake her works also contain subtle ideas of redemption , though of cultural artifacts , not spirits at two separate water features in the emerald necklace system , leverett pond in olmsted park and the back bay fens lagoon near the museum of fine arts , ms parker has placed four bronze plaques just offshore the two at olmsted park read at the bottom of this lake lies a fragment of a star at 1 15 am on the 28th of june in the year 2000 , a chondrite meteorite fell into leverett pond
rahway he tells them his name is crazy chris these cocky teenagers who have been brought to east jersey state prison and stand sullenly on the auditorium stage and , he adds , he is serving double life for murder his sleeves are cut off raggedly at the shoulders , an effect that makes his muscular , tattooed arms look as big as weathered tree limbs and his craggy , bewhiskered face , battered and scarred by fists and time , is menacing , as he brings it to within inches of one of the shiny young faces end up here , he snarls , we 'll eat you alive this is a scene from scared straight ! 99 , a sequel to the 1979 documentary which received an oscar and an emmy and drew widespread attention to the program in what is known formally as the juvenile awareness program , inmates serving life sentences describe the realities of prison life to atrisk youths , using abusive language and intimidation from the beginning the goal is to break through the defenses of even the most incorrigible youths and get them thinking about changing their behavior before they , too , end up in the yard at a viewing of scared straight ! 99 at the prison last july , corrections commissioner jack terhune praised the program before an audience of judges , probation officers , social workers and the lifers themselves he said its impact ca n't ever be measured but by december the program had been scaled back , the rules for allowing youths to attend sessions stiffened and control transferred from the lifers' group at the prison to corrections headquarters in west trenton after almost 25 years without incident , scared straight , as the program had come to be known , seemed to be in trouble it s obvious to me that they 're trying to curtail it and make it fade away , said alan august , a retired corrections lieutenant who helped to found the scared straight program in 1976 with a group of inmates serving life terms in may , mr august publicly voiced his concerns about the program , and almost immediately social workers , counselors and other proponents bombarded the department with letters seeking a reprieve despite the cutback in the schedule , corrections officials denied scared straight was being deemphasized yet mary ellen bolton , the department s chief of staff , said several months ago in a letter to the lifers' civilian advisory board , research has shown that scare tactics , in and of themselves , are not effective in preventing antisocial behavior and in an interview last july even before he began to reevaluate scared straight , mr terhune seemed lukewarm about the program instead , he praised project pride \( promoting responsibility in drug education \) , which he started in early 1998 , not long after after becoming commissioner the new program sends inmates from minimumsecurity prisons into schools to talk about drug and alcohol problems that got them into trouble , mr terhune said and , he added , they made their point without intimidation they 've had 50 , 000 students go through there in 20 years , he said more recently about the scared straight program during an interview in his office project pride , which started in the fall of 1998 we 've already done 32 , 000 students in a little over a year and a half so if you look at it , particularly in terms of volume , we 're able to reach more students in a much shorter period of time for his part , mr august said he had no gripe with the new program , but added , i cannot understand why you do n't keep both programs you need more programs for kids , not less , he added i do n't see why he is promoting project pride , which is a good program , and slowly destroying scared straight elijah accoo was only 9 years old when he broke his teacher s leg his distraught mother , candy graham , did not know what to do no teacher or counselor seemed to help she finally turned to sheri bouldin , a probation officer who grew up in the project in long branch where ms graham lived with her son since 1994 , ms bouldin had taken hundreds of troubled youths through scared straight although elijah seemed a little young , ms bouldin agreed to try to get him in the day elijah went into east jersey state prison , he remembered it was crazy chris who sidled up to him you 're the one that broke the teacher s leg , he said that was my mother i was scared , elijah recalled recently as he sat with his mother in the kitchen of their long branch home but what viewers of the scared straight documentaries have never seen are the followup sessions at which the inmates talk civilly with the youngsters , one on one , with counselors by their side elijah , who will be 12 in august , went for followup once a month for nine months and became friendly with an inmate named akbar , whose given name before he turned to islam was kevin stout , of plainfield before the first visit , akbar talked by phone with ms graham and knew the boy had a serious discipline problem among the things he had done was urinate on a student s leg and push a heavy desk against a teacher s leg , causing a hairline fracture
equipped with an incredible mental toughness that enabled him to win the 1976 olympic 1 , 500 meters and dominate middledistance running for the better part of a decade , new zealand s john walker now battles the debilitating effects of parkinson s disease three times a day he takes dopamine to combat the disease , which is caused by progressive deterioration of the nerve cells of the part of the brain that controls muscle function when walker , 48 , was fully fit , he was loath to take an aspirin he is acutely aware , too , that there will come a time when the effect of the medication will diminish and his body will further regress but for the moment he remains optimistic it has been three years since the diagnosis , and while friends and admirers still shower him with pity , walker himself wants none of it i hope they find a cure for it , he said it s an awful disease , i can tell you i would give up my medals and all the world records for my health it s a disease that can hit anyone anytime , male of female they do n't know how or why i saw a doctor in belgium , and he thought it might have been a trauma i suffered at birth that s where they think it comes from or i was exposed to sprays and chemicals on the farm there is no real answer walker said he currently does not have the tremors that often characterize the disease , but it seems small consolation to him an extremely proud man , he would not want to be seen in such a state the worst aspect of parkinson s , he says , is having to do things slowly i get a bit frustrated , it gets on my nerves , more than anything else , putting my shoes on , tying my shoelaces , all that sort of stuff , walker said quietly it s all slow movement i guess that s when i am reminded there is something wrong sometimes i get very , very tired i could easily fall asleep walker has been active all his life , on and off the track he was the first runner to break a fourminute mile 100 times \( he did it 129 times in all \) he held the world record in the mile for four years in the late 1970 s , having taken it below 3 minutes 50 seconds for the first time when he was not in europe beating world records and the best milers on the planet , he and his wife , helen , ran a farm with horses and sheep calls to the house would often find him in the barn helping deliver a foal or shearing sheep his legendary training regimen was done on top of all the work around the house he still cuts the grass and goes out for the occasional game of golf , a show of defiance , perhaps the sheep are all gone now , sold after his running career came to an end 10 years ago the walkers still have three horses now , he focuses on an equestrian supply shop , stirrups , which the family opened four years ago close to their home in papatoetoe , near auckland depression is endemic among parkinson s sufferers , but the store is a source of income and gives walker a worthwhile reason to get up each morning i really believe the whole answer is to keep active , walker said it s to get out of bed every morning and get off and do things because if you sit around all day , you know , you just get depressed and as i have said before , there are many people in this world who are worse off than i will ever be maybe not for the future , but at the moment i feel fine fine enough to still deliver 20 to 30 speeches a year , in addition to the 50 or 60 hours a week he puts in at the shop and walker is also a parttime elected municipal official for manakau , a region near auckland i can go to four or five meetings a week , three hours at a time , so it is quite involved , he said of his commitment to manakau it s just another part of my life i have a pretty full day , seven days a week and i guess i will keep doing that until i ca n't do that any longer i do n't know when that day will be and i never think about it if you dwell too much , you get too down and too depressed six months ago , during a telephone conversation , walker admitted to having admiration for michael j fox , also afflicted with parkinson s , who quit his acting career to concentrate his efforts on finding a cure for the disease at the time , walker hoped to make contact with fox to offer his support , but he has so far been unable to do so with all the recent developments in parkinson s research , walker remains optimistic that a lot of people can eventually be cured or at least treated and he refuses to let his life revolve around the illness , even though his shop has become a focal point of sorts for people with parkinson s and other diseases who gravitate to him he is still a national hero in new zealand , and he acknowledges that people freely pour out their emotions because they feel an affinity toward him people still call up , and i really do n't want to see anybody , though i was a little more adventurous this year , he said , i did a television commercial to raise money for parkinson s we raised 200 , 000 in a small tv campaign the thing is , i do n't want to be the martyr for all the sick people around new zealand i did my bit and that is about as far as i want to go photo john walker , a 1976 olympic gold medalist for new zealand , at his equestrian supply shop he is also a municipal government official \( associated press for the new york times \)
five years after a clash between police and parishioners at a queens church , a federal jury heard closing statements yesterday in a case stemming from a lawsuit brought by church members alleging that police officers had injured them , violated their civil rights and falsely arrested them each side challenged the opposition s account of how a revival meeting at the universal calvary church in south jamaica , queens , turned violent six police officers and 28 parishioners sought treatment for injuries after the aug 20 , 1995 , clash ronald kuby , a lawyer for church members , argued in federal district court that the officers in order to justify indiscriminate violence , including the use of mace and police batons falsely claimed that parishioners had attacked them first as a result of the fight , which he said left some church members permanently disabled , his clients had lost something that all of us take for granted a sense of safety but charles horn , a lawyer for the 22 police officers named in the lawsuit , said the plaintiffs had lied on the witness stand about their role in the conflict and had exaggerated their injuries in trying to arrest one parishioner , the police came under siege as church members hurled bottles and threw punches , he said the trial has dredged up bitter memories of an episode that caused black leaders to denounce the police department for excessive use of force according to court records , the incident began when church ushers blocked a retired police officer from entering the revival meeting to see his estranged wife and children , resulting in a tussle in which he was injured three hours later , the retired officer , clifford warsop , returned with police officers to arrest one of the church members who he said had attacked him as the fighting spread , police reinforcements were called in and more than 100 officers in riot gear arrived at the church although the melee was captured on videotape , lawyers yesterday presented significantly different versions of who had instigated the fight and who its victims really were the revival meeting was to be a joyous occasion among lawbiding congregants , none of whom had a criminal record , mr kuby said the congregants even called the police after mr warsop menaced them while trying to gain entry , mr kuby said , but when the police showed up , mr warsop convinced the officers that he was the victim mr warsop was taken to a hospital later , when the police returned with mr warsop to make an arrest , the clash that followed spilled out into the street mr kuby said one church member sustained brain damage after being choked by a nightstick another was sprayed with mace and subjected to racist remarks mr horn painted the lawsuit , involving 200 church members , as an effort to get a disgusting amount of money from the city on the night in question , the parishioners acted like a bunch of hooligans , he said and , he added , had it not been for their illegal actions , nothing would have happened as the case went to the jury , which will begin deliberations on monday , the two sides studiously avoided one another while leaving the courtroom
among the epiphanies that internet executives had last year , as they pondered routes to profitability , was the notion that web sites need a healthy mix of the three c s content , commerce and community following that mandate was easy enough as long as venture capitalists were elbowing for a seat at the poker table but as the venture folks pulled their chips off the table , executives were forced to realize that dealing with even one of the c s was difficult and expensive enough let alone all three generating content , in particular , proved much harder than many internet companies had expected given the web public s insatiable appetite for new information , sites must constantly refresh their editorial content , either with their own stables of writers and multimedia producers or by striking deals with other sites that can provide that material but both approaches have given internet executives headaches sites that license content from media companies or other contentheavy businesses must go to great lengths to synchronize their technology , so the articles and multimedia clips can flow easily from one place to another such partnerships also require close monitoring the last thing executives of rollingstonecom , for instance , want to see is one of their stories running , heavily edited , on some portion of a partner s site that has nothing to do with music of course , producing one s own material can also have drawbacks like working with writers who do n't grasp the meaning of deadlines , or video producers who do n't grasp the meaning of budgets these problems have not been lost on socalled online content syndicators , a relatively new category of internet businesses that act as intermediaries between sites that need content and sites that want to sell it companies like isyndicate , screamingmedia , yellowbrix and newsedge are quickly building their client lists as web executives look for help in filling their sites with material that will keep users on the page meanwhile , media companies and others that supply content have found that syndicators have given them a muchneeded , and unexpected , revenue source demand for these services is definitely growing , said dan o'brien , senior analyst with forrester research , an internet consulting firm and the law of supply and demand indicates that as the web grows and as the need for content grows faster than the supply this will pay off much more than it does now indeed , jupiter communications , another research firm , forecasts that online content syndication and licensing will amount to a 15 billion market in 2004 , up from 343 million this year analysts say the leading content syndicators are isyndicate and screamingmedia screamingmedia , which went public in the summer , sells the content of more than 2 , 800 online publishers to roughly 1 , 100 web sites , while isyndicate offers the content of about 1 , 200 publishers to some 270 , 000 sites in the case of isyndicate , which rolled out in 1997 , the company takes video , audio , photos and text from publishers and offers the material to customers in categories like health or sports for fees ranging from 50 , 000 to 500 , 000 per year , isyndicate can also publish the content on its own servers , track the performance of the content and advise companies on how to improve that performance screamingmedia , meanwhile , filters content to suit each particular site s needs if a health site wants news about leukemia or allergies , for example , screamingmedia s technology will filter all stories related to those subjects and send the most relevant ones to the site in addition to a onetime setup fee of between 3 , 000 and 40 , 000 , subscribers pay between 500 and 50 , 000 per month , which buys thousands of articles or multimedia clips notably , in both cases , the syndicators screen the sites that buy the content , to make sure it is used in ways that conform to the original publisher s standards meanwhile , syndicators also send the content to their customers in a format that suits their particular computer systems executives say the benefits of this formatting were difficult to quantify , but crucial andrew fritz , president of fringe golfcom , a content site that also sells its own brand of merchandise , said that when the site rolled out in 1998 , it wanted to run golfrelated stories and scores from the associated press wires but with the ap , there was a pretty long process to integrate systems with them you either had to set up a satellite dish or wire your building for it , he said and it cost about 1 , 000 or 1 , 500 a month , which was a lot for us then the company also lacked the resources to generate that content on its own but isyndicate let us buy just ap s golf sports news , whereas with ap we 'd have to buy the whole sports category , mr fritz said so it s actually less expensive something like 500 a month for us to just get ap s golf information from isyndicate , and we do n't need to spend any energy integrating it into our site mr fritz said fringegolfcom was now negotiating with isyndicate to have its original content sold to isyndicate s affiliates being able to play both sides is a real advantage for us , he said according to mr o'brien of forrester , web executives looking to sell their content through syndicators should not get too excited about becoming rich in the process if a company makes a lot of money through this , it s the exception rather than the rule , he said because the syndicators typically keep 70 percent of each sale , mr o'brien said , it would n't be worth doing the deal if money was the sole focus instead , he said , media companies and web site publishers that provide content are more intent on using syndicators to get their information and their brand names on thousands of other sites , while letting marketing executives concentrate on other matters and it s also a matter of competitive displacement , mr o'brien said if abc s video clip appears on a given site , for instance , nbc , cbs and fox lose that opportunity for exposure none of this means , of course , that media companies are interested in spreading all of their content to the outer reaches of the web we have to make sure we 're not giving away too much , said dan chiss , director of marketing and business development for rolling stonecom , a unit of wenner media that licenses its content and that of rolling stone magazine to both isyndicate and screamingmedia we want to keep our best content close to the vest for instance , he said , online syndicators can never sell rolling stone s cover story , because that s our most precious asset , and we want to keep people coming back to our site but the company does sell enough articles and photos through syndicators to earn monthly revenues in the five figures , mr chiss said and it comes at really no cost to us those sales should continue to grow , as the web s global reach grows , mr chiss said rolling stone is a pretty ubiquitous brand , and music is something that really has no language barriers , he said so we 're definitely looking forward to seeing where this goes photo the abc news anchor peter jennings in a tape that was provided to screamingmedia , which may then sell it to web sites \( abc \)
washington , march 21 from simmering tanks of highlevel nuclear waste in washington state and plutonium laced with chemical poisons in idaho to production of radioactive gases in south carolina , the federal government s nuclear weapons program has festering technical and environmental problems like no one else in the country with no easy way to solve them , the energy department has gone to one of the few entities in the world with experience as broad as its own british nuclear fuels , part of the nuclear power and weapons agency of the british government , now spun off as a governmentowned company but as the british company now known as bnfl prepares to tackle the american problems , an embarrassing lapse has emerged back home in its core business , which is producing plutonium fuel british government inspectors reported in february that for months , employees who were supposed to be performing a final measurement of fuel pellets bound for japanese reactors were instead copying numbers from previous shipments bnfl executives said workers felt the work was boring and a crew on the night shift had apparently found it easier to falsify the numbers concern over the company s business practices is now affecting its contracts with the united states government energy secretary bill richardson , in a telephone interview from algeria , where he is meeting opec ministers , said he had ordered his department to send a team to england to meet with british investigators we are now placing bnfl under extra scrutiny because of these problems , he said i have been uneasy about some of their operations in the us if we uncover anything , i will take swift and strong action he added , business as usual is over with bnfl and with all our contractors , but especially with bnfl the situation , mr richardson said , was itching for stronger management review the company said the incident with the pellets was an isolated problem we feel very badly about the pellets , said david r bonser , a director of the governmentowned company , and head of waste management and decommissioning he said it was a problem caused by a handful of people in one of the plants who did things they absolutely should not have done britain s nuclear installations inspection agency , however , rejected that defense although various individuals were at fault , a systematic failure allowed it to happen , a report , published in february , said in a plant with the proper safety culture , the events described in this report could not have happened john j taylor , the company s chief executive , has resigned , but the company s problems continue sellafield , the plant on the west coast of england where the fuel was made , was never popular with neighbors for years it has dumped radioactive waste into the irish sea english antinuclear advocates and the irish government would like it shut and the british government reported that pigeons in the area had become radioactive from the plant s emissions but now the problem is not just with neighbors , but with customers japan asked the british company to take back the fuel , although the company insists that two automatic systems measured the pellets and found their diameter to be within specifications a german utility , preussenelektra ag , shut a reactor running on the fuel that was not properly measured , and asked for compensation germany also suspended imports of additional fuel well before its fuel problem at sellafield , however , it was clear to leaders of the british company that the future profitability of that business was uncertain as a result , they moved decisively into the united states with an american partner , the morrison knudson corporation , the company acquired many assets of the old westinghouse corporation , which had been a major energy department contractor it also bid directly on energy department work at oak ridge , tenn , and hanford , wash and it has hired several former energy department officials , including one who approved giving a contract to bnfl without making the company take part in a fully competitive bidding process the hanford contract , which involves solidifying liquid nuclear wastes in glass , is expected to take decades and cost tens of billions of dollars at hanford , bnfl hired the energy department s former site manager , one of four highranking energy department officials now on its payroll meanwhile , a coalition of american groups that has been pressing the energy department for years to clean up its nationwide archipelago of weapons operations plans to file a petition with the department on thursday urging that bnfl be barred from government contracts , for lack of integrity and competence we think clearly a case can be made , and that the case is selfevident , that this is a company that does not possess those qualities , said thomas carpenter , a lawyer with the government accountability project , in seattle the problem is serious for the energy department , critics say , because its track record on overseeing its contractors is particularly poor no evidence of wrongdoing has been found in bnfl s american operations but at rocky flats , near denver , where a bnfl subsidiary works in plutonium cleanup , a prior contractor committed five felony violations of environmental laws with no apparent notice

camp shamrock , lebanon , a signpost mounted by irish troops at the heart of this united nations military encampment just outside the israeli occupation zone in southern lebanon brings home one of the ineluctable facts that makes peace in this region so elusive dublin 3 , 930 kilometers , one of the handlettered arrowheads reads , about 2 , 435 miles opposing it , pointing due south , is another arrowhead tel aviv 135 kilometers , about 84 miles , it says the sign is a measure of the compact scale on which conflicts between israel and its neighbors have played out from united nations outposts near here , the ramin kibbutz in northern israel is visible on a thickly wooded hillside less than 10 miles east with powerful field glasses , a visitor can see people in shorts moving about on the kibbutz the pilots of the israeli f16 fighterbombers that fly high overhead , dropping smart bombs with deadly accuracy , are only minutes away from bases in israel it takes only a small leap of the imagination to believe that if relations between lebanon and israel were normalized , the wealthier among the shiite muslim population that predominates here could drive to tel aviv in midmorning to shop or have lunch , and be back for tea israel s largest city would then be only a little bit farther from this biblical landscape of rocky hillsides above groves of olive , orange and lemon trees than beirut , lebanon s capital , an hour s drive to the north for the moment , this remains a dream , albeit one that seems closer to realization prime minister ehud barak of israel promised during the election campaign that brought him to power last year that he would withdraw the israeli troops that have held an occupation zone in southern lebanon since 1985 the fulfillment of the promise would be a first , essential toward ending the enmity that israel s occupation , and the guerrilla war it ignited , has sown between israel and lebanon , a country that is by tradition perhaps the most cosmopolitan of all israel s arab neighbors on march 5 , israel s cabinet unanimously endorsed a commitment to a july withdrawal what a full and lasting peace might mean is already apparent in the routines of one man timur goksel , 56 , a turkish citizen , has been a united nations political adviser in lebanon since 1978 , when israel s initial invasion prompted deployment of a united nations force that now has 4 , 500 men mr goksel recently met with a highranking israeli military official in tel aviv in the morning , then drove to tyre on lebanon s coast for a lunchtime meeting with a local commander of hezbollah , the lebanese guerrilla force confronting the israelis he drove home to haifa , the israeli coastal city where he makes his home , in time to collect his children from school nothing to it , mr goksel said on a stopover in tyre one morning recently , before returning to israel visions of what peace might bring have begun to entrance people here since mr barak made his pledge last year to withdraw israel s troops ahead of the deadline , united nations officials say , israel s 1 , 000member force has become more wary in the occupation zone , and israeli newspapers have quoted young conscripts as saying they pray not to be the last israeli soldier to die in lebanon for the moment , though , the hills and gullies around tibnin , the lebanese village where camp shamrock is situated , echo almost every day to the boom and rattle of rocket , artillery and machinegun fire that is the currency of exchange between israeli forces and their allies in a christianled militia force , the south lebanon army , and their antagonists in hezbollah , or party of god , the lebanese force that draws its inspiration from the militantly islamic ideals of the proiranian shiite clerics who lead it over more than two decades of warfare , the fighting here has become such a fixture in the consciousness that people on both sides have built entire lives around it in northern israel , the populations of whole towns and kibbutzim disappear into bunkers within minutes of sirens signifying the risk of hezbollah firing a volley of the russianmade katyusha rockets that have been the most terrifying , because they are the least accurate , of the weapons in the guerrillas' armory in lebanon , where shelters are rare , people hunker down behind stone walls along the roads , or hasten into basements , when israeli forces open up with 155millimeter artillery or launch f16 fighter jets other local residents long since migrated north , to beirut or other lebanese cities or abroad , to africa , europe or the united states some made fortunes and returned to build huge , pretentious , pillaredandtowered mansions that are the most prominent feature along roads that wind through the hills one of the few things about the war that local residents find even vaguely amusing is when israeli aircraft flatten one of these monstrous houses , suspecting it of being a hezbollah stronghold , as they did in january how the israeli withdrawal will occur will depend on complex maneuvering between israel , syria and lebanon at the moment , with no formal negotiations , all manner of speculation is running will syria and israel resume their suspended talks , settle differences over the golan heights , and make a deal in which syria , through its overlordship in lebanon , guarantees that israeli forces can withdraw in peace \? or will it be a withdrawal under fire , raising the risk of harsh israeli retaliation , possibly more bombing raids of the kind that destroyed three lebanese power plants on feb 8 \?

long islanders are deeply committed to a catastrophic view of life as the millennium demonstrated , we love preparing for disasters that will never happen now we have a thousand years to wait for the next round of millennial hysteria , we need something else to worry about and here it is , right on cue , winter i was innocently shopping for motor oil in the aid auto center in rocky point when a deep voice came from above my head , like a prophet of doom be prepared for winter , it boomed , and went on to propose a long list of things i absolutely must have in order to survive the next few weeks a snow brush , an ice scraper with a builtin mitten , windshield melt , lock deicer , an emergency shovel , a battery charger , booster cables , gasline antifreeze by a lucky chance , the store was stocked with heaps of these things my own winter preparations seem pathetic by comparison the sum total of my survival equipment is a battered plastic ice scraper that has been under the driver s seat of my car for the past 10 years home depot had the same discouraging message for customers beware the ides of january , the demon winter is poised , ready to destroy us to help us ward off the coming catastrophe , the warehouse was piled with mountains of salt , labeled ice melt and priced accordingly , dozens of seals and weatherstrips to keep any hint of cool air out of the house , propane and kerosene heaters , humidifiers , snow shovels in all their charming variety , and fabulous gaspowered snow blowers costing up to 1 , 000 each the psychological impact of all this coldweather hysteria was so great that , as i left home depot , i was braced for a kind of frigid apocalypse but the weather was sunny and mild , and my small bag of salt was an embarrassment the signs of the coming winter siege are everywhere pharmacies have pushed out sun block and insect repellant to fill their shelves with cold and cough remedies if you venture into a clothing store , which i would not recommend , you have to force your way through a jungle of bulging parkas , heavy coats , massive snow boots , scarves , mittens and wool hats this winter is obviously going to be very bad indeed some of our neighbors seem to have been snatched by aliens their houses are empty and dark , their cars and pets have vanished in fact , they have all gone to florida we are stuck here , like the winter crew of a base camp in antarctica , watching the contrails of planes heading out from macarthur airport toward the earthly paradises of tampa and miami beach we get brightly colored postcards saying , the temperature today was 76 , and we keep the pool at 87 had any snow up there yet \? but winter on long island can be pure pleasure , if only we approach it in the right spirit for example , it s the best possible excuse not to exercise the mornings are too chilly , the evenings are too dark and the middle of the day must be dedicated to lunch if we are in a bad mood , we can always claim to suffer from seasonal affective disorder , a recognized disease caused by the dearth of daylight a grumpy person is just annoying , but a victim of sad is an object of care and sympathy make the most of it winter means cocooning with extra blankets and duvets , fires and candles , mulled wine and rich casseroles we do n't count the grams of saturated fat , because we need all the fat we can get gardening is suspended , along with barbecues , mowing , and all those tedious outdoor chores that make summer so tiresome if all this seems flabby and selfindulgent , winter can also be treated as an opportunity to demonstrate our more heroic qualities the first settlers on long island in the 1600 s had no central heating , snow blowers or even a single set of booster cables between them they just toughed it out , and we can do the same regular riders on the long island rail road , for example , and commuters on the long island expressway can look forward to some seasonal vicissitudes that would have sent the pioneers straight back to europe such experiences bring people together priceless moments of camaraderie shared between commuters standing in a freezing train station , or scraping ice off their windshields up and down the street at times like these , the puritans would be proud of us the sunbirds who sneak off to florida have none of these satisfactions right now , their lives are a meaningless string of sunny , idle days , dedicated only to comfort the moment the temperature in the sunshine state touches 80 , they 'll be heading north toward the temperate zone the purpose of this extravagant migration is never , on any account , to allow the outside air temperature to get high enough or low enough to make an impression on their nerve endings down in florida , they love to imagine how terribly we suffer during the long island winter what they do n't know , or have forgotten , is that we can enjoy all the charms of the season without having to suffer a serious winter at all our average january temperature on long island is just above the freezing point in fairbanks , alaska , it s 40 degrees below that the citizens of alaska , or maine or siberia have something to complain about when january hits them but , on temperate long island , we have winter lite oh , you should have been here in february , it was terrible , we can say to our neighbours when they come back in may , tanned and fit , from their cowardly retreats in florida february will be cold , of course but nothing warms the heart like a little moral superiority , especially when it is totally undeserved cartoon \( pc vey \)
washington , june 20 the trial judge in the microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly delayed today the sweeping restrictions he had imposed on the company s conduct until a higher court affirms them the restrictions on microsoft s business practices , ranging from the features of its software to its relations with customers and rivals , were to take effect in just 11 weeks they were part of an order signed two weeks ago by judge thomas penfield jackson that also called for a breakup of the company the judge had already stayed the breakup until appeals were complete now none of the steps he ordered in his remedy ruling may go into effect for a year or longer , even if they are upheld microsoft was jubilant for weeks the company had been arguing that the conduct restrictions would cause grievous harm to the company and its customers judge jackson s stay order was issued as he sent the case to the supreme court for direct review , an idea the justice department had advocated and microsoft had vigorously opposed under a provision of antitrust law , cases with significant impact can be appealed directly to the supreme court with judge jackson s action today , it is now up to the supreme court to decide whether to take the case directly , or to let an appeal be heard first by the court of appeals the justice department lauded judge jackson for referring the case to the high court but added , given the district court s decision to stay the remedy during the appeal process , the direct appeal to the supreme court is of particular importance to the national interest in a brief filed with judge jackson earlier today , the department had argued that in an industry microsoft vigorously characterizes as fast paced and quickly changing , delay would undermine the ultimate value of the remedy to correct the harmful results of microsoft s anticompetitive actions and to restore competition judge jackson did not explain his decision to stay the conduct restrictions , but he appears uncomfortable with imposing a sweeping remedy before his work on the case has been reviewed by a higher court in an interview earlier this year , the judge said i have been in splendid isolation on this case long enough i would welcome another mind studying my work product to see if i am correct or wrongheaded i want to move this case upstairs as quickly as possible until the judge s order today , the supreme court would have been called on to rule quickly on microsoft s request to stay the remedy order or to decide that the entire case should be sent to the appeals court now the supreme court , or the appeals court , can review the entire appeal , and rule on it , before deciding whether to impose judge jackson s remedy , to modify it or to cancel it the process could take a year or longer if the case is sent back to the appeals court and then appealed to the supreme court under judge jackson s order , microsoft would be broken into separate companies , one for its windows operating system and one for its other software and internet businesses the company would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on its conduct lasting three years if the breakup order withstands appeal , and 10 years if it does not the provisions included uniform royalty terms for windows products , a ban on exclusive deals or on making the company s sales to hardware or software makers contingent on use of other microsoft products , and an order not to retaliate against any person or entity that provided evidence against it those conduct restrictions were to take effect 90 days after his order was issued , or sept 5 and though the breakup itself was stayed until appeals were complete , microsoft was required to prepare a detailed plan for the breakup by oct 5 that order is now stayed as well at least in the short term , microsoft can now carry out new business like moving its next generation of software products increasingly from the personal computer to the internet unimpeded by the restrictions proposed by the government and approved by judge jackson this evening , vivek varma , a microsoft spokesman , said obviously we are very pleased with the judge s decision to stay the remedy order this lets us go forward with our appeal without any disruption to our business and our customers the law under which direct appeals are authorized , the expediting act , has been used in only one previous case , the att case , since it was revised in 1974 and so there are few precedents for judging how the supreme court might decide whether to take the case but since the court s session ends shortly , a decision is not likely before the new term opens in october microsoft argues that the case is inappropriate for immediate supreme court review but richard e donovan , who is head of the antitrust and trade practice at the new york law firm of kelley drye warren , noted that when congress revised the law in 1974 , the intent was to invoke it when the issues in question were the immediate economic impact of the case rather than on the significance of the legal issues presented microsoft has repeatedly argued that judge jackson s remedy could have a significant adverse impact on the nation s economy mr donovan also noted that the federal government , through the attorney general and the solicitor general , supports a direct appeal , and the supreme court tends to accord substantial weight to their opinions in such matters in its brief filed earlier today , the government told judge jackson that microsoft s effort to avert a direct appeal misstates and misapplies the appropriate legal standard for certification and ignores the incontrovertible importance of prompt resolution of this case to consumers and the national economy apparently judge jackson agreed microsoft tried to outmaneuver judge jackson and the justice department by filing a part of its appeal with the court of appeals last week , before the government had a chance to file its directappeal request the appeals court eagerly accepted the case , and even laid out an aggressive schedule for hearing it , but also made clear that the schedule would be suspended as soon as judge jackson sent the case to the supreme court when he did so today , the appeals court stood down
the state department has asked the agency for international development to withdraw its registration from one of the largest muslim charities in the united states , saying it has ties to the terrorist group hamas , government officials say christopher madison , a spokesman for the agency , said it had not officially heard from the department , but when it did , the agency s officials will take appropriate action but the agency has started to review how it registers charities and relief groups that work overseas , a procedure that allows the groups to get united states government grants and contracts the agency has also stopped listing registered groups on its web site until the review is completed , the agency said today officials said that the state department s request was part of an effort to clamp down on charities and relief organizations suspected of being used to support islamic terrorist organizations acting against american citizens the effort was prompted by recent terrorist attacks and plots against americans and american property officials said the aid agency had asked the state department to produce evidence supporting its concerns about the muslim charity , holy land foundation for relief and development , an islamic relief group based in richardson , tex government officials say one reason they suspect the group is tied to hamas is that it provides support to families of suicide bombers israel , contending that the foundation was a front for hamas , closed it and four other charities in may 1997 earlier this year , the family of an american killed in a terrorist attack in israel filed a civil suit against holy land , seeking monetary damages in what the suit contends is its support of hamasinspired terrorism a spokeswoman for the foundation , dalal mohammed , said she was surprised to learn of the state department s request we 're in close cooperation with aid , ms mohammed said the charity , which says it raises about 6 million a year for the poor , mostly in the palestinian authority , has repeatedly denied an affiliation with hamas or any terrorist group it says it is the object of an israeli vendetta , to deny charity to poor and needy palestinians in gaza and the west bank while holy land has not applied for federal grants , withdrawing its registration would prevent it from asserting , as it has in recent publications , that it has been accepted and certified by the aid agency the request for the revocation came last week from the state department s counterterrorism office , which told the agency that the charity s work was contrary to the national defense and foreign policy interests of the united states and because it provided indirect support to hamas , officials said a state department official said an interagency committee was drafting new guidelines for vetting relief groups more meticulously to ensure that bad groups do not get recognition or money from the us government as a result of its review , the agency might decide to stop registering private charities altogether , one official from the agency said the registration procedures now are quite loose , the official said none of the agency s eight requirements for registration specifically prohibits groups from supporting terrorism or engaging in activities that could damage american foreign policy interests the foundation seems to have taken advantage of some very sloppy registration procedures , the official said that s why the requirements at the very least must be changed the agency approved the holy land foundation s request for registration on june 29 , despite the fact that the charity was included in a list of 30 islamic relief groups that are the focus of government concern the state department request is yet another political embarrassment for the independent agency , which reports directly to the secretary of state and which prominent senators and members of congress tried to abolish several years ago last december , the agency , also at the state department s request , revoked two grants worth 42 million to the islamic african relief agency , a charity based in columbia , mo government officials asserted that the charity had ties to sudan , which the state department has identified as a sponsor of terrorism ahmed mubarak , the organization s president , said at the time that the charity had nothing to do with sudan and denied that it supported terrorism since then , the charity has challenged its suspension as unlawful the aid agency s handling of its registration procedures shows how difficult it is for the government to restrict groups it suspects of having terrorist ties without jeopardizing their civil liberties government officials said their investigations could reveal evidence of terrorist ties that fell short of a smoking gun that could be used to prosecute such charities on charges of violating a 1996 law banning fundraising by and contributions to groups that sponsor or support international terrorism according to government documents and interviews with officials , the government has been investigating the holy land foundation since 1996 but no charges have been filed against the charity obviously , we ca n't deny a group registration or funding to a group simply because it is being investigated , said a state department official but in this case , we concluded that holy land s support for the widows and orphans of suicide bombers was inimical to the americanled peace process in the middle east , and hence , to american national security and foreign policy objectives , the official said at the same time , a state department official said the administration did not want to jeopardize the work of more than 6 , 000 legitimate islamic groups operating worldwide , which provide emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places , often with the support of friendly states nor , he added , does it want to be publicly criticized as being antimuslim
dax , france , july 9 nine days and hundreds of kilometers after it started , the tour de france really begins monday , and storm signals are flying that is not metaphor the weather forecast when the bicycle race enters the pyrenees is for rain , snow , fog , winds up to 37 miles an hour and temperatures as low as 43 degrees in similar conditions in 1996 , the jewel alpine stage was shortened in fear that the racers would be endangered if they tried to traverse the galibier peak in howling winds after a freak snowfall few daily stages have been curtailed or canceled because of bad weather since the tour began in 1903 even before the grim prediction from the french weather service , which is often inaccurate , the 10th stage in the threeweek tour shaped up as a storm on paper , the tour opens july 10 , lance armstrong , the defending champion , said before the actual start , july 1 after the long period of wandering around the flatlands and small hills of western france , the race will begin to move steeply up and the outlines of its final shape will emerge except for the two time trials , most of the favorites have ridden anonymously in the pack until now jan ullrich , marco pantani , abraham olano , alex zulle , laurent jalabert , fernando escartin , laurent dufaux , richard virenque , bobby julich and armstrong none of the contenders' names figured today in the results of the ninth stage instead the major names were paolo bettini , geert verheyen , jose angel vidal and didier rous , a breakaway group that barely held off the main pack of chasers to finish in that order after a 112mile rolling stage in gloomily overcast and breezy weather that may look like paradise monday bettini , an italian with mapei , was timed in 4 hours 29 minutes 6 seconds , a speed of about 25 mph the stage to dax began in agen , an occasional tour stop and the prune capital of the world alberto elli , an italian with telekom , continued in the overall leader s yellow jersey ahead of fabrice gougot , a frenchman with credit agricole , and marc wauters , a belgian with rabobank most of those names should be missing from the news monday weather permitting , the big boys should be back that first day in the mountains can set the tone for the rest of the tour , bobby julich , the american leader of the credit agricole team , said this morning it s time to sink or swim where do the winners of the last three tours stand before the first of five days of steep climbing , spread over the next eight days , in the pyrenees , the midi and the alps \? armstrong , the texan who leads the united states postal service team and trails the leader by nearly six minutes , appears to be in splendid position i'm feeling good , though how good i 'll know monday night , he said saturday the team has n't had to work hard the first week and we 're ready he seemed relaxed and confident , yet on edge , like a man eager for battle glancing at the french sports newspaper l'equipe , armstrong read aloud an item in which german reporters had been polled about the eventual winner eighteen voted for ullrich , the german leader of telekom and the champion in 1997 , 10 for armstrong and 1 for zulle , the swiss leader of banesto , who was second last year ten s enough , armstrong said with a smile although he will not put it into words , he regards ullrich as his main rival and proceeded to discuss the german s weight , an annual problem armstrong said he thought that ullrich still weighed about 2 kilograms , or 44 pounds , too much if i were 2 kilos over , i would n't be a factor , he said two kilos over the course of a day of climbing , that s plenty one kilo is too much he may be wrong about ullrich s condition , however to others , the german , who is six and a half minutes behind , looks fit the spare tire around his middle that was evident in races last month has melted in the tour his head is good , said telekom s directeur sportif , walter godefroot that s where his problems start , in his morale and now his morale is strong the winner of the 1998 tour , marco pantani , the italian leader of the mercatone uno team , has also been troubled since he was ousted from the giro d'italia last year for failing a blood test that indicated the use of illegal drugs but he too has seemed restored in this tour the best climber of the three champions , pantani will get his chance to start reducing an 11minute deficit monday , weather permitting map of france highlighting the tour s route
optimists expected george w bush to take three objectives into account in choosing his secretary of the treasury first , most people expected him to choose someone with extensive experience of financial markets there is every reason to believe that the series of financial upheavals that convulsed the world in the 1990 s will continue robert rubin and lawrence summers did a yeoman job of containing those crises until a few days ago most people expected mr bush to choose someone who looked like a republican bob rubin , someone like painewebber s donald marron second , some thought that mr bush might choose a treasury secretary who could be a symbol of bipartisanship one name floated was william mcdonough , the president of the federal reserve bank of new york finally , given the troubling impression during the florida fight that mr bush was abdicating responsibility to dick cheney , and more broadly to his father s men , most people thought that treasury would offer a good opportunity to show that the new administration would not be filled with mr cheney s cronies paul o'neill , the former office of management and budget official who became alcoa s chairman , was n't exactly what the optimists had in mind indeed , mr bush himself seemed oddly uneasy during the press conference at which he announced the selection i'm not big on interpreting facial expressions but anyone who watched mr bush as mr o'neill spoke can tell you that he was , well , shiftyeyed his gaze darting frantically from side to side unless this is a characteristic nervous tic that mr bush successfully concealed throughout the campaign , it was an indication that something was wrong what s wrong with mr o'neill \? he built his business reputation by reversing efforts to transform alcoa into something more than an aluminum company , instead refocusing on the core business and engaging in ruthless costcutting this is all very well but overseeing world financial markets is nothing at all like running a large , very oldeconomy , commandandcontrol corporation \( or , for that matter , working the details of the federal budget \) mr rubin excelled at the deft strategic intervention persuading investors , when the situation was on a knife edge , not to pull their money out and turn a temporary loss of confidence into a selffulfilling prophecy of collapse perhaps mr o'neill will reveal a comparable talent , but nothing in his career to date suggests that this is his sort of thing and by the way his long friendship with alan greenspan does not constitute a qualification for all his qualities , mr greenspan is not god the treasury department does n't need a greenspan acolyte to second the great man s views it needs a secretary who , like mr rubin , has enough independent knowledge and gravitas to supplement mr greenspan s judgment , and if necessary challenge it despite mr o'neill s long association with conservative causes , his appointment does not please the hard right but given mr bush s decision to cave in to the hard right on the crucial matter of the justice department , simply appointing a treasury secretary who is n't rabid is n't much of a bipartisan gesture and last but not negligibly , mr o'neill is surprise ! an old colleague of mr cheney s and one suspects they are kindred spirits like mr cheney before his own reentry into politics , mr o'neill belongs to the class of businessmen the japanese call amakudari , descended from heaven former government officials who later in life enter the business world at the top , not the bottom none of this says that mr o'neill will necessarily fail but it does raise questions about what is going on in the bush transition why did the candidate who was supposed to represent the aspirations of the investor class reject all the candidates proposed from the investment community \? here s a guess despite all the talk of being forward looking , mr bush s people are fundamentally uncomfortable with the modern world as my colleague tom friedman has pointed out , they seem to hanker for the lost certainties of coldwar diplomacy perhaps they also hanker for the lost certainties of the old economy , where big companies were comfortably settled in stable oligopolies , and did n't have to worry about the shifting tides of financial markets in short , they want to pretend the world is still the way it was when some other guy was president ca n't remember his name , began with a b
greenville , sc , sept 18 patrick j buchanan roared back from his sickbed tonight to resume his fight for the country s soul , using the richly symbolic podium of bob jones university to declare his highdecibel presence as the reform party presidential candidate in the remaining weeks of the campaign he looked slightly drawn from his recent gallbladder surgery but seemed to have lost none of his ardor in condemning the dechristianization of america , the acceptance of homosexuality and the oneworld visions of the united nations , which he promised to expel from the country if elected from the world trade organization to the decline of christopher columbus , he made clear that the reform party platform would be his wellknown agenda i fear that here at home they are abolishing america , he said , referring to what he called a loose coalition of supreme court justices , northeastern universities and entertainment executives they are deconstructing our country and this is one of the great issues of our time , which really should be addressed in a presidential campaign he won repeated applause from an audience of about 1 , 500 residents and students at the fundamentalist christian college , and from bob jones iii , the university s president , who praised him as a brave soldier trying to keep the nation from slipping over the precipice gov george w bush of texas had been criticized for appearing here in february while saying nothing about the institution s onetime policy of forbidding interracial dating , since changed , and its disagreement with the roman catholic church the press had it all wrong when they vilified george bush for coming here as he did , mr jones said , stressing the similarities of mr buchanan and the school as mavericks who revel in defying the mainstream the speech was mr buchanan s first since his midaugust operation , and his recuperation could not come at a worse time for mr bush , whose republican party mr buchanan ridiculed as having lost the will to fight in tonight s speech now that it is clear that mr buchanan will use the reform party platform for his own sharpelbowed positions , he has the opportunity to begin drawing off a few likeminded conservative voters , particularly in southern states like south carolina , at a moment when mr bush is eager to regain his edge in national polls from vice president al gore mr buchanan listed several ways in which he said the elites were dismantling america , and chief among them was the effort to remove christianity as the moral foundation of the country woodrow wilson said america was born a christian nation , he said , but if you say that today , you are guilty of intolerance to others and you will be shouted down in the american capital now who dechristianized america \? in my judgment the principal culprit is the united states supreme court he also listed the growing acceptance of homosexuality as a key element in the country s decline , citing particularly the legalization of gay civil unions in vermont if elected , mr buchanan promised , he would bring home american troops from europe and the middle east and station them at the mexican border to protect the country from rampant illegal immigration he said he would close the national endowment for the arts and the department of education , and called for a new legion of decency to monitor the entertainment industry and assist in boycotting its pollution he even reprised his famous line from the 1992 republican national convention that there remains a religious war for the country s soul , adding a postscript that eight years of president bill clinton convinced him he understated his case he said he left the republican party because he was tired of the polltested pabulum of the country s twoparty politics we may not succeed , but i believe we need a new fighting conservative traditionalist party in america , he said i believe , and i hope , that one day we can take america back that is why we are building this gideon s army , and heading for armageddon , to do battle for the lord mr buchanan s beliefs may not get him anywhere close to the 15 percent in national polls he needs to participate in televised debates , but his biblical references and political orthodoxy were immensely popular in the auditorium here hundreds of solemnly dressed students crowded around him after the speech seeking autographs , and several students eagerly said they would vote for him whether he has a chance or not mr jones said the address was the work of a lonely man , bravely annunciating the truth the country will probably not survive another democratic victory this year , he said , and only a man like mr buchanan , who says what he believes and does not care whether he wins , can speak the truth that will save it photo patrick j buchanan , left , at bob jones university yesterday , with bob jones iii , mr buchanan s wife , shelley , and mrs bob jones , right \( associated press \)
teresa weatherspoon stutterstepped around two defenders and raced up the court , leaving the ferocious debbie black fuming behind in the trail of smoke weatherspoon easily found her teammate tari phillips slicing to the basket and when phillips s layup dropped , giving her liberty a safe 8point lead over the visiting miami sol , weatherspoon stretched her arms to the madison square garden crowd and circled like an airplane coming in for a landing vintage weatherspoon , a women s national basketball association allstar for the second straight season on the night she was named the eastern conference s starting point guard for the july 17 allstar game , she gave her teammates the lift they needed when their energy level had plummeted , the fatigue of playing six games in nine nights gripping their legs her sixth assist of the night punctuated the liberty s 11point run with five minutes left in the game and propelled new york to a 6351 triumph , its third straight victory the streak put the liberty \( 98 \) one game over 500 for the first time this season everybody fought through being tired tonight , weatherspoon said we knew it was important to get going in the second half of the season and turn everything around weatherspoon scored just 4 points , but she held miami s leading scorer , sheri sam , to 7 points and threw off the pesky black , who , at 5 feet 3 inches throws daggers with her eyes and body while none of the sol scored in double figures , the liberty drew from the offense of tamika whitmore , who matched her career high with 17 points in her third start this season , and vickie johnson , who scored 7 of her 14 points down the stretch but during the last seven minutes of the game , weatherspoon was more than steady she was exciting it s such a simple little play , her teammate sue wicks said about the bounce pass to phillips on the fast break but it really got the crowd going and us going as well we could get a little surge of energy after last night s game , weatherspoon sat in front of her locker , her shoulder wrapped in a pack of ice her aching shoulder was the product of fighting through screens and denying black any satisfaction i needed to find that juice again , weatherspoon said my teammates depend on me for that energy , to trash talk , to do what they expect of me the twotime defensive player of the year did that tspoon played tremendous defense tonight , coach richie adubato said she kept on coming in the last four games , her intensity level has been back up to what it has been in the past while weatherspoon was named an eastern conference starter in the wnba allstar game , the fans also voted in wicks , the team s seventhleading scorer wicks had 4 rebounds and 6 points , but pulled down one of the most important rebounds of the game with 3 minutes 33 seconds to play she immediately dished out to johnson , waiting beyond the arc , and johnson sunk a 3pointer as well as miami , extending the liberty s lead to 12 points the first half was not as comfortable for new york , which took a 3127 lead into the locker room what the liberty did , storming back on to the court to start the second half , however , defined the game as well as one player on the liberty s first possession in the second half , whitmore spun right , then left and calmly deposited a soft hook into the basket as if she were mailing an envelope a minute later , she barreled into the lane on a fast break and finished with a clean , confident bank shot that was the first of 6 unanswered points , as new york extended its lead to 11 points , its largest of the night but the sol came back , and former liberty guard kisha ford hit two foul shots to cut the deficit to 2 points with 8 27 left to play the new york players , who arrived in manhattan just 5 hours before game time following their return from friday night s triumph in minnesota , were fighting the fatigue crystal robinson played in pain most of the night , grimacing from her right shoulder sprain that had kept her out of friday night s victory becky hammon still had a groin pull that was bothering her phillips scored only 10 points after notching her eighth doubledouble friday the liberty needed more than another body , and weatherspoon stepped in at the right time photo vickie johnson , who scored 14 points to help the liberty move above the 500 mark , looking for help against pressure from kisha ford \( associated press \)
president clinton s pardon yesterday of dan rostenkowski , the former chairman of the house ways and means committee who pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges in 1996 , is a misuse of the presidential pardoning power in order to pay back a loyal political lieutenant we sought to caution mr clinton last week to show restraint in exercising this extraordinary power during his last holiday season in office , but our cautionary note was replaced in most editions by an editorial on the supreme court s latenight ruling in the election case , so we return to the subject today the president s power to pardon anyone charged with crimes against the united states is absolute but mr clinton ought to avoid any more reckless eleventhhour subversions of the rule of law while michael milken , jonathan pollard and some of the figures involved in the whitewater scandals are reported to be under consideration , none of them deserve a presidential pardon although presidents routinely grant pardons to reverse what they consider flawed outcomes in the judicial process , most celebrated pardons serve a broader political and societal interest but a pardon for susan mcdougal , webster hubbell or others involved in the whitewater scandal would be a selfindulgent gesture on mr clinton s part and would serve no higher purpose for years , the white house has been caught in a political crossfire in the case of jonathan pollard , the naval intelligence analyst convicted of betraying classified material to israel the israeli government has been among those advocating for clemency , making the case all the more delicate but we share the central intelligence agency s concern that pardoning mr pollard would signal undue leniency on national security mr clinton has said he is considering clemency in the case of leonard peltier , the prominent native american activist convicted of killing two fbi agents in 1975 a politically motivated pardon would be inappropriate neither the passage of time nor a political agenda can be invoked to minimize the coldblooded killing of federal agents but troubling questions have been raised about the fairness of mr peltier s trial and whether he actually did the shooting or simply abetted it the case warrants vigorous review by the justice department to determine whether presidential action is needed michael milken , the financier who revolutionized wall street by allowing entrepreneurs to tap into capital markets via junk bonds , may be benefiting from the most intense lobbying his cause has been taken up by some of mr clinton s most generous financial backers having pleaded guilty in 1990 to six counts of securities fraud , he has already served his time and is at present an energetic philanthropist he remains a hero to many in corporate america , who say that he was unfairly singled out by the prosecution and that his overall contribution to society calls for a retroactive pardon many mistakenly believe that crimes that subvert the integrity of financial markets are not all that serious that is the unfortunate message the white house would be sending if it pardoned mr milken he suffered no injustice needing reversal

the 20campus city university of new york was in chaos when the board of trustees hired matthew goldstein as the new chancellor last summer political infighting among the trustees had paralyzed the administration , driven out some of the institution s most talented minds and further demoralized a faculty that was already embittered by hiring freezes and disrespect from a few trustees who put politics ahead of academics the tensions between the faculty and the administration seemed to subside when mr goldstein was installed as chancellor but the faculty and the administration were at loggerheads again last week over proposed curriculum changes that the trustees voted for , including a plan to consider a systemwide core curriculum , in the style of elite institutions like columbia and the university of chicago the board chairman , herman badillo , says the faculty will be consulted on the details of the new curriculum , which he says is aimed at raising standards across the system but the faculty union president , barbara bowen , charged the trustees with conspiring to usurp faculty powers , forcing through a curriculum dictated by conservative groups like change new york and the national association of scholars , two organizations that have long sought , in the faculty s judgment , to commandeer the university both sides will need to proceed rationally and in good faith to avoid yet another destructive round of intramural warfare the master plan put forward by the trustees has many commendable aspects for starters , the plan is aimed at eliminating program duplications , and augmenting each campus s strength in order to produce flagship campuses with higher admissions standards , in the style of the california system the plan also calls for strengthening teacher education and for more systematic relations between cuny and the public schools that provide most of the system s students the trustees realized that none of this can be accomplished unless cuny rebuilds its faculty , which is far too dependent on poorly paid parttimers , who dash from one parttime job to another , leaving little time for student counseling or for other activities that sustain a vibrant university the trustees want at least 70 percent of the fouryear college faculty to be fulltime teachers the faculty applauds the rebuilding effort but fears that conservatives outside the university will have undue influence over the shape of the proposed core curriculum , making for a narrower selection of course offerings at cuny mr goldstein and the trustees dispute this emphatically , saying that the entire program is up for discussion it is incumbent upon both sides to work this through the last thing cuny needs is more of the intramural warfare that ravaged the system for much of the last decade
new haven bloomsbury is the nickname never sought by those directly concerned for a group of friends and sometime lovers who began to see one another in or near gordon square in london in 1910 they included virginia woolf her sister , the painter vanessa bell clive bell , the critic and author of art \( 1914 \) roger fry , the originator of two historic postimpressionist exhibitions in london , in 1910 and 1914 the painter duncan grant , the economist j m keynes and the essayist and biographer lytton strachey they stayed together not as a selfpromoting group , but as people who never tired of one another s company the art of bloomsbury is the largest and most complicated loan exhibition ever mounted at the yale center for british art here what we see is a very large and tightly focused exhibition , but it is much more than that in an almost subliminal way it gives us the freedom of a certain britain in the first half of the 20th century this was a time in which a handful of people provided the model of a civilization in which old ideas were called in question and new ones put quietly forward at the heart of it were three high victorian families the stracheys , the stephens and the frys lytton strachey , with his queen victoria \( 1921 \) , pioneered the case for biographies that had something pertinent to say in every line but that did not go on forever his brother , james , made the first translation into english of the complete works of freud their sister , dorothy , married a french painter , simon bussy , and was for many years a close friend of andre gide henri matisse , a former classmate of bussy , was their friend and neighbor near nice anyone who thinks that bloomsbury lacked bite need only look at bussy s little portrait of lady ottoline morrell in the present show duncan grant , a preeminent figure in the yale show , was a cousin of the stracheys and went to school with the poet rupert brooke men and women alike fell for him on sight until he was well into his 80 s the second bloomsbury family were the stephens virginia woolf , the novelist , and vanessa bell , the painter , were the daughters of sir leslie stephen , the first editor of the british dictionary of national biography roger fry s father , sir edward fry , ended his legal career as a lord justice of appeal and his sister margery was principal of somerville college , oxford he himself had been for a while at the metropolitan museum of art , where he was responsible , among other things , for the purchase of renoir s charpentier family these were high victorian families , but they were not at all stuffy uncensorious is the word for lady strachey s attitude to the often wayward antics of her children nor did her descendants forget her some 50 years ago , when i first went to the stracheys' house in gordon square , i found that the nameboard in the hall still bore the names of sir richard and lady strachey though long dead , they were simply marked out , as if they had just gone round the block and now , on the title page of the catalog for the art of bloomsbury , we find vanessa bell , painter duncan grant , painter and roger fry , critic , painter , designer and mesmeric lecturer on the history of art more than 200 paintings , drawings and sculptures are on view there are enough autograph letters \( none of them perfunctory \) to give an interested visitor a long and happy day s reading \( a magnifying glass will help \) there are photographs by the dozen , and not one of them is dull anyone who knew leonard woolf as a widower , quietly fading away , will be amazed by the photograph that emphasizes the trenchant virility that he radiated at the time of his marriage to virginia woolf in 1911 there are also headsets on which one can call up recorded memories by veterans of the bloomsbury scene there are relevant books and manuscripts by members or nearmembers of bloomsbury virginia woolf , above all , but also leonard woolf , e m forster and keynes we see the books published by leonard woolf under the imprint of the hogarth press unmistakable bloomsbury book jackets \( mostly designed by virginia woolf \) also abound and there are pieces of furniture made at the omega workshops , which were directed from 1911 to 1918 by fry almost everyone in bloomsbury agreed with the philosopher g e moore that loving friendship and esthetic enjoyment were the supreme goods from 1910 onward a loving friendship is clearly present in many of the portraits on view beginning with grant s portrait of keynes \( 1908 \) , a great many of them are clearly lovetokens samesex love affairs ran throughout the history of bloomsbury , though significant reversions to heterosexuality could happen at any moment and sometimes led to genealogical havoc and the art \? to begin with , the dedicated organizer , richard shone , gives the lie to the longrunning opinion that fry s paintings are not worth looking at fry s paintings of french landscape in 191213 , and even more his wonderfully lively and truthful portraits of iris tree \( 1915 \) and edith sitwell \( 1918 \) , have a candor and a directness that still take us by surprise bell and grant were loving companions for half a century , and she had a daughter by him in 1918 but in their work , their selves remained separate grant always had surprises to spring , from the hauntingly beautiful abstract image that he painted in 1915 in memory of rupert brooke to the apotheosis of contentment that smiles out at us in his vanessa bell at charleston \( 1917 \) bell , by contrast , could always make something memorable out of plain things and plain places , even as early as 1912 with her monte oliveto the art of bloomsbury was a conversational art , in which high drama remained latent \( grant put more drama into his parrot tulips , from about 1912 , than into any of the paintings that relate to his own life \) nor were these artists competitive , either with one another or in the market they did their own thing , in their own way , and they knew that it was part of a world of new books , new poems and new points of view in which they would always have a place the art of bloomsbury is at the yale center for british art , 1080 chapel street , new haven , \( 203 \) 4322800 , through sept 3 in conjunction with the show there will be a twoday symposium \( june 16 and 17 \) performances of vita and virginia , a play about virginia woolf and vita sackvillewest written by eileen atkins \( 5 30 pm on june 20 and 21 \) and a program about the composer ethel smyth \( 5 30 pm , june 22 \) photo a 1958 selfportrait by vanessa bell in the art of bloomsbury \( charleston trust estate of vanessa bell \)
black girl in paris by shay youngblood illustrated 238 pp new york riverhead books 2395 following in the footsteps of langston hughes and josephine baker , a young american woman flees for france in order to pursue her dreams of becoming an important writer this is the premise of shay youngblood s second novel , black girl in paris bearing her small savings , a few possessions and the requisite journal for when the muse strikes , eden hops a flight to paris knowing only that the city of light has also been the chosen destination of many others stricken with similar aspirations this straightforwardly written story follows eden as she stumbles into the life of an expatriate where to live , whom to love , what to write the territory is familiar included are the obligatory cheap hotels and the cheap , occasionally pilfered meals bohemian parties with exotic friends cannot be far behind it s the paris of every young artist s fantasies , except this is france in 1986 terrorist bombs nest along the avenues and antiimmigrant sentiment abounds it seems not even the french love les negres as much as they used to eden sometimes thrives and sometimes flounders the specifics of her travails are often less interesting than their presentation youngblood s narrative devices include snippets from eden s journal and lists she creates so that others might learn from her mistakes some lists give actual advice others provide only clever titles for the continuing narrative along the way , there s even a recipe or two the novel is built around the characters and episodes that shape eden s early days in paris a wellknown poet becomes her mentor she falls in love with a soulful white jazz musician she takes mediocre jobs with insufferable employers who treat her with condescension and contempt the novel reads like a roman clef youngblood introduces the artists and writers presented here in a way that suggests strongly that these are people we have heard about , or should have heard about were we as savvy as the main character indego , who first takes eden under his wing , was born in texas to a family of musicians and studied the world , traveling from coast to coast on trains , on buses and in brokendown automobiles another poet , suffering from a degenerative nerve disease , gossips about her peers as eden bathes her and helps her to the toilet for the most part , this kind of thing is annoying it s like listening to an intimate conversation among friends with whom you are newly acquainted lingering at the edge of each tale is the sense that knowing the right people might bring the anecdote to life meanwhile the story falls flat , interesting only to those who are in the know fortunately , the episodic nature of the narrative means that none of the supporting cast annoys us for too long few characters carry forward from one incident to the next more than anything else , black girl in paris is the story of a quest , each station providing a necessary trial on eden s road to encounter her own personal wizard , the quintessential expat , james baldwin everyone along her route seems to have encountered the great man , but as was also the case with poor dorothy , no one is quite able to deliver on a promised audience the analogy to oz is hardly strained in light of eden s moving encounter with the frail and ailing master in the end , what confounds about the novel its brazen need to retread the wellworn streets of the paris of the young artist may also be its greatest strength black girl in paris is shay youngblood s love letter and her homage to the expatriates who paved the way for those who followed the poets and musicians and painters and singers they are present here in fact and in spirit they gently guide eden in the direction of her dreams and good guides they seem to be we are left with an eden full of promise , ambition and the good wishes of artists past along with their thin wallets and the addresses of a few cheap hotels , young writers intending to run away to paris might be wise to drop a copy of this one in their backpacks
yonkers it is nearly 7 pm , long after most of lincoln high school has gone home , but assistant principal shango blake is still hard at it he has spent the day in his basement office , handling the problems and complaints of dozens of students now he is out looking for their parents mr blake s mission , as he sees it , is to act as a community ambassador for the troubled school here , extending a hand to mothers and fathers who have had little contact with lincoln other than the occasional disciplinary writeup , sent home in the mail on a recent monday , mr blake was on his third home visit of the evening he had already spoken with the teenagers hanging out in getty square , crisscrossed the highways of this racially divided city , been yelled at , questioned and embraced by everyone from police officers to single mothers , and his expression rarely wavered a broad smile , soft conversation , these are the tools mr blake has relied on a group of elderly women playing cards at maria george s kitchen table in a small house off tuckahoe road offered the babyfaced , 29yearold administrator some dinner from a pot on the stove he refused politely and went upstairs to visit with ms george the mother of a lincoln senior , ms george was fuming because college scouts had told her they would not seriously consider miranda , who is a stellar basketball player and an advanced placement student at lincoln , for a sports scholarship because kids from yonkers do n't make the grade that hurt me so much , ms george said my kid was discredited just because of where she came from the state education department has been monitoring lincoln high for some time and last year threatened to close the 1 , 350student school if academic performance did not improve dramatically the effect has been as polarizing as ramming a superhighway down the middle of a sleepy village administrators , including the controversial district superintendent , andre j hornsby , insist that the only way to succeed is to throw out every vestige of the past but teachers believe that what their school most desperately needs is consistency , with measured steps toward change the administrative team brought in this year to create a new lincoln does n't even know the teachers' names , they complain , and principal horace williams , who only arrived in september , has not assured them that he will be there next fall students say the rush to turn lincoln around has created so many new rules that none are taken seriously perhaps the only thing that everyone in the school experiences similarly is the tidal wave of blame the board of education criticizes the teachers the teachers decry the administration and grumble about parents' lack of involvement parents and students complain about superintendent hornsby , the teachers' union and even the mayor , who generally sides with the school board the circle goes round and round , becoming more bitter and entrenched each week in march , mr williams tried to break this cycle by rallying his staff with a daylong series of speeches and workshops he paced before them in the lunchroom , delivering something between a motivational address and an ultimatum it s no more them and us , he said into his microphone as teachers shifted uncomfortably in their plastic chairs divided we fall yet , divide he did if you 're going to be at lincoln , you 're going to have to make some very serious decisions , he told the crowd if you 're not happy at your job , make a change if you 're afraid or intimidated by the kids , make a change you have to make a decision , and you have to make it today then he asked those who were ready to stand for a new beginning at lincoln to rise from their seats everyone , except for one office assistant did stand , but they did not appreciate mr williams s tone , nor the fact that he had , in essence , invited them to quit only minutes before they were to present their own plan for improvement , one that focused on an interdisciplinary approach to improving performance and would enlist the entire yonkers school community in addressing lincoln s problems you start a new beginning by building bridges , not by burning them , pat puleo , an art teacher , said during a lunch break if we wanted to leave we could have left at the end of last year i chose to stay to help make lincoln better in his basement office , decorated with pictures of martin luther king and a framed poem titled black man do n't you know you are a threat , mr blake is struggling to do the same thing the assistant principal s forte is neither speechmaking \( though he does plenty of that \) , nor teaching an educational leader , he believes , is a community leader so most days after school mr blake who is married with three young children of his own does not go home he hits the streets the first stop is often getty square , where hundreds of teenagers flock mr blake does his banking and shopping there now , though he lives in queens , just so students will see him around , just so they know that he sees them
scranton , pa the miners had a saying 'if the timbers start talking , we start walking , ' joe burke said , turning his head so that the thin beam from the lamp on his miner s helmet poked into the gloom , barely illuminating the stout wood columns that seemed to hold up the roof these timbers do n't really support the mine roof , explained mr burke it is held up by pillars of stone that miners leave standing as they dig out adjoining chambers of coal you could actually remove all of these timber props , and the roof would stay the way it is , he said their real job was to let miners know if there was what they called a squeeze pressure or movement in the rock above that would make these timbers creak and even crack , which was basically an early warning system to get out fast guiding visitors along a damp and chilly tunnel in the old lackawanna coal mine , 300 feet under the ground , mr burke does not give the company line on the history of king coal coal mining was brutish , backbreaking and sometimes fatal for those who went down into the mines in pennsylvania s anthracite mines , 600 to 700 men died annually in each of the 15 years of heaviest production until the end of world war i in all , more than 30 , 000 workers died in accidents in the anthracite mines from 1870 to 1949 , after which production fell off sharply the hundreds of visitors who take the guided tours of the mine every day are meant to come back into the sunshine with a greater appreciation of a way of life that left deep veins of loss , misery and cultural trauma through successive generations of families in the anthracite fields of northeast pennsylvania , where thick fingers of hardcoal deposits are splayed for 450 miles between the folds of rolling mountains only fairly recently have memories of mining history become cultural imprints to celebrate rather than bitterly suppress mining left a mark on many families around here , said tom supey jr , the foreman of the restored coal mine , which is operated by lackawanna county a lot of people were killed or watched their loved ones die of black lung disease , so coal mining was kind of something they wanted to forget about the american labor movement was born here , starting with the first miners' strikes in the 1840 s coal companies and the railroads that hauled coal often deployed armed thugs to respond to labor agitation like early swat teams , squads of brutal pinkerton private detectives , as well as the hated coal and iron police , were rushed by railroad cars to sites of labor unrest on the miners' side , the nightriding molly maguires , a secret society whose members had fled the irish famine in the late 1840 s , rallied miners and exacted violent retribution against many abusive mine bosses in a struggle of class warfare that was forged into american labor legend in the 1980 s , worried that the turbulent history of the coal fields might be forgotten as its culture faded , mr supey and his brother , andy , joined with their father , tom sr , to lead fundraising efforts for restoration of the mine , whose 1 , 300foot main shaft had deteriorated over the years since it was shut down in 1966 the goal was to reopen the lackawanna mine as a way to commemorate a critical american industrial experience whose narrative , they feared , would otherwise literally die on the lips of the last generation of men who had gone down daily into the mines the mine , which remains structurally sound , was reopened in 1985 , when the idea of luring tourists to a drab , playedout upstate pennsylvania city like scranton was considered eccentric at best the regional tourist business increased substantially after the opening in 1995 of steamtown national historic site , where one of the country s largest collections of steam locomotives and steamera rolling stock are gathered in a 52acre former rail yard only a few miles from the mine like steamtown , whose trainbuff visitors often spill over to the lackawanna site and the adjacent staterun anthracite heritage museum , the mine tour emphasizes the real thing you get the dampness , you get the cold , you get a firsthand look at what mining was like , mr supey said you also get guides like joe burke affable , knowledgeable and deeply cognizant of his family roots in the coal fields though mr burke was n't a miner , his father hauled those roof timbers down into the mines a greatgrandfather started out as a breaker boy , one of many child laborers , whose job was to pick out slate rocks and sort chunks of coal that rumbled in an endless stream along troughs in a breaker shed where giant machines crunched the newly mined coal the miserable plight of breaker boys inspired gilded age journalists to loud denunciations of coalmine exploitation and led to passage of stronger child labor laws the lackawanna site was one of about 200 mines that once operated in the northeastern pennsylvania coal fields their product , anthracite , is a hard , cleanburning coal that first fueled the small factories , steam engines and iron furnaces of the 19thcentury industrial revolution the ruins of four such structures from this era can be seen at the scranton iron furnaces later , soft bituminous coal from west virginia and kentucky fed the blast furnaces that turned pittsburgh , 300 miles to the west , into the steelmaking capital of the nation
'hamlet' in his updating of shakespeare , the director michael almereyda does something few other film versions of hamlet have ever bothered to attempt , and makes this melancholydane story a singular achievement in the bargain he roots hamlet in an actual place manhattan and employs the dramatic contradictions of contemporary new york city for all of their tremendous possibilities what better headquarters for rampant paranoia and epic depression is there \? the visual strategies he brings to bear are matched by his staging of the actors the soliloquies of hamlet \( ethan hawke \) are now interior monologues , and characters keep tabs on the world and their feelings through video monitoring 'george washington' there s simply nothing else like this movie in this year or any year it s a dream of a picture , with delicate shifts of tone and the sure , steady hand of a writerdirector in this case , the firsttime feature filmmaker david gordon green who trusts his actors lively and inviting , george washington follows its group of young actors none of whom have an ounce of the professional , ingratiating slickness of child performers through what initially feels like idle conversation and turns out to be layers of character revelation mr green and his talented cinematographer , tim orr , build a community , and the gentle intermingling of the races has the honest feel of a real southern town this landmark achievement is not to be missed 'calle 54' one of the best documentaries of the year , as well as one of the most important films ever made about jazz one that finally gives the performers their due and the form the respect it deserves each sparkling performance is staged in jawdroppingly gorgeous color and introduced with a short , intimate blackandwhite interview segment the director fernando trueba has assembled an allstar program of latin jazz greats , including bebo and chucho valdes , jerry gonzalez , eliane elias , paquito d'rivera and gato barbieri , and simply lets them play 'crouching tiger , hidden dragon' there are n't many who would choose to parody the loony conventions of the hong kong action film and to simultaneously give them dramatic weight the director ang lee comes through on both counts , giving the martialarts sequences the exuberant radiance of musical numbers and making each of them advance the story the female characters are n't simply defined by men they make their own decisions , and suffer for their choices this is jane austen s buffy the vampire slayer 'praise' one of the most powerful and thoughtful movies on relationships in years looks at two people who are totally wrong for each other and who still ca n't stay away from each other cynthia \( sacha horler \) and gordon \( peter fenton \) tumble into one horrible and often hilarious situation after another it s the postpunk version of last tango in paris except this time , it s the woman s inflamed libido that propels the doomed affair the fireplug cynthia is literally inflamed \( parts of her skin are covered with raw patches of eczema \) and peter is a slender slacker who goes wherever she throws him an irrepressible object meets an unmoved force 'black and white' the director james toback s noisy and boisterous take on the current state of race relations and the romance with africanamerican culture deserves note if only because he got much of the wu tang clan , who are featured in the film , to show up on the set at the same time black and white is a world where cultures and hungers collide mr toback understands he s dramatizing desire everyone here has something that somebody else wants , and those with the audacity to step up and voice their needs are the most attractive some of the film is spotty , but all of it is worth watching especially robert downey jr and mike tyson as mike tyson , the movie s voice of reason 'before night falls' this film on the life of the cuban writer reinaldo arenas \( javier bardem \) is the remarkable second movie from the painter julian schnabel he shows an empathy for the mind and soul of an artist through bold , expressionistic scenes that give a sense of the conflicts inside arenas there s a lovely , paternalistic curiosity at the heart of the film mr schnabel s own needs become evident he wants to clarify the turmoil in arenas s heart , perhaps to make sense of the creative process for himself at the same time , mr schnabel knows that great art is unexplainable before night falls is a potent and hypnotic depiction of an unanswerable question 'ratcatcher' much of this film about james , a young glaswegian boy \( william eadie \) during a few weeks in 1970 , seems to take place near water , and much of its power comes from the dreamy authority of its debutante writerdirector lynne ramsay her influences are clear this could be the 400 blows by way of ken loach but the intimacy that ms ramsay achieves is her own value is constantly being weighed by the characters someone s chucked out a perfectly good dog , someone says , while examining a canine s corpse everything here gets a second look and deserves it 'requiem for a dream' lurid , splashy and powerful , this is the director darren aronofsky s allamerican , robust take on selfdestruction he floors his accelerator all the way to the equator , as the doowop king dion once sang in a song set in roughly the same era as requiem requiem , adapted from hubert selby jr s novel by mr aronofsky and mr selby , is about the american appetite for something better the movie also fixates on the rituals of addiction mr aronofsky shows development as a director , and gets strong performances from his cast ellen burstyn , jared leto , jennifer connelly and marlon wayans , as unlikely a grouping as you 're likely to see 'the yards' the writerdirector james gray s second film has the mordant elegiac power of italian neorealism , using the best of visconti as its model his dedication to craft and storytelling generates excitement in the tale of a young man \( mark wahlberg \) returning home from prison who ruins the lives of his friends and family by trying to do what s right an artfully rendered descent into nightmare photos jerry gonzalez on trumpet in the fernando trueba jazz documentary calle 54 \( jordi socias miramax films \) ethan hawke and julia stiles in a

denver , aug 17 roy rosa watched the television images of democratic conventioneers whirling like dervishes after senator edward m kennedy finished his speech on tuesday night and asked , do n't these people realize they 're going to lose \? mr rosa , a college student , joined three other independent voters in a hotel room here earlier this week to view the convention , cracking jokes at the proceedings and matching notes on what did or did not work about the orchestrated series of speeches presented by democratic loyalists much of the convention s rhetoric , they agreed , seemed specifically focused upon attracting independent voters like themselves without loyalty to any party mr rosa is perhaps the definition of an independent voter a member of both the national rifle association and the board of the national gay and lesbian task force , he supported senator john mccain s presidential bid like the other voters gathered here to watch the convention , he approached with an open , if skeptical , mind three of the four had supported president clinton when he first ran for the white house in 1992 two had even done volunteer work in his campaign but none of them voted for mr clinton in 1996 , and not one would support him if he were running today , they said all the lying and duplicity just bugged me with clinton , said sarah edgell , a 42yearold graphic designer who voted for ross perot in 1996 as a protest against the president he is such a complex man he can seem so honest and then be such a liar jeanne smith , 29 , an administrator for the university of colorado s health science center , said , i did n't trust him then and i do n't trust him now her husband , keith , a senior officer with the american indian college fund , said that after feeling initial enthusiasm for the clinton administration , he had become progressively disenchanted with the democrats over their handling of indian issues but that did not mean he was willing to leap to the republicans george bush does n't understand indian affairs , said mr smith , a member of the navajo tribe going into the convention , he had been leaning toward vice president al gore , as was ms edgell mrs smith had not made up her mind , and mr rosa , 22 , planned to vote for ralph nader the election , ms edgell said , should be about providing homes , education , food , and health care for everybody there are so many people out there working for the minimum wage , not getting anywhere , she said i do n't want someone as president who s just a mouthpiece for big business mr rosa , a former member of the reserve officers training corps , said 'do n't ask , do n't tell' in the military was a big mistake the democrats give gays a seat at the table , then bind us to the chair they do n't want to hear us speak in my main issue , gay rights , both parties get an 'f' it was senator joseph i lieberman s speech on wednesday night that seemed to most heighten the viewers' interests in the democratic ticket particularly important , said mr smith , 31 , was mr lieberman s emphasis on his religion respect for faith is part of the navajo being , mr smith said a lot of our relationships with other people and other tribes are grounded in our respect for others' beliefs i definitely want to know more about lieberman , mr smith said he was genuine in what he had to say he was so natural and honest he did n't sound like a politician by the time mr gore took the podium on thursday night , mr smith was even more inclined to vote for him , as were his wife and ms edgell mr rosa was still wavering between mr gore and mr nader mr smith said his speech started off slowly , basically rehashing all the stuff we 'd heard before he picked up in the middle , but overall , i was disappointed ms edgell and mr rosa , though , said the vice president s speech was an unqualified success i loved that he talked about traditional democratic values and workingfamily issues , ms edgell said but among the four voters , the most affected by the speech was mr rosa sure , it was banal and boring at the beginning , but when he got warmed up it was awesome , mr rosa said he covered the whole plight of the working class and he did n't do it in a patronizing way and if one goal of the quadrennial democratic party s party was to solidify its base , mr rosa said he thought the vice president s speech accomplished that mission he really energized the activists by talking about roe v wade , and hate crimes and racial profiling , mr rosa said gore did it very well , and i was really impressed he sold himself to me at the same time yeah , i'm going vote for him

los angeles david milch , the cocreator and architect of nypd blue , is one of television s most successful writers so it s not surprising to learn that he works out at a fancy sports club and has a summer estate on martha s vineyard , that he met his wife , rita , at yale and that he dotes on her and their three children he would , in fact , appear to have it all but appearances can be deceiving the 55yearold emmy awardwinning writer , who is leaving nypd blue after seven years , has had his share of torments on the one hand , mr milch was a yale university lecturer who was mentored by and who idolized robert penn warren , the pulitzer prizewinning writer on the other hand , he was a heroin addict , an alcoholic and a compulsive gambler who once destroyed a police car s roof lights with a shotgun blast , who spent time in a mexican jail and who more than once came close to death it was a very violent life and stupid and criminal , said mr milch , his voice drifting off i lived a shadow life somehow i was able to find more constructive accommodations for all these impulses there was my work there are n't too many people that i write about that i ca n't imagine being mr milch s decision to leave nypd blue to create television series and movies for paramount in a multimillion dollar deal was in part inspired by exhaustion working nonstop on the scripts of the police show , often writing scenes just hours before the actors were to perform them , he realized he had had enough i will not work that way again , mr milch said i 've watched david over the last three years become increasingly burnt out , said steven bochco , who brought mr milch to hollywood from yale in the early 1980 s and created nypd blue with him i do n't mean in terms of talent or enthusiasm but the level of intensity and singlemindedness that he brings to his work takes its toll the departure of mr milch will , most certainly , alter the awardwinning police drama , whose central figure , det andy sipowicz , played by dennis franz , is a complicated , tormented , angry exalcoholic mr milch said that the character is based not on his own personality but that of his father , elmer , who died in 1979 my father s mother s name was sapowitch , said mr milch he was a surgeon , a professor of medicine at the state university at buffalo and chief of staff at a hospital he was also challenged the way sipowicz is challenged , in terms of his habits , his addictions , his temperament mr milch said that in addition to suffering from serious emotional problems , his father , who often treated criminals in his medical practice , was also a habitual gambler mr milch , seated in the 20th century fox commissary at lunchtime , was eating his usual lunch of steamed vegetables and fish he worries about his health he has lost about 50 pounds over the past few years , and his gym workouts are less about vanity than about survival shortly after the premiere of nypd blue , mr milch underwent seven angioplasty procedures the heart problems that caused the death of the show s bobby simone , played by jimmy smits , mirrored mr milch s own health battles the disease that threatened the young son of sipowicz echoed a scare that mr milch and his wife faced when their son became ill if his real life has a way of insinuating itself into his work , it s also true that he seems to incorporate the stuff of drama into his life only the previous night , mr milch said , he had begun weeping at the sight of a man who reminded him of someone he had known a drug dealer and male prostitute who went from new york to new haven three times a week to sell mr milch drugs while he was teaching at yale between trains , the drug dealer would read the homosexual greek poets in the yale library h e died before either of us turned our lives around , said mr milch and as i experienced this man last night , my friend was alive again and sober and he did n't have to suffer every day and that was because i was able to experience him i feel that way about sipowicz too , mr milch continued my dad does n't have to suffer the way he suffered because i'm able to experience that character in all of his complexities and scope and humanity mr milch grew up in buffalo , ny , and attended yale and the graduate school of the university of iowa before going on to yale law school to escape the draft \( at the same time as president clinton \) his career at yale was bizarre his attempts at writing novels came to the attention of robert penn warren and r w b lewis , the literary critic and historian but mr milch s talents were matched by his demons it was in new haven that he shot out the police car s roof lights addicted to gambling as well as to drugs , he lost thousands of dollars but mr milch also taught , under the guidance of warren , who secured him jobs for years , he used one addiction to manage the others heroin saved my life , he said , in the sense that it normalized my existence

christmas of 1999 was rather forgettable for allan houston he lay around in an almost empty indianapolis hotel that day , thinking about his wife , tammy , and their 6monthold daughter , remie that evening , he went out and missed 7 of 11 shots in a 10190 loss to the indiana pacers houston s holiday was much better this year fresh off a 27point performance in the knicks' most inspiring victory of the season , a 20point rout of the philadelphia 76ers on friday night , houston spent yesterday in new jersey with his wife s family the couple are expecting their second child in april , making the day even sweeter last year was strange , being in a hotel all alone , houston said hardly anyone was working , so guys could barely get something to eat so it s great this year to have family in the area and to be able to go visit them at a time like this being near family is just one reason houston loves playing in new york the fact that he has clearly come of age , on and off the court , during his five seasons with the knicks is not lost on him he experienced his first postseason victory in new york and forever lodged himself in knicks lore with his gamewinning , seriesclinching basket against the miami heat in the 1999 playoffs he also earned his first allstar game berth last season and won an olympic gold medal in september no wonder houston would like to finish his career in new york but whether that will happen is far from certain houston , 29 , can opt out of his contract and become a free agent at the end of this season he has not yet decided what he will do , but there is little financial incentive for him not to exercise that option moreover , there are continual trade rumors involving houston this season , there has been speculation that he may be traded to the atlanta hawks for dikembe mutombo or to the minnesota timberwolves for terrell brandon for any player , but particularly one who is content where he is , such persistent talk can be distracting but houston , who is averaging a teamleading 189 points , does not appear the least bit bothered i do n't even think about the rumors , houston said the good thing about hearing rumors all the time is that you almost become immune to them if it was just once or twice a year , it would be different but in new york , we hear it every two weeks , so it comes to a point where you just say , 'oh , here we go again' it s like seeing a red light you just get to the light and stop without even thinking about it you 've seen so many of them that it s no big deal houston said he only hears about trade rumors from friends or reporters often criticized harshly after bad games , he has taken to ignoring the sports sections of newspapers i do n't want to know what they 're writing , houston said to me , why should i allow negative stuff to go into my head \? it s not healthy for me i understand that there are times when good stuff is written , too , but in new york , where it s so competitive , there has to be something negative written that s the nature of the market , and i understand that so i make a conscious effort not to see the papers if i see one , it s not like i'm going to run from it , but i never stop at a newsstand and pick one up houston has become comfortable in the spotlight during his time in new york latrell sprewell may be the knicks' most popular player , but houston is the club s most visible on a national level he can be seen shooting jumpers in a television commercial or appearing in a magazine advertisement he also had a role alongside ben stiller and claudia schiffer in the movie black and white , which was released last spring while houston said he enjoyed the experience and would want to continue acting , he has felt some remorse about appearing in the film because some scenes were sexually explicit none of his scenes were , however regret is a strong word , because i did enjoy being in the movie and seeing how i could act , said houston , a bornagain christian but there were certain things i regretted about doing it when i had my daughter , my perspective kind of changed now i'm looking at it like , 'one day she might watch it' she probably will but hopefully , at that time , she 'll be grown enough where she 'll be able to handle it he added instead of it being like 'remember the titans , ' or something inspirational like that , it was a movie with everything in it if i did something now , i would prefer doing something more on that level but i ca n't lie it was fun being in it houston s reservations about appearing in black and white , which was filmed in 1998 , grew out of his induction into parenthood and his increased spirituality houston said his religious commitment has deepened since he has been in new york , because of the influence of his teammates andrew lang , terry cummings and , most notably , charlie ward houston , one of the knicks' most charitable players , hopes to record a christian rap song to share the faith that he says keeps him from worrying about things like whether he will be a knick after this season it 'd be like me being in a movie , houston said of his musical ambitions it 'd be something that would be fun to do i think people would be interested in hearing it , and i think that over the next year or so it s something i'm going to try to do and he hopes to do it as a member of the knicks photo allan houston , leading the knicks with 189 points a game , had 27 points in the knicks' victory over the firstplace 76ers on friday \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
adasiye , lebanon when lt col robin abboud looks down from his home high in the rugged hills of southern lebanon , the view is of israel less than 500 yards away lies the border fence topped with electrified barbed wire , and beyond it a military road flanked by minefields that snakes steeply uphill to an israeli army post bristling with radars and lookout towers but the israel that the 42yearold lebanese colonel sees most plainly is the israel that lies beyond the bands of steel the israel represented , a few miles down a lush valley visible from his veranda , by the town of qiryat shemona a cluster of neat green fields , gleaming apartment blocks and tidy industrial zones , the town looks like a poster for all that israel , in the last halfcentury , has carved out of these stony biblical lands compare the history of israel and the arabs , of judaism and islam , if you will , colonel abboud said over arab pastries and thimble cups of thick turkish coffee in his living room the arab past has been a history of deception , of rivalry and dictatorship but look at the jews how they decided , after the holocaust , to establish israel , to commit themselves to each other and to create the only real democracy in the middle east in his view , the vision makes for a stark contrast with lebanon , where progress has been confounded by years of religious and ethnic enmity and , before 1990 , by 15 years of civil war lately , though , his view has been tinged with melancholy and even fear for the colonel , an arab and a shiite muslim , is also , in the eyes of a lebanese military court , a traitor , sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment at hard labor for having served more than two decades in a militia force allied to israel in its military presence in southern lebanon now israel is preparing to leave , and as a member of the south lebanon army , or sla , a 3 , 000member militia of lebanese muslims , christians and druse , colonel abboud is more than ever a marked man the critical moment came this month when the israeli cabinet endorsed a campaign pledge made last year by prime minister ehud barak to withdraw the 1 , 500soldier israeli contingent back into israel by july 7 worse still , from the militia s viewpoint , the israeli cabinet decided to complete the pullout with or without an agreement with lebanon and syria the syrians effectively control most of lebanon through the 35 , 000 troops they maintain beyond the military buffer zone that israel controls within nine miles of its border the territory israel is vacating has become a curious hybrid , a place where the resentments that its presence engenders have been offset by advantages superior roads and other public services , like water and power , stores richly stocked with foreign goods imported duty free through israel , and at least for sla officers and their families prosperity unrivaled elsewhere in rural lebanon but there is also an elusive sense of lifelessness and a lack of authenticity , as if this were no more than a stage set , to be dismantled when the players move on many of the villages are halfdeserted , abandoned by residents who long since migrated north to other parts of lebanon or abroad in shops and cafes , people not working for the israelis or their lebanese allies shy away when approached by outsiders the hills and valleys held by the israelis , flanked by the mediterranean to the west and the snowy peaks of mount hermon to the east , have been marked by the ebb and flow of conquest for thousands of years the phoenicians , the greeks , the romans , the ottoman turks , the british and the french all left their traces before being driven out now , after 22 years , the retreating power is israel , and the repercussions for the south lebanon army are profound without an agreement among israel , syria and lebanon setting terms for the withdrawal , the men of the militia force , and possibly even the 5 , 000 other residents of the buffer zone who work in israel in total , counting families , about a quarter of the 120 , 000 residents of the zone appear to be prime targets for reprisals for ordinary members of the militia , many little more than conscripts , lebanese officials have said the punishment will be prison terms probably of a year , possibly two or three but the outlook for the force s 350 officers is grimmer a small flicker of hope remains in the possibility of a peace agreement between israel and syria before the july withdrawal date , which would enable israel to negotiate the terms for withdrawal with lebanon but with the israelisyrian peace talks deadlocked , president emile lahoud of lebanon has ruled out talks with israel in any case , militia officers say that with the israeli deadline near at hand , too little time may be left for negotiations anxieties have been heightened by warnings from the leaders of hezbollah , or the party of god , the shiite muslim militant group backed by iran and syria sheik hassan nasrallah , the muslim cleric who leads hezbollah , has described the south lebanon army s soldiers as criminal collaborators who must be tried for treason , and has warned western countries inclined to offer the militiamen refuge that they , too , should expect to treated as enemies by hezbollah in addition , pledges of lenient treatment for defectors that hezbollah held out several years ago have been withdrawn
a long island man found a new way to make real estate deals with no money down , prosecutors in brooklyn said yesterday he stole the properties with the stroke of a pen , they said , transferring the deeds into his own name by forging the rightful owners' signatures he then used the phony deeds to secure more than 900 , 000 in mortgage loans and to sell some of the properties to unwitting buyers for a total of more than 700 , 000 , the authorities said from 1996 to 1998 , prosecutors said the man , kevin walker , 35 , of sayville , ny , was able to steal 11 small houses or apartment buildings in the bedfordstuyvesant and flatbush sections of brooklyn his victims included not only the private lending companies that gave him the mortgages and the title insurance companies that guaranteed the real estate deals , the authorities said , but also the owners who had their properties sold out from under them and the people who eventually bought them nachum greenspan , for example , was surprised to find one day two years ago that his dead mother s home in east flatbush had changed hands we 're very concerned because the house has been sold there are other people living in it now , mr greenspan said yesterday a guy walks up to you and mugs you on the street well , this is a bit more sophisticated but really , it s the same kind of thing mr walker is accused of 23 counts of grand larceny in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in connection with the deals he is being held in 100 , 000 bail and would face 5 to 15 years in prison on each count if convicted , prosecutors said while most of us believe that it is not possible to get something for nothing , mr walker is accused of doing just that , charles j hynes , the brooklyn district attorney , said yesterday at a news conference with nothing more than a few pieces of paper forged deeds he , in fact , turned nothing into 16 million mr hynes called the scheme a simple but extremely effective real estate scam he said that mr walker wrote down the addresses of vacant houses or small apartment buildings , then went to the office of the city register , where he obtained microfilm copies of the pertinent deeds simply by providing the block and lot numbers the deeds contained the names of the rightful owners , the prosecutor said , and mr walker would then execute a new deed , signing as the buyer and forging the owners' signatures as the sellers the scheme worked , mr hynes explained , because in new york state , signatures alone are sufficient to transfer a deed from one party to another in these cases , five of the legitimate owners of the buildings were dead , he said , and the owners of the six remaining properties had no idea their deeds had been switched to mr walker s name investigators were still uncertain how he managed to advertise and sell homes and apartment buildings that he did not legally own the investigators said they did not know what mr walker had done with the 16 million that they said he had made from the deals according to mr hynes , the title companies that guaranteed the sales of the properties are legally bound to reimburse any buyer who purchased a building from mr walker without a change in the law , the district attorney said , there was really no way to prevent such a scheme from occurring again , aside from cracking down on people who did it and got caught other states go to greater lengths to check identification in real estate transfers , he said the experience of mr greenspan , a computer programmer from east flatbush , was typical he discovered what had happened to his mother s home on east 91st street a couple of years ago , he said , after the brick twostory house was gutted by fire in 1996 mr greenspan checked on the home only occasionally as the renovations were slowly being done on a visit about two years ago , he said , he was shocked to see the windows bricked up and a padlock on the door confused , he executed a title search on the property and came up with kevin walker a name he said he did not know then he called the authorities while the district attorney s office was investigating his claim , he said , the house was sold to new owners there was no one at the house last night , but neighbors said that the current owners had bought the place within the year and had diligently worked to clean it up you 're talking about people who came and fixed this house , who helped fix the entire block , said murphy moise , 29 , who has lived on the block for nearly his entire life it s the american dream they worked hard to get this house , and now its like they have to start all over again mr greenspan said his lawyer has been in touch with the current occupants , but he refused to discuss their dealings because he has taken legal action to have the house returned as of yesterday , mr hynes said , none of the original deedholders had gotten their properties back although he added that it would take some time before the buildings were officially returned particularly since in some cases new people had already moved in he promised that his office would do its best to ensure that each of the properties went back to its rightful owner as for mr walker himself , prosecutors said they knew little about him investigators said he had no prior arrests and added that they were still unsure if he had any training in the real estate trade he sometimes operated under the name of a business called communicare , said kevin davitt , a spokesman for the district attorney , but the business had no office or staff , only a telephone number listed in long island he appeared from the mists , mr hynes said mr walker s nextdoor neighbor and landlord in suffolk county , bea koch , said he was a polite and respectful man who had said that he worked as a counselor for troubled youths in bohemia , ny , and apparently had no experience in the realestate business but ms koch said in a telephone interview that she was not surprised that mr walker had run into trouble with the law , or that it involved real estate she said mr walker always offered excuses when it came time to pay the rent first his mother died , then his father died , she said when he first started renting from us , he was bald he said he had cancer but then he started growing hair photo kevin walker
carmen policy was president of the san francisco 49ers from 1991 to 1999 , and during that period the team captured super bowl xxix and never won fewer than 10 games policy was considered a genius by many , able to massage the salary cap without breaking a sweat , and he quickly became one of the highestprofile executives in the sport when his competitors whispered that he was bending the rules , those words were often ignored as jealous ramblings policy is now running the cleveland browns , and depending on whom you believe , either his past has finally caught him or he is enduring one of the worst witch hunts of all time according to team and league officials , the national football league s management council is close to finishing its more than yearlong investigation into whether policy and the 49ers violated salarycap rules with contracts involving the former tight end brent jones and the former quarterbacks steve young and jim druckenmiller the council , according to those people , will most likely conclude that there is sufficient evidence to believe that serious violations did occur during policy s reign , specifically during the 1997 season , when the 49ers reached the national football conference title game in an interview , policy defended his actions in san francisco , insisting he did nothing wrong , and hinting that the accusations , in part , are a result of jealousy from other owners who were constantly beaten by the 49ers under his reign policy compared the investigation of him to that of president clinton by kenneth w starr , the former independent counsel there is a fine line in the nfl between jealousy and focused competitiveness , policy said last week i have tremendous respect for most of the owners in the league , but on sunday , if i lose to them , i do n't like them very much if you take my situation when i was with the 49ers , we won a lot so multiply those feelings i was talking about , and all those victories we had , those playoff wins , the five super bowl appearances , and there is a subconscious delight in watching a competitor get taken down a little bit if the management council which in these cases acts like the prosecution in a criminal trial determines that policy did violate salarycap guidelines , the council will try to negotiate a settlement with policy and others involved if there was no settlement , the case would be turned over to a special master if that person determined policy had violated the rules , it would be up to commissioner paul tagliabue to decide punishment the 49ers might lose a firstround draft pick while policy could be fined or suspended the management council is also investigating dwight clark , who worked in the front office under policy in san francisco and followed him to cleveland , as well as the agents for young and druckenmiller whatever happens , policy seems primed for a long fight the management council has been extremely intrusive , he said the documents they have requested have been numerous there have been a number of witnesses and depositions it has been relentless they 've been more thorough than ken starr was during his days in the sun they want an acceptable conclusion , as do i but i refuse to agree to any settlement that would send the wrong message i do not feel that i personally did anything wrong there is conflicting information as to what kind of discipline if the accusations are proven true tagliabue would be able to levy against policy the nfl believes it could suspend policy , if that was deemed appropriate , under the large umbrella of conduct detrimental to the league however , the collective bargaining agreement says that if a special master rules against policy , the only punishment allowed is a maximum fine of 250 , 000 when asked if he thought things could get nasty between himself and the nfl , policy said i 'll do everything possible to make sure that does not happen but like everything else , if this ever reaches the stage where there is litigation , when you put it in that environment , you do n't have warm and fuzzy feelings the nfl had no comment according to team and league officials , at least one owner has asked highranking nfl officials , including tagliabue , to kick policy out of the league for good still other owners have said that policy should be suspended for at least one year the owners who are saying i should be severely punished are basing those comments on what they hear , not the facts , policy said policy s defenders insist he has never broken the rules , and the reason he is being investigated is that he was so successful his supporters also point out that none of the super bowl years are involved many in the nfl consider salarycap violations to be almost as big a threat to competitive balance as drugs or gambling that is definitely not a stretch if one team can pay players under the table to get around salarycap rules , while all others are abiding by the guidelines , the cheating team can win faster and keep that winning team together longer according to team officials , there are several issues in the 49ers case
last monday morning , county officials gathered on the second floor of the smith county office building in tyler , tex , for a hand recount requested by bill hollowell , a republican who had apparently lost his bid to unseat an incumbent democratic state representative sheriff s deputies were posted outside the door eight democrats and eight republicans broke into four groups at tables set up around the large room , and began to go through the 11 , 121 computer cards one by one by midafternoon , they were finished ten ballots on which voters had depressed but not punched out the paper squares , or chads , had been added to the count , three for mr hollowell and seven for state representative bob glaze there were no disagreements , no partisan bickering over the dimpled chads mr hollowell s defeat was confirmed , as the recounting in the other two counties in the district also showed only slight changes in the race it s very obvious when you see how they have indented it , said doris gunkey , the deputy clerk in charge of elections in smith county common sense just tells you that s the intent of the voter as florida election officials drag through the courts their disputes over what kind of dimples count and what kind do not , the legislature in texas has made it much easier to handle such recounts a texas law enacted in 1993 says that local election officials can count dimpled ballots , provided they reveal the intent of the voter when we started this recount , the secretary of state s office told us we would have to use our own judgment about what the voter meant , said county judge larry craig , who worked with a fellow republican , bill martin , on the recount of votes in mr hollowell s race nationwide , that kind of statutory guidance is rare amid the patchwork of tradition , regulation and common law that governs the counting of votes in california , a card that has not been fully punched can be recorded as a vote only if the chad hangs by a single corner in ohio , where state courts have thrown out dimpled ballots , the secretary of state has directed that chads hanging by either one or two corners be counted as votes washington state lets each county make its own rules and some differ in what they count but texas largely follows the rationale of some of the state courts that have spoken on the issue , like those in massachusetts and illinois that the voter s intent is paramount and can be determined from incompletely punched ballots in its decision on tuesday , the florida supreme court did not directly address the issue of how to count dimpled ballots in the presidential race between vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas in florida , a palm beach county circuit court yesterday ordered the county s election board to consider up to 2 , 000 indented ballots , ruling that the canvassing board can reject dimpled ballots only after seeking to determine the voter s intent in miamidade , county officials had separated out thousands of dimpled ballots when they stopped the recount yesterday texas officials contend that their law , enacted in 1993 before george w bush became governor , sets a tough standard for dimpled chads 'it s a fairly high threshold , said jeff eubank , assistant to secretary of state elton bomer , a bush appointee it has to be an ascertainable or measurable intent of the voter smith county officials had no trouble with that standard mr hollowell , who trailed by 2 , 000 votes on election day , demanded a recount and exercised his statutory right to specify whether he wanted it by hand or by machine , the right given to candidates in a 1997 law signed by governor bush there were no real disagreements on any of them , said judge craig of the dimpled ballots in fact , there were no dimpled ballots that were not counted there were a lot of folks there , judge craig said on every one it was real easy to say , this was the voter s intent judge craig said that even if there was no perforation , the dimpling would leave a gap in the prepunched chads that would allow a tiny bit of light through the main ones we changed were ones you could see the light through , he said another muchcited ruling that used the voterintent standard was made by the massachusetts supreme judicial court in 1996 on election night , it had appeared that philip w johnston , a wealthy environmentalist , had beaten william d delahunt , a lawyer , by 266 votes in a democratic congressional primary the election had taken place in a driving rain , and both candidates asked for recounts in towns where they had expected to receive more votes mr delahunt s lawyer , michael e mone , recalled yesterday that polling officers set up tables to go through all the ballots with representatives from both campaigns , just as the florida counties are doing in some towns , mr mone said , about 90 percent of the ballots were punched completely the rest were put in separate piles for review by local election boards , with most counting the dimpled ones oddly enough , mr mone said , it was pretty clear that someone had tried to vote if i showed you the ballots , i do n't think most people would have a serious dispute about it but in weymouth , mr mone said , the registrar refused to count the dimpled chads , even though a counting machine had registered nearly 1 , 000 of the 4 , 000 votes cast there as blanks mr delahunt sued , arguing that it was unlikely that so many people went out in the rain with the idea of filing blank votes
in cora unashamed the image of dried , brown leaves appears repeatedly to remind viewers that death is in the air , literally and spiritually the music by patrice rushen often controls the emotional calibration these dense atmospherics dominate this adaptation of a langston hughes short story , the first in masterpiece theater s new american collection series , which draws from american literature rather than english or european sometimes it feels as if there is n't enough oxygen for the characters to breathe set in a small town in iowa during the depression , the story follows its heroine cora s conversion from dutiful repression to expressed outrage , when her white employer s smallminded righteousness results in tragedy the scenario is strangely muted on the question of race after raising the issue at the outset in the opening scene , cora has given birth and her mother says ominously , nothing good can come out of white and colored love many sad things do come to pass , but none of them are really related to white and colored love the drama s pivotal act of bigotry is directed at a local greek family , not cora s , which is the only africanamerican family in town cora s brief affair with a white man , which produced the child she adored , has been transformed into treacly flashbacks the screenwriter ann peacock has turned this man , joe , whom hughes described briefly as big and strong and careless as the horses he took care of , smelling like the stable , into a poet the characters are drawn starkly , especially the servant and her boss cora is noble and wise , even when she finally explodes , which does n't give the capable regina taylor much room to maneuver her employer , lizbeth studevant , is selfish , neurotic and obsessed with status but while her characteristics are defined , her character is n't the fine actress cherry jones is left to find new ways to perfect her scowl the master of the house fares better michael gaston is suitably clumsy and vague in the smaller role of arthur studevant , a man who is cowed by his wife but still seems to love her , for reasons that are n't obvious he seems weak but decent , a man inclined to do the right thing , unless doing so will cause discomfort he compliments cora s biscuits , which his wife pronounces too salty when sorrow strikes the housekeeper , he offers genuine words of comfort without having to think about it , while mrs studevant s attempt at compassion remains stymied after much thought yet he hesitates to contradict her , preferring to look the other way , even when he knows her actions are twisted cora captures the strain in this stuffy household , dominated by a woman accustomed to having her orders obeyed without question given the time and place , and the prevailing social order , it does n't occur to cora to object , until mrs studevant s wrongheaded sense of propriety becomes disastrous to her own family presented as a drama of female suffering , strength and intolerance , cora is often moving and has some strong scenes but too frequently the slender narrative succumbs to pretty pictures cast in meaningful light , which soften and sentimentalize the blunt social commentary of hughes s short but incisive story masterpiece theater s american collection cora unashamed pbs , tonight \( channel 13 , new york , at 9 \) adapted by ann peacock from the langston hughes short story the ways of white folks deborah m pratt , director music by patrice rushen marian rees , anne hopkins and and stephen kulczycki , executive producers for alt films ron colby , coproducer rebecca eaton , series executive producer produced by alt films and wgbh boston with regina taylor \( cora jenkins \) , cherry jones \( lizbeth studevant \) , michael gaston \( arthur studevant \) , c c h pounder \( ma jenkins \) and molly graham \( jessie studevant \)
safe area gorazde by joe sacco illustrated 227 pp seattle fantagraphics books 2895 who would have imagined that the best dramatic evocation of the bosnian catastrophe would turn out to be a booklength comic strip written by an american of maltese origin who arrived in the balkans only in late 1995 , after the shooting had largely stopped , and stayed just four weeks \? and yet joe sacco , a cartoonist whose previous work includes treatments of the arabisraeli conflict and the punk rock scene in the united states , has produced a work that improbably manages to combine rare insight into what the war in bosnia felt like on the ground with a mature and nuanced political and historical understanding of the conflict to page through safe area gorazde , at least for anyone who spent time in bosnia during the war , is to experience an almost unsettling jolt of recognition sacco s bosnia is the one that those of us who covered the fighting actually experienced day by day , rather than the one we mostly reported on high politics , the shuttling of international negotiators , the united nations' empty promises , the movement of front lines , are so much background noise in sacco s book , just as they largely were for ordinary bosnians over the course of the four years of fighting sacco s aim is to evoke a very different and far more visceral reality what concerns sacco is how ordinary bosnians were affected by the conflict to that end , he traveled to gorazde , the only bosniangovernmentcontrolled area in the eastern part of the country to survive once there , he simply listened to what the inhabitants of the enclave told him of course , none of what he reports is new the plight of the eastern enclaves gorazde , cerska , zepa and srebrenica figured hugely in the reporting of such brilliant correspondents as roy gutman , john burns , allen little , christiane amanpour and roger cohen but , of necessity , the evocation of what life was like had to appear in their reporting principally as backdrop , as color in book form , only chuck sudetic s incomparable blood and vengeance , with its painstaking , microcosmic focus on doomed srebrenica , manages to keep the human dimension in the foreground but sudetic s book was above all an effort by one of the war s most knowledgeable reporters to explain the bosnian tragedy through the fate of the eastern enclaves sacco s goal is more to evoke reality in its lived details to be sure , on one level safe area gorazde seems like a familiar combination of reportage and firstperson narrative of a trip to a war zone \( though one of exceptional distinction with , moreover , the novelty of being in the form of a comic book \) but sacco s book not only has dramatic force more crucially , it has the emblematic quality of a good historical or political novel and in some ways , at least in sacco s hands , the comic book form reveals itself to have advantages that neither novels nor nonfiction prose can command there is a cinematic immediacy here sacco s technique is to let his characters talk and talk , sometimes about the most trivial things yet he does this without boring us or losing the thread of his narrative this is no mean achievement in theory , safe area gorazde should be boring , since so much of sacco s story concerns not the tales of siege , death and privation but the common joys and miseries of everyday life in the enclave sacco does not shy away from the serbian massacres of muslims at the beginning of the war , or of the accounts he heard from survivors of the systematic rapes , let alone from the terrifying reality of life under siege to the contrary , he portrays them at great and painful length in an eloquent series of images that at times is very hard to look at but sacco also insists on showing his characters in their mundane complexity he never loses sight of the fact that the people he got to know in gorazde were not just victims or heroes \( though clearly to him they were both of those things as well \) but ordinary people for whom the war was scary and horrible and also a complete waste of time in the last image of the book , sacco draws edin , a math teacher who became his host and fixer in gorazde , talking about how , now that the war was over , the last thing he wanted to do was take a break he was in his late 20 s , sacco reports , and looking back on a hole in his life almost four years long this was no time for a break he wanted to get on with things but close as sacco clearly became to edin , the fixer s is only one of many voices in the book sacco gives them all their turns , and in doing so , succeeds brilliantly in bringing to life the cacophonous , tragicomic reality of wartime bosnia at once gallant , cloying and engaging in the book , there are all sorts those who have been broken by the war and those upon whom , strangely , it seems to have made little impression those who want to get out of gorazde as soon as possible and never look back and those for whom leaving would be psychologically inconceivable all of these sacco draws with fine impartiality he includes himself as a character but , appropriately enough , assigns himself a decidedly secondary role still , from time to time sacco does let his emotions out describing a party he attended during his first visit to gorazde , sacco writes ok , ok , maybe this shindig does n't sound like much , just a bunch of drinks and decibels in the balkans but our new pals , they partied like the resurrected not like there was no tomorrow , but because there was a tomorrow i know of no better way of describing how bosnia felt in the immediate aftermath of the war none of the disappointments of the postwar period can quell the grateful sense , known to everyone who lived through the conflict , of how miraculous it is that places like gorazde and sarajevo survived at all this sacco captures as no foreigner has captured it before putting a name on what sacco does as an artist and a writer is difficult his drawing style , broadly reminiscent of the work of r crumb and the other head comics artists of northern california in the 1960 s , seems almost defiantly ugly at least as sacco draws them , no one in gorazde , least of all sacco himself , is anything but homely or worse as a result , there is intelligence but no eros in the book presumably , this was the effect sacco wanted to achieve in his introduction , christopher hitchens rightly calls sacco a moral draftsman , which is as close an approximation of his enterprise and of the hybrid form he is helping to pioneer as anyone is likely to come up with does a moral draftsman have to forswear the beautiful in order to get the truth \? sacco appears to think so he may be wrong , but of the myriad books that have appeared about bosnia , few have told the truth more bravely than sacco s he is an immense talent , from whom we will hear a great deal more drawing
crotononhudson , ny , aug 23 as helicopters and rescue boats searched the hudson river for two teenage boys from a state psychiatric center who were swept away tuesday , investigators said today that a counselor who had been warned to keep them out of the water had led them down a steep , treacherous path to the river s edge there , at a rocky outcropping where the hudson and croton rivers converge a spot that local people said had been the site of many drownings over the years three of the six teenagers in the counselor s care suddenly leapt fully dressed into the treacherous crosscurrents , the police said one boy managed to fight his way to shore right away , and the counselor , lenox gabriel , who had yelled for the boys to get out and then jumped in after them , was rescued by police officers but as of late today , the two other boys , arimendi lajara , 15 , and cedric florence , 17 , had still not been found mr gabriel told the police that they appeared to swim away from shore dozens of their relatives , some who came from as far away as florida , gathered at the desolate site waiting for news the westchester county police said the boys' survival seemed unlikely the police said the incident , in croton point park , was being treated as an accident , although they wanted to speak again with mr gabriel , 47 , who was listed in stable condition tonight at phelps memorial hospital center in sleepy hollow officials there said he would not comment at this point they are not anticipating any criminal charges , sgt donald f mcarthur said of detectives investigating the case he said the detectives were interviewing the four other boys from the brooklyn children s psychiatric center , as well as three other counselors who were supervising them on the threeday trip it is not clear , sergeant mcarthur said , where the other counselors were when the boys jumped into the river he said mr gabriel told investigators that he was the only adult with the six children at the time one of the counselors called the park headquarters to report the emergency , and two police officers who had been in the park jumped in to rescue mr gabriel the state office of mental health , which operates the brooklyn psychiatric center and the group home on its grounds where the boys are temporarily living , is also investigating the incident , said roger klingman , a spokesman for the office but those investigators had not yet interviewed mr gabriel and had drawn no conclusions , mr klingman said we are still piecing this together mr gabriel told a detective late tuesday that he had walked the boys down the nearvertical hill called teller s point at the southernmost tip of the park to take them on a hike , not to go swimming , the police said the pathway is marked by rocks and tree roots that can be used as footholds it is thickly wooded and takes great skill to navigate no swimming signs are posted by the water , officials said , but the police said they were often removed by vandals none were visible today the counselors asked park officials if swimming was allowed , sergeant mcarthur said , and were told twice at checkin on monday and earlier tuesday that the water was off limits for bathing walking on the cliff , however , is not prohibited anglers typically climb down to get a good fishing spot , he said today , helicopters buzzed overhead and a phalanx of boats scoured the violent waterway , until their blinking emergency lights were barely discernible through the gathering mist fog and rain shrouded the big state prison at ossining , to the east , the palisades cliffs to the west and the tappan zee bridge to the south , landmarks that frame the triangularshaped search area , 35 miles north of new york city but with each passing hour , the prospect of a rescue looked less promising this is not a place for them , said denise peralta , 20 , the cousin of arimendi lajara she descended the cliff and peered into the onefoot swells to see the place where arimendi vanished she shook her head and said , he ca n't be alive and then she began asking questions how did the boys come to this spot \? why did they go into the water \? why was no permission sought for such a hike beforehand \? who was supervising \? carlise florence , the mother of cedric florence , also walked to the river s edge with relatives , and posed her own questions , specifically about the decision to bring such children to so remote and rugged a place as croton point park she said she asked mr gabriel on sunday not to allow her son on the trip because he did not want to go think of supervision , said maurice patterson , cedric s stepfather there were four counselors here and there were six children so that is enough to have two children to one counselor each and to have one counselor left over how in the world did the counselor bring these children over there to the cliff , and how did they get down that cliff , to get in the water \? they were not supervised mr klingman , of the state office of mental health , said the matter of proper supervision is a question we need to address in our investigation but he would not speculate on whether any disciplinary action would be taken the six boys on the outing are residents of an outpatient group home on the grounds of the psychiatric center , in bedfordstuvesant the fiveyearold home is a shortterm or transitional center for emotionally troubled teenagers who require roundtheclock supervision rather than hospitalization , mr klingman said the children sometimes go home on weekends , and arimendi had been at a family barbecue sunday all of the counselors , who are state employees , must undergo background checks , he said mr gabriel had been the manager of the residence for a little more than a year , and before that he was the manager of a nonprofit community residence , mr klingman said cedric , one of the missing boys , has dreams of becoming a united states marine , his mother said the other boy , arimendi , known as ari , enjoys playing basketball , handball and drawing pokeman or spiderman cartoons with colored pencils he wants to become an artist , his brother forito , 12 , said cedric had been in the brooklyn group home for eight months and was due to return home sept 8 , ms florence said arimendi was in the home for about four months and was also set to come home soon by all accounts , both were doing well in the program mr klingman said that he was not sure whether the brooklyn home had made past trips to croton point park , but that other group homes run by his agency had visited the park he said such outings were therapeutic for children , to involve them in normalizing activities teller s point , though , is anything but normal , said two local volunteer firefighters , stephen dominello , 34 , and john o'brien , 36 , who monitored the search from the shore and told how they had recovered past victims from the waters , known as crawbucky bay it does n't give you a second chance , said mr o'brien , a diver who recovered the body of a 10yearold boy from the same area in july 1995 it 'll take you in a cabin where some of the boys had been staying , the two families hugged one another , cried , smoked cigarettes , paced and waited the sound of the river lapping at the shore echoed through the cabin photo the spot in croton point park where two boys hiked down to the edge of the hudson \( bernie nunez for the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) map of new york showing location of croton park point croton point park is near waters that often claim swimmers \( pg b4 \)
washington , dec 26 it is easy to forget how beleaguered the democratic party was at the dawn of the 1990 s a generation had come of age with only the dimmest of memories of a successful democratic presidential campaign the extraordinary popularity of reaganism had shaken liberals to their cores , and three straight republican victories , two of them landslides , led many analysts to conclude that the republicans had a lock on the white house many democratic party gatherings were like irish wakes , filled with mournful , longing tributes to dead heroes and despair about how to move on if his critics and his defenders agree on one thing , it is this bill clinton transformed that political world whatever the cost and some in his party s left say it was too high mr clinton restored the democrats' national stature just winning two times in a row for the first time in a long time was a huge achievement , said representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the democratic leader of the house we had n't had a president since roosevelt who had done it , and a lot of us had begun to wonder whether it would ever happen again first as candidate , then as president , bill clinton dealt , one by one , with the democratic vulnerabilities , perceptions of the party that had become easy targets for republicans from 1968 on that the democrats were soft on crime that they were big taxers and spenders , addicted to giveaway programs that they were achingly sensitive to the needs of minorities and the poor but cared little for the problems of the white middle class that they were more interested in redistributing wealth than in fostering economic growth this year s election showed that many of these vulnerabilities remain , just below the surface republicans portrayed vice president al gore repeatedly and effectively as a champion of big government and new spending programs they also pointedly promised a new moral tone in the white house but much of the postelection analysis has explained mr gore s defeat by pointing to the flaws in his campaign rather than deeper flaws in the democratic party , particularly since gov george w bush s victory was so narrow al from , president of the democratic leadership council , which mr clinton once chaired and used as a launching pad for his presidential campaign , argued that mr clinton s democratic party should be measured by the distance traveled rather than the shortcomings of the last campaign do n't forget where we were , mr from said we 'd lost 40 states in three straight elections if clinton pulled us to parity in an election where we ran what a lot of people thought was not a stellar campaign , that is some progress stan greenberg , who was mr clinton s first presidential pollster and who worked for mr gore this fall , said of mr clinton he has created the possibility of a democratic majority but it s not a democratic ascendancy critics scoffed throughout the 1990 s that mr clinton s new democratic party was all about tactics , but inside the white house , the party s new mission was seen as something grander michael waldman , the president s former speechwriter , remembered that mr clinton declared one night in 1998 , while they were working on the state of the union address roosevelt saved capitalism from itself our mission is to save government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive force' mr waldman added , we came to believe that the public would be willing to back activist government , but first they had to believe that government had been brought under control what mr clinton called the third way , the political path between left and right , was not an easy journey for democrats even some of his closest aides say they cringed when he declared in 1996 that the era of big government is over james carville , a longtime clinton strategist , said he was furious about parts of the welfare overhaul that mr clinton signed into law congressional democrats were often enraged at his willingness to strike deals with republicans , especially in the difficult middle years of his administration , after the republicans took control of the congress the question , for different democrats at different times , was whether the careful repositioning at the heart of clintonism ceded too much to the right , reacted too much to the polls and endangered the party s soul but by and large , the party followed his march to the center we are now advocating , almost to a person , that we have to grow the economy first and balance the budget and be fiscally responsible , said senator bob kerrey , democrat of nebraska , often a clinton critic that does n't mean you ca n't be progressive or even liberal , mr kerrey said , but you 've got to give the public economic growth and safety on the street and a defense that s credible i think clinton has done that i think the party is back to being a party of the middle class mr from offered an even more generous view of mr clinton s accomplishments
paterson the sevenacre tract of land along the passaic river , with the ruins of an old brick factory and weatherworn timbers lying amid the knots of scrubby vegetation , does not look much like hallowed ground but it is in one of the state s most significant historic districts , and it is at the center of a dispute between the city and a group of preservationists that recently brought a suit against the planning board and a developer over how best to develop the land the site , stretching along a halfmile of riverfront here in the state s thirdlargest city , has been in disrepair for more than a decade , the target of vandals for five years the city has been negotiating with the state and federal government to build 114 units of moderately priced housing but the preservation group , paterson friends of the great falls inc contending that the city has improperly approved a project that deviates from its redevelopment plan in terms of size and density insists something more befitting the cradle of american industry should be erected as legend has it , alexander hamilton saw the nearby great falls of the passaic and envisioned a national manufactury with that , paterson was born as the oldest planned industrial city , and industries sprouted along the river , powered by the falls among them was allied textile printing corp which gives the sevenacre tract its name , the atp site nobody disputes the fact that it s in a ruinous state , and nobody disputes the fact that it needs to be revitalized , said david soo , a member of paterson friends and one of those who brought the suit we believe that this project could be anywhere in paterson , mr soo said one recent morning as he toured the site , bounded by the passaic river and van houten street in the great falls historic district and this singular , unique place offers an opportunity for economic development unlike anyplace else in the city or the state but mayor martin g barnes , who inherited the project from his predecessor , disagreed with mr soo is it the best possible development for that site \? mayor barnes said probably not but it s the best that we have interviewed at city hall , mayor barnes described the housing situation in paterson as bleak much of the housing stock is more than 100 years old , he said , while immigrants from central and south america and middle eastern countries continue to flood into the city indeed , officials here say the current census will show paterson s population has grown to more than 170 , 000 , up from 140 , 900 in 1990 there are more than 3 , 000 vacant lots available for housing construction , but they are mostly small and scattered , planning and development officials say this gives me some muchneeded affordable housing , mayor barnes said of the atp plan it gives me some ratables it s the only sevenacre site i 've got in the city and it gets us to build up the downtown area because what we 're trying to do is bring a community into downtown our downtown closes at 6 o'clock at night under the first phase of the project , which will cost about 14 million , the developer , regan development corporation of yonkers , plans to put up 57 twofamily houses of three and four stories as well as a cafe and public river walk , according to the developer and redevelopment officials the second phase , which will cost about 8 million , involves rehabilitating three old mills on van houten street behind the first site to create 15 , 000 square feet of commercial space and 51 apartments part of second phase would also involve rehabilitation of the former colt gun works also in disrepair on the atp site where samuel colt perfected his revolver the first phase was approved by the planning board here last july after it directed the developer to cut back on the number of twofamily houses to 57 from 64 to provide some open space it formalized the approval in february but mr soo and others said there was nothing binding regan development to complete the second phase , a concern that the city disputed the paterson friends of the great falls , a group of about 50 residents and preservationists that was formed with the help of the sierra club , brought suit last month in state superior court in paterson seeking to revoke the planning board s approval nothing in the city s redevelopment plan allows what is proposed to be built here , said bruce d greenberg , a newark lawyer who brought the suit the most significant deviations were the density of this development , the number of homes , the height of the buildings and what they call the floor area ratio the amount of the site that s covered by construction the suit contends that the planning board did not have the authority to approve these exceptions none of that is true , mayor barnes said of these arguments you know , this is a real frivolous claim the suit also claims a deputy mayor who sits on the board should have abstained from voting because mayor barnes was an outspoken supporter of the plan but underlying the specifics of the complaints is the feeling it is not compatible with the historic character of the site jeffery jones , a councilman who represents the historic district , said the city had wrongly settled for what was convenient if any project comes before me , it s got to have more than just 'it s better than what was there , ' mr jones said anything s better than what s there , provided it gives you a lot more than what you have jeff tittell , executive director of the new jersey chapter of the sierra club , said because of the new state development plan and urban revitalization that s sweeping the country , the atp tract is probably the most historically important site in new jersey mr tittell said , it has a great opportunity to be the catalyst for revitalizing this whole historic district and bringing the types of facilities that are going to enhance the city and really make it a better place for all types of other redevelopment and instead of that , he added , they 're just going to be putting in vinylsided modular housing larry regan , the president of regan development , took exception to that characterization there is no vinyl on this project , mr regan said in a telephone interview , he said the buildings will be three and four stories the fronts and the sides will be 100 percent brick and the rear will be wood clapboard mr regan , who said the project would bring the city 500 , 000 in ratables the first year , added that his company had been committed to paterson for more than 20 years , having built 145 units of artists' housing in the rehabilitation of two historic factories in the 1980 s this is our business , mr regan said we do historic redevelopment and we 're in it for the long haul what especially troubles critics like mr soo , who lives in one of the artists' houses closest to the atp site , is that the city never sought requests for proposals from other developers for other uses like a museum , conference center and other cultural or commercial activities francis blesso , a former redevelopment director for the city , said that there seemed to be no interest when the city took the site over for taxes in the early 1990 s allied textile printing had closed up shop in the 1970 s a developer had failed to get financing for a mixeduse project at the site in the mid1980 s , and the site fell into further disrepair we were going to do a market analysis and go out and solicit proposals , mr blesso said in the meantime , we had been talking to people about different ideas , but nobody stepped forward photos as legend has it , alexander hamilton saw the nearby great falls of the passaic river , above , and envisioned a national manufactury with that , paterson was born as the oldest planned industrial city , and such industries as colt gun works , where samuel colt perfected his revolver , left , powered by the falls , sprouted along the river \( photographs by dith pran the new york times \)
atlanta it happened overnight , literally one moment the titans and the rams were running around separate stadiums , celebrating their trips to the super bowl the next moment they were here in icy , snowy , slippery atlanta now this is the way to run a super bowl get the show on the road do n't sip too much of that stuff , boys we 've got a game less is most definitely more no yawning week between the conference title games and super bowl week just get it on this is only the fifth time the national football league has run its super bowl the week after the conference games there does not appear to be a master plan , but this should only be a habit the hurryup offense is happening this season because the league did not want to hold playoff games on saturday , jan 1 , what with all the bowl games none of them relevant anymore , but that s another story so they pushed back the 17week season , cut out the interim week , and here we are , almost ready to rumble is there any advantage to playing the game with one week or two weeks in between \? when in doubt , go to an expert one expert would be jim kelly , the quarterback of the buffalo bills back in their four straight super bowl years , who was in town yesterday to work on the program nfl countdown on espn we tried it both ways and it turned out the same , kelly said with a smile , not needing to footnote that the bills lost all four super bowls from 1991 through 1994 in the first super bowl , the bills lost to the giants without the extra week of coaches burrowing molelike in their dismal film rooms in the second and third super bowls , the bills had two weeks to prepare the fourth time , they had only one week , and they lost to the cowboys there are pluses and minuses , kelly said the extra week is good for taking care of all the details do n't underestimate details the players like to bring family and friends , and sometimes the offweek is spent allocating the tickets and arranging hotels and travel by the end of the offweek , a player could have a real nice family feud going marv always prepared us the week before for that , kelly said of his former coach , marv levy it was never a problem actually , all four teams in the two conference games were advised about super bowl details last week this struck coach dick vermeil of the rams as being a trifle sad i was thinking of all four teams going through this meeting , and only two of them would get to go , said vermeil , who , admittedly , does have a lachrymose side as it turned out , vermeil s team did not waste its logistics session but there is another factor that no amount of preparation can fix if you have injured players , you can use the extra week off , kelly added we usually played five preseason games plus two or three playoff games , so the week off was a plus for us the bills were an experienced team even by their first super bowl appearance after the 1990 season they were reaching the level that had been predicted for them kelly thinks this year s teams are in a somewhat different position some teams are on a roll , and you do n't want that week off , kelly said momentum s on your side you just want to play that would certainly fit the rams and the titans , both relocated franchises that suddenly found themselves this season the titans were not your normal 97 wildcard clunker , but rather a very good team that won 13 of 16 games this season they had the burden of coming through the wildcard round , an extra layer of bruises and fatigue , but they have now rambled through three playoff games on talent and energy the rams proved themselves in a grueling 116 victory over tampa bay on sunday they knew they could sling the ball now they know they can win a grim defensive battle , too with all the nervous energy coursing around in them , the rams and titans might be well off playing in piedmont park today , even with the broken tree limbs all over the city that wo n't happen , of course there is too much at stake the entire world is primed to pause on sunday evening for probably four hours of commercials interspersed with the odd snippet of football action the nfl has done the right thing no time to build up for the normal inertia , the normal super bowl reaction of , that s it \? it is already tuesday the super bowl is only five days off where did the time go \?
bentonville , ark , nov 6 nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a fresh start after a season of cynicism , gov george w bush ended his quest for the presidency today on a nearly identical note , pledging to purge washington of what he characterized as a crippling discord the course mr bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail , plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic , left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere the texas governor s first major rally was in tennessee and his last before heading home late tonight was here in arkansas , the states that gave political birth to vice president al gore and president bill clinton mr bush s words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country s best hope for bridging ideological divides , healing partisan wounds and making sure americans could gaze upon the white house with unfettered respect it s time for new leadership in washington , dc , mr bush told the crowd here late tonight in bentonville , a republican stronghold with its own significance it lies in the district where a young bill clinton once ran a failed campaign for congress , and it is now represented by asa hutchinson , one of the house republicans who presided over mr clinton s impeachment indeed , mr clinton was the person mr bush seemed to have in mind as he told a cheering crowd of thousands , the next leader of the united states must understand the awesome responsibilities of the office just before mr bush began and just after he ended his remarks on a stage inside a local airport hangar , his campaign played a new tape of music it featured snippets of the fleetwood mac song do n't stop \( thinking about tomorrow \) , which mr clinton used as the theme for his 1992 campaign , followed by the who song wo n't get fooled again almost 12 hours earlier , in chattanooga , tenn , mr bush told supporters there was a better day ahead if the country chose to elect someone who would elevate the people s business above everyday politics supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision one more day ! they roared what the nation needed , mr bush told them , was a president who can unite this nation , a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation s capital , a president who puts the people first , a president who lifts this nation s spirits i 'll be that president , he added , a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction it underscored the optimism that mr bush had , from the very beginning , sought to project to voters his schedule for a 16hour day was also an expression of that between stops in tennessee and arkansas , his plane touched down in wisconsin and iowa , and while any one of those four states could provide the key to a bush victory , none has as many electoral votes as battlegrounds like michigan and pennsylvania but the states are genuine tossups that were initially expected to be much more hospitable to mr gore by visiting them today , mr bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president he did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory with 24 hours before election day , mr bush stripped campaigning to its essence coaxing and cajoling , pleading and persuading i want you to understand that i ca n't win without you , mr bush told a crowd of about 1 , 000 in green bay , wis i hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls minutes later , he added when you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done , and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the american people , i believe it does n't matter what political party they 're in they 're going to come our way at a theater in davenport , iowa , he took a similarly blunt tack not only do i want your vote , mr bush said , i want your help i hope you continue to man those phones , and for those of you who are calling on my behalf , thanks from the bottom of my heart do n't let up , he said it s a close election mr bush repeatedly needled mr gore , which was much of the point of going to tennessee , where mr gore is not at all certain to prevail the texas governor used the location to claim that mr gore s decades of experience in washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending my opponent vows to carry his home state , mr bush said from a stage at a chattanooga airport he may win washington , dc , but he s not going to win tennessee he forgot his roots , he said he trusts washington we trust the people here in bentonville , mr bush was jubilant , clearly reveling in the way his appearance , and the choreography of it , tweaked mr clinton but at the rallies in chattanooga and green bay , mr bush had come across as slightly less ebullient than usual he seemed serene , his demeanor in keeping with the events , which were less crowded and shorter on gaudy pageantry and eyepopping fireworks than previous rallies maybe mr bush was after an aura of simple earnestness maybe he understood that there was only so much a candidate could do at this late stage or maybe he had sacrificed some of his energy to the hundreds of thousands of miles that it took to get to this point his hair was grayer than when he started but his message , an answer to the challenge of campaigning against an incumbent administration during peace and prosperity , was mostly unchanged mr bush was careful to dwell on positions with appeal in the places he visited in both iowa and wisconsin , where agriculture is an important part of the economy , he called for an end to the inheritance tax , which farmers find especially onerous mr bush referred to it as the death tax , although he slipped in wisconsin and labeled it the death penalty falling prey to scattered flubs , he also said in iowa that cashstrapped elderly people should not be forced to choose between prescription drugs and medicine , meaning prescription drugs and food but what stood out today were broad themes and emotions , and he wrapped his events and himself in patriotic colors there was no balloon drop or confetti in davenport , but there was a giant american flag behind mr bush his outfit was red \( tie \) , white \( shirt \) and blue \( suit \) the greatness of the country lies ahead , he told the people in chattanooga i strongly believe that this nation can accomplish anything anything we set our mind to photo i want you to understand that i ca n't win without you , gov george w bush told supporters in green bay , wis , on the last day of campaigning \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg a22 \)
going to the movies used to be no big deal for kids many of us would see films the way we read books because it never occurred to us not to i remember walking , every saturday , to the rko or the loew s on east 86th street there 'd be a double bill , and no one was too particular about what was playing or what time it started this is where i came in still had meaning then , and often it was n't until the movie ended and began again that you learned what the title was my friends and i saw every single movie that was made for us , and many that were n't and later , we also occasionally sat upstairs in the balcony and necked and sneaked cigarettes , but that s another story or perhaps not nowadays in these much more salubrious , enlightened days of ratings and 5 popcorn and clean , nosmoking , notalking theaters when people take their children to the movies , what do they want to get out of it \? perhaps it just happens to be the shape that an american family outing takes , especially when the weather is n't fabulous judging by the amount of complaining and the lack of specificity , it seems that many people know only what they do n't want they do n't want to be left flat they want to have fun with their kids that s all , really , that people demand of the movies for their families they want to be happy how was it \? was it violent \? was it scary \? you 'll hear one adult say to another and they 're talking about stuart little surely , there must be a correlation between the huge number of new books on parenting and the extraordinary concern about socalled family movies worried parents have taken to wandering in a maze of intricacies of what is and is n't appropriate appropriate language appropriate amount of violence , sex , fear , diversity appropriate amount of stimulation and lack thereof appropriate amount of play of the imagination appropriate amount of good and bad news about life well , then , parents of small and midsize children had better strap themselves in getting ready to zoom , glide , slide , swat , trundle and chugachuga onto their neighborhood screens this summer is a particularly vexing collection of movies , buttressed by colossal ad campaigns , marketing deals , tieins , linkups , crossover and franchising strategies why vexing \?

insisted the journalist the others laughed no , said ms marsden at least none is planned so there was no intention to hedge the bet here was there that much faith in the movie \? family pictures have completely changed in the last 10 years , said brian levant , the director of both flintstone movies the flintstones in viva rock vegas , which opened april 28 , was shot , with the help of some 4 , 500 extras , on the biggest set since cecil b demille s ten commandments it was built or , rather , flintstonized from scratch in preproduction for close to a year , it employed a crew of 1 , 000 you get to create the whole world , said mr levant , a civilization those things that made 'the wizard of oz' such an incredible voyage visually we can do very easily now so many films being made now tax the imagination of both the filmmaker and the audience there are no stories that cannot be told there are no stories that ca n't be told what does that mean for our children \?

trenton running for office as a socialist is the ultimate exercise in egalitarianism , so greg pason , the socialist party usa s candidate for u s senate seat from new jersey , has no complaints about shuttling around the campaign trail aboard new jersey transit trains mr pason does n't bemoan the fact that his job as the party s national secretary pays 12 an hour \( the same figure as the party s proposed minimum wage \) or that his budget for the primary was a paltry 1 , 370 but mr pason is a bit bewildered that with election day just seven weeks away , the candidate who many voters think of when they hear the word socialist is jon corzine , the democratic candidate who is a former wall street chief executive worth 400 million in mr pason s past campaigns , his party s platform \( based more on western european social democracies than on marxism or leninism \) made it simple to distinguish himself from his mainstream opponents health care \? mr pason proposed a governmentfinanced medical program for everyone education \? preschool \? free , from cradle to grave with mr corzine running , mr pason suddenly finds himself with formidable competition in the race to propose expansive social spending mr corzine has called for the government to provide universal preschool , free college tuition for any student with a b average or better and universal health care \( although he later revised that promise to universal access at health care \) during the democratic primary , former gov jim florio branded mr corzine a bearded socialist the republican senate nominee , bob franks , calls mr corzine s ideas radical and extreme but stops short of invoking karl marx in case anyone misses the implication , chuck haytaian , chairman of the state republican party , describes mr corzine s platform as evidence of a socialistic mentality while some of those comments were intended , at least partly , as barbed humor , mr pason is n't amused jon corzine s using our language , calling for universal this and universal that , but he s really advocating more corporate welfare than anything else , mr pason said i mean , what is universal access to health care \? anyone can walk into an emergency room the trouble is , thousands of people have no way to pay for the massive bills they 'll face once they walk out despite the fact that new jersey has fared incredibly well during the current wall street boom , mr pason believes his call for economic populism will resonate , especially on the issue of regulating health insurance companies but it will be difficult for mr pason to get his message out because mr corzine has a gargantuan advantage in the ultimate capitalist tool campaign money mr corzine spent 35 million in the primary , and is paying 12 million a week for television advertising mr pason s campaign operation is somewhat more modest i hand out a lot of leaflets and talk to a lot of people on street corners , he said if mr pason s task sounds overwhelming , the odds are even more daunting for nancy rosenstock , the other socialist in the race ms rosenstock is running as the standard bearer for the socialist workers' party , which holds cuba as its model of an enlightened government she does not plan to file a report with the federal election commission because her campaign will be run on less than 1 , 000 ms rosenstock acknowledges that her time on the trail has been limited by the demands of her job as a sewing machine operator in a garment factory , but she was stunned to hear her party s good name was being sullied by its association with a man as far removed from the means of production as mr corzine i 've never heard that , she said , howling with laughter he s a millionaire , a hundred millionaire that automatically disqualifies him i can tell you that it s not the socialists calling him that it must be the conservative republicans to mr corzine , who hopes to appeal to the moderates who dominate new jersey politics , such talk is encouraging despite the banquet of social spending mr corzine proposes , he rejects the true socialists' calls to slash the military budget and impose steep tax rates from 70 to 100 percent for anyone who earns more than 200 , 000 a year in fact , the only major issue on which mr corzine is to the left of the socialists is gun control he favors strict laws to curb the sale and possession of handguns , including licensing and registration firearms mr pason said it was none of the government s business ms rosenstock , who believes that real change will not occur until there are uprisings like the civil rights movement , says ominously that the government has no right to disarm the people while it is unlikely that mr corzine will ever meet with the two cardcarrying socialist candidates to publicly compare their platforms , he and mr pason did have a chance encounter recently as both candidates worked the same crowd at a public event on labor day when i introduced myself and told him i was running as a socialist , mr pason said , he told me , 'that s funny some people say that i'm , a socialist' so i told him that if he 'd invite me to the debate , i 'd show the world what a real socialist is , and make him look moderate four days later , mr corzine finally ended weeks of delays and agreed to a series of three debates with mr franks , but mr pason and ms rosenstock were not invited it s enough to make any selfrespecting socialist shave his beard in protest photo david kocieniewski
the suffolk county district attorney announced yesterday that he would review the cases of prisoners who might be cleared by dna evidence , speeding up a state effort to use new technology to investigate criminal convictions that have been called into question suffolk , which would pay for any dna testing , is believed to be the first county in the state to create such a program the state passed a law in 1996 allowing dna evidence to be considered after a conviction district attorney james m catterson said yesterday that he would review cases involving inmates in state prisons who have asserted they were wrongfully convicted of crimes in suffolk county before 1996 there are 734 people in prison who were convicted before 1996 , but mr catterson said he did not expect his review to flood the courts with cases a similar program in san diego did not result in any overturned convictions , he said similar programs are operating in austin , tex , and orange county , calif mr catterson said his program was intended to accelerate the process of clearing prisoners who were wrongly convicted there are so many defendants sitting in jail that have been claiming innocence and who do not take advantage of it one way or other , he said , and i could sit back and wait for them to make their motions , but here s a process where once and for all we can clear up the backlog new york and illinois were the first states to pass laws allowing for the review of dna evidence after a conviction , and dozens of other states are in the process of passing such laws , legal experts said in the four years since new york s law was established , only half a dozen prisoners have applied through suffolk county to be tested in the state program , mr catterson said , and none were exonerated before 1996 , dna evidence resulted in overturning the convictions of two men in suffolk county kerry kotler , who was imprisoned on rape charges , and leonard callace , who had been convicted of sodomy christopher asplen , executive director of the national commission on the future of dna evidence , under the united states department of justice , praised the suffolk program it is certainly a visionary approach to this kind of application of the technology , he said it is not something that will overwhelm the system , and i think ultimately it will create a greater confidence in the criminal justice system
the dotcom mania has not died phonecom and softwarecom , two relatively small , moneylosing software companies , announced they were merging yesterday , and investors responded by adding 26 billion to their combined market values the com suffix in both companies' names , moreover , is somewhat misleading , as neither does business through its web site softwarecom sells software that internet service providers , like att worldnet , use to operate their electronic mail systems phonecom has developed a tiny browser program that allows wireless telephones to view specially formatted internet sites the browser is free , but phonecom makes money selling software used by purveyors of sites meant for the wireless phones the californiabased companies have no overlapping products , and the main thing that they have in common is that they both sell their products primarily to telephone companies in the future , however , the companies were primed to become more direct competitors they were both developing products allowing telephone companies to offer unified messaging services , in which voice messages , faxes , electronic mail and so on are all collected into a single place and then distributed to the device of the user s choice , be it a computer , a telephone or a wireless gadget this opportunity appeared to be compelling enough to donald j listwin , a softwarecom board member who was , until tuesday , also an executive vice president of cisco systems , that he proposed that he run the combined company last week amid the final negotiations between phonecom and softwarecom i approached folks and said you may need help pulling off a complex merger and how do you feel about my joining the team , mr listwin said yesterday he knew the new company s customers because at cisco he managed the sale of internet network hardware to telephone companies and service providers mr listwin will become president and chief executive alain rossman , the chief executive of phonecom , will become chairman and executive vice president john l macfarlane , the chief executive of softwarecom , will be an executive vice president \( mr macfarlane s consolation prize for giving up the chief executive spot is that his shares are now worth 710 million mr rossman s shares are worth 336 million \) the new company has not been named , but will either be softwarecom or phonecom the combined company will have headquarters in redwood city , the silicon valley home of phonecom softwarecom has been based in santa barbara none of the combined company s 1 , 500 employees will be laid off both companies have ridden a roller coaster in the stock market , but unlike most purveyors of web sites and online stores , they still enjoyed the sort of stock market values unheard of in the preinternet era phonecom s shares have ranged between 2750 and 208 in the last year , and were 78 on tuesday , before the deal was announced , giving it a value of 61 billion softwarecom s shares ranged between 22 and 155 , closing monday at 10775 giving it a value of 51 billion at best , investors were betting on the companies rapid growth , rather than their current financial performance in the most recent quarter , phonecom lost 166 million on sales of 287 million softwarecom lost 11 million on sales of 295 million mr listwin said he hoped the company could achieve 1 billion in annual sales in two years
portland , ore , aug 29 monstrous is the word used by portland s mayor , vera katz the executive director of the port of portland says the city s reputation has been tarred by gestapotype actions a state senator here says the conduct in question is racist and xenophobic and united states senator gordon h smith , a republican , put it this way today , we do n't want portland to be known as deportland all four are talking about the conduct of the local branch of the federal immigration and naturalization service the furor has been fanned by the recent stripsearch and twonight jailing of a chinese businesswoman who had landed here on her way to new york but public officials were already concerned that immigration agents were detaining or deporting foreign travelers at a much higher rate than at other west coast airports for portland , which labored mightily to persuade delta air lines to establish a minihub here with nonstop flights to asia , the controversy over the immigration office has been a blow to the city s image abroad the south china morning post reported recently that the city was already known as deportland in some asian countries , and the kyodo news service of japan has also reported on the problems , prompting some japanese travel agencies to advise their customers to avoid flying through portland if possible delta has already scaled back its crosspacific flights to portland to two a day , both from japan , having once had four daily nonstops , including flights from seoul , south korea , and taipei , taiwan and , citing fears that the controversy over the immigration service s treatment of foreigners here might lead the airline to scrap them altogether , public officials here have begun mounting a furious campaign to revamp the office the mayor , the governor and both united states senators here , as well as one from neighboring washington state , have all called for the resignation of the local director for portland , which prides itself on being one of the nation s more livable and culturally tolerant cities , the entire controversy is strange and wounding , and it could have severe economic consequences a port of portland study said that losing the direct air link to asia could cost the city as much as 900 million a year in lost trade and tourism and even as the immigration agency has faced accusations of mistreatment or insensitivity in its dealings with foreigners at portsofentry around the country , the criticism here is particularly harsh , prompting officials to promise a complete review of the portland office we are absolutely committed to restoring public confidence in our operations at pdx , said virginia kice , a spokeswoman for the agency s western division , using the threeletter airport code for portland we will not rest until the job is done inspectors at the portland airport will be given additional training in cultural awareness and professional communications skills , ms kice said , and the western regional director for the agency , johnny williams , traveled to portland on monday to meet with public officials and announce other procedures , including higherlevel authorization for decisions to detain or search foreigners arriving at the airport , and a better system for translation even as they acknowledged that portland s deportation rates were demonstrably higher than those in los angeles , san francisco and seattle , immigration officials noted that the vast majority of foreigners were admitted into the country at any of those airports , and that rate differences between portland and other west coast airports had narrowed significantly in the past year according to the immigration agency , from may through july of this year , portland turned back 58 of 34 , 694 foreigners arriving here , meaning it admitted 9983 percent of them seattle admitted all but 80 of 122 , 633 \( 9994 percent \) , and los angeles admitted all but 752 of 1 , 236 , 679 \( also 9994 percent \) moreover , officials said , there may be additional reasons that portland has a higher rate of deportations because it has much smaller numbers of foreign travelers , they said , agents here may actually be able to do a better job of screening out counterfeit documents , and a higher percentage of people arriving here are workers , who are more likely than tourists to have problems proving they have the proper authorization to remain in the country none of that , however , seems to have quelled the public outrage here or the perception abroad that portland is a bad place to enter the country and the stripsearch treatment of the chinese businesswoman , which was first reported by the oregonian , a daily newspaper here , was described as the last straw by mike thorne , the executive director of the port of portland the woman , guo liming , of guangzhou , china , arrived here on an aug 19 flight an agent , who has not been publicly identified by the immigration service , decided that her passport was suspicious because the laminate over the photograph was loose , indicating that the photograph could have been replaced the director of the office here , david beebe , later told a reporter that the woman also fit the profile of an illegal immigrant because she was traveling with another person a man who turned out to be her fiance ms guo was shortly removed to a room where she was ordered to strip down to her underwear , and was inspected by two female agents she was then handcuffed and taken to northern oregon regional corrections facility in the dalles , ore , 80 miles away , while the agency investigated whether her passport was bogus inspectors declined to tell her fiance , hsieh tsuhui , where she was , and he hired a portland immigration lawyer to track her down after spending two nights in jail , ms guo was told by the immigration service that her passport was indeed authentic , and they brought her back to the airport for a flight to new york mr beebe initially defended the agency s treatment of her , but after the oregonian article about her ordeal set off a storm of outrage , he reviewed the incident , announced that agents had erred in their handling of her , and offered ms guo an apology ms guo is traveling and could not be reached for an interview , said her portland lawyer , bao lin chen the incident was not an isolated one the immigration service here has come under fire for jailings of other foreigners , including six chinese teenagers seeking asylum but mr beebe has resisted calls from elected officials for his resignation , and the agency has not announced any disciplinary action against the agents who dealt with ms guo mr beebe referred calls to the immigration service s regional office in laguna niguel , calif mr williams , the director there , said it was too early to call for anyone s dismissal here you would not jump to that kind of a decision without benefit of a full look at all the issues at hand , he said photos david beebe , the beleaguered chief of the immigration branch \( associated press \) the strip search of guo liming , a chinese businesswoman shown with her fiance , hsieh tsuhui

maybe , way down the road , grudgingly allowed richard lattis , senior vice president and director of living institutions for the wildlife conservation society , the bronx zoo s parent apparently aware of the public relations impact of his alltoobrusque reply , he hastened to add that as a child he treasured a stuffed panda the now determinedly avuncular zoo official said that the issue transcended spectator glee , cutting to the ultimate purpose of zoos in a fragile ecosphere how best to marshal public support and scientific expertise to save threatened species he offered four sensiblesounding reasons for the bronx s pandalessness first , the bronx zoo long ago abandoned is mission of exhibiting every kind of animal in favor of more educational exhibits of fewer species it deliberately has no chimpanzees , for instance second , its exhibits are linked to areas where it has major conservation projects the 50 million congo exhibit that opened last year , with its stunning gorilla habitat , strives to tell the story of the conservation society s scientific work in the african rain forest third , the society s scientists , some of them the first westerners to study pandas in their chinese habitat , are not persuaded that american zoos are the best way to preserve a species that has dwindled to 1 , 000 or fewer bears fourth , pandas are not cheap , and they drain money from other priorities the chinese demand 1 million per pair a year well , sensible shoes , onepiece bathing suits and spinach are great too the truth is that just about everybody adores seeing pandas when the bronx zoo displayed a pair of visiting pandas for six months in 1987 , a million people came to ogle them , including lisa dautrich of oneonta , ny , who acknowledged owning a panda sweater , panda slippers and a panda hat we have a whole room decorated panda , her husband , ken , volunteered simply put , pandas are boffo box office , and you either have them or you do n't when asked to comment on the panda gap between her zoo and the bronx , gail eaton , senior vice president of zoo atlanta , had a swift and pointed response nyah , nyah , nyah , nyah , nyah ! in a polite voice , she added , you can quote me history suggests that the bronx zoo has seldom been nonchalant about pandas two years after the zoo opened in 1899 , william t hornaday , its first director , said that what he really , really wanted was a giant panda not until 1938 did the great zoo get one , pandora that chicago s highly regarded brookfield zoo got a panda a year earlier seemed only a minor slight , particularly because a second bear , pan , arrived in the bronx the next year they became the stars of the society s pavilion at the 1939 new york world s fair , and an amplebellied , sleepyeyed panda graced the cover of the zoo s guide that year the good fortune persisted in 1941 , mrs chiang kaishek sent two more pandas , pandah and pandee , to demonstrate the love that noncommunist chinese harbored for the united states , and particularly , it appeared , the bronx a central panda fact became apparent pandas , above all else , are perfect for political pandering mayor edward i koch understood this he looked across his vast realm and saw no pandas pandora , the zoo s last surviving panda , died in 1951 with characteristic energy and abrasiveness , he devoted seven years to lobbying china mr koch became known in beijing as the guy who wants the pandas mr koch says the door began to open during a lunch he arranged at gracie mansion for china s prime minister , zhao ziyang , in 1984 an occasion remembered for his publicly correcting mr zhao for holding his gift , a tiffany s crystal seal of new york , upside down mr prime minister , mr koch remembered saying , may i speak with you alone about a very important matter they retired to the library , where the mayor got to the point mr prime minister , i need two pandas we do n't give pandas , mr zhao answered i do n't want to own them i just want to borrow them , mr koch said the prime minister appeared puzzled if i get two pandas , i 'll get reelected , mr koch explained as the two politicians said goodbye , mr koch asked what he could tell reporters about pandas mr zhao replied , it is possible that new york city will have two pandas mr koch almost did a cartwheel that s how i got reelected , he said the other day , perhaps exaggerating , perhaps not
jessica sung clutched the chainlink gate and stared at the river about a dozen people were putting kayaks into the water at pier 26 in tribeca the air was crisp , the skies blue all this had inspired ms sung to get up early on a saturday morning , but not early enough her face pressed against the gate , she pleaded with the river guide to let her join the group the guide , john nocera , glared at her people always did this they arrived late , after the gate was shut at 8 am , and expected to go on the trip have you been kayaking before \? he asked ms sung and her friend metta murdaya the women looked at each other this is a long trip , mr nocera said we go to the statue of liberty and back we 've been whitewater rafting , ms sung said does that count \? mr nocera sighed in exasperation but there were still two open slots , and he was in a generous mood he unlocked the gate and told the women to dump their belongings in a locker , fill up bottles of water and put on life vests then he asked them to sign a sheet of paper this says that if you drown , you ca n't sue us , he said and so began another paddling trip on the hudson river the excursions are run by volunteers from the downtown boathouse , a building on pier 26 that houses dozens of kayaks belonging to paddlers in new york few would mistake the hudson for the coastline of baja or the rapids of nepal but every weekend morning from may to september , weather permitting , experienced kayakers lead 14 people on a threehour run across its waters depending on the tides , they head to liberty island or upriver to the uss intrepid , docked near 46th street sometimes , more than two dozen people show up for the 14 spots after word caught on about the trips , which began in 1995 , people started arriving at 5 30 am fistfights broke out a few times so last year , the boathouse started a lottery system that s the most difficult part of the trip , said tim gamble , secretary of the boathouse people get upset there s high anxiety not so a week ago saturday no more than the maximum number of people had turned out and of those , most had paddled before the group bobbing in the river included two photographers , a chef and a tourist from san antonio water lapped the sides of their boats , sometimes splashing inside every now and then , it resembled dishwater drained from the kitchen sink there are a couple things you should watch out for , said mr nocera , a lawyer piers , ferries and speedboats and if you fall into the water , always hold onto your paddle , because you 'll need a way to get back the kayakers' hands curled a little tighter around their paddles , and they began following mr nocera like ducklings across the hudson they stroked madly water splashed into their faces and sweat ran down their brows the current helped push them toward liberty island without threatening to overturn the boats near the new jersey shore , they paused to let a circle line ferry glide past its greenandwhite hull dwarfed the paddlers sitting in the kayak felt a little like being an ant on a floating leaf speedboats raced up and down , though none came close to the paddlers if a guy with a couple of daiquiris in him comes by , you 're dead meat , john staples , a boathouse volunteer , warned a straggler the current incarnation of the downtown boathouse was founded in 1995 , when paddlers heard that city and state transportation departments had condemned the pier they persuaded the agencies to lend it to them on the conditions that they clean it up and provide free kayaking for the public that meant having kayaks on hand for people to take out for halfhour runs and for leading trips along the river the number of people using the 30 or so public boats in the summer has surged , to 11 , 000 last year from 100 in 1995 although few mishaps have occurred on the kayak trips , christopher howard , a founding guide , recalled one bad run in 1997 as the paddlers neared ellis island , a small cessna fell from the sky into the hudson , right behind them one woman burst into tears mr howard ended up towing the weakest paddler back to shore and leading the group a quartermile out of the way to avoid the wreckage but on mr nocera s trip , there were no aerial accidents the kayakers rested in the water in the shadow of lady liberty seeing her and the manhattan skyline from this perspective was like looking at them with virgin eyes the kayakers paddled around the island , beneath a low bridge and into a sheltered cove on the new jersey shore , where they clambered out of the boats a few said they were grateful that they had gotten this far their muscles burned they gulped bottled water at some points , it s hard work , said liz maxwell my shoulders are a little sore my arms are a little sore ms sung held her glasses up to the sun they were splattered with brown muck it looked like the kind of dirt that would require industrialstrength cleanser this trip seems like an insider thing , she said to ms murdaya what determines insider \? ms murdaya asked if it s not in the tourist books \? i guess so , ms sung said or if it s not in the newspaper photo volunteers from the downtown boathouse lead free kayaking trips on the hudson river on weekends from may to september depending on the tide , the kayaks go to liberty island or the uss intrepid \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)
washington , sept 10 the 14th musicians' competition sponsored by the thelonious monk institute of jazz began on saturday with a consecration renato thoms , a 33yearold competitor from panama , who now lives in brooklyn , read aloud from corinthians be anxious for nothing , he said , asking god to bless the festival and the competitors then he started to play , not drums , saxophone or trumpet or any of the the usual instruments of jazz that have been the basis of past competitions , but congas latin music in jazz has gone far beyond the windowdressing stage now american jazz musicians are traveling to cuba in greater numbers , and musicians from the afrocaribbean islands or south america are appearing in new york and changing the music as exhibit a , there s this year s monk competition the first to focus on afrolatin hand drumming , it drew contestants ranging from an ethnomusicologist with a degree from wesleyan university to a 10yearold from east harlem originally the notion was to hold a contest open to all hand drummers , said shelby fischer , associate director of the institute but then the institute decided to limit the drumming competition to the latin and african traditions and the various mixtures of the two that have grown all over the new world each year the institute offers a 20 , 000 prize for the winner and 10 , 000 for each of the two runnersup but winning the monk competition does n't automatically make a musician bankable though the institute has important alliances with highlevel jazz musicians , actors and members of the clinton administration , who all attend the event , the momentum of the competition seems to have slid despite victories in the early 1990 s by joshua redman and teri thornton , who were both snapped up by major record labels , the prize does not necessarily translate into a career , especially if the winner is n't ready to be a working bandleader this year the absence of the musicbusiness crowd was palpable only one record label sent a representative that may be understandable , given the contest s parajazz slant but none of the invited representatives from latin labels came the institute was doing something unusual , and this competition was a shaky first step usually the applications , which require a 10minute homemade audiotape and a 25 fee , number in the hundreds this year the institute received only 50 tapes , even though word had gone out through university music departments , magazine advertising and information sent to new york and miami radio stations there were no semifinalists from the west coast , none specializing in brazilian rhythm , none representing the puerto rican bombaandplena style two of the finalists were students of the percussionist johnny almendra , who both led the contest s house band and served on the tapescreening committee but even with the restrictions of the contest , the competitiors played many styles kera washington , a young musicologist and drummer , offered her own fusion of haitian and brazilian rhythms eli cane , a 20yearold student at tufts university , played fumefume rhythms of the ga tribe from the gulf of guinea samuel torres , 23 , from colombia , placed second , playing a cumbia rhythm ramses araya , 29 , a technically imposing costa rican musician and a member of ruben blades s band , played five bata drums \( used in yoruban religious ceremonies in cuba \) roped together mr araya , a progressive player , had made a risky move the judges , musicians like candido , ray barretto and milton cardona , represent the older guard in latin music his choice was daring not only because the bata is a religious instrument for which newwave innovations are not taken lightly , but also because the judges made their careers playing more modest setups in the 1950 s candido , 79 , became the first conguero in latin jazz to use two conga drums regularly some judges clearly felt that more than two was overkill even with the contest s restrictions , mr barretto said the net was too wide you would n't put a bluegrass violinist next to jascha heifetz , he said it s two different ballgames there are styles of drumming that are more traditionally africanbased , and styles that are more cubanbased , and others that are puerto rican or dominican when you have a knowledge of each of these separate categories , you realize that each one should be judged on its own merit other judges disagreed big black , an american musician in his mid60 s who has played a mixture of latin , african , and jazz percussion for his entire career he now calls his style environmental rhythms mentioned a more inclusive ideal the competition was much too narrow , he said afrocuban does not fully express the whole drum thing there should have been some indian drummers there should have been young drummers from north africa , persia , around the world they could have brought hundreds of drummers together , and started the elimination process by just having a series of jams this could go on for a month or two months
the wheels come up , said daniel dominguez we see the st john s airport below , and i look back and say , 'my god , we 're actually doing this' that was when this whole thing really hit me on sept 15 , after years of planning , mr dominguez and a friend and fellow pilot , christopher wall , both 22yearold college students , left newfoundland for a threemonth trip around the world in their refurbished 1957 twinengine aero commander 560e when they returned to rochester on friday , they became , unofficially , the youngest crew ever to circumnavigate the globe mr dominguez said the two , who grew up together in el paso , dreamed up the idea of the flight in a dingy bar in juarez , mexico , when they were 17 chris and i always wanted to fly , he said apparently , when i was 7 years old , i told my mother that i was going to fly around the world in my own plane she and my father traveled all over mexico and central america as kids in a vw bus , so they never told me that i could n't do it the day he turned 17 , mr dominguez passed the test for his private pilot s license , and several months later , he said , he and mr wall took a mindblowing flight to ketchikan , alaska , in a cessna twoseater at this point , mr wall chimed in because of alaska , we made the decision to go around the world , he said the next morning , we said , 'how the hell are we really going to do this \? ' when they tried to find sponsors for the project , they were told they needed to have legal nonprofit status it took them two years to put together the global advancement foundation , in early 1998 it was and continues to be essentially a twoman operation mr wall , then an electrical engineering student at rice university in houston , and mr dominguez , an economics major at the university of rochester , persuaded officials at the rochester school to donate a small office and a phone line then they began planning the project and raising money in earnest no one would back us without a plane , mr wall said i began to settle on the aero commander you could get them for a good price , even if they 're kind of beat up they take off easily and can carry the equivalent of a jeep and they look cool a year ago , while searching on the internet , mr wall found his prey , grounded derelict on an airfield in guthrie , okla the paint was peeling , the interior was dead , it had n't been flown in a year , he said but it was only selling for 15 , 000 i called dan and said , 'dude , i found our airplane' mr dominguez said he took a bus to oklahoma , and there s the ugliest plane i 've ever seen it had been a drugrunning plane in miami , he went on the owner got caught , then got himself killed using student loans and credit cards , the two set up a delaware corporation , bought the plane and christened it dreamcatcher mr wall was so devoted to the project that he drove 700 miles from rice to oklahoma every weekend to work on the plane i 'd work all weekend , then try to make it back to school so i did n't flunk out , he said i got her together enough to fly to rochester and got a oneway permit from an faa guy who swore when we bought her that she 'd never fly again but mr wall had not tested the gas tanks just before takeoff , they discovered that , in the plane s earlier life , one wing tank had been removed to store drugs we put 156 gallons in the center tank , mr dominguez said , and it starts to leak down the side but we had to get to rochester we did n't have any more money for gas a little duct tape , a wing and a prayer , we got in and went once in rochester , mr wall took a year off from rice while mr dominguez continued his studies both prepared for their roundthe world flight we 'd be out on the airfield sunrise to sunset , mr dominguez said chris would be doing airplane mechanics and i 'd be flightinstructing in my spare time their dream was taking shape it was students who made it happen , mr wall said we made it a school project we would also invite our friends out , have a case of beer , and we stripped and polished her , tore out the interior , tuned the engines , all new hoses , electronics , everything with what he called huge help from two students , jennifer powers and elizabeth ann begy , the project put up a web site , worldflight2000org despite all the work , the project continued to struggle financially mr wall and mr dominguez began giving speeches at schools we 're trying to encourage all these kids to make their dreams happen , mr dominguez said but what do you say to a third grader who asks what you 're going to do when you run out of money \? the question weighed heavily until the young pilots flew the dreamcatcher to an air show in oshkosh , wis , in late july attended by more than 500 , 000 people , the event was their best shot at publicity they gave us a spot near the center , said mr dominguez and our photographer , jesse weisz , ran around letting everyone know what we were doing and getting us all sorts of sponsors we got 21 , 000 in camera gear from rowe photo in rochester , garmin gave us radios and global positioning equipment , and an engine mechanic from tennessee named nick carter offered us a 25 , 000 engine overhaul , which we found out we desperately needed we easily had over 100 , 000 in equipment and service donated to us now , the project was gear rich but still cash poor its saving grace came in august when mr dominguez , sleeping under a table in his flight office , got a call from the president of america online , robert w pittman i'm there in my boxers , and aol offers us enough sponsorship to make this thing happen , mr dominguez recalled i was floored he paused but as i said before , none of this really hit me until we were out there over the atlantic suddenly , i became incredibly aware of everything we had sacrificed to get here , and of my own mortality from newfoundland , he and mr wall flew to the azores , barcelona , spain , rome , greece , cairo , oman , bahrain , india , bali , australia , vanuatu and hawaii and made their return to the united states mainland on dec 6 , when they landed at tiny half moon bay airport in california both men said they lived as aerial vagabonds , flying a plane that had one wing in the 1950 s , and one in the 21st century one night they slept in hammocks under the dreamcatcher s wings , the next in a 400 a night hotel room that a benefactor had paid for on the greek island of rhodes they said they watched the sun rise from inside the coliseum in rome , had machine guns pointed at them by anxious guards at an airport in cairo , and toured the pyramids by camel later in the day when an engine failed over the red sea , they were forced to dump about 1 , 000 worth of fuel , turn around and make an emergency landing on the egyptian coast later , they spoke to 1 , 000 schoolchildren at one time in bhubaneshwar , india , snorkled in the great barrier reef off the coast of australia and surfed off oahu , in hawaii as you fly around the world , your mind opens up and you realize what a small world it really is , mr wall said after seeing what i have seen , i want to see so much more mr dominguez added i suppose the main thing that we 've learned is that anything is possible dare to have a dream even if you fail , you 'll have a hell of a story to tell photos christopher wall working on the aero commander during a stop in bangor , me searching the internet , he found the plane in oklahoma \( chris dixon \) christopher wall , above left , and daniel dominguez returned to rochester friday after a roundtheworld trip that included stops in newfoundland , rome and india during one segment of the odyssey , mr wall , at left in photo at right , and mr dominguez piloted their 1957 twinengine aero commander over the brazos river in texas \( carlos ortiz rochester democrat and chronicle \) \( chris dixon \)
and so , as the late autumn , if not the hoary winter , of his career is upon him , patrick ewing , at age 38 , with his 7foot body battered but still willing after 15 bruising seasons with the knicks , looked back on his professional basketball life athletically , he said , i'm not where i was back in my prime , but mentally i'm much better when i think about what i knew back then and what i know now , i realize how great i could have been this candid , even surprising , observation from him occurred monday at the news conference in seattle that introduced ewing , fresh from the recent trade , to the fans of his new team , the supersonics the concept that youth is wasted on the young is less than original most of us have had it , but for many , what we missed we missed because of a combination of arrogance and ignorance we did n't know , were never told , were certain we knew better , or let personal considerations outweigh anything else ewing seemed to have shared some of those characteristics a wondrous talent , a superb scorer and one who often played hurt and invariably hard , he missed opportunities to become a champion , or to set himself into a better position to become a champion he rarely seemed to trust his teammates , for example , or some of his coaches , believing that he was the one who knew how to win a championship , that he must carry the team on offense but the goal of a title has thus far eluded him michael jordan , who knew something about winning and is a friend of ewing s , told him a few years ago , patrick , you 'll never win a championship until you learn how to pass out of the double team it took ewing until near the end of his knick career to be willing to pass the ball and not just under duress to the open teammate jordan and the rest of the bulls have generally agreed that chicago would not have won its first three championships without bill cartwright , a limited player physically but a highly intelligent one the bulls needed a force at center , and cartwright provided it he was traded to the bulls by the knicks for charles oakley , a power forward early on , the knicks had hoped to play ewing at power forward and cartwright at center , because ewing , though a dominating center in college , had more versatility than cartwright ewing balked at the suggestion and management , for essentially and , it turns out , unfortunately , the whole of his career , submitted to ewing s demands and ewing s best moves evolved into power forward drives and mediumrange jump shots ewing liked to get the ball so much that when he took a defensive rebound , he rarely threw the outlet pass to start a fast break but had a guard circle around to take a handoff , allowing him time to get downcourt and set up , frustrating a long line of uptempo teammates i like patrick , personally , said dave debusschere , who , as general manager , drafted ewing in 1985 but if i were playing , there were times i 'd have said 'patrick , clear out of the center and go to the other side open things up ! ' i thought he cared too much for offense when he could have been an overwhelming force on defense when don nelson became coach of the knicks , he told ewing that he wanted him to be a better passer ewing was shocked i am a good passer , he said the knicks opened the season on a winning streak they were running and moving the ball ewing went to nelson i'm not getting enough touches , he said but patrick , nelson said , we 're on a roll i know , ewing said i'm not getting enough touches watching ewing for 15 years with the knicks , one had occasion to wonder what he could be thinking coach after coach on the sideline hollered , on defense , stay down , patrick , stay down ! but time after time , he went for the fake other actions were equally baffling , like his roaming off the bench when there was a scuffle against miami in the playoffs in 1997 , despite his knowing the rules it earned him a game suspension and contributed mightily to the heat s victory in the series none of this has anything to do with ewing s personality off the court his interaction , or lack of it , with the fans or the news media that was purely his business in the end , though , ewing cheated not only himself of being , as he said , as great as he could have been , but he also , to a significant degree , deprived fans and his teams of a better , more satisfying kind of basketball that he was capable of providing now patrick ewing turns a new page in his career it is never too late to learn the genuine hope here is that , finally , he does photo patrick ewing \( associated press \)

lavor postell knew it was an ugly shot an acrossthebody shot from the right baseline that skittered near the top of the backboard reggie jesse did not think about pretty he got his hands on the rebound and volleyballed it back on the glass when it fell , with just 289 seconds left , the st john s faithful really could not be blamed for the guttural growl that accompanied the ball as it fell through the net in a trying season marbled with late game brain seizures that have cost st john s six exacerbating losses , a 7675 victory over the nation s ninthranked team is a pretty cathartic event , especially when it has milestone significance it was st john s 1 , 600th triumph in 93 years of men s basketball , a number only perennial powers like kentucky , north carolina , kansas and duke have passed in fact , it was downright therapeutic for a program that for the past two weeks has shared headlines with street agents , benefactors and national collegiate athletic association investigators , who have targeted the program for an extensive inquiry but none of that mattered to the 19 , 410 at a soldout madison square garden to see these longtime big east rivals they saw what they are used to two teams running up and down and woofing at each other , clutching jerseys , banging knees even the coaches wanted on the floor syracuse s jim boeheim received a technical foul for wandering too far onto the hardwood but when all the pathos and pyrotechnics were set aside , it was the simplest and oldest play of the game , executed by jesse , who made only two buckets and a free throw , that decided the game a layup without it , the red storm was in danger it had blown a 9point lead , played 4 minutes 20 seconds without a basket , and watched syracuse score 12 straight points when postell bulled his way into the left corner for his awkward launch , jesse circled around the foul lane and drifted onto the right box the ball skipped his way he banked it back into the basket i was in the right spot , he said and a layup is a layup even if it wins a game the orangemen still had time to finish off a dramatic comeback with a buzzer beater they had taken a 3633 lead into halftime only to see it erased and quickly by the deft left hand of bootsy thornton \( 22 points \) but it was how those points came one after another the senior toed the 3point arc and launched successfully four of seven times the orangemen wanted to get the ball to hart , but erick barkley , jesse and postell all ran and slapped at him so his backcourt mate , allen griffin , spun at the top of the key and drove hard to the basket to put up an eightfoot leaner allen made the best play he could , trying to get to the basket , and i think , really , a big key for our team is what happened then , boeheim said we do n't get the rebound we need to get that rebound we got 69 , 68 , 68 out there we 're not doing it in terms of getting that particular rebound and that s something at this stage of the year , i'm not too happy about the red storm was relieved more than happy after a difficult week that has swirled around who paid for barkley s prep school and what , if any , agents have approached him the sophomore was sick to his stomach during the game and collapsed on the floor after the game he had to have intravenous fluids administered to him in the locker room everything we 've been through the last few weeks says something , said barkley , who finished with 16 points and 9 assists only the strong survive the rumors about me are over a little bit it feels like a big monkey off my shoulder but reminders of the continuing inquiry filled the garden ernie lorch , the manhattan lawyer who has built riverside church s basketball program into a national power , was in his usual seat behind the st john s bench he has not been contacted yet by the ncaa its investigators have contacted the maine prep school barkley attended in 199798 to see if lorch or any other benefactor paid for any part of the guard s 23 , 500 tuition in what may be construed as a violation of the organization s extrabenefits regulation lorch , who acknowledges providing financial assistance to hundreds of kids in his 40 years with the basketball program , continues to decline to say whether he paid part of the tuition for barkley a former riverside player at maine central institute every student is responsible for at least part of the 23 , 500 tuition but for last night at least , none of that mattered a layup led to a milestone a milestone led to a rare smile for coach mike jarvis any victory is good , jarvis said some are a little bit extra special and this goes down as one of those extra special victories as i told the guys when we assembled after the game , for whatever it s worth , just being who they are , and being tough enough to keep all the people in their seats for the entire game but to win is really great photo lavor postell of st john s , who

itta bena , miss look for the future of black colleges not on the spartan campus of mississippi valley state university , a survivor of neardeath experiences that desperately wants the world to know it is alive and has enlisted bb king , a native son , to sing its praises in television spots instead , go 10 miles west to greenwood , cruise down grand boulevard past the stately homes recalling plantation days and behold a brick strip mall just shy of downtown there , amid an insurance office , hair salon and satellite office of motor vehicles , is an extension of valley , as locals call it in its handful of classrooms are students like gregory wenger , a 42yearold national guard soldier , studying organizational behavior in greenwood en route to a degree in business administration there is little remarkable about his presence , except perhaps his race , white for mississippi valley like the state s two other historically black public universities , jackson state and alcorn state finds itself in a seeming paradox it is celebrating , in a reserved sort of way , the enrollment of 103 white students , who make up 45 percent of the student body in 1991 there were just 5 white students mr wenger s presence speaks to the unintended consequences here in delta mississippi of a classaction lawsuit filed against the state by jake ayers , a black sharecropper , on behalf of his son , jake jr , and other minority students this year marks the 25th anniversary of the suit , which seeks equal financing and facilities for the state s three black universities it has come to be known as higher education s brown v board of education and like the brown case , in which the united states supreme court ruled that separate but equal in public education was unconstitutional , ayers eventually made its way to the high court , in 1992 that was nowhere near the end of it with the case dragging on , the governor of mississippi last month pledged a new effort to resolve it while in the eyes of the courts a settlement might finally put to rest the vestiges of segregation in mississippi , the combatants think that , in a cruel twist , what was originally intended as an attempt at equity has in the end caused the black colleges to be shortchanged even more top black students are being lured by predominantly white universities , and the three publicly financed black institutions , whose mission has long been to nurture africanamerican students , find themselves trying to figure out how to attract more white students a result of newly promised settlement talks is likely to influence similar cases that the justice department is overseeing in alabama , tennessee and louisiana , which , like mississippi , legally segregated higher educational institutions into the 1960 s there have been 19 desegregation cases since the flurry of litigation in the mid1970 s involving public education most have been in the south and most ended in agreements with the federal department of education in midmarch , the department reached an agreement with the state of kentucky that , among other things , will provide 13 million for academic and building improvements at historically black kentucky state university negotiations continue with maryland , texas and virginia the ayers suit , filed in 1975 , has roots in a 1969 federal directive to the state to draft a plan to eliminate segregation at mississippi campuses the state countered that its sole legal obligation was to ensure raceneutral admission standards in its plan after winding its way through the courts , the case reached the supreme court , which ruled that raceneutral policies alone did not ensure the end of segregation it sent the case back to federal district court , where a judge , neal b biggers jr , would oversee a more comprehensive plan the state , reasoning that a key vestige of segregation was the black colleges themselves , came up with a plan to consolidate the state s eight campuses into four mississippi valley would close , merging with predominantly white delta state university about 70 miles away but after vociferous protests by black leaders , judge biggers rejected that plan instead , he set up remedies that included the adoption of uniform admission standards at the eight campuses , instituting new programs at the black universities intended to make them more competitive for white students and issuing otherway scholarships that would entice white students to enroll since the decree went into effect in 1996 , the state has allocated about 44 million to make improvements to its black colleges and universities , including 57 million this year it is not enough , says alvin o chambliss jr , a charismatic lawyer with a preacher s cadence mr ayers died in 1986 mr chambliss , who was among the original lawyers on the case , powers the suit today to settle , he wants the state to spend about 300 million and set up professional programs like a law school or nursing program at one or more campuses mr chambliss is not alone in his dissatisfaction the circuitous course the suit has taken and its fallout have left many perplexed
max weintraub grew up on the lower east side when it was still a predominantly jewish neighborhood , and spent a quiet career as the controller of a small advertising agency , cultivating his rogue side with trips to belmont race track after retiring , he joined a partnership to race horses at belmont and saratoga , but it was not enough nostalgic for the old neighborhood and his lost youth , he decided to volunteer in public school and so he presented himself at public school 142 , which sits on delancey and attorney streets among a jumble of tenements and undercapitalized stalls selling shoes , coats and bags in an area that is now more puerto rican than jewish out of sheer serendipity , mr weintraub , the cranky widower with a grown daughter and a yen to do good , met his alter ego miguel figueroa , a cranky puerto rican , who became a teacher 28 years ago out of a desire to find an alternative to serving in vietnam and an urge to do good mr weintraub remembers how it happened i said to the principal , 'i'm here to help out' he looked at me like i was from mars miguel walked into the office and the principal said , 'hey , miguel you want somebody to help \? ' he said yes seven years later , they are still together , curbing each other s excesses of temperament and looking after fifth graders as if they were their own children i was lucky , mr weintraub said their partnership shows how it is n't always grand ideas , like ending social promotion , that make schools better , and that sometimes it can simply be two people working together , even if one is a volunteer one day last month , mr weintraub treated mr figueroa s class to the circus on the way to madison square garden , mr figueroa , 53 years old , stocky and crewcut , and mr weintraub , 78 , jaunty in a plaid blazer but walking with a slight limp , talked about their school in a way that made the outside world of chancellors and politicians seem merely intrusive , if not irrelevant mr figueroa has 37 children in his fifthgrade class , about 10 more than average , not because the administration wants them there but because the parents do the parents finagle , he said the class , mr weintraub said , makes its own rules and socially holds itself apart from the rest of the school , but it is happy that way we still think that rome governs , mr figueroa declared , as if the barbarians were at the gate the rest of the world is trying to get in at the gates it s housetohouse and we 're the last house on the block i'm an elitist , and they 're elitists as they passed the principal s office on their way out to the subway , a secretary called mr figueroa in to discuss plans for a school cheerleading squad he was outraged they ca n't read , and the answer is to put them in clubs , he said clubs should be a reward they walked half a block south , turning toward the f train station on delancey as they passed a construction site , skirting mounds of dugup sidewalk , mr figueroa cheerfully called out his version of a warning to tread carefully this is a good sue ! he yelled let s raise money for the school ! unlike other students at ps 142 , the children in mr figueroa s class do not dare leave their navy uniforms at home they maintained two straight rows as they walked , as if they were being led by the nun in ludwig bemelmans s madeline books , and spoke in hushed tones there was none of the usual rowdiness when children go on class trips do n't push , mr figueroa cajoled , as the children squeezed through the iron subway gate they 'll say the empire is coming to an end mr figueroa boasted that his fifth graders \( whom he also taught as fourth graders \) had scored higher on the state reading test than the sixth grade , even his lowestscoring students how does he do it \? the group , he replied your score reflects the group your attitude reflects the group i 've been told that my kids are conceited but it s better that they think well of themselves they may be snobs but they are smart snobs at madison square garden , the students discovered they had frontrow seats i know the fellow at the garden , mr weintraub explained a girl stopped a vendor balancing a tray of snowcones on his head 6 ! she said in disbelief you get to take the cup home with you , the vendor said there were no takers mr weintraub bought everyone popcorn the ringleader announced that a clown would be shot out of a cannon does it hurt \? a girl fretted mr weintraub assured her that it would not be painful , only smoky a group of chinese women in pink rode out on bikes , balancing on shoulders and knees , five to a single bike i ca n't even ride a bike , the girl sitting next to mr weintraub whispered in the classroom , mr figueroa has his students reading jane eyre he chose it , he said , because it s a love story , and because it would help his students understand inference two years ago they read 'the odyssey , ' mr weintraub recalled of an earlier fifthgrade class that is not prescribed by the board of education the principal lets him do anything
moscow , march 25 they do n't make them much tougher than siberian bulldozer operators , and so it follows that roman khasanov , a 30yearold excavator from the flat , treeless permafrost of yakutia , has little use for politicians who feel people s pain by his way of thinking , it was mikhail s gorbachev and his squishy notions of perestroika and glasnost restructuring and openness that brought russia to ruination in the first place when he took off the handcuffs , he should have done so slowly , mr khasanov said as he sat , nursing a vodka hangover with ulcer medicine , on a train bound to a mongolia construction job because now people do n't know what to do with their freedom which is why he believes russia needs vladimir v putin , the acting president and the man who slapped the cuffs back on chechnya s rebels mr putin has the muscle to reimpose order on a chaotic nation and come the presidential election this sunday , mr khasanov declared earlier this month , i will vote for him with three hands but almost a continent westward , in the volga river town of samara , boris k fursov says mr putin s muscular submission of chechnya is reason enough by itself to deny him the presidency in soviet times , he said , maybe one man could impose order in a democracy , it is an entire nation s job i will tell you the truth about putin , mr fursov said over a snack of bread and appleandcurrant preserves in his tworoom apartment there is an element in his behavior that to my mind pushes us back in time and for my son and for my grandson , i would prefer that they have an open and democratic road to the future mr fursov , a retired soviet army officer who devoted much of his career to the cold war , says he will vote for grigory v yavlinsky , a member of parliament who is , by most measures , the most westernoriented of russia s presidential candidates what does russia want in its president \? does it want a strongman or a man of the people \? does it want to be led back to imperial glory , or simply , as russians will say without a hint of irony , to join the club of civilized nations \? do russians want a president who will bind them to europe and the west , or do they want a nationalist \? do they want a democrat , or has 10 years of democracy induced nostalgia for sovietstyle transfers of power \? what pollsters say russians clearly want is mr putin , although his intentions remain , so far , largely a blank slate the last preelection samples \( polling here ended , as the law requires , a week before the vote \) gave mr putin as much as 57 percent of the backing among people who said they planned to vote in sunday s election the closest of his 10 rivals , the communist party leader gennady zyuganov , drew only about 25 percent mr yavlinsky , the yabloko party leader , was third with about 6 percent mr putin needs only 50 percent of the vote to escape a twoman runoff , which would occur on april 16 with an additional expected flood of proputin ballots from the military and some prisoners , who already have voted , he seems likely to avoid a second election but saying the russians want mr putin as their president says precious little about how or where they want him to lead for mr putin s brief campaign has cast him as all things to all people a brutal warrior against chechens a dog lover who cries at funerals a supporter of basic rights a supporter of a crackdown on politically unruly journalists an architect of a new rapprochement with the west an architect of an antiwestern alliance with china beyond the war in chechnya , a gamble that paid off royally among voters thirsting for some symbol of national strength , mr putin s actual policies as opposed to promises have been few and uncontroversial the voters are in a situation where they know all the other candidates , and they know the others are n't suitable , said otto latsis , a political analyst and deputy editor of the newspaper noviye izvestiya putin they do n't know but they also do n't know many things which would push them away from him and in fact , pollsters and analysts say , mr putin , a 47yearold former kgb agent who took over as acting president last new year s eve after just four months as prime minister , has managed to remain remarkably popular precisely because he has religiously shunned any one ideology in a nation that , ideologically speaking , has been exhausted by the brand of wild east capitalism allowed under mr yeltsin , and before that by the brutal excesses of communism , mr putin has captured the noneoftheabove vote and it is huge nine years after the fall of the soviet union , the communist party is doomed to lose at the polls , at least in its present incarnation its base of support is about 25 percent of the electorate the communists are more popular than mr putin only among voters over 60 below that , their support dwindles almost in lockstep with age prowestern democrats of mr yavlinsky s stripe are even worse off , topping out at perhaps 15 percent of voters , by and large the young , experts say ultranationalists like vladimir zhirinovsky claim perhaps 5 to 10 percent the remainder of the voters , like mr khasanov , the bulldozer driver , are united less by strong political beliefs than by the lack of them
the premiere episode of the dr laura schlessinger syndicated television series , which ran across the country yesterday , clearly suffered from a summer s worth of protests by gay and lesbian activists as wellknown advertisers mostly shunned the show the protesters , complaining about remarks on gays dr schlessinger made on her popular syndicated radio program , urged mainstream advertisers to steer clear of her foray onto tv only a handful of recognizable brand names were spotted among the sponsors of the initial episode of dr laura , with the packagedgoods and retail giants that dominate daytime television notably absent the sole recognizable sponsors were brummel brown sandwich spread , sold by the lipton division of unilever scott bathroom tissue , made by kimberlyclark and summer s eve , a feminine hygiene product of the c b fleet company the biggest share of the spots came from national marketers that sell videotapes , diet aids and compact discs through tollfree 800 telephone numbers local vocational schools and lawyers and units of viacom , the parent of paramount domestic television , the paramount pictures unit that is producing and syndicating the series the commercials seen on wcbstv , channel 2 in new york , a viacomowned station , were from names like castalian music , selling the very best of the gipsy kings and a collection of shirley temple films the learning institute for beauty sciences premier dietzx , which promised weight loss 24 hours a day the invention submission corporation sanford rubenstein , a brooklyn lawyer with a tollfree number ending in hurt the wound care center the new york restaurant school , promoting classes in pastry arts and ontel direct , selling the universal inkjet refill kit , a syringe that is injected into empty printer cartridges the demonstration of the syringe produced an image that jarred incongruously with the topic of the first show , teens and drugs what is a parent to do \?

camden the grand gothicstyle building bespeaks an era of a greater camden camden high school was built on the hill in parkside , long camden s finest residential area , when the city was flexing its muscles as a prime industrial center of postworld war i america and the home of such businesses as rca victor , new york shipbuilding and esterbrook pen but parkside , like the rest of camden , lost its luster long ago rca , new york ship and almost every other big business have left the city there are no longer any movies , department stores or major supermarkets despite the state aquarium , a new entertainment complex and promises of a baseball stadium on the delaware river waterfront , camden s poverty defines the city the last census found camden had the fourth lowest per capita income in the country but as the other three cities are in the south and not in the more expensive northeast , it could be reasoned that camden is the poorest city in the nation if there are glimmers of hope amid the problems , they often come from the gothic building on the hill or more specifically , from the gym in the rear called proudly by its partisans our house on the hill where broken glass and boardedup houses litter the neighborhood , the camden high gym floor sparkles and the walls are a vibrant yellow and purple , the colors of the camden high panthers there has often been hope in that gym camden high has been winning state basketball championships for more than four decades now it went undefeated all the way to the title in 1959 and 1960 its 1986 team was ranked best in the nation by usa today and there were seven other state championships in the 1970 s and 1980 s as bad as things can get in camden , the high school basketball team has been a positive focus for the city legends have grown up around its stars , from the sunkett brothers and itchy smith in the 1960 s to billy thompson and milt wagner , teammates in the early 1980 s , both of whom went on to play for the los angeles lakers camden has n't won a state championship since 1987 but hope is back in our house again on game day , the gym is usually filled and attention is almost always focused on one young man , dajuan wagner , son of milt , touted by scouts as the top high school junior in the nation even alan iverson , the nba scoring leader who plays for the philadelphia 76ers , has come to watch he s had the hype and he s as good as they say , said jay gomes , the state s high school basketball guru who publishes the new jersey hoops newsletter , scouting report and web site there are other good players around , but not to the extent he is he has , as they say , all the tools behind the 6foot3inch dajuan , the panthers entered the weekend 134 and ranked fourth in the state dajuan missed his team s first five games with a broken left foot and a broken right pinky , yet he was still leading south jersey players in scoring with an average of 323 points a game two weeks ago , dajuan scored 80 points against pennsauken tech , an amazing feat considering high school teams play only 32minute games but dajuan and his coach , glen jackson , were vilified for running up the score on the mediocre pennsauken tech what was more impressive was his 43 points two days later against camden catholic , one of the best teams in south jersey and last monday he scored 19 points and dished out 4 assists in the second half to help camden overcome previously undefeated cherokee high school with arthur barclay , camden s 6foot8inch center , who is living with dajuan and his mother since his own family moved out of camden , and three other juniors surrounding them getting more in sync as the season moves along , camden is hoping for another championship banner on the yellowandpurple walls of our house but it was almost not so two years ago , camden was suspended from tournament play and its longtime coach , clarence turner , was suspended from coaching and fined 600 based on two incidents one in which he pulled his team off the court before a game was over and another in which officials determined that camden players and fans helped start a fight during a tournament game against long branch dajuan , then entering his sophomore year , and arthur , a prospective junior , threatened to transfer to camden catholic mr turner , whose 677107 record in 28 seasons at camden made him the winningest coach in south jersey history , reluctantly retired the school board hired mr jackson , then 29 who had never risen above the second team while playing for mr turner dajuan had already begun burnishing his legend as a freshman when he came to the primetime shootout , a midseason tournament in trenton , and scored 45 points in a 6655 victory for camden against red bank high school no one in north jersey had seen him before , said mr gomes but red bank had three guys who went on to play division i college ball they were very good , but he was fantastic , with all kinds of moves and shots , from 3pointers to dunks it cemented his status all over the state city loyalty finally persuaded dajuan and arthur to stay at camden , even though they could play only 17 games , and none in the state tournament , last year i love it here in camden , said the 17yearold dajuan in an effusive moment after a friday night practice if it were up to me , i 'd never leave my family is here , my friends it s where i belong it s also where his father , who is separated from dajuan s mother returned this year after a professional career in europe the elder mr wagner , who had also played briefly in the nba , said it was time for him to retire from basketball and work with his son before the pressures of college and maybe pro recruiters become too great i want him to go to college , said mr wagner , dispelling for now rumors that his son would go directly to the nba dajuan extended his reputation this summer he was the high scorer at the prestigious nike camp for high school players in indianapolis , and he and arthur barclay played on a team representing the united states in france he said he loved the travel , but felt more comfortable in camden still , mr turner always counseled his players who could get scholarships to get out i only had them for a couple of hours a day , he said the bad element could get them the rest of the time the bad element preys on the stars mr thompson and dajuan s father went to the university of louisville , where a recent camden star , nate johnson , now plays , raising the possibility that dajuan will follow for now , mr jackson helps keep dajuan at the top of his game on the court and off i laugh sometimes at the images of camden , he said crime \? yes , it is n't great but most of the crime comes at 1 , 2 , 3 in the morning who has to be out then \? there are a lot of good people who live here basketball here , yes , it s been a rallying point , but it s only one thing , ' added mr jackson i hate to hear people talking about falling back on your education it s sports you should lean on to get that education mr jackson said this loud enough so that dajuan , who had just completed five interviews that day , could hear and dajuan , a handsome , powerfullooking young man with neat cornrowed hair , just smiled i know there is a lot to do between now and the time i graduate , he said other players are getting better and i have to keep up with them , especially on defense dad says just to go out and play hard and it will all be there for me photo dajuan wagner had 19 points and 4 assists in the second half alone

san juan , pr luis rosa had never seen el yunque , puerto rico s renowned rain forest he had never tasted a seafood stew like the one he ate the other day or tried many of the tropical fruits people here pick from their backyard trees mr rosa , who was born and reared in chicago , is only now getting to know the country in whose name he took up a life of political violence as a teenager and for which he spent more than 19 years in a federal prison one of the puerto rican radical nationalists granted clemency by president clinton last september in a firestorm of controversy , mr rosa , 39 ,

until now more a cause than home the 11 were linked to a militant group that sought independence for puerto rico , an american commonwealth with limited selfgoverning powers and while what they still call their armed struggle against the united states is widely condemned on this island of 38 million residents , many puerto ricans have welcomed them , some as patriots , but most as people who have been punished and deserve a second chance they should not be stigmatized , said dorlizca irizarry , 60 , who unexpectedly found eight of the former prisoners at mass recently as guests of the archbishop of san juan , roberto gonzalez they should be supported so they do n't fall again the 11 received sentences of 35 to 90 years after convictions in the early 1980 s for seditious conspiracy and other charges in the plotting of bomb attacks and armed robberies to finance violent activities against the united states government while none were convicted of any crimes that resulted in death or injury , the 11 were accused of belonging to the armed forces for national liberation , known by the spanish initials faln , a group that waged an armed campaign in the 1970 s and 1980 s to end what it saw as puerto rico s colonial status federal lawenforcement officials tied the group to more than 100 bombings in the united states and at least six deaths for those like mr rosa , the passion for puerto rico developed in the neighborhoods and households of chicago and new york city where spanish was spoken and puerto rican culture nurtured in separate interviews , mr rosa and five of the other former prisoners said their political commitment had been infused by personal experiences with segregation and discrimination in the united states , and the conclusion that puerto rico s economic problems and the need of puerto ricans to migrate north stemmed from the island s status as an american possession we identified the situation in puerto rico as the root of the problems of puerto ricans in the states , said carmen valentin , 53 , a former assistant school principal in chicago who was arrested with several of the others in a stolen van in evanston , ill , in 1980 the nationalists said an armed movement seemed a logical way to advance the cause of independence in the wake of the civil rights movement and with revolutions brewing in latin america the view that violence was a legitimate weapon , the nationalists and other independence supporters noted , also sprang up in response to the puerto rican government s repression of independence efforts on the island this pattern of harassment was acknowledged recently when gov pedro j rossello , of the prostatehood new progressive party , publicly apologized and offered restitution of up to 6 , 000 each to thousands of puerto rican independentistas and others who were spied on as subversives by a police intelligence unit starting in the late 1940 s mr rosa , who at the time of his arrest in 1980 was a college student , said he saw violent action as a necessary propaganda tool to draw world attention to puerto rico it was louder than a march , he said but in the eyes of federal lawenforcement officials , victims of faln bombings and critics in the united states and puerto rico , the nationalists were nothing more than terrorists in granting clemency , president clinton said he considered humanitarian factors like the severity of the sentences \( insisting they were prisoners of war , most of the nationalists did not present a defense at their trials \) but the offer set off fierce criticism that mr clinton risked reinvigorating the puerto rican clandestine independence movement , and speculation that the president was trying to help hillary rodham clinton s senate campaign in new york , which has a large puerto rican population
mark burnett is raising the stakes in reality television he is bringing in the green berets to square off with the navy seals to see who is best at rescuing hostages and eliminating street snipers after setting ratings records with his rateating contestants on cbs s survivor , and then selling nbc on a showdown among wouldbe astronauts for a chance to be shot into space , mr burnett , the leading producer of the reality television genre , has created a new series called combat missions the show , to be announced today and set for next summer on the usa cable network , will pit eight fourperson teams of current or former special forces operatives in an elimination duel built on elaborately staged rescue operations that will have contestants doing everything from dropping by rope from helicopters into staged street battles to taking on faux terrorist groups simulating the takeover of a 747 all accompanied by explosions , weapons fire and other pyrotechnics i'm going to try to make it as real as possible , said mr burnett , himself a former member of the elite british parachute regiment he emphasized that his goal is filmquality pseudoreality that , he hopes , will remind viewers of movies like saving private ryan the program is the centerpiece of a new strategy for the usa network , which has been compelled to remake itself after this season s loss of professional wrestling , by far its highestrated programming mr burnett has also brought his longestrunning program , ecochallenge a team race through a jungle or desert to usa , and the network is clearly hoping to ride its association with mr burnett to new ratings success , as well as a definition of the channel s brand identity rob sorcher , the executive vice president of usa , said the deal with mr burnett is crucial to affirming to the channel s viewers largely young men that usa is the channel for escapist , actiony , adventurey television mr burnett , speaking by phone from australia , where he was wrapping up production on survivor ii , said combat missions would recruit its contestants through a web site going up today he acknowledges the show is likely to be dominated by men and might be a bit violent , though none of the weapons will be real and the situations all carefully mounted simulations mr sorcher said combat missions would be heavily promoted on ecochallenge , which will fill the week of april 1 for usa mr sorcher said , mark burnett is the best in this genre , and it means a lot for us to tie ourselves to him it meant enough for mr burnett to again secure the all but unheard of concession that he will split advertising revenue with the network he has a similar deal with nbc for the space show , and he shared in ad revenue for survivor with cbs i do n't do shows now where i do n't get revenue sharing , mr burnett said bill carter photo mark burnett , executive producer of the reality tv hit survivor \( cbs \)
washington , april 24 there is only one member of vice president gore s staff close enough to call him al it is leon sigmund fuerth , mr gore s longestserving aide , who has acted as his elder adviser on national security matters for two decades the two men know each other so well that , like an old married couple , they can communicate through a grimace or a glance the relationship goes back to 1980 , when mr fuerth , a staff member on capitol hill , tutored the young congressman from tennessee nine years his junior several hours a week for more than a year on the arcana of arms control since then mr fuerth has exercised an important influence on mr gore , whose world view blends a belief in a strong defense , the elevation of issues like illness and the environment to the top of the national security agenda and a moralistic impulse to punish dictators mr fuerth has often stiffened his boss s spine , from pressing early on to use strikes to constrain serbian forces from ethnic cleansing in bosnia and kosovo to taking an uncompromising line against iraq , iran and north korea , which mr fuerth has referred to privately as giant zits on various parts of the body yet for all his influence , including membership in the cabinetlevel principals' committee that advises the president on foreign policy , the onetime foreign service officer labors largely in the shadows he rarely gives speeches or interviews he has written no great tomes he likes to work alone at one point he announced at a news briefing that his goal was to remain nameless , faceless and odorless at another he told aides that his ideas belong to the vice president mr gore praises that approach as positively quaint and has hinted that he may name mr fuerth as national security adviser in a gore administration he has a keen intellect , a strong character , absolute integrity and excellent instincts , mr gore said in a telephone interview there is a certain quaintness to his insistence on taking as little credit for anything he can possibly push off to others , quaintness in the sense not that it is odd in fact , i wish it were more common in today s world that quality is all too rare asked about time magazine s prediction last year that mr fuerth was a cinch to be national security adviser in a gore administration , mr gore at first stuck to his rule not to discuss potential advisers but then he added , if i were to break that rule for anybody , it would be for leon certainly quaintness is not a word that springs to mind in describing former national security advisers henry a kissinger or zbigniew brzezinski and when asked what mr fuerth would be like in the job he once held , mr kissinger replied , i'm afraid i do n't know the man advisers to gov george w bush of texas have already begun to criticize the vice president and his top national security aide by criticizing the performance of the clinton administration a hallmark of the clintongore foreign policy has been ad hockery and casebycase actions lacking in strategy , said robert zoellick , an under secretary of state in the bush administration so despite mr fuerth s passion for anonymity , he inevitably will be drawn into the spotlight in a presidential campaign in which mr gore is increasingly contrasting his foreign policy experience with that of mr bush and that could be uncomfortable for the 61yearold mr fuerth , who has spent his entire career inside government and has never had to develop an ear for politics by contrast , samuel r berger , president clinton s national security adviser , who is known as sandy , knows how to shape foreign policy to fit politics sandy came to the job as a political pro and had to master the foreign policy part of it , said leslie gelb , the president of the council on foreign relations who has known both mr berger and mr fuerth for years leon came to the white house as a foreign policy expert and he now has to master the politics early in their relationship , mr gore created a division of labor that both insist suits them fine he told mr fuerth to provide advice on what was good for the country and leave the politics to me \( on super tuesday , when it became clear that mr gore would secure the democratic nomination , mr fuerth was not in nashville celebrating and did n't want to intrude by calling he sent a note of congratulations instead \) but that division means that mr fuerth can sometimes be out of the political loop in an interview on march 30 , for example , mr fuerth was asked how his boss would resolve the case of the 6yearold cuban boy , elian gonzalez the administration s position and the vice president s position consistently are to navigate where the boy s best interests are , mr fuerth said and in our system , the courts are the best place to get this task done at almost the same time , mr gore was proposing a legislative solution that could have allowed the boy to remain in the united states by mr fuerth s own admission , he was unaware that mr gore had decided to change course that day
although he lived several miles away , malcolm ferguson had , for good or for bad , adopted boynton avenue in the bronx , where he was shot by a police officer on wednesday night , as his home two or three days a week , typically beginning in the late morning , mr ferguson would hang out on the block of brick apartment buildings in the soundview section , residents said he usually stood in front of 1045 boynton , often listening to music on his headphones , at times playing dice with his friends , and often , according to investigators , dealing drugs five times in the last five years , mr ferguson , 23 , had been arrested on the block and charged with felony drug crimes two of the arrests occurred in the fourstory building in which he was shot the police said there had been 86 drugrelated arrests in that building in the last three years investigators said that on wednesday night , when the police searched mr ferguson s body , they found six packets of heroin hidden in his clothes but if the police viewed mr ferguson as a haunting presence , many residents of boynton avenue said they saw him as far from threatening they described him as a quiet , easygoing man who never carried weapons , often carted groceries for people and took to selling drugs as a last resort in a difficult life he was not a problem , said pura purvis , 20 , who said she was a friend of mr ferguson s he was quiet he did not bother nobody he just did what he had to do to survive , to get money amy lopez , 38 , a nurse who lives in the building where mr ferguson was shot , said he had a record , big deal they shot him like he was a dog mr ferguson had been arrested nine times , the first time for burglary in 1994 , when he was 17 he served three separate terms , the longest one seven months , in state prison during his first term , he enrolled in a shock incarceration program , a militarystyle boot camp for offenders in monterey , ny but four months after graduating in august 1996 , he was arrested on drugrelated charges mr ferguson was incarcerated two subsequent times when the authorities revoked his parole after his arrest on drug charges his latest prison term ended in january when he was released from a city jail after serving three months he was still on parole when he was shot mr ferguson s most recent arrest occurred last friday when he was charged with disorderly conduct at a demonstration protesting the acquittal of the four police officers who shot amadou diallo malcolm had a conscience , and that s the reason he participated in the nonviolent diallo protests , said luther williams , a lawyer representing the ferguson family mr williams said the police mistreated mr ferguson last year , when his hand was broken while he was being handcuffed at the 43rd precinct station house the police ignored his injury , he said it was n't until he got to the bronx house of detention when corrections officers noticed and sent him to the hospital the police would not comment because they said the accusation was part of a pending lawsuit none of mr ferguson s arrests were for violent crimes , although the authorities said he had been involved in two prison fights for which he was punished with confinement to his cell and a loss of privileges although drugs are a problem on boynton avenue \( there have been 144 drugrelated arrests on the block since 1997 , the police said \) , many residents defended mr ferguson he was a cool guy , said jose augustin , 21 he was always around the building when we came out and stuff he never started trouble when he 'd see me coming down the street with my baby and the carriage , he 'd help me often mr ferguson spent time watching music videos with friends in the secondfloor apartment of the building where he was shot he used to sit there in the corner and play with the kids , and would n't say a word , louise classen said ms classen s cousin , libertad franco , said mr ferguson was so gentle she had named him the godfather of her 3yearold daughter , for whom he routinely bought things , like a stroller and clothes he was always there for me , said ms franco , 22 but even those who described themselves as mr ferguson s close friends could not say how he had made his money the police said they executed a search warrant in ms classen s apartment last month and recovered 95 packets of heroin they also arrested two men , julio reyes and william cadiz , who were with mr ferguson just before he was shot mr ferguson s own home was a fivestory walkup on east 135th street in the bronx , overlooking the bruckner expressway , where he lived with his mother , juanita young , his two sisters and one of his two brothers the boy was human like you and me , his mother said last night they did n't have to kill him several friends described mr ferguson as slow , saying that he often spoke in a halting manner and sometimes had a hard time remembering things but school officials said he had attended adlai stevenson high school for several years and had received his high school equivalency diploma in 1996 mr williams said that mr ferguson had been talking about going back to school to become a paralegal one former employer , michael bharath , 25 , said that mr ferguson had spent a year washing cars at his former business , bronx auto spa , about two years ago he was a very nice kid he would n't bother anybody , mr bharath said this is the projects , but that does n't make them animals it does n't make them killers photos juanita young leaving the bronx apartment building where

santa ana , colombia on a verdant farm carved from thick jungle , leonardo arevalo raises 7 , 000 fish , a small herd of cattle and plenty of yucca and corn yet , in eight years of farming in this corner of southern colombia , mr arevalo says with a tired look , none of it has brought him much of a living then there are the five isolated acres lying far off the main road , where mr arevalo raises the only cash crop to speak of in this region coca harvested every three months , the bright , green leaves are sold for processing into coca paste , the gummy base for cocaine coca growing has not made mr arevalo rich , but the earnings have helped feed his family by early december , mr arevalo and thousands of farmers on the rolling hillsides near this tiny farming community will agree in writing to become the first to take part in an ambitious government program that calls for them voluntarily to replace coca plants with legal crops , or risk having their farms destroyed the plan , supported with american funding , is a crucial component in the government s 75 billion effort to eradicate coca in this prime coca region and thereby weaken the rebels , who use coca profits to finance their guerrilla war during a long period of time , the strategy in this battle was based on the idea of fumigation , and now what we want to do , from a strategic viewpoint , is increase the importance of voluntary interdiction , said gonzalo de francisco , president andres pastrana s special adviser on the putumayo province , where the program is beginning what we 're hoping for is that they will work the land with other crops until they have no more room for coca under the plan , eligible farmers those with less than eight acres of coca would immediately replace their coca with corn , plantains or other subsistence crops later they would cultivate hearts of palm , black pepper , fish or medicinal plants for the export market the government , in return , is promising subsidies and technical help and tens of millions of dollars to pave roads so farmers can take their crops to market , and to build plants to process crops for sale worldwide if successful , the program would be repeated across putumayo and beyond , lessening dependence on the aerial spraying that will still be used to destroy large coca fields cropsubstitution , however , faces an array of difficult challenges in this vermontsized province , home , the government says , to about half the nation s 255 , 000 acres of coca first , government officials do not know how the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , the rebel group that has taken control of many roads in putumayo , will react the rebels see the program as a strategy aimed at defeating them then there are the farmers' deep suspicions about the government in putumayo , a poor and isolated province of farms and dusty towns carved out of amazonian jungle , farmers remember how a government agency in 1996 prodded them to give up coca for the spiny palm trees that produce heart of palm in mr arevalo s case , he replaced his coca with 10 , 000 palm trees today , the trees palmitos , in spanish are fully grown a swipe of a machete reveals the soft , white insides , popular in salads at upmarket american and european restaurants so far , however , not one of mr arevalo s palmitos has made it to market because the processing factory the government promised is only now on the verge of opening they came and they brainwashed me , said mr arevalo , 53 i did so much work on that field that in 14 months i was ready to harvest then , when we had to cut the palmito , we had nowhere to sell eduardo gamarra , who has extensively studied alternative development programs , said weaning farmers off coca with subsidies was nearly impossible in regions like putumayo that have poor soil and marketing structure in chapare province in bolivia , where coca has nearly been wiped out , farmers who were paid to switch to other crops often kept growing coca , mr gamarra said , and outsiders attracted by subsidies started arriving success only came after bolivian army troops forcefully destroyed the coca plants , he said when you cost in all the money you 're going to invest , this is not the most rational marketdriven mechanism , said mr gamarra , director of the latin american and caribbean center at florida international university in miami colombian and american officials acknowledge the obstacles , but they already cite modest success in eradicating heroin poppies in colombia through alternative development in the last year , a 15 million americanbacked program run by the united states agency for international development has led to the voluntary eradication of 1 , 500 acres of poppies , out of 20 , 000 acres nationwide george wachtenheim , director of aid in colombia , said the program could work in putumayo in large part because the farmers are being presented with a stark choice replace coca or pay the consequences the threat of forced eradication has to be just as credible as the offer of assistance , said mr wachtenheim , who worked on similar projects in peru and bolivia we found that one does n't work without the other , neither the stick nor the carrot they really do need to go hand in hand , and that s the approach that the colombian government has crafted
four years ago , manhattan prosecutors won a conviction in the case of a white new york transit police officer who mistakenly shot and wounded a black colleague on monday , as district attorney robert t johnson of the bronx defended his office s unsuccessful prosecution of the officers who killed amadou diallo , he was asked why he did not use similar tactics in the diallo case although the two cases involved different circumstances and evidence , there were some common elements , and the prosecutions reflected the varying strategies district attorneys can adopt in handling a disputed police shooting in the manhattan case , prosecutors essentially aimed low , hoping to win a conviction on at least some charge they asked for and got a special instruction from the judge that the jury consider whether the defendant , officer peter deldebbio , might have been justified in firing some of his five shots , but not the rest the jurors acquitted officer deldebbio of the most serious charge , but convicted him of seconddegree assault , saying the issue was excessive force in the diallo case , prosecutors aimed high they argued to the jury that the officers were not justified in firing any shots they requested no special instruction to the jury that they consider whether the officers were justified in firing some of the 41 shots , but not all of them the officers were acquitted of all charges at a news conference on monday , mr johnson said that asking for such a charge might be too confusing to the diallo jury every shot was unjustified , he said , sticking to the prosecution s central argument amadou diallo was in a lighted vestibule he did n't have a weapon the officers approached him every shot was unjustified the august 22 , 1994 , shooting of officer desmond robinson on a crowded manhattan subway platform prompted debate over racial bias in the police force officer deldebbio said he fired at officer robinson , an undercover officer who had drawn his gun , because he thought he was a criminal running toward him but prosecutors said officer robinson was hit four times in the back by officer deldebbio s shots and the officer admitted pausing between firing his first two shots and his last three assistant district attorney raymond castello argued that none of the shots were justified , but that once he fired one or two , he had no right to continue to fire at officer robinson over the objection of officer deldebbio s lawyer , judge bernard fried instructed the jury to analyze each shot separately you may conclude that the defendant reacted reasonably in firing all of the shots or in firing none of them , the judge said you may also determine that he reacted reasonably in firing some of the shots and unreasonably in firing the remainder of the shots whether such an instruction would have had any impact in the diallo case , or whether the judge would have agreed to one , is unclear the cases appear similar prosecution witnesses in the diallo case , for example , also described a pause in the shooting but involved vastly different evidence in the deldebbio case , the accused officer admitted pausing during his shots in the diallo case , officers sean carroll and edward mcmellon , who each fired 16 shots , said they did not remember any pause officers kenneth boss and richard murphy , who fired five and four shots each , said they thought they had only fired two rounds each forensic evidence also handicapped prosecutors in the diallo case ballistics experts were unable to link all of the 41 shots fired to specific officers photo officer peter deldebbio at the 1996 trial in which he was convicted of seconddegree assault in the shooting of a colleague \( don hogan charles the new york times \)

sao paulo , brazil , may 28 when rumors circulated last month that the american company starmedia network might be acquired by terra networks , the internet industry found the story plausible after all , starmedia , based in new york , had one of last year s hot internet stock offerings but had seen its shares fall precipitously and its web portal , which since 1996 had been the premier gateway to material on the internet in spanish and portuguese , was facing increased competition in latin america the pressure has come from both local and international multimedia giants like terra , which is owned by spain s largest telecommunications company , telefonica terra , in fact , had already bought up a handful of internet service providers in latin america to challenge starmedia as the region s biggest player but terra was weak on content the news , information and entertainment that is starmedia s specialty so on the face of it , a deal made sense even if starmedia continued to insist that it was holding no talks with terra as it turned out , starmedia s denials were genuine two weeks ago , terra did make a content play a 125 billion deal to buy lycos , an american web portal with international reach so now , rather than having a partner , starmedia must contemplate an even bigger , more powerful rival in the latin american internet market starmedia s charismatic 33yearold founder and chief executive , fernando j espuelas , is not one to voice anxiety , though in sao paulo recently for the introduction of the company s redesigned portal , starmedia 60 , he brushed off worries of growing competition in latin america it is our leadership to lose , and we are not going to lose it , said mr espuelas , a native of uruguay not because we are preordained to win , because nobody is but we move very fast we know this business very well it is the only thing that we do , and we did our homework we built a brand when those companies did n't believe in the internet yet , despite its early leadership in the latin american market , the uncertainties are mounting for starmedia in the last year , huge international players like terra and america online have made latin america s growing internet market a major priority and many of the region s dominant media and telecommunication companies are also devoting huge resources to building up internet businesses some analysts say starmedia no longer has what it takes to compete alone in the new highly competitive latin american internet market what looks on the basis of 1999 numbers as a commanding lead , will , on 2000 numbers , look like starmedia is one of many rather than a clear leader , said lars schonander , a media analyst in mexico city for the investment bank ing barings and investors are hardly sanguine about starmedia s stance after mr espuelas announced in march that the company would confront its growing competition by increasing its marketing spending by 12 million in the first half of the year , the stock plummeted 33 percent in one day even before that announcement , starmedia was well off its high of 70 , reached last july , six weeks after its public offering recently , with the oscillations in the nasdaq market , the stock has fallen even more , closing at 150625 on friday until recently , starmedia had seemed to lead a charmed existence mr espuelas met the company s cofounder , jack chen , in the sixth grade both of their families had recently immigrated to greenwich , conn mr espuelas s was from uruguay , and mr chen s was from china as children , they took english classes together as teenagers , they jointly won a high school debate championship while still in his 20 s , mr espuelas took a vacation in the nepalese himalayas it was there that he visualized what would become the underlying goal of starmedia to knock down cultural barriers in latin america through universal internet access the whole cliche about why would an argentine care about a chilean is just not true , he said it is part of the same type of propaganda that has been fed to us for 200 years about why there should be separate countries now , we are faced with a generation in latin america in which 60 or 65 percent of the people are younger than 24 years of age this is truly the internet generation and this generation will grow with a completely different set of experiences in 1996 , mr espuelas quit his job as managing director for marketing for att s latin american operations along with mr chen , who was by then a wall street investment banker , he moved back to connecticut to start starmedia out of the chen family s house noting the success of yahoo in the united states , the two men designed starmedia as a socalled content aggregator starmedia would build a gateway to various spanish and portugueselanguage web sites rather than go through the costly process of creating its own sites at the time , latin america was barely on the internet radar screen starmedia used a storm of local television commercials to make itself a household name in the region and while latin america s nascent internet service providers struggled to build the network

to the editor brendan lemon s article for pittsburgh , the latest stage in a long revival dec 26 was a very comprehensive review of the pittsburgh cultural trust s mission to revive pittsburgh s cultural district one aspect of the renewal that i would like to elaborate on was the role of the late jack heinz and the continuing support of the heinz endowments in both preserving the district s architectural past and reinventing its future the impetus to create the cultural trust began with jack heinz s dream that the arts could become an economic catalyst for the redevelopment of the 14squareblock area now known as the cultural district his efforts led to a longrange plan that focused on preserving many architecturally significant structures , including theaters within the district , developing new gallery and public green space , creating a catalyst for further commercial development and attracting a greater number of visitors to downtown the heinz family particularly jack heinz s son , the late senator h john heinz iii and the senator s widow , teresa and the heinz endowments continue to be one of the largest supporters of the cultural trust s efforts , and with incredible results as mr lemon noted , our longrange plan was devised in almost curatorial fashion by the pittsburgh cultural trusts with help from an advisory committee of local arts experts and has undergone many modifications since then none of this would have been possible without jack heinz s original vision carol r brown pittsburgh the writer is the president of the pittsburgh cultural trust
nearly a year after the american bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade during last spring s nato air war against yugoslavia , the central intelligence agency has done its part to investigate and punish those who were responsible for the disastrous mistake the question now is whether the pentagon and nato will look as squarely at their own roles while the cia made the pivotal error that misdirected the bombs , military commanders failed to review the agency s target selection adequately last week the cia dismissed a midlevel officer whose error led to the bombing six other agency employees received administrative punishments in disciplining these employees the director of central intelligence , george j tenet , properly assigned accountability within his agency the bombing killed 3 chinese and wounded 20 officials at the white house , the pentagon and the cia have maintained that it was an accident , the result of a series of errors that flowed from the use of an outdated map of belgrade the intended target was a yugoslav arms procurement agency instead the bombs hit the embassy , several hundred yards away , though the site of the embassy building was well known in belgrade the officer who was dismissed last week apparently used a yearold , unclassified military map to try to pinpoint the arms agency s location he also wrongly assumed that belgrade s street addresses were numbered uniformly his chosen target was then discussed during at least three meetings among cia officials , none of whom questioned his identification process instead they passed it along to the pentagon , which put it on the list of targets to bomb this is no way to pick a bombing target in the middle of a crowded city the cia long ago gave up a central role in selecting bombing targets for the pentagon and was ill prepared to pick sites on its own during the air war mr tenet said last week that the agency lacked formal procedures for preparing and forwarding target nomination packages to the pentagon normal vetting procedures by the pentagon and nato were not applied beijing , which exploited the bombing to stir antiamerican sentiment in china , yesterday dismissed the cia s disciplinary actions as insufficient that may play well in china , but it reflects a stubborn refusal to believe that washington may merely have made a terrible mistake in picking the target mr tenet has had the courage to admit his agency s errors and to hold individuals accountable the pentagon should do the same
the evening was cold , wintry , and the hundreds of people making their way to the bethel ame church on 132nd street in harlem were upset another unarmed black man had been shot dead by the police and almost before his body hit the sidewalk the mayor and the police commissioner were rummaging through court records in search of dirt to smear him with a woman squeezing into a seat in the crowded balcony said , giuliani is a lost soul that s why he behaves so bad a woman in the row behind her nodded in agreement , and added , to no one in particular , he s lucky jesus is merciful the crowd was there to see hillary rodham clinton , who has recognized what should now be apparent to most new yorkers that the continuing excesses of the police department , and the hostile attitudes of rudolph giuliani and howard safir , have raised the level of anger , frustration and fear among black new yorkers to an almost unbearable pitch still , there was no hateful rhetoric at bethel ame on monday night , just a hunger for leadership that would address what had come to be seen as a crisis mrs clinton stepped into that leadership void i reject , with all my heart , she said , the notion that falling crime rates demand the rising mistrust between communities and the police i reject the false choice between effective policing and mutual respect she said , i do not believe that bad relations with the police is a necessary cost of doing the business of keeping our cities safe two things struck me about the scene first , the imagery with the press corps looking on , mrs clinton stood at the microphone and , between bursts of applause , commanded the respectful and even reverent attention of every person in the church those in the balcony leaned quietly forward to catch every syllable it was the kind of attention i imagine was paid to robert kennedy when he made appearances in black neighborhoods in new york in the 1960 s second , mrs clinton spoke the words that should have been spoken by mr giuliani she described the shooting of patrick dorismond as tragic and acknowledged the grief and the anger it has caused she offered her condolences to his family and she spoke repeatedly of the need to forge warmer , closer relations between the police and the communities they serve what we need now , she said , is leadership that brings this city and state together leadership that realizes that the growing mistrust makes it harder for the police to do their job in keeping all of us safe when mrs clinton turned her comments directly toward mr giuliani , she did so with an intensity that had not previously been seen in her senate campaign new york has a real problem , and we all know it , she said all of us , it seems , except the mayor for the sake of our communities , for the sake of the police officers , for the sake of our children , for the sake of all new yorkers the mayor must stop dividing this city there is no evidence that the mayor can rein in his compulsive hostility and begin the critical work of bridging the chasm between his administration and black new yorkers mr giuliani is widely despised by blacks in this town , and that seems to be fine with him he is disliked by the young and the old , the wealthy and the poor , everybody it may be that mr giuliani is right , and that none of this is his fault , and that all of the black people in new york are wrong that may be the case , but i doubt it meanwhile , there appears to be a growing unease with both the policies and personality of the mayor among white new yorkers who previously supported him mr giuliani s relentless and pointless demonizing of mr dorismond has dismayed a lot of people who previously were willing to cut the mayor a great deal of slack the writer robert caro was quoted in this week s new york observer as follows my visceral reaction was revulsion i'm not even talking about whether the mayor is right or wrong i'm talking about this rush to make these statements there s an injustice in the haste it reveals something about his governance that is deeply disturbing and will have very longterm consequences
i recently read a newspaper article about a vermont farmer who has found a way to make his unprofitable family farm profitable he sold his milk cows and started leading tours of the farm , obligingly chewing on pieces of hay for photographs the simple old life is gone , the farmer was quoted as saying it do n't fit in today s world our crop is fleecing the city folks the president of cbs , leslie moonves , could n't have said it better like the vermont farmer , mr moonves has cast his lot with pseudoreality and brought us city folks survivor , whose first episode was broadcast on wednesday night as you must have heard , survivor is a reality game show in which 16 men and women are stranded on an island in the south china sea , with a television crew to record their travails \( travails , of course , are crucial to the enterprise otherwise , why watch \?

hamburg , germany for the last remaining superpower , it is time to ask the ed koch question , how am i doing \? the answer is , ok , but not great ten years after victory in the cold war , the united states is still no 1 by any conceivable measure but the lesser actors russia , europe , china are beginning to make true what history and political theory have predicted all along great power will generate ganging up nos 2 , 3 and 4 will seek to balance against mr big just last week , president vladimir putin of russia swept into berlin , where he deftly executed a classic gambit of muscovite diplomacy this is the ageold attempt to forge privileged relations with germany , the traditional holder of the european balance he wooed , and he won germany , mr putin intoned , is russia s leading partner in europe and the world chancellor gerhard schroder cooed back he , too , was all for a strategic partnership with russia one motive is obvious both europe and russia intensely dislike the american missile defense project , and for good reasons if it works \( which it wo n't for many years , if ever \) , the son of star wars will further magnify american dominance by devaluing the nuclear arsenals of russia , china and europe no wonder mr putin and mr schroder together trained their guns on the antimissile bubble in the sky the more general thrust is obvious , too the purpose is not to resume the old game of the 18th and 19th centuries , which was to harness alliances or even go to war to lay low the hegemonist du jour it is to contain and constrain what the lesser powers see as excessive clout on the part of no 1 in the past , the united states was rarely mentioned by name russians and chinese kept inveighing against a unipolar world and a single model of culture the enemy was hegemonism and repeated imposition by youknowwho now , as usual , it is the french who thunder where others grumble foreign minister hubert vedrine likes to call the united states a hyperpower given to unilateralist temptation because there is no counterweight last week , the european union s external affairs commissioner , chris patten , made it explicit europe had to grow into a serious counterpart to the united states in fact , that process is well under way according to the german foreign minister , joschka fischer , monetary union , begun in 1999 , was an eminently political act by which europe had opted for an autonomous path shamed by its impotence in the kosovo bombing , the european union last december vowed to field an intervention force of 60 , 000 capable of slugging it out without the united states none of this should come as a surprise subtly and cautiously , the lesser players are acting out the oldest game of nations primacy provokes , and power begets power what is no 1 to do \? the most critical item is a change of consciousness america is so far ahead of the crowd that it has forgotten to look back yes , the president and his minions are diligently working the global diplomatic circuit public opinion , as the surveys keep demonstrating , remains internationalist but congress has come down a long way from the days of senators arthur vandenberg and j william fulbright now , it is obliviousness with a dollop of yahooism why else would congress have foisted star wars , the sequel on president clinton without looking at the feasibility \( low \) , the costs \( very high \) and the toll on american leadership \( soaring \) sure , when you are eyeing that megamerger or ipo bulging with zillions , the rest of the world looks both boring and ornery but this world this wondrous system of open trade and collective defense that the united states built in the 1950 s wo n't manage itself nor will it long withstand america s unilateralist reflexes like the missile defense system or the micromanagement of the kosovo war by the joint chiefs of staff obsessive secondguessing by the brass back in washington not only riled european souls , but also humiliated the nato commander at the time , wesley clark , who happens to be an american why stick to the alliance if it becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the pentagon \? one assumes that the last remaining superpower will want to remain one but if so , the united states might recall the best tradition of its postwar grand strategy it was n't just sheer size and weight that shaped this most brilliant chapter of american diplomacy it was the bipartisan conviction that power comes with responsibility , and that responsibility must defy shortterm selfinterest or the domestic fixation of the day hence that marvelous alphabet soup of international institutions from nato to gatt and the imf that turned america into the indispensable power celebrated by madeleine albright why \? because this no 1 was the first in history to lead rather than rule others followed because the united states was a supplyside hegemon it provided the world with essential public goods like stability and free trade to heed the needs \( and sensibilities \) of others is the best defense against ganging up , and that is as true in domestic as in international politics great leaders shun both imposition and indifference the proper maxim for mr big is do good by others to do well for yourself great powers remain great if they promote their own interests by serving those of others drawing \( matthew martin \)
it s impossible to create a group dance when no one will attend a rehearsal but that was jody oberfelder s plight when she was stationed at her home in the far eastern reaches of long island last summer , and none of her dancers had the time to make the trip the 46yearold choreographer had no choice but to devise a solo , which ordinarily would have been a fine compromise however , in this case , she was working on social dances , a suite of 10 short works that explore the yearning to move with and be moved by other people understandably , it was n't going so well i took a long walk on the beach and not only enjoyed the pleasure of being alone , but i found that even when i'm alone , i'm in relationship to everything around me , ms oberfelder recalls it came to me that social dance is n't necessarily about needing a partner , but about how you are always a partner to everything around you that realization was the catalyst in creating social dances , a group work commissioned by dixon place , now at the former vineyard theater on east 26th street , where it will be performed friday and saturday nights and sunday afternoons through jan 30 more than a reworking of traditional social dances , the piece delves into the emotions of a lifetime alternately playful and tender , with combative moments of pure aggression , social dances occasionally hints at ballroomdance forms like the tango set to music by steve elson , tin hat trio and the french dj dmitri from paris , it even includes a few hilarious disco moves but for the most part ms oberfelder is interested in creating new forms intrigued by the infinite possibilities of partnering , she is adept at manipulating herself , her five dancers and five guest performers into intricate knots , then unleashing them with powerful acrobatic lifts and throws it s that fearless approach to movement that attracted dixon place s director , ellie covan after ms oberfelder performed at the space s openingnight gala last september , ms covan offered her a commission her dances are so highspirited , so enlivening , ms covan says but she also uses the limitations of a small space well she flies through the air and bounces off walls in a very light way i thought it would be exciting to present something so intensely movementoriented it s inyourface dance in many ways , ms oberfelder s wild approach to social dances is a reaction against her view of the competitive ballroom dancing scene i see women in those competitions wearing ball gowns with numbers on their backs and horrible plasteredon smiles , she says i want to go beyond that and get to the humanness and throw in momentum , weight and motion and spirit in her new piece , in which the longest section is less than six minutes , she is attempting to show that social dancing is not just a waltz at a family wedding but also the small dances people experience constantly , whether it s a couple going through the motions of a longtime relationship or a fleeting interaction with a deli cashier ms oberfelder , who danced in the 70 s and 80 s with phyllis lamhut and pooh kaye , has searched for ways to reach a broader audience without becoming mainstream by creating works that investigate personal issues with candor she looked at being a mother and a dancer in motherlode she explored the sensuality of pregnant women in expectant tango but a great degree of the honesty her work exudes is a result of her disdain for what has become somewhat commonplace in the moderndance world the blank , expressionless performer sometimes i think that dancers do n't want to look like fluff , so they have to be very serious when they perform , she says it s like 'look at me i have integrity' but in a way , it s hard not to be passionate when you dance that approach may not be for everyone there are some techniques that are almost an intellectual exercise to dance and to watch but when i dance or watch dance , i want to be moved i want to get goose bumps photo the choreographer judy oberfelder , left , and sara joel rehearsing social dances \( andrea mohin the new york times \)

the civil forfeiture laws that allow the government to confiscate the property of narcotics dealers even in the absence of a criminal conviction have proved to be a valuable weapon against wealthy drug dealers , some of whom fear losing their money more than they fear prison but the laws have also spawned a growing number of cases in which people guilty of no wrongdoing have had their assets seized giving rise to civil liberties concerns , as well as a promising reform movement in congress there is now widespread agreement that the forfeiture rules tilt too far in favor of government power to justify a seizure , law enforcement officials need only make a showing of probable cause that the property is subject to forfeiture , an easy standard to meet the burden then shifts to the property owner to prove that the seized property was not illegally used or acquired last june , the house overwhelmingly approved a measure that would shift the burden of proof to the government , where it belongs it was sponsored by representative henry hyde , the chairman of the house judiciary committee , and representative john conyers jr , the committee s ranking democrat two lawmakers who rarely agree their bill would permit forfeitures only if the government could show by clear and convincing evidence that the property figured in a crime a similar reform measure backed by the leaders of the senate judiciary committee senator orrin hatch , its republican chairman , and senator patrick leahy , its ranking democrat is now pending before the committee it would sensibly set the evidentiary bar for the government somewhat lower than the house , allowing forfeitures based on a preponderance of the evidence the standard that applies generally in all civil cases some of its other worthy provisions borrow from the house bill these include new protections for innocent owners , courtappointed counsel for at least some indigent owners and abolition of the unreasonable requirement that property owners pay a bond for the privilege of challenging a seizure a competing version put forward by senator jeff sessions , the alabama republican , and senator charles schumer , the new york democrat , is favored by the justice department it also embraces the sound preponderance of evidence standard but is too forfeiturefriendly in other respects for example , it retains the bond requirement for claimants , and would allow the government to demand that owners produce documents even before any civil complaint had been filed against them or the government had articulated its reason for suspecting wrongdoing unfortunately , none of the proposals address the impetus for abuse created by the current scheme for sharing forfeiture proceeds between federal authorities and local police still , there is a chance now to strike a better balance between legitimate law enforcement needs and protection of individual rights it should not be missed

the players association , as expected , filed a grievance yesterday challenging commissioner bud selig s suspension of john rocker , then explained why the move did not create a conflict among union members , many of whom have been critical of the remarks by rocker that prompted the disciplinary action selig suspended rocker for all 45 days of spring training and for the first 28 days of the season , and fined the atlanta braves' closer 20 , 000 on monday the players association , in its grievance , said the discipline was without just cause union representatives and labor representatives of the commissioner s office are scheduled to meet tomorrow , when they will establish ground rules for the grievance hearing shyam das , baseball s arbitrator , is expected to hear the case either next week or the week after gene orza , the union s associate general counsel , said yesterday that no player had criticized the union for challenging the suspension , nor did he anticipate any complaints from players there are undoubtedly a number of players , most players , i think , who disapprove of what rocker said , orza said in a telephone interview no one at this hearing is going to say what he said is good but if you talk to players one on one , they have an interest in ensuring that in a sport where they are told to talk to the press , a penalty of this magnitude cannot be visited upon them if they speak all players have a stake in this the association , orza said , has heard from many players since rocker was quoted in a magazine article in december disparaging foreigners and gays , among others most of them are very concerned about what he said , orza said , but none i have spoken to feel a penalty of this nature does n't require a response from the union fighting for rocker , he said , does not represent a conflict for the union there were a lot of players who did n't want us to represent steve howe , but it was n't steve howe it was the principle that was at stake , he said orza was referring to a 1992 case involving howe , then a yankees relief pitcher , who had been suspended for life by commissioner fay vincent after another encounter with drugs the union filed a grievance and won the rocker and howe cases , from the union s standpoint , are perhaps similar to the american civil liberties union representing a neonazi group in its attempt to march in skokie , ill to avoid grievances , commissioners or league presidents have often discussed with the union possible disciplinary action before determining it we had discussions about reaching a resolution on this matter , orza said , but from our end it never approached the magnitude of this penalty based on the results of challenges to previous suspensions , the union would seem to have at least a 5050 chance of winning this one , most likely by having the suspension reduced although the union would like to have the suspension overturned altogether , it would likely consider it a victory if the arbitrator were to reduce the suspension during bowie kuhn s tenure as commissioner , arbitrators overturned or reduced many of his suspensions of players for drug offenses , most notably his 1980 suspension of ferguson jenkins jenkins was arrested in canada and accused of having marijuana in his suitcase in a case that was not drug related , kuhn disciplined alex johnson in 1971 by placing him on the restricted list the union , contending that johnson was emotionally disabled and should have been placed on the disabled list , as a physically injured player is , filed a grievance and won in his action against rocker , selig said he could not participate in spring training with the braves , but could begin extended spring training and participate with minor league teams in the braves' system beginning april 3 that is the date the major league season opens selig said rocker could not play with the braves until may 1
gaza , nov 21 glancing warily overhead , gazans ventured out today to inspect the bombedout police stations , the crippled television studios , the wrecked office suites and the other physical evidence of an unnerving night of missile barrages from israeli helicopters one palestinian was killed and others were seriously wounded in the israeli raids but major property damage appeared to be confined to the designated targets , all of them symbols of the palestinian military establishment that israel contended was complicit in the bombing on monday of a school bus from a jewish settlement in the gaza strip the israeli missiles smashed carsize holes in the headquarters of the palestinian preventive security services , the command center for several local police and intelligence agencies another rocket tore the exterior wall off the thirdfloor office of a local director of yasir arafat s fatah movement , leaving his desk exposed to the mediterranean breeze next to the soccer field in the central training compound for force 17 , mr arafat s elite presidential guard , israeli helicopters leveled a small onestory building that officers there guessed had been chosen randomly a lifesize statue outside of a grinning , khakiclad mr arafat , his pistol holstered and arm aloft in a frozen triumphal wave , remained intact none of the damage appeared crippling to the police or political institutions involved but the psychological impact of the israeli attack was profound , people said here today unfounded but fastspreading rumors of further israeli attacks today sent jittery police officers running from their headquarters this afternoon principals sent schoolchildren home early by nightfall , gaza s normally bustling commercial center was unnaturally quiet as a selfimposed curfew closed shops and kept families indoors the missile volleys started at 6 pm on monday , as power outages plunged gaza into darkness , and continued for three hours , while helicopters hovered overhead the noise was horrible , and all the children were screaming , said zaher yazge , who watched the raid on the force 17 compound from his home across the street his windows were shattered by the blasts today , he and his neighbors gathered outside the force 17 compound to discuss the airstrikes , the internal israeli roadblocks that have cut off gaza city from the rest of the strip , and the israeli import blockages that have them hoarding dwindling supplies of flour , powdered milk and gasoline this is the mind of barak at work , mr yazge said , referring to prime minister ehud barak of israel are we supposed to pay the price for everybody s sins \? mr barak came to gaza today to personally assess what he termed a broad operation against palestinian authority infrastructure in gaza this resolute response has one purpose , he said in a visit to the main israeli army base in gaza , to clarify that violence has a price and that we will not tolerate any form of violence almost simultaneously , a gaza sniper a few miles away shot and critically wounded an israeli settler palestinian leaders reiterated their denials of collusion in the school bus bombing and other attacks against jewish settlers we , as the palestinian authority , have nothing to do with this , muhammad dahlan , the security chief for the gaza strip , said after visiting the missileperforated police headquarters here once considered a behindthescenes ally of israeli security forces in their fight against radical islamist groups here , mr dahlan himself has been singled out by some senior israeli officials for his alleged acquiescence or even involvement in the school bus attack and other recent attempted bombings in the gaza strip at a meeting in jerusalem between mr barak and israeli opposition leaders after the monday night attack , the likud party chairman , ariel sharon , expressed dismay that mr dahlan had not been killed in the raids and called for his liquidation , according to israeli press reports mr dahlan today shrugged off the threat sharon has always been known for doing bloody things against the palestinian people , and now he wants to drink more cups of our blood , he said aggression will not solve the problem blood only produces more blood mr dahlan said he still had a slim hope that negotiations with israel could resume , even if palestinian protests continue we had an intifada for seven years without negotiations , then we had seven years of negotiations without an intifada , and maybe now we can have negotiations with an intifada , he said but mr barak said again today that talks could resume only after a halt to palestinian street violence and terror attacks the school bus bombing killed a schoolteacher and a handyman and maimed three children , siblings who were sitting together at the front of the bus orit cohen , 12 , lost part of her foot in the blast sevenyearold yisrael cohen s mangled left leg was amputated below the knee today the missiles fired in reprisal killed one palestinian police officer and seriously injured several bystanders , including young children and teenagers three youths were treated today at the orthopedic ward of gaza s main hospital for debilitating shrapnel injuries , including samir elsawir , 15 , who was walking past a palestinian government television station when it came under fire by israeli helicopters his right leg was amputated below the knee
like many elite new yorkers , trout are picky about their surroundings unlike carp , which can thrive in the liquid murk of the urban waterway , trout need a cold , clear stream from a pristine source no wonder that biologists say wild brook trout have not been seen in the city for 100 years or more but scientists and volunteers with a private conservation group think they may have found a spot in alley pond park where trout can live the east and west branches of alley creek the first issues from an underground spring , and the second flows from alley pond , on city parkland near the long island expressway and cross island parkway the scientists and volunteers are conducting a yearlong study , which began in may , with 9 , 000 in grants acquired by the new york city chapter of trout unlimited , a national conservation group they are monitoring alley creek for troutfriendly conditions , which , if found throughout the year , will lead to the release of about 200 of the fish into the creek in 2001 or 2002 wayne tusa , an environmental consultant working on the project , said the early data looked promising , meaning the water was cold and clear and swarming with favorite trout foods like mayflies and midges in the spring of 1998 , the group released 200 two and threeinch trout into the creek , then checked on them six months later they found that many of the fish measured six to eight inches an impressive amount of growth but eight months later , none were left mr tusa said this showed that the creek could most likely support trout in the short term , but might have environmental barriers to long life he speculated on the disappearance of the first 200 fish it literally could have been two herons feeding in the stream for a week should that prove to be the case , he said , the group could do something as simple as putting boards across the creek at points as a refuge from birds of prey parks commissioner henry j stern compared the study to a department program that has returned native plants and animals to the city long after they were driven out , like the brook trout , by development or pollution we 're promoting biodiversity by helping these creatures get another start , he said of the luna moths and woodchucks that have been brought back by the program mr tusa said that if alley creek could sustain the finicky brook trout , which once thrived in streams near what is now minetta lane and canal street in manhattan , it would be a sign of new york s recovering ecosystem the symbolic value is enormous , he said jim o'grady drawing \( niculai asciu \)

philadelphia , july 31 even though many republicans worry more about losing the house than capturing the presidency , gov george w bush s team has given the house campaign effort no prime time for the week and indeed just half an hour of throwaway time at midday today but nobody from the congressional wing of the republican party could be found to complain that mr bush was putting his election ahead of theirs representative thomas m davis iii of virginia , chairman of the national republican campaign committee , said the unprime time was just fine , even though the republican majority , with a margin of just 13 seats , is not as good shape as the bush candidacy appears to be the governor is going to be our spokesman , mr davis said , adding that for republicans , bush is a great brand name and 29 of his candidates made the most of their allotted 60 seconds on stage john kline , challenging an incumbent in the suburbs of st paul , walked quickly onstage , promised to return control of our schools to the parents of minnesota and take it away from the bureaucrats of washington , and dashed off back home in eagan , mr kline s supporters watched carefully as a television camera recorded their cheers at joe sensor s restaurant it made the noon news mr kline said later that it was a big help the senate , where retaining republican control seems more likely but the margin of majority is now only eight after the death of senator paul coverdell of georgia , also got a midday halfhour , under the control of its campaign chairman , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky recalling his state s kentucky derby , mr mcconnell valiantly tried to persuade the halfempty hall that there was more than a firstplace bet on mr bush on the board there was a trifecta , a wager in which the bettor picks the first three finishers winning a trifecta takes real skill , mr mcconnell said the true measure of victory in addition to george w bush winning the white house is keeping a republican senate and a republican house mr mcconnell put six candidates forward there were two embattled incumbents , spencer abraham of michigan and rod grams of minnesota , and four competitors for open seats , representatives bob franks of new jersey and bill mccollum of florida , former representative john ensign of nevada and attorney general don stenberg of nebraska and mr mcconnell alluded to one other highprofile race , the one in new york , saying , we 're going to elect a republican to the united states senate who is actually from new york but he never said the words rick lazio later mr mcconnell said in an interview that representative lazio had been offered one of the fiveminute speaking slots for senate candidates but had turned us down in new york , mr lazio s staff said he had better uses for his time he had no public campaign schedule today mr lazio was mentioned , but by his wouldbe house successor , joan johnson , the islip town clerk , who said she would follow in the footsteps of rick lazio with an acute sense of timing , ms johnson , who is black , said , i will make history and as the audience expected her to proclaim herself the first black republican woman in congress , she said instead , i will be the first republican woman ever elected to congress from long island mr lazio s opponent was also mentioned by mr franks , who said his own opponent , jon corzine , was pushing hillary rodham clinton s failed health care plan most candidates sought to tie themselves to mr bush , none more forcefully than mr stenberg , who complained that his argument before the supreme court for his state s ban on a particular type of abortion need not have been unsuccessful if i had one more conservative justice , he said , nebraska s ban on partialbirth abortion would have been upheld president george w bush can make that happen some house candidates had highly individualistic messages sometimes intended to distinguish them from their district s general assumptions about republicans former representative dick zimmer , hoping to unseat representative rush d holt in central and western new jersey s 12th district , cited a strong republican legacy that the environment will be protected for generations to come others seemed to benefit from the speechwriting assistance of the campaign staff faith , family and freedom was a central message for both dunn lampton of mississippi and chuck yob of michigan the lucky 29 seemed thrilled mark nielson , challenging representative jim maloney in southwestern connecticut , said , they say everybody has 15 minutes of fame , and so i know it was only one minute , and therefore i still have 14 left while senators and wouldbe senators were given five minutes , the house hopefuls and representative james e rogan of california , the only struggling incumbent to receive stage time , may not have been aware of the training they were receiving with their one house members most often speak for only a minute , though they get to revise and extend their remarks and make them look longer in the congressional record photos \( photographs by andrea mohin the new york times \)

art and music are finding their way to one another in museums many of the state s museums are discovering that the people who walk through their doors are more sophisticated than ever and exhibitiondriven musical events sell out repeatedly , indicating a hunger for knowledge and a challenged intellect the art concert is a comprehensive , meticulously researched event that has been blessed by a music committee , education directors and the curators themselves while many museums and art institutions have offered performances by chamber music groups and soloists in addition to the exhibitions , as well as films and lectures that pertain to them , rarely has the music been programmed and developed with the art s aesthetic in mind museumgoers now have the opportunity to attend a concert to hear music that , for example , the artist might have heard if the show encompasses an era or school of painting , the concert program will reflect the historic scope whatever the exhibition s theme , there is music to match it and if there is none , museums are comfortable commissioning new works many of the concerts are free and , in some cases where space allows , the music is performed in the gallery itself and sometimes there is a perfect match the norwalkbased american classical orchestra has become the first periodinstrument ensemble to complement an exhibition at the metropolitan museum of art art and the empire city new york , 18251861 opens on tuesday and runs through jan 7 the orchestra s music director , thomas crawford , said he heard about plans for the exhibition two years ago and decided to contact the museum because , in his words , the 19th century is our bailiwick after six months of not having his phone calls returned , he said , he just went to the museum , which asked for a proposal mr crawford said he did a lot of research and stumbled on these two masterpieces that were premiered in new york the two pieces the christmas bells , by charles edward horn , and a christmas symphony , by william henry fry as well as mendelssohn s von himmel hoch will be on the orchestra s concert program on dec 10 in the american wing at the met horn \( a founder of the new york philharmonic \) and fry were prominent new york musicians in the second quarter of the 19th century , mr crawford explained , and mendelssohn was so popular in new york that 10 , 000 people are said to have attended his memorial concert lisa doyle , associate manager for concerts and lectures at the met described the experience this way it s a natural because you are totally immersed in the culture of the time , she said concertgoers will sit in the historic american wing , hear music of the second quarter of the 19th century , performed on 19thcentury instruments played in the style of the 19th century the focus shifts to a different aspect of 19thcentury culture on oct 5 at the wadsworth atheneum where the impressionists at argenteuil \( which runs through dec 3 \) is the backdrop for a session of the hartford museum s first thursday series a celebration of french culture will include music by the impressionist trio , musicians from the hartford symphony orchestra the yale center for british art in new haven has its own artcummusic planned kay desanctis , programs coordinator for the past six years , said she strived to put exhibition and concertgoers in the same context as those who viewed the art when it was new it gives a sense of the period , the times , she said this season the yale center opens with edward lear and the art of travel , running from wednesday through jan 14 lear \( 18121888 \) , one of the great artisttravelers of the victorian age and author of the owl and the pussycat , documented a lifetime of journeys throughout the mediterranean and india ms desanctis said she told tobe malawista , a soprano in mirror visions ensemble , that the center was looking for music that british travlers might have heard when they went to italy or india or egypt the result is a concert entitled a musical journey in the footsteps of edward lear that will be held on oct 15 at 2 pm the baritone richard lalli , who will also play the piano , will be joined by the baritone scott murphree the program features songs and duets from england , france , italy , greece , russia and india new settings of the words of lear will be performed by william ryden , betty roe , richard pearson thomas and mr lalli the program will also feature lear s own musical setting of the words of alfred lord tennyson in conjunction with the yale center s exhibition the school of london and their friends the collection of elaine and melvin merians , which opens oct 11 and runs through jan 7 , ms desanctis has engaged the auros group for new music in november , the ensemble will present a program highlighting the innovators and followers of british contemporary music \( such as birtwistle , turnage and ades \) to parallel the exhibition , which traces the school from its beginnings in 1940 up to the present somehow , when contemporary music is coupled with art , people are more receptive

and definition can be dangerous even the titles of those two professorships near and middle east and near east studies beg questions , as does the title of his new book lewis himself recognizes that the term middle east is meaningless , colorless , shapeless and for most of the world inaccurate , and over the past century has been flexible to the point of emptiness in 1958 lord vansittart wrote that when he was a young diplomat 50 years earlier we had none of the sloppy modernism which lumps everything from the mediterranean to bengal as middle east actually , this was accident as much as sloppiness in political and journalistic parlance it had made sense of sorts to speak of near and far east , with a middle falling between then during world war ii the middle east command of the british armed forces expanded in all directions for operational reasons , and the near east vanished having grown , the meaning of the term has since drastically shrunk in a newspaper , the mideast will likely as not be euphemistic shorthand for the conflict between jew and arab in what used to be called the holy land or more broadly it may intend the levant \( another antique term which could be usefully revived \) , the eastern seaboard of the mediterranean even if , as lewis says , the middle east has no collective identity like europe , india or china , it is nevertheless the spiritual and mystical center of the world for much of mankind , and it is no accident that it has so often been a battleground or that its identities are so complex the nine admirably erudite and illuminating essays in the multiple identities of the middle east discuss these difficulties three primary human identities are acquired at birth , lewis notes blood , place and faith , though these tend to overlap and intermingle with one another and then with further layers of identity if anything , he exaggerates the degree to which this is a specifically middle eastern phenomenon he says that only three countries in the region turkey , arabia and iran conform to what he calls the european convergence of nation , country and language but to call this european is misleading such a convergence may be the platonic ideal of modern nationalism , but in reality portugal is unique in europe as a country whose boundaries have n't changed for several centuries , whose population is completely uniform in religion and whose political territory exactly coincides with language in the middle east , language throws fascinating light on the theme of confused identity in a way that takes a man of lewis s polyglot learning to perceive others will have noticed that asia minor is dotted with deserted greek orthodox churches , sad legacy of the anatolian greeks , who are among this century s all too many collective victims and vanished communities few but bernard lewis would have spotted that the greek inscriptions there are actually in turkish , written in greek characters he goes on to discuss a whole range of such transliterated tongues , comparable with the jewish vernaculars yiddish and ladino \( in origin german and spanish dialects respectively , both written in hebrew script \) other jews wrote arabic in hebrew letters , and christians wrote arabic in the syriac script , while muslims in reconquered spain wrote spanish in arabic script as to place names and their implications , lewis notes correctly that the name palestine was barely used in the place itself between antiquity and the 20th century then 80 years ago , during one of those fits of absence of mind in which the british empire was said to have been created , a government of palestine was established as lewis says , events have removed this government , while creating for the first time a palestinian nation he muses dryly that had the jews disappeared like most of the peoples of antiquity , the palestinians might have claimed to be the heirs of ancient israel , as the egyptians were of the pharaohs and the iraqis of the kings of babylon but the jews did not vanish , they even returned and suddenly we 're no longer talking etymology , topography or history , we are talking politics of a most fractious kind not that there is ever any clear distinction between past and present in the middle east more than most places , the historical is political during the appalling iraniraq war of 198088 , both sides regularly invoked the battle of qadisiyya , fought in 636 or 637 \( as lewis puts it with a scholar s skeptical touch \) and the egyptian soldier who assassinated president anwar elsadat shouted , i have killed pharaoh
east rutherford , nj he seldom scores for that matter , he seldom shoots but he is the devils' constant if the devils are playing , ken daneyko is playing in an era when too many professional athletes jump at the drop of a dollar sign , daneyko is a dinosaur he has not only spent his entire national hockey league career with the devils , he has no desire to play anywhere else when the devils drafted me in 1982 , he said , i did n't know where new jersey was except that it was near new york , but now i could n't imagine playing anywhere else nobody else could imagine that either as the devils lost , 42 , last night to drop behind the philadelphia flyers by two games to one in the fourofsevengame eastern conference finals , their 36yearold defenseman was playing in their , and his , 121st stanley cup playoff game most hockey players are about goals or assists or penalty minutes or shutouts , but daneyko is about games , about consistency and dependability he vividly remembers certain moments in certain games , but he wants to forget about last night s performance we lacked a little jump , he was saying now we were sluggish for some reason they capitalized on their chances and we did n't but we 've got to stay positive this is no time to panic we know now that game 4 saturday night is imperative in losing the last two games to the flyers , the devils hardly resembled the defensive wall that eliminated florida and toronto in earlier rounds , especially the virtually perfect sixth game against the maple leafs only 10 days ago daneyko s 1 , 070 regularseason games rank second \( to detroit s steve yzerman \) among active players with the most career games , all with one team on the alltime list , daneyko s 1 , 070 games are tied for 11th place with , coincidentally , craig ramsay , the flyers' coach who was a forward for the buffalo sabres the leader is alex delvecchio , a center in 1 , 549 games for the red wings , a total that is probably out of reach for daneyko i 'll keep playing , he said , until i lose that passion through the years , that passion has always separated daneyko from most of his 186 teammates growing up in edmonton , he was a 14yearold in a summer hockey school where mark messier , then 17 but already in the world hockey association , was an instructor mess told me , 'i see the fire in you , keep working , ' daneyko said that s what i 've always tried to do just keep working when most hockey players reflect on their careers , they remember a big goal or a big save but daneyko remembered big games when we won the last game of the season in 1988 on johnny maclean s goal to get into the playoffs for the first time , that was the turning point of the franchise , he said , alluding to the struggle of the devils' early seasons i was on the ice when johnny scored but instead of rushing to him , we all just skated around like little kids for a few seconds almost in passing , he added , i scored in that game he has not scored that often only 34 career regularseason goals , none in 74 shots in the recent season only four playoff goals , none since his goal in 1995 , when the devils won the stanley cup with a fourgame sweep of the red wings in the finals after shawn chambers scored with about six minutes to go to just about clinch the cup , he said , i finished that game with tears coming down my face in 1994 , the devils battled the rangers into overtime at madison square garden in the seventh game of a classic conference final series , only to lose on stephane matteau s goal but i was n't too dejected that year , daneyko said i knew and we knew we had left everything out there on the ice i had a lot worse feelings the last two years he meant the firstround playoff losses to ottawa in six games in 1998 and to pittsburgh in seven games a year ago but under larry robinson s firm hand as coach now , the devils resembled a stanley cup contender until last night when larry came here as an assistant coach in 1993 , daneyko said , he really taught me about positioning , how to use your stick , how to deflect pucks , how if you see a big hit , take it but do n't run around wasting your energy daneyko grew up watching robinson , a hall of fame defenseman for montreal and a feared fistfighter when aroused one night i remember seeing larry beat up dave schultz on television , he said , referring to the broad street bullies' prince of the penalty box in that era those things stick in your mind but last night s loss wo n't stick in ken daneyko s mind
mineola , ny , nov 29 after a frantic day of argument and confusion over the size of a proposed tax increase , nassau county officials agreed tonight on a fiscal rescue plan that allows one of the nation s wealthiest counties to avert financial ruin and at least for now prevent a state takeover of its daytoday operations the plan , passed unanimously by the county legislature shortly before midnight , includes an increase of 79 percent next year in the county portion of property taxes an additional 73 for the average household and it calls for an additional 5 percent increase in each of the following three years , or about 57 a year for the average household , said eric naughton , acting director of the legislature s office of budget review the tax increases were a key sticking point in months of often chaotic negotiations among the democratic and republican leaders of the legislature county executive thomas s gulotta , a republican and a state oversight board monitoring the county s efforts , whose leader was handpicked by gov george e pataki but the state board , known as the nassau interim finance authority , threatened to take over the county s finances if mr gulotta and all 10 democrats and 9 republicans in the legislature did not support the plan after the legislature grudgingly went along , at 11 30 pm , the state board issued a statement from its chairman , frank g zarb while there are many management challenges still facing the county , the statement read , this plan may avoid hard controls while nifa continues to assist nassau county in achieving longterm structural balance still , the story of the county s fiscal mayhem in the midst of one of the nation s longest stretches of prosperity is far from over the fouryear plan approved tonight is , for the most part , merely a blueprint although it sets a 2001 budget , the proposals for the following three years could change , especially if a recession hits the region the debtridden county still must allow the state to monitor its finances and future budgets , and it must still make millions of dollars in spending cuts over the next four years if that effort fails , and the county drifts back to the edge of bankruptcy , the state board can swoop in at any time and seize fiscal control from elected officials on dec 8 , the board , at the direction of mr zarb who is also the chairman of the group that runs the nasdaq stock market is expected to accept the plan on the day that they expected to finally approve the plan , county officials were thrown into confusion today over the size of the property tax increase it would impose next year the legislature had planned to vote at 1 pm to pass the plan , which it had worked out with mr gulotta and the state board , unanimously but after waiting through the afternoon for mr gulotta to make final calculations , the lawmakers said he told them that the 79 percent increase he had calculated in next year s county property taxes might be wrong to make the budget work , he said , he thought he might need an 85 percent increase mr gulotta s revision sent county officials back into negotiations but in the end , the tax increase for homeowners was found to be 79 percent after all this is nowhere near the end of the process , said richard m kessel , one of seven members of the state board it is the end of the beginning of the process we made a step forward , but there are many steps left to take before nassau county is on strong financial footing in stronger words , the often battling legislative leaders judith a jacobs , the democratic presiding officer , and mr schmitt , the republican minority leader said the plan fell far short of pleasing them or ruling out future budget problems before the vote tonight , ms jacobs said the plan was far better than any the county had seen in the last decade but , she said , it left democrats in her caucus feeling deflated she said it relied too heavily on revenue that is not sure to materialize from year to year 66 million in a onetime source of revenue and could set the stage for future budget problems democrats had agreed to support the plan , she said , to prevent a state takeover we still believe that the concerns we raised during the budget process will rear their head during the fiscal year , ms jacobs said we do not kid ourselves mr schmitt , who said he would immediately push to freeze wages and win contract concessions from government employees , and seek even further spending cuts in the months ahead , was even more critical he accused the state board and governor pataki of dictating policy to the county s elected officials by insisting that lawmakers pass the plan unanimously a spokesman for the governor rejected that charge the governor made it very clear that he hoped the county leaders would reach a bipartisan consensus that would result in longterm reforms that protected the taxpayers and resulted in a more efficient government , said the spokesman , michael f mckeon how they got there was up to them , so long as it could pass muster with nifa
fairfax , va , nov 2 the slugfest between senator charles s robb , the twoterm democratic incumbent , and his republican challenger , former gov george f allen , turned even more bitter this week when mr robb accused his rival of compiling an intolerable and appalling record on racial issues a blizzard of television advertisements financed in part by outside groups the national rifle association backing mr allen and abortionrights groups siding with mr robb had already slashed away at the positions and characters of the two candidates mr robb , a moderate liberal , heralds his support for abortion rights , tighter gun control and stronger environmental protections mr allen , a hardcore conservative , trumpets his abolition of parole and the revamping of virginia s welfare system , both during his term as governor , which ended in 1998 but mr robb s impassioned plea to the state s black voters , who make up 15 percent of virginia s electorate , has pushed the campaign to a new level in remarks in richmond , mr robb also associated himself with state party officials who circulated fliers attacking mr allen as a racial extremist who opposed a federal holiday to honor the rev dr martin luther king jr once hung a confederate flag in his home and displayed a noose in his law office mr allen was caught off guard by the attacks aides scrambled to say that the noose was a bit of cowboy lawandorder memorabilia mr allen displayed in the early 1990 s by midweek , the former governor was sharply criticizing his rival for senator robb to make that charge in the desperate end of a losing campaign is pathetic the allen campaign also retaliated today by running a radio spot featuring an endorsement from a former state naacp president who once supported mr robb his party s most vulnerable incumbent , mr robb has clawed back into a statistical dead heat in polls democrats say they must win the campaign to keep alive their slim hopes of recapturing the senate robb has to mobilize the democratic base , including africanamericans , and convince moderate republican voters in sizable numbers to come over , said robert d holsworth , director of the center for public policy at virginia commonwealth university in richmond that s a doable task , but it s daunting mr robb is the only democrat holding statewide office in virginia so it is no real surprise that in the campaign s waning days , he is fighting for his political life gov george w bush is expected to carry this conservativeleaning state in the presidential race , so mr robb is relying on democratis allies to stir a base that so far has showed little enthusiasm for him on sunday , president clinton urged parishioners at an africanamerican church in alexandria to vote for mr robb the senator has also belatedly won the key endorsement of former gov l douglas wilder , a democrat who is the country s only black elected governor the two men have feuded , but have closed ranks , as they did in 1994 in mr robb s successful campaign against oliver l north none of this fazes mr allen , a garrulous and pugnacious campaigner they 're sending in all the king s horses and all the king s men , he said i love the challenge mr allen has made the contest a referendum on mr robb s 12 years in the senate , and his one term as governor in the early 1980 s he has sought to tie mr robb to mr clinton at every chance declaring them ideological soulmates who favor big government and even bigger taxes the candidates' contrasting political philosophies mirror their divergent backgrounds and personalities mr allen , 48 , is the son of the former washington redskins football coach george allen a former state legislator and oneterm congressman , he is a natural campaigner whose style reminds many political observers of governor bush mr robb , who is 61 , is a former marine who commanded a rifle company in vietnam and married a daughter of president lyndon b johnson a quiet lawmaker , he tends to delve into the arcane details of budget and military policy mr robb is trying to attract swing republicans with his military background but to his distress , polls show that likely voters trust mr allen more to improve the armed services than mr robb on monday , against the backdrop of the iwo jima memorial , several retired marine generals endorsed mr robb as we look at our congress , we see fewer and fewer members with senator robb s credentials , said gen charles e wilhelm , the former commander of united states forces in latin america a few hours later , mr allen marshaled his allies at the west falls church metro station and ticked off his achievements in fighting traffic congestion , a bane to this fastgrowing region of northern virginia it s clear he had an eye on raising turnout among suburban voters the world , mr allen said , is controlled by those who show up photos polls show senator charles s robb , shown at left at the iwo jima marine memorial , is in a dead heat with his republican rival , former gov george f allen \( justin lane for the new york times \) \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
the martha graham dance company , a pioneering institution of american modern dance , yesterday pulled out of two major festivals and suspended operations for the foreseeable future because of financial problems the announcement was made after a unanimous vote by the board of the martha graham center of contemporary dance , the umbrella organization for the company , its influential school and its junior troupe the center , based in manhattan , would have faced an accumulated deficit of 500 , 000 if it had continued operations this year we do n't have the funds to go forward today , said francis mason , the acting chairman of the center s board we continue to seek those funds this will be a suspension that s what we 're hoping the company was founded in 1929 by graham , a prime revolutionary in the arts of the 20th century and the american dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance her bestknown dances include clytemnestra and appalachian spring , but her overall technique and philosophy were more influential on dance and american culture than any single work she died in 1991 at 96 the dance company , the school and the junior troupe will suspend operations today we have to be responsible , said marvin preston , executive director of the center the suspension will force the immediate cancellation of performances at the american dance festival in durham , nc , where the company was scheduled to open the season on june 8 , and at kennedy center in washington , where it was to have opened a twoweek festival , the legacy of martha graham and paul taylor , in september the company was also scheduled to perform at the joyce theater in chelsea , manhattan , in november charles reinhart , codirector of the american dance festival and the dance programming at the kennedy center with stephanie reinhart , his wife , yesterday described the board s decision as totally irresponsible you cannot cancel performances you contract for just before they happen , mr reinhart said i'm going to try everything possible to make the performances happen we have no other choice financial problems are not uncommon in the world of dance the suspension of activity also has precedents , among them the temporary disbanding of ballet theater \( now american ballet theater \) in the 1940 s and in 1965 since graham s death , her dance company has been under the artistic direction of ron protas , her chosen successor she left him the rights to her work , and her dances are now licensed by the martha graham trust , which mr protas directs the trust will continue to operate mr protas , a nondancer , is considered by some in and outside the company to be divisive but the troupe received positive reviews for its performances under his tenure , and a recent restaging of graham s diversion of angels for american ballet theater was also praised mr protas said that the graham dances continued to be licensed and performed by companies , including the joffrey ballet in chicago last fall , mr protas agreed to give up the position of artistic director of the company to janet eilber , a graham lead dancer in the 1970 s , effective in july the move was made , he said , to institutionalize the company and to allow him to devote more time to the trust , although he would continue to work with the troupe as an artistic adviser in march , the board voted to remove mr protas as artistic director after he began objecting to ms eilber s appointment the board was unable to raise money for ms eilber s firstyear salary she proposed to direct the company from los angeles , where she lives with her family , with the help of terese capucilli and christine dakin , senior graham dancers and associate artistic directors in new york mr protas retains firm control over the company and school as director of the trust , which gives him the legal responsibility for overseeing the quality of both institutions he objected to having a longdistance director and said that he felt the appointment had been a mistake sources in the dance company have said that some government and private donors said they would withhold promised grants until mr protas quit as the company s artistic director , in effect dictating artistic policy it was clearly implied , mr mason said of the reason for withholding the money but he said that mr protas was voted out because of his sudden change of mind about ms eilber an effort to reinstate mr protas , at a board meeting in late april , was defeated 9 to 5 five proxy votes in his favor were not allowed martha entrusted me with her life and her legacy in her works , mr protas said yesterday it is an honor i take seriously i will always act in a manner she would have done in 1998 , the company sold its major asset , its longtime headquarters on east 63rd street , to pay off a deficit of 24 million that left the center with almost no capital the board has been unable to raise money for continuing losses plans to move back into headquarters in a new building on the east 63rd street site were recently canceled because the company had not been able to raise the 150 , 000 necessary to convert the raw space into studios and offices the money is not there , mr mason said this week i 've been to everybody i know who has the resources that will save us between now and the joyce season he said that a national tour that had just ended , the company s first in 28 years , added to the deficit performing raises money , but it also costs money ideally , he said , the company should earn 36 million annually through performing and raise an additional 24 million we 've been limping along on 2 million or less , mr mason said not performing much cutting back performing organizations flourish if they make and spend money , not if they tighten their belts but none of this is new , said mr mason , who joined the graham board in the early 1970 s since 1989 , we have slowly been going broke without realizing it , he said we assumed when martha was alive that everything was going to be all right because everybody was performing and she was there and the money would always come it was tough raising money for martha because she was an older person , and people preferred , perhaps , to give to younger people but once anyone came under her spell , we were in the threehour board meeting yesterday was also attended by some dancers , teachers and staff members some of us are in tears , mr mason said , and some of us would like to be photo the dance company founded by martha graham in 1929 is in financial trouble

mitrovica , kosovo , may 27 the french commander of this volatile town , gen pierre de saqui de sannes , told a visiting united nations security council delegation recently that the place was calm minutes later , before the visitors had even left town , the first stones were thrown in a weekend of street violence that left six french soldiers and one united nations police officer injured , several buildings burned and dozens of foreign cars damaged it is the nature of mitrovica , the last town in kosovo with a significant presence of serbs , to explode without warning , and no one knows better than the general in february , on his second day in the job , the town exploded in the worst night of rioting that the natoled forces , known locally as kfor , has seen since foreign troops arrived in kosovo in june three months later , as he prepared to hand over the job to another french general , general de saqui de sannes conceded that the situation remained extremely delicate and that there was no guarantee against further violence i cannot stop another attack occurring in north mitrovica , he said in an interview there are a number of extremists on both sides it could happen again foreigners who are working here complain that despite 2 , 000 troops , including a contingent from the french foreign legion , and several hundred international police officers , the forces are still not in control of either the albaniandominated southern part of mitrovica or its northern serbian enclave kfor and the un have been unable to become the ruling power here , said a senior officer who works for the organization for security and cooperation in europe they have never been the governing authority , except on paper former members of the now disbanded kosovo liberation army rule the albanian side , and the serbs are in charge in the north , the officer said , adding , there is a climate of complete impunity here that has to be changed some changes have been instituted since the violence in february and march , with troop reinforcements arriving and the appointment of a retired american general , william nash , as the new regional administrator general nash , who has experience as a peacekeeper in nearby bosnia , has injected a certain dynamism into decision making after the violence , he had a stream of people attend meetings in his office and reintroduced joint police and military patrols , a recognition of the poor cooperation that has existed from the street , mitrovica s divisions look uglier than ever the boundaries between the serbian northern district and the albanian areas are now defined by coils of razor wire and sandbagged checkpoints in the name of security , the troops have reinforced the divisions between the two some albanians expelled in february have returned to a designated zone around the ibar river , the waterway that divides the serbian and albanian districts the albanians returned under armed protection and now live behind armor and barbed wire the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates that 60 percent of the estimated 2 , 000 who fled in february have not returned izet jaha , 72 , an albanian , has french soldiers watching over him from an observation post in the house next door while kfor is up there , mr jaha said , we can take our socks off while we sleep if they were not here , none of us would be here the serbs also feel insecure , distrustful of the peacekeepers and the united nations , while fearing that a mass influx of albanians into their district would force them to flee dusko prodanovic , a serbian bank manager who lives a block from the dividing line , said that the increased security was just a charade and that he saw little prospect for peace i think the albanians hate us so much that they do not want to live with us , mr prodanovic said the americans are just waiting to expel us , said his wife , bosanka if the albanians suffered more directly from the violence in february , the serbs have lost out overall , said a member of the osce office here the serbs have lost a lot in these last three months , she said , adding that if the violence had been planned , it was a mistake they managed to expel a few hundred albanians , the member said but the reaction of the international community was very strong against them after trying to negotiate with the serbs to return the albanians and establish a safety zone , general de saqui de sannes did it by force he also used force to push back from one bridge the serbian thugs who keep watch on the river to deter albanians from crossing to the northern side we showed that we will not accept partition , and the albanians feel that , the general said now we must show that we will also not accept that serbs be pushed out general nash arrived last month with a mission to prevent the partition of the city and the northern serbdominated part of kosovo his goal has already shifted to returning the serbs to kosovo the issue we now face today is not partition , but the prosperous and safe return of serbs to their homes the general said in an interview but violence simmers on after the outburst on april 29 that followed the security council visit , one additional elderly albanian couple was evicted from an apartment in northern mitrovica and the serbian bridge watchers remain in charge on the main bridge , threatening albanians and , sometimes , foreigners the international forces have failed to arrest anyone for the killings in the riots in february and the damage on april 29 police cells are full of petty criminals and drug addicts , but the general conceded that arresting the real troublemakers could spark a bigger problem the approach has raised questions about the determination of the french troops to enforce order in the smaller serbian enclave of gracanica , by contrast , swedish troops move in forcefully to arrest troublemakers immediately in commotions a swedish soldier recently shot one man in the leg to deter an attack , and several men have been expelled for three months , said a swedish officer you have to show them force , the officer said otherwise they do n't stop photo

a new survey , prompted by last month s fatal fire at seton hall university , has found that 71 percent of college beds in new jersey are not protected by sprinklers , officials said yesterday the report was presented at a hearing of the state senate law and public safety committee , which then unanimously approved bills requiring that all dormitory rooms have sprinklers and providing 50 million to help pay for them under an amendment to the uniform fire safety act , all dormitories built since 1991 have been required to have sprinklers in each room but the law has allowed older dormitories to go without them none of the sleeping areas at seton hall , for example , have sprinklers , today s report said although the school does have sprinklers in some dormitory common areas , there are none anywhere in boland hall , where three students died in a jan 19 fire that is still under investigation the school has decided to install new sprinklers and improve existing ones the committee chairman , senator louis f kosco , republican of paramus , who also sponsored both bills , said yesterday that he was surprised not so much by the lack of sprinklers as by the fact that no one had ever raised the issue what surprised me , said mr kosco , who has been a legislator for 18 years , is that no one ever approached me to say , 'we need help putting in sprinklers' i 've had college presidents come to me because they need 200 , 000 for an anniversary party the survey , conducted by new jersey educational facilities authority , an agency that issues bonds for college building projects , found that of the 51 , 913 beds in all college dormitories , only 15 , 290 , or 29 percent , were protected by sprinklers it found that the 32 , 807 beds at public institutions were three times as likely 39 percent to 13 percent to be protected by sprinklers than the 19 , 106 beds in private colleges the reason is probably that many more of the dormitories at public colleges were built after 1991 , said jeanne oswald , deputy executive director of the new jersey commission on higher education , the state s collegegoverning body one of the two bills approved yesterday by the senate committee would require all 24 public and private colleges to submit plans for installing sprinklers to the state within six months after a law is passed , and to complete the installation 18 months after that the financing bill would cover half the cost of installation at the state s 14 private colleges , and twothirds of the cost at its 10 fouryear public institutions mr kosco said the measures would go before the appropriations committee before a vote by the full senate about 10 sprinklerrelated bills have been introduced in the assembly , although none have been scheduled for a hearing , said ed rumen , a spokesman for the assembly republicans the survey estimated the cost of installing sprinklers at 59 million that figure was much lower than the 85 million estimated by the public and private colleges themselves assemblyman john v kelly , republican of nutley and the chairman of the assembly housing committee , said last month that the cost for sprinklers could be as high as 300 million mr rumen , the assembly spokesman , said that the figure was little more than a guess , but that mr kelly was still concerned that the amount set aside in the kosco bill would not be sufficient mr kosco said the amount in his bill could be increased as needed
frankfurt , july 21 richard j callahan started his career stringing telephone lines in south dakota in the 1960 s now he is stringing together cable television systems in europe , and he may soon be one of its biggest operators to the astonishment if not anger of many rivals , mr callahan recently outmaneuvered a number of european companies in acquiring germany s biggest cable television system from deutsche telekom he is well on his way to acquiring a second system from telekom , the former government monopoly mr callahan s venture is a local sideshow to deutsche telekom s far more prominent effort to buy voicestream , a cellular telephone company in the united states but it offers an important glimpse into what some see as deutsche telekom s efforts to insulate itself from competition at home , even as it seeks to expand abroad if all goes according to plan , mr callahan and his partners will serve about onethird of germany s 17 million cable customers by the end of this year and like a number of other cable operators , mr callahan has big plans for upgrading his systems to offer telephone service , highspeed access to the internet and interactive television but looming over all these plans is the giant shadow of deutsche telekom itself the upgraded systems would compete directly with deutsche telekom , which has insisted on keeping a 45 percent stake in each cable system indeed , other aspiring bidders complain the german company went out of its way to make sure the cable systems would be too fragmented to pose a serious threat some go further , arguing that deutsche telekom intentionally picked buyers who would be the least likely to cause it competitive heartburn when deutsche telekom announced plans to sell its cable systems two years ago , more than 35 companies expressed interest today , all but a handful of those companies have either dropped out or have been deemed unqualified by deutsche telekom executives indeed , the only people who have actually bought a system so far are mr callahan and a secretive american financier named gary a klesch even more striking , executives on all sides say that deutsche telekom selected mr callahan s bid even though it was lower than one from the investment arm of deutsche bank it s pretty clear that deutsche telekom wanted to keep as much control of these systems as it could , said paul thomassen , chief financial officer of primacom , germany s fourthlargest cable operator , whose bids were also rejected mr callahan declined to be interviewed , saying that the company had just completed a bond offering and was prohibited by american securities laws from making public statements but mr callahan has been quite public about his plans as head of international ventures in the early 1990 s for u s west , the regional bell telephone company , he helped launch telewest , the british cable company that was one of the world s first to offer telephone and cable television over the same system now , backed by investors like the blackstone group and ge capital , callahan associates international is already building advanced cable systems in spain and france and has raised nearly 8 billion to pay for its german venture under orders from antitrust regulators at the european commission , who wanted to see cable systems competing with telephone carriers , deutsche telekom agreed to spin off its cable properties two years ago earlier this summer , mr callahan s group paid about 35 billion for a controlling stake in deutsche telekom s cable network in northrhine westphalia now he is in exclusive negotiations to buy a second german system for nearly 2 billion , which would give him control of about onethird of the german cable television market from the beginning , however , deutsche telekom executives have made it clear they are worried about somebody transforming the cable systems into a nationwide rival of the phone company to block potential buyers from establishing a nationwide network , the german telephone giant divided its national network into nine regions it also insisted on retaining a 45 percent stake in each of the systems , which is enough under german law to veto mergers and perhaps capital increases as well the most startling aspect of the process is the way buyers have been selected executives on all sides of the auction say that mr callahan s bid for the north rhine system was significantly lower than an offer from deutsche bank s investment arm , db investor yet deutsche telekom executives flatly rejected db investor s bid they basically told us they did n't want us to have those systems , because it would make us too big , said one person close to db investor , which had outlined plans to stitch together a nationwide network ulrich lissek , a spokesman for deutsche telekom , insisted that his company had no intention of blocking competition or influencing the cable systems but he acknowledged that the company had not necessarily picked buyers who offered the highest price for us , it is not interesting just to get the best price , mr lissek said the best price says nothing about the future of the company , nothing about the targets of the owner and nothing about the future of the employees those arguments are believable when applied to mr callahan but they strain credibility when applied to the other big winner in the cable auctions , mr klesch
garden city , ny , sept 29 the owner of one long island company has pleaded guilty to cheating workers out of 300 , 000 in wages , and two officials at another company face similar charges that they underpaid workers by nearly 780 , 000 , the authorities said today in the first case , ralph garofalo of huntington pleaded guilty on wednesday to a felony count of scheming to defraud and a misdemeanor count of willful failure to pay prevailing wages the prevailing wage includes union pay , overtime and other benefits required of contractors who work on public projects the charges stemmed from a 1998 investigation of garofalo carting inc , a garbage carting company in brentwood , said james m catterson jr , the suffolk county district attorney as part of his plea , mr garofalo is expected to be sentenced to one and a half to three years in prison , mr catterson said sentencing is scheduled for nov 21 mr garofalo and the company have agreed to pay 300 , 000 in restitution to the workers as part of a settlement with the federal labor department in a separate case , douglas and carolann ryan of massapequa have been indicted on charges that they withheld 779 , 000 from employees of trade wind plumbing inc , mr catterson said the ryans pleaded not guilty on thursday mr catterson said plumbers employed by their company were underpaid between january 1998 and may of this year the workers were assigned to projects awarded by the suffolk county water authority as well as by fire , library and school systems from melville to east hampton , he said the ryans were arraigned on a 160count indictment resulting from an investigation they knew about for several months , said david s smith , a lawyer who represents trade wind plumbing and its principal , mr ryan they have entered pleas of not guilty to all charges , and we are confident that at the end of this case they will be acquitted , mr smith said this is a small company that will survive this unfortunate , lengthy and costly process melvyn k roth , a lawyer for ms ryan , said i think in the end they will be vindicated they are reputable people they run a good business during the investigation , the wife of one of the plumbers told an investigator that her husband worked three jobs just to make rent payments , mr catterson said these are people who are looking for day work , mr catterson said if they get it steady , none of them are in a bargaining position
the united states is increasingly worried that slobodan milosevic , the yugoslav leader , will move militarily against montenegro , the junior republic in yugoslavia , forcing washington and nato into the awkward position of deciding how to react , clinton administration officials said yesterday mr milosevic s possible use of his yugoslav army troops and special forces stationed in montenegro to undermine president milo djukanovic of montenegro or even strike against him was discussed at a white house meeting this week and at nato headquarters 10 days ago , the officials said the fears about mr milosevic s intentions toward montenegro have become more acute since he unilaterally changed the constitution to arrange presidential , parliamentary and local elections on sept 24 mr djukanovic , who has forged a path in opposition to mr milosevic for more than a year , has refused to take part in the elections and has rebuffed pleas from secretary of state madeleine k albright to participate in them mr milosevic has called the elections in an effort to remain in power for an additional eight years , a prospect that particularly distresses dr albright , one of his most forceful administration opponents she has been eager for mr djukanovic s democratic party of socialists to participate in the elections , partly to increase the chances of mr milosevic s defeat and partly to minimize the risk of mr milosevic s using force montenegro has been receiving american financial assistance for the last year if mr djukanovic refuses to participate and both he and the united states have called the elections illegal then mr milosevic will be more tempted to move against him , administration officials said about 15 , 000 yugoslav army troops are based in montenegro , along with 1 , 000 men of the seventh military police battalion arrayed against those forces are 15 , 000 montenegrin police officers loyal to mr djukanovic mr milosevic put the army units on high alert last month while he was changing the constitution this was a reminder of their ability to act with little or no warning , a nato official said as for timing , the yugoslav leader has several options , all potentially embarrassing to the clinton administration in the fall presidential campaign some military action against mr djukanovic after the elections on sept 24 would be most likely , administration officials said at the north atlantic council last week , mr milosevic s designs on montenegro were discussed at some length , a nato official said none of the 19 alliance members had much enthusiasm for any sort of action against mr milosevic over montenegro , the official added nato members saw few parallels between montenegro now and kosovo last year they could not cite a legal basis for intervention , officials said a human crisis in kosovo was used as the rationale for that conflict and with a presidential election in the united states and the declining popularity of prime minister tony blair of britain , domestic political considerations were uppermost the american national security adviser , samuel r berger , said yesterday that he would not speculate about what washington or nato would do if mr milosevic moved against mr djukanovic we support djukanovic , mr berger said we believe he has broad support in nato it would be another mistake for milosevic mr berger stressed that he believed that it was important for the opposition parties in serbia to run as effective a campaign as possible against mr milosevic then , if mr milosevic stole the election , the opposition would have a reason to mobilize street demonstrations against him , mr berger said i remind you of marcos , mr clinton s adviser said that was the beginning of the end in 1986 , ferdinand e marcos of the philippines claimed victory in rigged elections and was eventually toppled through street protests washington has tried to enlist the help of russia , which traditionally has warm ties with serbia , the main republic in yugoslavia , to dampen mr milosevic s ambitions in montenegro to that end , president vladimir v putin was persuaded last month at the group of eight summit meeting in okinawa , japan , to sign a communique that expressed concern about the legality of the elections in addition , the secretary general of nato , lord robertson , wrote to mr putin asking him to dissuade mr milosevic from moving against montenegro the russians have not been cooperative a nato official said yesterday that the russian ambassador to nato , sergei i kislyak , had told lord robertson that mr putin s agreement to the communique in okinawa did not guarantee russian support for it
all s fair in love and politics hillary rodham clinton s latest defender on the talk shows \? suri kasirer , whose husband , bruce j teitelbaum , managed rudolph w giuliani s campaign i 've always been a democrat , ms kasirer said , but she kept a low profile on the senate race while her husband was involved she worked mostly , she said , for vice president al gore s campaign now , with her husband s boss out of the race , ms kasirer is being more public about her support for mrs clinton she turned up on new york 1 news on tuesday , on a panel about jewish voters and the senate race she argued that undecided voters who might have cast their ballots for mr giuliani , are more likely now to support the first lady than her new opponent , representative rick a lazio as they get to know her , ms kasirer said yesterday , they 're going to come back home to the democratic party they 're going to be supporters of hillary clinton is mr teitelbaum surprised that she is saying this \? he knew all this when he married me , she said it did n't come as a shock one of the things i liked about bruce i dated many men who were apathetic they may have been democrats , but they were apathetic bruce and i may at the end of the day support different candidates , but we feel strongly about the importance of being involved , taking an active role thinking ahead of possibilities charlie fitzpatrick , a lawyer in san antonio , tex , thinks mrs clinton should think beyond november of course he would think that he is the owner of the internet domain name www hillaryforpresident com , which he is offering for sale at 100 , 000 or best offer \( none so far , he said \) i bought the web site believing that my cat , hillary , would be a better president than either of my current candidates , mr fitzpatrick said alternatively , if anyone else named hillary chose to run for president in the future , they might find it a useful site for campaigndonation gathering he figured that that someone would be mrs clinton i felt like when giuliani s campaign evaporated , the likelihood of her making the senate increased , he said , so the likelihood of her running for president increased not so , said howard wolfson , a spokesman for mrs clinton s senate campaign absolutely no interest in running for president , he said as for the domain name , he added , i would n't even buy it for a dollar mayor giuliani as a fashion plate mayor rudolph w giuliani , who has displayed a certain onstage flair for crossdressing , was so impressed with the theatrical new hilton times square hotel yesterday that he sounded as if he wanted to put on a dress and kick up his heels again it s much more beautiful than i thought it would be , mr giuliani said at the opening of the hotel , on 42nd street between seventh and eighth avenues and it looks to me like a broadway set , or an opera set so i may actually put on a dress and perform i'm feeling the urge to do that here in a still talkedabout performance , the mayor appeared as rudia at the inner circle show , an annual blacktie gathering that features reporters doing humorous skits about the mayor in 1997 he appeared in a sequined gown , full makeup and a blond wig he appeared in a video with joan rivers at this year s show , reprising rudia , and has appeared as an italian grandmother on saturday night live but maybe the mayor just wants a medallion on the sidewalk alongside four men who design dresses his appearance at the hotel came after he had unveiled the fashion walk of fame , created by the fashion center business improvement district everyone would agree that new york city is the capital of the world for fashion , he declared as he unveiled medallions honoring geoffrey beene , bill blass , calvin klein and ralph lauren the mayor compared them to baseball s babe ruth and ty cobb the medallions have been set in the sidewalk on the east side of seventh avenue between 39th and 40th streets four other , commemorating the designers rudi gernreich , halston , claire mccardell and norman norell , have been placed between 38th and 39th streets james barron with elisabeth bumiller and enid nemy
joe gould s secret is an odd book to want to make a movie of it is a classic of sorts , by one of the most revered of the old new yorker writers , joseph mitchell and until the booklength version was republished recently by the modern library , copies of the original magazine articles , bleary from overxeroxing , were passed around in certain circles like samizdat but the action , such as it is , is largely interior joe gould s secret is sometimes called a writer s book , and not without reason it s a story that in part is about writing , a theme whose track record up on the screen is not terribly encouraging think of those embarrassing scenes in doctor zhivago , with the crumpled papers littering the freezing studio presumably , it was the very literariness and unfashionableness of the story its serious , writerly aspect that appealed to stanley tucci , who produced , directed and starred in joe gould s secret , which opened friday he and his screenwriter , howard a rodman , have created a film version that is earnest and intelligent and , for the most part , painstakingly faithful to the facts but the movie necessarily makes linear what in the written version was double and circular , and in the process the story loses some of its stereotypical quality , in the best sense of the word the depth of field generated by looking at the same thing twice joe gould is a kind of diptych two portraits , written 22 years apart , of the same person gould , or professor seagull , as he was sometimes called , was a familiar figure in the greenwich village of the 40 s , a diminutive , shabby but wellspoken panhandler who cadged money for drinks \( donations to the joe gould fund , he preferred to call it \) by reciting poetry and performing screeching sea gull imitations in 1942 , mitchell , who had made a specialty of such characters gypsies , scam artists , sideshow performers the odd , forlorn , and often quite funny people who lived in the margins of new york then published a famous profile of gould in the new yorker this article , which became the first part of the book , was a lively , mostly cheerful piece , full of offbeat and colorful detail as soundly constructed , william maxwell writes in the book s introduction , as a piece of carpentry no hesitations no bent nails every word driven , so to speak , all the way into the wood the piece made a forceful case that gould was more than your runofthemill eccentric he was the author of an unfinished and who knew , possibly great manuscript called an oral history of our time , a work of roughly nine million words , recording some 20 , 000 conversations , from people of all walks of life , that gould had overheard and faithfully transcribed in 1964 , seven years after his death , the new yorker published mitchell s longer , twopart piece about gould , who , it turned out , had become an ongoing presence in mitchell s life , a source of guilt , annoyance and revisionist misgivings from the very first sentence , the tonality of the new piece was different slower , darker , more meditative and the gould who emerged was less a character than an almost tragic figure , whose life had been filled with yearning and disappointment and selfthwarting readers learned much more about his background as the disappointing son of a welltodo boston physician and as a fishoutofwater member of harvard s class of 1916 and along the way they learned more , too , about mitchell and his own loneliness and hesitations , his second thoughts about gould as maxwell says , this may be the first moment in magazine journalism when we see the emergence of the reporter as human being in a famous passage toward the end of the piece , mitchell reveals something he had suspected , but had n't let on , two decades before that the oral history was almost certainly a fraud , consisting only of a few false starts and endlessly rewritten passages that were n't conversations at all and he goes on to say that he understands just how it was that gould could become half convinced that this great work in fact existed because he , mitchell , had similarly deceived himself for years , he says , he had been working in his head on a vast autobiographical novel , a joycean epic , about his own coming of age in north carolina and his subsequent wanderings in new york but the truth is , mitchell says , i never actually wrote a word of it time passed and i got caught up in other matters even so , for several years i frequently daydreamed about it , and in those daydreams i had finished writing it and it had been published and i could see it i could see its title page i could see its binding , which was green with gold lettering those recollections filled me with almost unbearable embarrassment , and i began to feel more and more sympathetic to gould the book ends a few pages later , but most fans of mitchell know that there is an eerie and poignant coda though mitchell dutifully went to his office at the new yorker every day for the next 32 years , he never published another word
to the editor robert j shiller , the yale professor and author , says one antidote to what he sees as an overvalued united states stock market is to increase the number and varieties of securities , and the markets that trade them \( wealthy market \? yes healthy \? wise \? no , april 30 \) to increase financial stability and personal security , professor shiller proposes markets that would trade new financial instruments linked to the national income of countries , future income of occupation groups and the value of singlefamily homes there are several fundamental problems with his approach to begin with , financial markets require sufficient volume in both demand \( buyers \) and supply \( sellers \) for a similar product \( shares of stock , government debt , soybeans \) none of the derivatives professor shiller proposed meet these basic tests also , the future income of even a seemingly homogenous group of workers like physicians varies far too widely based on employment status \( group practice versus solo \) , specialty , age , location , etc singlefamily homes are notoriously dissimilar and illiquid and the future national income remains an academic concept too often buffeted by political winds additionally , no securities markets exist or are likely to be naturally created for the proposed derivatives so it would fall upon the government to create them investors would be expected to trade unproven derivatives on a market created and supported by government i realize that professor shiller has become the savant of this latest market crisis , but was n't the last market crisis longterm capital s undoing caused by illiquid and unproven derivatives \? stephen grant aiken , sc , april 30
washington , dec 16 gen colin l powell has been lionized in stamps , baseball cards , bronze medals , audiotapes and more than a dozen biographies for children and adults but of all the icons venerating the retired fourstar general over the years , the one than stands out is the limitededition , g i joe action figure that the toy maker hasbro produced two years ago the doll s face is fiercer , its shoulders broader , its waist slimmer and its complexion fairer than the reallife model but it came dressed in a truetoscale uniform decorated with ribbons , insignias and stars and included a press release that lauded general powell as a reallife hero and an inspiration to the children of america now general powell will get the chance to channel some of that star power to a bush presidency as the nominee for secretary of state the first black who will hold the post he brings 35 years of military service with him , including four years as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff both for the bush and the clinton administrations general powell brings savvy negotiating skills honed as deputy national security adviser and then as national security adviser in the reagan administration , where he was a key player at the summit meetings that brought the united states and the former soviet union closer he is the ultimate insider , a policy maker s general , touted as the model of the modern army general in an era when diplomatic finesse seemed as important as combat experience indeed , except for four command assignments , none more than 15 months , general powell served in the power corridors of washington from 1969 until he retired in 1993 general powell was offered the job of secretary of state once before , in 1994 , by president clinton , when warren christopher was thinking of leaving but the general said no , writing in his autobiography that when mr clinton summoned him to the white house , he said he and his wife , alma , wanted a longer break from public life he added , left unspoken were my reservations about the amorphous way the administration handled foreign policy in private life , general powell has made millions from his speeches \( about 75 , 000 an appearance \) and his 1995 autobiography , my american journey , which earned him a 6 million advance and was a runaway best seller under an arrangement with his agent , he has barred most video or audio taping of his speeches , which means there is no definitive public record of his views since he left government service in 1995 , general powell flirted with the idea of running for president , and his deliberations tantalized voters and for a time froze the republican nomination at about the same time , he embarked on a successful book tour for his autobiography but his wife said that she would worry about her husband s safety if he became a candidate , and he announced that he would not run in 1996 because the campaign would require a calling that i do not yet hear two years later , he became founder and chairman of america s promise the alliance for youth , an organization that works with corporations , charities and communities to encourage volunteerism to help disadvantaged youth \( the organization , which has claimed to have mobilized millions of volunteers and contributed 300 million to programs helping 10 million children , has been criticized by some experts on volunteerism for inflating its results \) he is , wrote the historian ronald steel , as walter lippmann wrote about ike before he won the republican nomination in 1952 , 'not a real figure in our public life , but a kind of dream boy embodying all the unsatisfied wishes of all the people who are discontented with things as they are' the son of immigrants from jamaica , colin luther powell was born on april 5 , 1937 , in harlem , and reared in a racially and ethnically integrated neighborhood in the south bronx his father was a gardener and a building superintendent , and

and was even a great cook , he wrote about her in his memoirs they have three grown children , michael , linda and anne , and two grandchildren less than four years after his first commission , general powell was on his way to vietnam although he wrote in his memoirs that he knew the vietnam war was pointless , he completed two tours of combat duty wounded slightly in combat , once by

moscow , jan 18 the political party most closely associated with acting president vladimir v putin unexpectedly joined forces with the communists today to reelect the communist speaker of the russian parliament s lower house the unexpected maneuver blocked two former prime ministers , yevgeny m primakov and sergei v stepashin , from a chance to lead the duma , the lower house of parliament , and prompted a furious walkout by more than 100 deputies in protest against what one described as a a cynical backroom deal , and another as a political farce i can not take part in this pigpen , declared sergei kovalyov , a former dissident and liberal deputy for the last eight years the exact motives of mr putin , now the leading candidate in the march 26 presidential elections , were not immediately evident , except that the maneuver offered him at least the temporary support of a party , the communists , which is most likely to opposed his policies in the lower house the acting president , not a member of parliament , hinted at the coalition in a speech to legislators earlier in the day for normal work , we need the biggest possible base of support in the state duma , he said this is not a political but a purely pragmatic position the deal was apparently put together between unity , a party closely linked with mr putin , and the communists in an allday closed negotiating session from which all other parliamentary factions were eventually excluded with 285 of the 450 votes in the lower house , the current speaker , gennadi seleznyov , was assured easy reelection , and other candidates withdrew mr seleznyov , a moderate communist , has been speaker since 1995 several party leaders called on their supporters to boycott the vote , including mr primakov , grigory a yavlinsky , who heads the liberal yabloko party , and sergei v kiriyenko , another former prime minister and leader of the union of right forces mr primakov and mr yavlinsky said they would refuse to accept any committee assignments allotted them by what mr yavlinsky called the aggressive , obedient majority under the allotment drawn up the communists and the unity party , together with their respective allies , the agrarians and the people s deputies , the communists will head nine committees and unity , seven mr primakov s fatherland party was given one chairmanship , while yabloko received none mr stepashin , one of those who stepped down , is associated with yabloko after the walkout , mr seleznyov , a former newspaper editor who two weeks ago lost a bid to become governor of a region outside moscow , dismissed the protesters as a minority of malcontents and in a telling shift of political tactics , boris a berezovsky , a financier and media magnate elected as deputy from a povertystricken region of the north caucasus , told reporters today that he too was ready for a dialogue with the communists , a party he used to accuse of having ruined the country they are a real political force , he said today as several commentators pointed out , the deal between the kremlin and the communists unthinkable before dec 31 , when boris n yeltsin resigned as president seemed to fly in the face of the results of parliamentary elections in december that many thought had given the kremlin a freer hand to pursue its agenda of economic reform people who voted for unity did not intend to vote for the communist party , said boris y nemtsov , a leader of the union of right forces they intended to support the current prime minister mr putin , who became acting president upon mr yeltsin s resignation , will serve as prime minister until the march 26 elections throughout the yeltsin era , the russian parliament was dominated by a communistled majority that frequently obstructed reform legislation thanks largely to mr putin s personal popularity , two new progovernment parties soared ahead in the voting on dec 19 , opening the way for a parliament that could , for the first time , break the communists' block on legislation today , with the unity party now locked in a formal embrace with the communists , the lineup in the lower house looked very different appearing tonight on a television talk show , mr kiriyenko and mr yavlinsky talked of joining mr primakov in a new antigovernment opposition but mr kiriyenko said his party made up of young freemarket economists might still back mr putin in presidential elections mr yavlinsky is already a declared candidate , since mr yeltsin s unexpected resignation , russia s political elite has been lining up behind mr putin , whose popularity continues to soar but other than the chechen war , which he vowed to see through to victory , mr putin , a former agent of russia s security agency , has no political record , and so far no political program that distinguish him from several other russian political leaders by forming an alliance with the communists , mr putin seemed to point at a new kind of political leadership that put pragmatism ahead of ideology , or , some say , principle it seems as though with yeltsin s exit , the kremlin is looking to the communists for allies , mr yavlinsky said what we have is a bloc of the communists and the unprincipled mr primakov , who has all but withdrawn from the presidential race , warned that the uncontested nomination today for the speaker s job was a dress rehearsal for an uncontested presidential election there are things happening here which we deeply do not like , said mr primakov , who six months ago was pegged as a leading contender to succeed mr yeltsin some commentators today said the kremlin , having won popular backing for its candidate , is trying to provide russia s next president with a loyal and predictable parliament seleznyov will be dependent on the kremlin , and thankful , said masha lipman , deputy editor of the news magazine itogi this makes him a good figure photo acting president vladimir v putin , left , with gennadi seleznyov , reelected yesterday as speaker of the lower house of russia s parliament \( associated press \)
san antonio it was a spellbindingly intense and brutal performance , and the concert had n't even begun slipknot , an explosive rock nonet from des moines , was seething in a large holding room backstage at the live oak civic center just outside the city , warming up like a football team psyching itself for a particularly fierce playoff game its members , each masked and wearing orange prison coveralls , were pacing across the room in different directions a musician in a grotesque clown mask menacingly swung a large pvc pipe as he choked a rag clown doll in his other hand another , in a gas mask , squirted bottled water onto a lone groupie s tshirt others brandished wooden planks , punched walls or dropped to the floor to stretch suddenly they met in a huddle , threw their hands to the center , and let loose a ferocious scream that drowned out the 3 , 000 fans chanting slipknot then , one by one , they emerged onto the stage , driving the crowd wearing shirts pledging allegiance to other new hardrock bands like sevendust , staind , papa roach and system of a down into a frenzy two teenagers had already been treated for injuries before slipknot had even finished thrashing , banging and raging through its first song about exploding angst it feels so easy to make a connection with these kids , said matt mcdonough , or spag , the drummer in slipknot s opening act , the facepainting screamrock group mudvayne they 're wanton slipknot have them so pumped up that you could walk up to a mike and burp , and they 'd go crazy pete murray , the singer in the other opening act , the electrometal group ultraspank , shook his head it was like this when we toured with incubus too , he said you get the feeling that something is going on , but you do n't know exactly what it is what s happening is that a new school of hardedged rock bands have formed a loose association from years of relentless touring together most are composed of ordinarylooking suburban or smalltown 20to30yearolds playing vaguely hiphop or electronicainfluenced hard rock that sounds fresh but not necessarily new from the best to the most mediocre , the majority of these acts are selling an impressive 500 , 000 albums , but none have crossed the million mark that would make them blockbusters still , through touring and the power of promotion on the internet , the bands and their audience are reaching the boiling point at which they bubble into the mainstream this , certainly for us , has been a real movement of late , said tom calderone , senior vice president for programming at mtv , which has begun playing many of these acts on a show called return of the rock but there is n't anyone leading the pack , so to speak we 're waiting to see who s going to come out with that big second album there are a lot of bands on the surface right now , waiting to break , and i think it s a real close race as a music fan , it s exciting to watch since grunge and alternative rock began fading in 1994 with the suicide of kurt cobain , there has been no great resurgence of rock 'n' roll , only isolated successes but the same year , something new was rising from the ashes korn , a motleylooking quintet of selfprofessed white trash from bakersfield , calif , put out its first album , a bottomheavy , rapfriendly primal scream produced by ross robinson along with the older and more politically minded rage against the machine , the denser tool , and , later , the more watereddown and nakedly ambitious limp bizkit , korn began attracting not just the remnants of the alternative rock audience but also heavy metal , thrash and hardcore fans looking for something new on their heels came suburban teenagers who had temporarily abandoned rock for rap and a younger generation looking for a sound to call their own then , in 1997 , ozzy osbourne brought his ozzfest to arenas and stadiums , providing an inadvertent launching pad for what some are calling the new rock , new metal or heavy alternative movement to wide industry surprise , ozzfest became the year s secondhighest grossing tour \( bested by sarah mclachlan s less aggressive lilith fair \) performing in ozzfest , limp bizkit , slipknot , powerman 5000 , machine head , soulfly , incubus , coal chamber , sevendust , staticx , deftones , godsmack and system of a down proved their metal , significantly expanding \( or in some cases , creating \) their fan base at the same time , ozzfest gave new rock its roots with performances from elder statesmen , including mr osbourne s pioneering metal band black sabbath wellknown hardrock bands that formed in the 80 s like slayer , white zombie and pantera and other hardrockers of the late 80 s and early 90 s that never broke into the mainstream , including neurosis , fear factory and type o negative thanks in part to ozzfest and similar tours , the teenage audiences of the newer bands began working their way backwards to metallica , kiss and black sabbath while older metal fans began lining up to get into staticx , deftones and slipknot shows ozzfest was very important , said serj tinkian of system of a down it put us in front of a lot of kids we did it twice , and it s had a huge impact on this band
this is a hard one a very hard , hurtful one not guilty twentyfour times that phrase rang out in an albany courtroom last night , acquitting each of four police officers of two murder counts and four less serious charges not guilty and yet amadou diallo , innocent and unarmed , is dead not guilty and yet there were those 41 shots not guilty it is hard to get one s mind around this one nobody can convincingly argue that the trial was rigged it was fair the diverse jury took its job seriously most who watched the trial expected the defendants kenneth boss , sean carroll , edward mcmellon , richard murphy to be acquitted the prosecutor did n't present much of a case the officers , clearly in pain themselves , said that they thought they saw a gun in amadou diallo s hand one night last year and fired , only later learning that the gun was a wallet no evidence at the trial refuted their accounts so the jury acquitted because mistakes do not rate murder convictions and the prosecution did not prove its case not guilty yet nobody has been held to account for a man s death there could be another mistake tomorrow another innocent man or woman could fall victim to a police officer s bad judgment what does this say to a frustrated community , to africanamericans in particular , who reacted to the verdicts last night with weariness and anger \? what does this outcome say to all fairminded people saddened by the death of mr diallo \? the larger tragedy here is that the outcome of this trial , however legally just , adds to the aggrievement of people sure that , as bronx demonstrators shouted last night , there is no justice for minorities in this country the diallo trial is already lumped together with the first trial of los angeles policemen , acquitted of beating rodney king , despite a videotape showing his brutalization the shooting of mr diallo is surely seen as part of the same continuum as the torture of abner louima by justin volpe , the former police officer recently convicted in brooklyn it has to be compared to the death of anthony baez , who died in 1994 when francis x livoti put him in a chokehold , to the acquittals of so many other police officers accused of mistreating black and hispanic people the cases are not all the same the officers who shot mr diallo made a series of fatal mistakes mr livoti , mr volpe and the officers who beat mr king made no mistake they were brutal on purpose but the distinctions are easily lost all the cases involve police officers , and some racial profiling that is enough to add to the hurt those cases also show that there can be remedies , even after acquittals mr livoti was acquitted in state court , but then dismissed from the police force and convicted on federal civil rights charges in the diallo case , the police department may question whether the four officers followed regulations and can keep their jobs the diallo family will pursue a civil suit it seems unlikely , but federal prosecutors could file a civil rights suit , as they did against the officers who beat rodney king , winning two convictions but none of the remedies can possibly satisfy the anger of people who want to know who pays for mr diallo s death what does this society say to those people \? the answer , such as it is , cannot be satisfying blacks are in the same position today as whites were after the acquittal of o j simpson many white americans were convinced then that race trumped justice but the criminal justice system cannot be manipulated to satisfy the pain of the aggrieved the whole system cannot be overturned if it is , then what \? the rev al sharpton implicity understood that last night when he called for peace so did mr diallo s parents , who reacted to the verdicts with such nobility in a country where people want expect a cure for every illness , a pill for every pain , a new beginning to erase every mistake , it is hard to accept a criminal justice system that can leave a wrongful death unavenged the system can be harsh , even cruel but it is what we have maybe in the aftermath of this trial , new yorkers can hope for some introspection at 1 police plaza , another look at what aggressive policing has wrought along with contributing to a drop in crime , it has left open wounds on that count guilty
sydney , australia , sept 18 wherever she has played the past five years college , professional or pickup katie smith s job description was simple goto player she usually took the most shots , scored the most points and got used to having the basketball in her hands with the game on the line yet playing alongside sheryl swoopes , lisa leslie , nikki mccray and the awesome cast of the united states olympic women s team , smith learned , can whittle at your confidence and minutes we 're so deep , smith said , that you just go in for your 12 minutes and understand your role you just get used to it it s a lot of fun coming off the bench smith , a team usa reserve shooting guard , reverted tonight to her persona as a women s national basketball association allstar when she was through knocking down all six of her field goals , including three 3pointers , at the dome in olympic park , the united states had routed cuba , 9061 , and looked for all the world like a team with 12 starters whether the victory sent a message to russia one of team usa s obstacles to the gold medal and wednesday s preliminaryround opponent is unclear but the way smith led the united states in scoring with 15 points , coupled with the way the backup point guard dawn staley moved the ball and the reserve forward natalie williams rebounded , it appeared as if team usa s bench could bring home gold on its own you think you got them , and then they come in with their second five , said christi harrower , the australian point guard , after an exhibition last week against team usa there is hardly any dropoff in fact , sometimes there is none the australians , considered to be another united states rival here , topped brazil , 8170 , later in a key group a game lauren jackson s 19 points led the winners , as australia made 60 percent of its shots in the second half the aussies \( 20 \) are trying to set themselves up for a showdown with the united states \( 20 \) in the medal round not that anyone genuinely craves a matchup with the united states the americans shot 551 percent from the field and outrebounded cuba by 3420 the lithe and skilled cuban center , yamilet martinez , fought her way inside for 19 points but she picked up her third and fourth fouls within 50 seconds of each other with 16 minutes 45 seconds remaining with cuba trailing by only 5046 moments earlier , the united states went on a 144 run with martinez out of the game in many ways , the game was a carbon copy of so many others featuring the americans the opponent stayed close in the first half , gave off upset vibes and then was overwhelmed by defensive pressure and sheer depth everyone knows you have to sacrifice your regular role on this team , said swoopes , who scored 11 points , grabbed 5 rebounds and distributed 5 assists a lot of us are stars in the wnba but with so much talent , you go from sometimes being an offensive specialist to a defensive specialist everyone is willing to do that playing behind teresa edwards , staley finished with eight assists she was responsible for increasing the tempo in the second half as the united states blew the game open team usa s bench outscored cuba s , 4417 after the game , swoopes and her teammates were motivated for the showdown with russia a game that would indeed show the americans the distance between themselves and the rest of the medal contenders they 're very physical and very dirty , swoopes said they 're definitely one of our biggest rivals
mexico city , july 3 swept to power by younger , bettereducated voters fed up with corruption and oneparty rule , presidentelect vicente fox quesada today began the transition from a republic led for decades by autocratic presidents to one in which political power suddenly seemed up for grabs as mr fox fielded congratulatory phone calls today from world leaders , including president clinton , and met with president ernesto zedillo , election returns showed that mexican voters on sunday handed him a substantially more decisive victory over the governing party than any poll had predicted with 93 percent of the ballots tabulated , the mexican electoral agency reported that mr fox had won 43 percent of the votes , while francisco labastida ochoa , the candidate of the governing party , won 36 percent and cuauhtemoc cardenas solorzano , a leftist candidate , 17 percent mr fox will take office on dec 1 for many mexicans it was still sinking in today that after 71 years , the institutional revolutionary party , which evolved from an alliance of revolutionary generals into a model nationalist party imitated across latin america before degenerating into a clique of corrupt insiders , was finally deposed from the presidency but when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of power in this country s history , for the first time none of the major parties the deposed one , mr fox s centerright party or the largest leftist grouping will be in control of either house of congress at a news conference tonight , mr fox said he had assured president zedillo that he did not intend to carry out a purge of the government bureaucracy , at least in the first stage of his new administration the two leaders agreed to meet frequently between now and december to plan next year s budget and to discuss the transition , mr fox added our team will take office with creative ideas and new philosophies , but there 'll be no change in federal work rhythms , mr fox said mexico will be a country on the move , headed by a government that keeps its commitments mr fox will preside over a government unused to coalition politics but one in which all major business will require the consent of one or the other of his rival parties all the parties are going to have to relearn the art of making politics , said carlos elizondo mayerserra , a political scientist who is rector of the center for research and teaching the fundamental pillars of mexico s political system have changed these unsettled results were reflected around the country mr fox s national action party won the two governors' seats up for grabs on sunday and will now govern in 7 of mexico s 31 states in mexico city , the leftist party of the democratic revolution , or prd , retained control of the mayor s office , but the presidentelect s party took control of the city council as president , mr fox will face the ticklish task of meeting the hopes for quick and sweeping change of the diverse voters who backed him he has promised , simultaneously , to modernize the economy and spur 7 percent growth , carry out political reforms and initiate an educational revolution he has pledged to better the lot not only of the largely young , middleclass professionals in his own party , but also millions of poor urban workers as well as dirt farmers who have in the past supported the governing party we 've all got to get to work right away , mr fox said in an interview early today after his triumph i want to be certain to deliver good results to the people of mexico , to govern and to govern well the election results provoked a debate over how successfully president zedillo s party would navigate its journey from its powerhouse position into the ranks of the opposition some said the party had already proven its adaptability and resilience in states where mr fox s party had already won control of the governors' chairs but others , comparing the position of the institutional revolutionary party , known as the pri , to some communist parties in eastern europe , argued that without presidential support and control over federal patronage , the party would crumble dulce maria sauri , the party chairwoman during the presidential campaign , quickly announced her resignation , and some party officials said they feared that it could be the first in a significant exodus the results of the elections to fill all 128 seats in the senate and all 500 in the chamber of deputies indicated that mr fox s party would finish with its powers significantly enhanced , mainly at the expense of the leftist prd , with which it shared opposition powers during the last legislature still , it will not control a legislative majority the pri lost the senate majority it had enjoyed since the party s creation , and without the power of the president to coordinate its efforts , the pri s entire legislative delegation will wield considerably less strength mr fox s party was receiving 38 percent of the votes for congress , the returns showed the pri was receiving 36 percent and the prd 18 percent
red atom russia s nuclear power program from stalin to today by paul r josephson illustrated 352 pp new york w h freeman company 2695 in the years after hiroshima and nagasaki , two ideas gave birth to a civilian nuclear industry one was electricity too cheap to meter , in the now infamous phrase the other was expiation through technology , a chance for the scientists who had created horrible weapons to redeem themselves by providing the world with a benefit from their invention the soviets never used nuclear weapons in combat , but they had motivations related to ours to bring the boon of electricity to a woefully retarded industrial base , and to show the world that a wellorganized society and economy could work wonders with a technology that the west had used to work horrors however , paul r josephson s red atom , based on an extensive review of sovietera archives , shows that nonmilitary use of nuclear power was like many areas of cold war competition an avenue for the participants to go to illogical extremes , especially on the soviet side the american postwar track record was mixed 250 reactors ordered , but almost half canceled before completion costs so high that several electric companies dropped dead in the effort fear and loathing after three mile island and an intractable waste problem but in the united states , at least , the twin restraints of public opinion and capitalism limited the excursion into nuclear power and its spinoffs in the soviet union there was far less to hold the designers back , and the whole country became like one of those unfortunate american utilities that committed itself too heavily and could find no way out the soviets built and built and built graphite reactors , pressurized water reactors , sodiumcooled reactors , submarine reactors , floating reactors , portable reactors , a giant reactor factory that sank in the mud and on and on josephson , a longtime historian of technology and science and currently a fellow at the davis center for russian studies at harvard university , has produced a thorough , if sometimes dense , history of the soviet effort in some of its more stunning passages , the book captures the communist vision of the workers' paradise as it extended to nuclear power chernobyl was intended as a reactor park , josephson writes , with canals for cooling water that would create a 'venice' of nuclear power , where warmwater effluent in the canals attracts geese and ducks , who winter there rather than completing their southern migration the goal was atomicpowered communism , mighty concrete palaces , energy too cheap to meter , the freeing of citizens from manual labor by wondrous , electrically powered machines , mastery of modern science and technology indicating the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist one and the taming of nature to serve the interests of society as defined , of course , by the politicalscientific leadership but it worked even less than in this country costs were higher than anticipated , output was smaller , provisions for handling radioactive waste were worse than in the west and design characteristics and operational controls were , as the world learned from chernobyl , woefully lacking so was preparation for an accident josephson s research has turned up an astounding variety of dead ends there was , for instance , food irradiation starting as early as the 1950 s , the soviets had tried irradiating fruits , fish , meat and potatoes as a means of preservation they also tried irradiating hens , seeds and barnyard breeding stock to increase productivity the image of the mighty atom joining us at the dinner table was no more a reasonable hope than that of other images promoted during the glory days of atomic energy the atom and nuclear engines , the atom as excavator and the atom and unlimited electric energy none of it worked well much of it did not work at all there was the attempt to use small nuclear bombs for peaceful purposes , to aid in oil and gas drilling , to put out fires in oil and gas wells , to create underground storage space for hazardous wastes and to dig canals , harbors and reservoirs \( correcting the mistakes of nature , the soviets said \) and there was russian imperialism within the soviet union , as moscow exported reactors for research and power to the other republics much was wasted , but , as josephson explains , his story is also a tale of heroism whatever american physicists accomplished , they did it without having to dodge the destruction brought about by the invasion of the nazis or the purges carried out by stalin and the kgb the russians were world leaders in physics not for nothing is our term for the machine that allows fusion a russian one , the tokamak josephson might have done well to note , though , that too cheap to meter is a term invented here , to describe a fantasy that flourished in both countries , to the benefit of neither the soviets hardly had a monopoly on insular decisionmaking , unrealistic expectations about cost and reliability and institutional momentum that put bad ideas on artificial life support but red atom does not distinguish among causes how much is red and how much is atom \? one longs for josephson to isolate the factors , to separate the universal human constants here , like the messianic drive of physicists , from the particular dictates of the soviet system , with its penchant for standardization and megaprojects and the small role it allowed for public input or market analysis how does this compare , say , with france , a nation that is highly centralized and has a strong political overlay in the energy sector of its economy , or with china , another communist nuclear power , but one with less interest in reactors \? even the united states , a country that until recently cherished free enterprise in everything but electricity , would be a good point of reference and in spots , josephson seems to share the confusion of the nuclear engineers themselves he complains , for example , that the reactors operated at low efficiency that argument made sense when the uranium fuel was scarce and expensive in fact , it has not been so for years still , red atom is impressive in its sweep , and it provides essential details about an industry that has outlived its creators yet , because rickety reactors are still in use and wastes are still accumulating , can make its presence felt around the world at any timeh
there is a paradox here somewhere last year , polaroid not only outsold its competitors in the growing digital camera field , it even turned a slim profit on those sales since analysts say that no one else is making money on digital cameras , it was a coup but talk to polaroid executives and they shrug off digital cameras as simply polaroid s way of marking time they expect that a few years down the road , people will be snapping pictures with cell phones , palm pilots and the like and , they hope , printing them out on wireless polaroid printers the cameras are just another way of capturing images , many of which we hope people will want to print , said gary t dicamillo , polaroid s chief executive the accuracy of this forecast could determine polaroid s chances for survival in a digital world polaroid has always sold cameras pretty much at cost and made its money from chemicalandpaper film that develops itself in a minute or two since digital photography is essentially an electronic form of instant pictures , polaroid is either in a special position to move into this field or specially suited to be rendered obsolete by it of course , polaroid executives stress the opportunities i laugh when people are surprised we 're doing well in digital cameras , said brian d poggi , senior vice president for north america after all , they 're really the same as instant cameras they provide an affordable and immediate picture but industry experts wonder whether the similarity will translate to sales many note that , even as film sales shrink , companies like fuji and kodak can still do a thriving business in sales of coated papers , which can be used to make highquality prints of digital photos but a polaroid customer who switches to digital photography is lost to the market for the company s selfdeveloping film unless those customers use polaroid printers or hybrid digital instant cameras to make prints it is not clear to me what longterm digital strategy can really replace what they are generating from filmbased instant prints , said steve hoffenberg , a digital photography market analyst with lyra research in newtonville , mass wall street has similar concerns eastman kodak and polaroid have both had earnings problems that have driven their stock prices down in recent years kodak s stock remains mired in the 50 s well below the nearly 70 it traded at a year ago but many analysts say the company has cleaned up its digital portfolio and brought its costs under control , making its stock a good buy right now few are as upbeat about polaroid , even though that company s stock closed at 251875 on friday nowhere near the price of 6025 it reached in july 1997 , but a nice rebound from its low of 1725 in december digital cameras , scanners , picture cd s , web sites , they are all geared toward one thing driving output , said jonathan rosenzweig , an analyst with salomon smith barney and the competitive picture for polaroid in a digital world is a lot less clear than it is for kodak certainly , as the only instant photography company in the country , competition is not something polaroid is used to \( the fuji photo film company sells instant cameras and film overseas , but when kodak tried to do so here , the courts upheld polaroid s patents \) but as the digital revolution is wooing many people from the 35millimeter film camp , polaroid could grab customers long loyal either to fuji or kodak we used to be the only show in town for people who wanted instant gratification on their pictures , and yes , we 've lost that , said paul e lambert , polaroid s senior vice president for research and development but for the first time , we can really tap into the conventional photography market rather than try to capture a highend digital market the strategy that fuji and kodak have pursued polaroid has farmed out its production to overseas manufacturers , which make polaroidbranded cameras that sell for as little as 99 and rarely top 300 digital cameras are just their mechanism for building shelf space , said michael ellmann , an analyst with schroder company true to its massmarket roots , polaroid already is spewing forth products to fill those shelves there is a portable scanner that can upload images to the web there is a digital camera with a builtin modem that can send pictures over the web to polaroid for transfer to prints , tshirts or other items in february , polaroid announced an alliance with pictureworks technology , a software company , to develop more internetrelated products one on the drawing boards is a product to help dermatologists keep a digitalimage record of a patient s progress during treatments for skin disorders and plug the pictures into insurance claims forms on the wireless front , polaroid recently demonstrated a wireless printer that can receive images transmitted by radio waves from up to 50 feet away this makes the process truly portable , because digital cameras are no longer tethered to pc s , said ulysses yannas of buckman , buckman reid
jerusalem , dec 5 two months of violence have devastated the economy of the west bank and gaza , according to a new report issued by the united nations israeli restrictions on palestinian goods and workers which israel says it has imposed both as a security measure and as diplomatic pressure have cost the palestinians more than 500 million in lost wages and sales since violence erupted in the region in late september , erasing 10 percent of the year s projected gross domestic product , the report says unemployment has tripled , leaving more than a million palestinians a third of the population with no regular household incomes , the united nations says three years of progress have been wiped out in two months of conflict , said terje rod larsen , the united nations special coordinator for the middle east , who presented the report in gaza on monday to foreign diplomats and aid donors mr larsen , a norwegian diplomat who helped broker the 1993 oslo peace agreement , urged israel to lift its twomonthlong clampdown on the movement of palestinian goods and workers to israel and between gaza and the west bank palestinian living conditions are falling fast , and safety nets are wearing thin , he said the violence has also taken a serious economic toll on israel israeli economists have lopped a full percentage point off their growth estimates for the country for the year , a billiondollar correction tourism has vanished farmers and contractors who depend on palestinian workers are demanding bailout aid even the vibrant hightech sector is feeling the pinch , with venture capitalists scaling back spending the economic forecast for the next few months is dismal , said nehemia strassler , an israeli economic columnist we have an external blow from the intifada , causing a reduction in economic activity , a loss of production , a decrease in investments , a drop in private consumption and an increase in unemployment even so , forecasts show the 100 billion israeli economy growing by more than 4 percent , propelling per capita income past 18 , 000 the highest in the mediterranean after france and italy and the clinton administration is seeking to supplement israel s annual 29 billion aid package with an additional 450 million this year for the palestinian economy , just onetwentieth the size of israel s hightech juggernaut , the impact has been far more devastating normal economic activity has been slashed in half the estimated 388 million drop in local economic output , plus 117 million in the lost wages of 110 , 000 workers who had jobs in israel , are two and a half times greater than the total foreign aid received by palestinians from all sources 183 million in the first half of the year , the united nations noted this is catastrophic , said salam fayyad , the representative of the international monetary fund in the palestinian territories it is undoubtedly the worst shock the palestinian economy has suffered since oslo the european union has released emergency aid to help pay palestinian authority employees , and persian gulf businessmen have donated more than 20 million for a special palestinian unemployment fund over the long term , arab governments have pledged 693 million in new economic aid to the palestinians , with most of it coming from saudi arabia \( 250 million \) , kuwait \( 150 million \) and the united arab emirates \( 150 million \) and the united states continues to provide more than 75 million annually to the palestinians under a longterm aid commitment , though most of the programs it underwrites have been paralyzed for the last two months none of that assistance , however , will keep the palestinian poverty rate from climbing drastically this quarter , with nearly half of the population living on 2 a day or less , according to the united nations in its economic impact estimates , the united nations did not include what its report said was tens of millions of dollars of damage to palestinian buildings , infrastructure and vehicles , due mainly to the israeli army s use of heavy weapons , including rockets , tank shells and highcaliber automatic weapons in the first six weeks of the conflict , the united nations report said , israeli attacks resulted in the partial or total destruction of 431 private homes , 13 public buildings , 10 factories , and 14 religious buildings the israeli army has said its attacks on palestinian homes and public buildings have been limited to sites harboring snipers or to offices connected to organizations it accuses of complicity in armed violence or terrorism the united nations report also chastised israel for reducing tax transfer payments to the palestinians during the last two months under economic arrangements negotiated as a corollary to the oslo peace accord , the palestinians are entitled to customs duties , sales taxes and other levies on goods bought and sold within their own autonomous territory the israelis , who control the seaports and border crossings used for palestinian commerce , collect the import taxes themselves , and transfer the payments monthly to the palestinian treasury most sales taxes are also collected by israeli authorities , and transferred later to the palestinians until recently , those payments averaged more than 50 million a month enough to meet the entire palestinian government payroll , from doctors and schoolteachers to bureaucrats and policemen in the seven weeks from early october through the end of november , official sources say , the transfers came to no more than 8 million , as israel reduced and delayed the payments for political and bureaucratic reasons the palestinians had amassed unpaid debts and failed to provide all the invoices and other paperwork needed for reimbursement , israeli officials said prime minister ehud barak is currently relaxing controls on palestinian exports and imports in what he terms a gesture of good will during the muslim holy month of ramadan under intense pressure from the powerful israeli agricultural lobby , he is considering plans to readmit some 15 , 000 palestinian day laborers but mr barak remains opposed to a return to the situation before the outbreak of violence two months ago , favoring continued restrictions on palestinian goods and workers some israeli finance and foreign ministry officials have questioned this separation strategy their skepticism was reinforced from an unexpected quarter on monday , when ami ayalon , the former chief of israel s intelligence service , attacked what he called humiliating security restrictions israel is imposing on palestinians , and heaped scorn on proposals to ban palestinian trucks from israeli roads economic separation and fences are n't the best model in the middle east reality , mr ayalon said in a widely discussed speech we should bear in mind that whatever we decide to do will have an impact on us , and that there s a limit to power and to the degree of pain we can inflict on each other without a boomerang effect photo two months of violence has been catastrophic for palestinian businesses , erasing 10 percent of the projected gross

washington , may 10 the pentagon is assessing the risk to national security of cutting its nuclear arsenal to 2 , 000 warheads under an armsreduction treaty with russia , a step that could help president clinton broker a missiledefense deal with moscow before he leaves office , administration officials say the highly classified review has been under way for months , but it has intensified in recent weeks in advance of mr clinton s scheduled summit meeting with president vladimir v putin early next month in moscow on thursday , defense secretary william s cohen , the joint chiefs of staff and the commander of the strategic arsenal , adm richard w mies , will hold the latest in a series of meetings in the tank , a supersecure conference room in the pentagon , to gauge the effects of deeper cuts in two weeks , the findings and recommendations are expected to be sent to mr cohen and to gen henry h shelton , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , for final approval before the assessment is delivered to mr clinton in preparation for the moscow meeting we 're trying to get a better understanding of the risk at the lower numbers and whether we can still meet the deterrent strategy , said a senior pentagon official involved in the study it s a prudent thing to do with the summit coming up the american strategic nuclear arsenal includes 7 , 200 warheads russia has 6 , 000 in helsinki three years ago , mr clinton and boris n yeltsin , who was then president of russia , agreed to cut the number of longrange warheads on each side to no more than 2 , 000 to 2 , 500 by the end of 2007 by negotiating a third strategic arms reduction treaty , start iii the two leaders reaffirmed their pledge in june in cologne , germany , although russia is pushing for both countries to go even lower , to 1 , 500 warheads despite the official american negotiating position that start iii levels range from 2 , 000 to 2 , 500 warheads , the joint chiefs of staff have always said they would need at least 2 , 500 warheads to carry out the nation s nuclear war plan , which is thought to include thousands of individual targets on potentially hostile territory the new review is testing whether that assumption continues to hold start iii has become a bargaining chip for the administration , which has offered to carry it out if moscow agrees to what american officials describe as modest changes to the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 those changes would allow the united states to field a limited missile defense system that administration officials say is intended to protect the united states against missile strikes from countries like iran , iraq and north korea or an accidental launching from a superpower but russia opposes such a defense , leaving administration officials searching for ways to enhance the incentives for moscow to change its mind part of the solution may lie in lower start iii force levels the overall purpose is to take stock of how it all plays out , and if there is any chance of potentially lower numbers , said a second senior defense department official involved in the assessment for now at least , the review is confined to examining the risks at various levels in the 2 , 000to2 , 500 range , administration officials said we are not looking outside the range , and no one has come to us yet with pressure to say , we need to go below those numbers , said a third senior pentagon official but some white house and state department officials are asking what military officials consider leading questions going down to 2 , 000 and slightly below what pentagon officials call the red line some american arms negotiators believe that if the review finds that the military could fulfill its strategic deterrent mission with 2 , 000 warheads , then diplomats could finesse the differences with russia and propose a range of 1 , 500 to 2 , 000 warheads what we 're seeing is an attempt on the part of the administration to accommodate the russians without having to change the definition of deterrence , said one former top military officer who is wary of deeper reductions two thousand warheads was the absolute most painful level for the military now they 're going back , i'm afraid , and taking the floor and using it to make a new ceiling the assessment and its potential implications have divided the government some civilian experts in the defense department , state department and national security council are open to deeper cuts the joint chiefs of staff is opposed to reductions that they believe could hurt national security and set off not discourage a new arms race the chiefs are concerned about arms reductions that reduce the flexibility in the strategic deterrence and put at risk maintaining all three legs of the triad , said capt steven r pietropaoli , a spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff the triad is the fleet of submarines , bombers and longrange missiles that carry nuclear weapons one way that the pentagon is considering reducing the start iii levels , at least on paper , is through the arcane counting rules for nuclear weapons at any given moment , not all submarines are at sea or bombers on alert military officials are considering whether to count , at least in one measure , only those nuclear weapons that are ready to perform the mission that could reduce the start iii levels by 200 to 300 socalled phantom warheads , administration officials said , and approach the 2 , 000 figure at the lower end of the range

cape town , nov 27 william bailey and a few hundred of his longlost neighbors came home this week to the place they knew as district six , but he was worried that none of them would remember his face after all , it has been more than 30 years since he and thousands of others were expelled from the neighborhood , separated and scattered by south africa s apartheid government in its effort to turn the district into a whitesonly community so when mr bailey , a spindly 64yearold man , arrived this weekend , he came prepared , toting a decadesold photograph of himself taken when he was a babyfaced , curlyhaired 12yearold schoolboy an agreement was signed on sunday settling the claims of thousands of people forced out of district six as they gathered to mark the milestone , people like mr bailey were ambling about , looking for a taste of what they had lost i thought maybe someone would see it and know that it s me , because i'm old now , mr bailey said as he pulled the woodframed 9by12 blackandwhite portrait from a gray plastic shopping bag i came back to see a lot of my friends that i knew long years ago by the hundreds they streamed back into district six beginning early in the morning , many walking with canes , others hanging on the arms of children and grandchildren it had taken a long time , and many of them were old and frail yet few were willing to miss this day and the moment on sunday afternoon when president thabo mbeki welcomed them back , offering them a chance to resettle in the place that for many was their only true home most of the 2 , 500 claimants , representing more than 20 , 000 people , have indicated that they intend to move back , while a few hundred , primarily the most elderly , say it would be too hard , as much as many of them wish they could the neighborhood , set in the hills just south of the city center and between the heights of table mountain and waves of table bay , was like few places in south africa blacks , indians and coloreds as mixedrace people here , many of them part malay , are called lived side by side , steps from the heart of the country s most cosmopolitan city ultimately the apartheid masters found it all too galling to take such mingling of the races , even if none of them were white , defied the regime s rigid system of racial classifications indeed , after 1950 it was illegal under the notorious group areas act and who else but whites , they thought , should enjoy the privilege of waking up to majestic views of the mountain and bay and walking only a few blocks to work or , on weekends , to the stores and movie theaters in the city center backed by bulldozers and p w botha , the minister of community development who would eventually rule the country , the government eviscerated district six , razing its homes , relocating 60 , 000 people to the barren flatlands several miles south of the city and renaming the community zonnebloem , afrikaans for wildflower in fact , the neighborhood never blossomed in its new identity instead it died a little bit at a time in the next 15 years as the government pressed ahead with the relocations until , by the early 1980 s , virtually no one was left few whites ever moved in , many of them frightened off by the simmering outrage over what had happened consequently , much of the land remained undeveloped while the community s churches and mosques , the ones left standing by the government , went begging for worshipers i thought i would grow up and die here , said teddy malangabi , 65 , who lived in district six for more than a decade before being relocated to guguletu , the cape flats township where he still lives i want to move back this is the best place the view , he said pointing toward the skyline and the waterfront off to the north everything is near for many people it was just that simple everything was just so close evenings were wonderful , said mr malangabi s sister , elizabeth monowe , 73 we would go windowshopping and then walk home where they were moved was so far away and so uncertain , exactly as the apartheidera urban planners envisioned it was not nice , mr malangabi said a man cannot cry , but you feel it inside you feel it inside because you do n't know where you 're going , where you 're going to live now , many like mr malangabi will come back others , like his sister , will not , their bodies too old to still follow their hearts with only dusty , pebbled lots , like the site of this week s celebration , marking much of the 111 acres that will be resettled under the agreement , years of work loom for the people who ultimately do move back the agreement , brokered by the district six beneficiary trust , was a remarkable step , but in many ways only a first one south africa s new blackmajority government is only six years old , and land is but one of many areas in which leaders are struggling to redress years of institutionalized discrimination since majority rule was established in 1994 , more than 63 , 000 land restitution claims have been lodged nationwide , and barely 10 percent have been settled in substance and in symbol , settling district six , with the sentimental attachment so many have to it , was special , and with local elections in just over a week , the occasion gave president mbeki and his governing party , the african national congress , a shining accomplishment to show off now , with the president , the ministers and the other dignitaries gone , the hard work will start a neighborhood will have to be rebuilt , save , that is , for its spirit , which after all these years could hardly have been more evident on a clear , breezy day in cape town photos former residents of the oncemultiracial cape town neighborhood known as district six greeted one another there on sunday after the signing of an agreement settling the claims of thousands who were forced to leave william bailey , 64 , held up a photo of himself taken when he was 12 , so that a friend who was also evicted in the 1960 s could recognize him \( photographs by louise gubb saba , for the new york times \)

american pharaoh mayor richard j daley his battle for chicago and the nation by adam cohen and elizabeth taylor illustrated 614 pp boston little , brown company 2695 twentyfive years ago , richard j daley won his sixth and last election as mayor of chicago his control of the city was still secure , but his national image could not have been much worse he was widely perceived as a sleazy and intolerant autocrat , a man who stole votes and ordered the police to beat up antiwar protesters in the streets some of his closest political confidants were under indictment on corruption charges , and many of them would ultimately go to prison when he died in the fall of 1976 , it was with the weariness of a beleaguered and discouraged man but time has come through splendidly for him as the centennial of his birth approaches , a poll of political scientists has selected daley as the single best mayor of the late 20th century and one of the 10 best in american history daleys son reigns virtually unchallenged as his mayoral successor at a moment when managerial efficiency has replaced social activism as the central value of local government , the phrase boss daley has lost the evil connotation for most people that it seemed to have a quartercentury ago adam cohen and elizabeth taylor have produced a splendid , serious treatment of daleys life , the first fulllength biography of one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters of modern american political history american pharaoh deals in the subtleties and complexities of a man whose closest associates insisted they did not really understand him very well daley was obsessed with competence and order but operated a political machine larded with hacks , waste and inefficiency he was personally honest to a fault but allowed those around him to take almost anything they wanted he was blunt , forceful and pithy in private conversation , yet embarrassingly inarticulate in public those were riddles in daleys lifetime , and american pharaoh does not really answer them it drops no bombs and adds few juicy anecdotes to the existing trove of daley stories the time for such revelations may well have passed daleys contemporaries are nearly all gone , and his machine , like all such organizations , left a very meager paper trail there is no significant storehouse of sensitive daley documents for historians to comb through but if this is not a work of startling disclosure , it is a scrupulously thorough and readable examination of the important issues of a long political life it is also a valuable introduction to the intricacies of chicago politics over several decades unlike previous daleyologists , the authors of american pharaoh are not locals taylor , the literary editor and sunday magazine editor of the chicago tribune , grew up in new jersey cohen , a senior writer at time magazine , is from new york they occasionally stumble over small details , such as whether halsted is a street or an avenue but for the most part , they demonstrate an impressive sensitivity to local nuance they pick up on the cultural differences between blacks on the west side and the south side , and the postwar rivalry between workingclass and middleclass irish politicians they approach the evidence with a dispassionate and balanced quality that no homegrown student of daleys life has been able to achieve daley was a man who loved tidiness , in things large and small he was obsessive about details and hated loose ends as chairman of the cook county democratic committee , he operated a political machine that was expected to perform with precision in every one of the citys more than 3 , 000 precincts , and he checked the votes to make sure it did as a newly elected mayor , he vowed that every street in the city would be swept once a month , and ordered 2 , 000 signs and 10 , 000 decals promoting the cleanliness campaign he sometimes stopped his limousine to pick up a newspaper littering the streets like quite a few of the legendary bosses of american politics , he was essentially a dour , inwardlooking man , no natural practitioner of last hurrah conviviality daley was a gregarious loner , the authors write , acquainted with thousands of people but close to almost none social life was a means for him , not an end what it was a means to , nobody who knew him doubted daley realized early in life that he desired power , and he was willing to wait patiently for the opportunity to exercise it he spent three decades toiling quietly at the routine jobs of urban machine politics as secretary to an alderman , as a functionary in the county treasurers office , as a state legislator , as county clerk he was 53 years old when the chance to run for mayor finally arrived , in the spring of 1955 by then he had maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the countys democratic party , so he could essentially anoint himself for the job as the official candidate of the party organization , he had little difficulty winning nomination against the citys ineffectual twoterm reform mayor , martin j kennelly , and election against a goodgovernment republican it was on election night , april 5 , 1955 , that alderman paddy bauler danced a jig and uttered his famous pronouncement , chicago aint ready for reform !
miami you peruse the box score this morning and see that allan houston and latrell sprewell chipped paint off the rim , combining for more turnovers than baskets neither larry johnson nor patrick ewing found much of an offensive rhythm you see missed free throws , 10 paltry assists and a near collapse at the end of the game however ugly game 2 got last night , the knicks beat the heat what does it say \? marcus camby began after the knicks returned to the brooding , offensively challenged team of playoffs past with their 8276 victory it says we can win without our key guys knocking down shots in five playoff games , we have n't even really gotten into a nice flow on offense not like last year in the playoffs we 've got tons of room for improvement , that s how i look at it camby seemed to grasp what game 2 meant , how it illustrated the incredible margin for error the knicks have in this eastern conference semifinal series , and how miami has almost none it showed a forgotten dimension to the knicks' game , the nasty , ornery disposition that kept surfacing each time the heat got back in the game you know , perception is interesting , coach jeff van gundy said everybody describes miami as tough , competitive and great defensively he paused and added , but we are too before a lot of volatile and emotionally wounded people at american airlines arena who wore bright red , the knicks set themselves up beautifully in the fourofsevengame series they will play host to the next two games at madison square garden , on friday and sunday , a perfect chance to go up , three games to one , after seizing their third split in three years against the heat in miami the knicks accomplished the feat by combating pat riley s swarming , mauling defensive schemes with some of their own camby , whom van gundy was taken to task for not playing at the end of game 1 , used his elongated frame to rotate over to alonzo mourning every time ewing was beaten he also switched johnson to mourning when ewing picked up his third foul at one juncture , mourning missed 11 shots in a row unable to gather himself in the low post , he was not sure who would guard him next camby stayed out of foul trouble , finishing with 10 points , 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots he was indefatigable on the defensive end , making up for whatever mistakes the knicks made one on one charlie ward attacked the basket , going strong to the goal , right at the hobbling tim hardaway he made hardaway play defense and exploited the weak link in miami s defense a word about van gundy after one measly playoff loss , it was suggested by some of his players and others to go with a big backcourt , to better exploit hardaway he held firm with ward , choosing , as he said , doing it better over doing it different at any rate , as hard as it may have been to watch parts of this eyesore , this may have been the most clearcut case to make for the knicks' going to the finals for the second year in a row two of the most potent offensive players in all of pro basketball were kept in check , and they still won sprewell and houston paired for a 5of27 night from the field they were 2 for 18 in the first half , a feat that once took john starks an entire playoff game this was indeed a sloppy game , the sort only those with civic interest could find beauty in in the first half , miami made 7 of 20 free throws and the knicks shot 282 percent astonishingly , they led , 3834 until midway through the third quarter , watching ewing was painful at the outset , he did not have any legs , hands , touch or mobility operating on pride and heart alone , his every move toward the rim was met by the long arms of mourning or p j brown he did not find a rhythm of any sort till the end of the third quarter but together , they got it done sprewell played more aggressively on defense against jamal mashburn , whose rubbishtime points did not exactly make up for how badly he fizzled during important moments ewing , back spasms notwithstanding , made himself more of a force against mourning down low in game 1 , he behaved like a cardboard cutout , signing a nonaggression pact with his close friend while mourning finished with 17 rebounds and 17 points in game 2 , he made only 5 of 18 shots the heat wo n't feel any satisfaction from holding sprewell and houston down how a journeyman like dan majerle and players like bruce bowen and mashburn are able to shake the confidence of the knicks scorers is anyone s guess it is a theme that may very well play out when the two teams meet at the garden on friday night in game 3 but if you are van gundy , you cannot help but feel encouraged after what happened last night each time the heat closed within a point or tied the game , his team responded and repelled miami his athletes were handcuffed , and the big fella often moved like molasses but somehow the knicks managed to find the defensive resolve to win a huge playoff game on another team s floor now riley and his team come to new york , their postseason demons haunting them all over again they are resilient and they probably will not be run off the garden floor as easily as they were in game 3 last season but they have to be searching their minds , wondering why they cannot shake the knicks when it matters it was not pretty for either team , the equivalent of two club fighters flailing away at each other until someone either lost on cuts or was dropped but it was the kind of homely affair a good team had to win to ever hope of achieving great things unthinkable , no \? houston s cool and sprewell s fire were not needed when riley s guys hit back without their onetwo punch , the knicks convincingly won this is a better omen than van gundy will ever admit photo patrick ewing , trying to maneuver around the heat s alonzo mourning , scored 13 points last night he shot only 4 of 12 from the field and 5 of 8 from the freethrow line \( g paul burnett the new york

'the spiritual in art' islip art museum , 50 irish lane , east islip through nov 17 \( 631 \) 2245402 in his influential 1912 treatise , on the spiritual in art , the russian painter wassily kandinsky set out a program of artistic practice that enables men in general to experience the spiritual in the material this highminded aim became a touchstone of abstract art in the early years of modernism , and continues to inspire artists who have little or no direct connection with kandinsky s theories cutting across ideological and stylistic boundaries , the 12 artists in the current exhibition approach art s spiritual dimension from various perspectives some see it as a generalized phenomenon , while others rely on familiar symbolism and refer to religious or cultural belief systems that ally them to a specific spiritual context pamela long nolan comes closest to mirroring kandinsky s concern with sensory resonance and color s effect on the emotions her tonal canvases are abstract , yet they suggest the kind of natural phenomena , like misty dawns and watery reflections , that inspire romantic notions of spiritual transcendence so , too , the diffused , lambent surfaces of julian jackson s homages to greek mythology , as in danae , with its evocation of the golden shower that symbolizes zeus s visit to the imprisoned maiden to embody the spiritual in the material , donna henes uses rings of sand and gravel as surrogates for the earth s yellow , red , brown and white races her equation of common clay with the fundamentals of humankind makes a point about the essential similarity of superficially different people without resorting to wearetheworld cliches the spiritual dimension of material objects is also a feature of susan bickford s jewelry , which is less like personal adornment than like the amulets or reliquaries worn by shamans among the several artists who use religious references , veronique lerichefischetti fuses haitian and christian imagery in her intriguing doll effigies amy zerner draws on the zodiac , tarot cards , eastern dieties and classical mythology to create elaborate and highly decorative fabric collages that imply a fundamental unity of spiritual experience going over the top in this vein , however , alex grey posits the artist as the ultimate mediator , the channel through which pure spirit achieves material form even in our secular , materialistic age , such arrogance is a bit much 'four artists' emily lowe gallery , hofstra university , hempstead through dec 15 \( 516 \) 4635672 in 1986 , four longtime friends decided

deference to her colleague \) , harriet schorr a blue oval platter and nancy hagin a ceramic pitcher each artist worked independently , and although they all paint representationally , each came up with a highly individual composition the project was reprised 10 years later with different objects , and the results have been gathered together for the current show , four artists , four objects , ten years all four artists delight in elaborate combinations of color , texture and form , and often use reflections to enrich stilllifes that are already crammed with visual interest yet none of them are trompe l'oeil painters abstract devices , like tilting surfaces up toward the picture plane , simplifying complex shapes and heightening colors to unnatural levels , indicate that each , as ms schorr put it , is looking at reality without rejecting abstraction this is especially true of her oil , the carp sings the blues , in which the candlesticks and ceramic objects seem to float before a rippling blue backdrop comparison to ms hagin s watercolor , blue plate special , with its careful attention to implied space and tangible surface , or ms fish s oil , scat , with its luscious modeling and textural variety , shows how much individuality is possible within proscribed limitations the 10thanniversary series , with a coffeepot , candy box , glass vase and cupandplate set , provides equally revealing comparisons and contrasts the most imaginative variation is ms schorr s after the fall , in which the four objects and other elements are partly submerged in water or reflected on its surface again space seems arbitrary , solid forms dissolve in shimmering liquid and the concept of reality is transmuted into the artist s relative truth 'playing with the rules'

decorum their art is simultaneously amusing and provocative , seemingly simple yet far from superficial the rules they play with are expectations , which they confound by subversion at a distance , mr gamache s paintings appear to be orthodox geometric abstractions , but on inspection one sees that their structure is determined by connectthedot pictures from children s game books the artist has indeed connected the dots , but in ways that contradict the underlying images an alternative rationale is imposed to fashion a dissonant logic , another way of making sense right and wrong and good and bad ways of perceiving the world are called into question as alternative images collide and interact mr gachot s quirky combinations of found objects resemble folk art , but beneath the apparent naivete is a sophisticated message several of the pieces are meant to be animated , but in this installation they are grouped in a glass case that prevents activation , somewhat blunting their impact if one could hear the clatter of a wooden shoe tree in please be quiet or the ticking timer in i 'll be there in two minutes , the autobiographical commentary would be more evident and if the naughty

ocean city with last summer s lateevening drownings on their minds , officials in at least two south jersey beach towns are extending the hours that lifeguards will be on some popular swimming beaches atlantic city , which kept lifeguards on its kentucky avenue beach until 8 pm last year after an afterhours drowning there , will again keep patrols on duty until 8 on weekends and weekdays , said the chief of the beach patrol there , robert levy normally , lifeguards leave atlantic city beaches at 6 pm in addition , other beaches will remain open later on holidays and during particularly hot spells , mr levy said lots of places in poorer sections do n't have airconditioning , so you want to provide a safe bathing beach , he said in ocean city , where three people drowned last year at unguarded beaches , the city will keep three of its most crowded beaches the 8th , 9th and 12th streets beaches open on fridays , saturdays and sundays until 8 pm starting june 30 , said the assistant captain of the beach patrol here , bud mckinley lifeguards there usually leave the beach at 5 pm on weekdays and 5 30 pm on weekends mr mckinley said the city was also strengthening a rapidresponse team for afterhours emergencies , as is the beach patrol in cape may however , cape may is not extending its lifeguard hours beyond the regular quitting times 5 pm until july 1 and 5 30 pm for the rest of the summer said the supervisor of beaches there , harry j mogck jr i kind of have mixed feelings about it when you open one beach , mr mogck said mr mogck said he feared that if tourists heard a beach was open late , they could misunderstand the situation and head to the nearest beach for a swim , even if was not guarded but what concerns officials here is a repeat of last year s drownings a review of incidents at the beach showed that 7 30 pm was one of the most frequent times for drownings and rescues , mr mckinley said the statistics are pretty plain , he said that s the time these things happen he estimated that extending the lifeguards' hours at three of the town s beaches would cost about 10 , 000 in overtime mr mckinley said many people were probably coming to the beach later these days because of the heightened concern over exposure to the sun , particularly during the time when the sun s rays are strongest an informal survey of towns along the 127mile jersey shore did not turn up any other beaches extending lifeguards' hours , and officials in atlantic city and cape may said they knew of no other towns adding hours the assistant beach manager of sea bright , david farley said that changing life guard hours from their current 9 am to 5 pm would require changing a town ordinance it s also an economic issue , he said , adding that in the event of any really nasty water such as large waves brought on by a hurricane , the city may extend the beach patrol hours to keep people out of the water in other parts of the country , beach towns are becoming more flexible , said don rohrer , president of the united states livesaving association shifts vary from 8 to 24 hours a day , mr rohrer said , and beach patrols are starting to realize that if they want to protect the public s safety they have to be around when people want to swim people s lives are more flexible , mr rohrer said , and that is reflected in the times they are using the beach the presence of lifeguards is also an issue on the delaware following the drowning of seven people last summer at unguarded sections of the delaware water gap national recreation area , which straddles 70 , 000 acres in new jersey and pennsylvania over the 35year history of the park , there was less than one drowning a year on average however , said bill halainen , management assistant at the park , it was a very intense summer for crowds the drownings have prompted the park to institute an aggressive effort to educate visitors about water safety , said mr halainen he also said that a tentative plan to develop a guarded beach on what is known as the depew area on the new jersey side is getting greater attention , though there would not be lifeguards there this summer there are two areas on the pennsylvania side with 11 lifeguards in the summer and none on the new jersey side swimming is allowed anywhere along the river photo bryan fox at the kentucky avenue beach in atlantic city , where guards will stay until 8 pm \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)

albany , july 28 politicians of all stripes are charging that the last few days have marked a revival of one of new york s least proud political traditions trying to gain advantage by manipulating who is or is not on the ballot seven republican state senators facing tough challenges have sued the tiny working families party , making a fairly novel argument that it is not a legally functioning party not incidentally , all seven republicans tried to get the working families nomination but failed , and the party s line went to their democratic challengers meanwhile , on thursday , the democrats on the board of elections blocked an effort to knock four littleknown democrats off the united states senate primary ballot , even though they clearly had not collected enough signatures to qualify this means that in the sept 12 primary , hillary rodham clinton could face five obscure challengers rather than one , diluting the antihillary vote and making her allbutcertain victory seem more resounding it s embarrassing , a state elections official said of the two disputes you do n't see this kind of garbage happening in other states new york is , of course , famous for such maneuvering just this year , gov george e pataki and the state republican party tried to keep senator john mccain off the state s presidential primary ballot , a move for which they were vilified , and that ultimately failed the rules for entering a presidential primary have been eased , and mr pataki has proposed relaxing them further , but the rules for other offices remain among the toughest in the country in the case of the working families party , seven republican state senators filed suit in their respective counties on wednesday and thursday , challenging not only the nominating petitions for their opponents a commonplace tactic in new york but the party s right to nominate any candidates at all the senators are roy m goodman of manhattan guy j velella of the bronx frank m padavan of queens michael a l balboni , kemp hannon and carl l marcellino of nassau county and thomas p morahan of rockland county none of the senators would discuss their suits on the record but some acknowledged , on the condition that their names not be used , that they knew nothing about the legal arguments behind their suits , and that the idea had come not from them but from the senate republican campaign committee the complaints note that the working families party , first created in 1998 and with fewer than 5 , 000 registered voters , does not yet have an elected state committee , only an interim committee working families officials say they are in the process of electing a state committee for the first time , following the timetable set by the board of elections this is just pure harassment , and hypocritical beyond belief , dan cantor , executive director of the party , said of the lawsuits the working families party did give its line to one republican state senator , george d maziarz of western new york , but the republicans have not challenged that nomination the law says they had to elect a state committee within their first year of existence , said john ciampoli , the lawyer for the seven republican senators who sued they did n't do it it s that simple all seven republican state senators are seen as vulnerable this year , leading to unusually heated struggles for minorparty lines that could provide the margin of victory in a close race a judge in albany and a judge in nassau county ordered that the seven suits be consolidated into one in mrs clinton s race , it became certain in recent days that she would face a primary , as mark mcmahon , a manhattan doctor , filed far more than the 15 , 000 signatures needed to get on the ballot four other democrats also filed petitions to appear on the primary ballot , but all fell well short of the requirements yet when the matter went before the state board of elections on thursday , and the two republican commissioners voted to disqualify the four challengers , the two democratic commissioners abstained three votes are needed to knock someone off the ballot this is obviously an attempt to jam hillary down the throats of democratic voters , said dan allen , spokesman for the state republican party they like to talk about a united party , but clearly it s not carol berman , the democratic chairwoman of the board of elections , denied that her abstention had anything to do with mrs clinton s prospects but she admitted that the petitions are in no way in compliance with the election law but she pointed to mr mccain s case this year , when judge edward r korman , in federal district court in brooklyn , ruled that the petitiongathering rules were too onerous she noted that he not only ordered that mr mccain be placed on the presidential primary ballot , but also ordered the inclusion of alan keyes , who had not filed any petitions judge korman explicitly limited his ruling to presidential primaries , but ms berman said the same rule should apply in the senate race mr mcmahon s campaign has signaled that it will go to court to challenge the board s decision and have the other four democrats thrown off the ballot republican officials said today that they might join such a suit

los angeles it is just a short walk from the staples center , where the democrats , the news media and assorted demonstrators spent the week playing out the politics of the information age but the thriving los angeles fashion district has more in common with 12thcentury baghdad than the california of the new millennium the 80block jumble of prewar commercial buildings , hastily constructed lowrise arcades commingled with a few modern towers , is home to 5 , 000 companies employing 50 , 000 people and taking in 8 billion a year in wholesale and retail sales and it epitomizes raw capitalism in both its glory and its shame the district has a reputation for paying its lowest rung of workers brutally low wages which drew the ire of demonstrators last week and for having too little respect for trademark laws and tax codes but for many of those who work here , including some who have made fortunes , the district also reflects the essence of the american dream it is a place

they are big and growing one new building that he is constructing with his moroccanborn partner , moshe aflalo , has space for 13 retail stores and more than 60 companies clamoring to fill them the district , just southeast of the center of downtown los angeles , was widely perceived as dirty and dangerous five years ago , but it has since blossomed property values have more than doubled and vacancies , particularly for groundfloor properties , are almost impossible to find in much of the area , said ed zoraster , a vice president at cb richard ellis , a real estate broker the city has issued more than 650 building permits for renovations or new construction in the district since 1995 mr zoraster gives some credit for the revival to a business improvement district , organized that year , that has improved the neighborhood s appearance and security but the most important factor , he said , has been the drive of immigrants like mr harkham , 52 , who came to los angeles in 1975 after living in israel and australia like many of his peers , mr harkham brought with him the bazaar culture of his native land , with its love of bargaining , jostling and quick , seatofthepants decisionmaking at the end of the day , the middle easterners are all traders at heart arab , jew and persian , christian , muslim , it does n't matter , he said we have the ambition and the drive others do n't the fashion business is so fast you have to be willing to be a gambler , and live on the edge jerry sullivan , the editor of california apparel news , a trade paper , said newcomers from the middle east and north africa had largely replaced the americanborn jewish entrepreneurs , many transplanted from new york , who helped establish los angeles as a leading center for sportswear and women s garment manufacturing in the 1950 s though middle easterners own only 7 percent of the district s apparel manufacturers and account for a negligible part of the factory work force , they own most of the area s premier brands , including guess , hot kiss , bissou bissou and bcbg , and control much of the region s textile trade these guys are better at developing brands and styles than anyone else who has been here , mr sullivan said they are more aggressive than the nativeborn they know what sexy is they are willing to strike their own path and offer no apologies the restaurant scene in the district has come to reflect the new ethnic order many israeli , persian and north african establishments have opened , and many get the bulk of their sales from meals they deliver to their perpetually harried customers korean eateries are also popping up , reflecting korean immigrants' emergence as the second powerful ethnic influence in the increasingly polyglot district unlike those from the middle east , who dominate the local industry s highfashion end , the korean entrepreneurs tend to make their presence felt in the lower price ranges and in manufacturing victor c kim , owner of cherish international , a consulting firm in the district , said people of korean background own at least 600 wholesale and retail operations , as many as 1 , 000 contractors the companies who actually do the sewing under contract from marketers and design houses and hundreds of knitting and other manufacturing operations mr kim said many business people of korean descent in the district felt unfairly tarred with negative stereotypes that koreans rely on knockoffs of styles developed by others that the worst wages and most abusive labor practices are found in their factories that they dodge paying taxes in fact , he said , koreans are more likely than other groups to be victims of unfair business practices , like landlords' demands for astronomical rents and key money , an upfront payment to obtain a lease that can run as high as 200 , 000 protests by korean groups against this practice have been laced with talk about merchant of venice figures , a nonetoosubtle stereotyping of the landlords , many of whom are jewish , mr sullivan said
that cigar the one that was being puffed by daniel snyder , the washington redskins' owner , throughout the weekend s national football league draft get used to seeing it get used to seeing snyder in a state of glee get used to seeing people pat him on the back , as they did after washington s outstanding draft get used to seeing the redskins win a lot of games get it through your head right now they are the best team in football that smile tampa bay coach tony dungy wears it well it s a confident smile it s a comfortable smile like the redskins , the buccaneers also had a great draft , just a different one imagine this a team owns no firstround selections and has one of the best drafts of the weekend how is that possible \? it s done by trading away two firstround selections , two unknowns , for the pro bowl wide receiver keyshawn johnson in one swift move , the buccaneers' offense went from the stone age to the industrial age this is the nature of the nfl draft it can transform average teams into good ones , and good teams into great teams suddenly , the two best are washington and tampa bay not st louis the rams will be so battered with every team playing them as if it s the super bowl that they will be bound to take a step back not tennessee the titans were a freakish play from losing in the first round last season not indianapolis the colts do n't have a good enough defense just yet washington is the king of the league right now the buccaneers are a close second and both teams can thank their new status because of this draft how each went about using its picks to get to this point is one of the better stories of these past few days the redskins were involved in many trade discussions in recent weeks for either the second or third pick , or both at one point , according to snyder , the team seriously considered trading for johnson it was close at one point , snyder said , but it would have taken a lot for us to give up one of our top two picks washington briefly considered trading the third pick for johnson and two of the jets' four firstround picks the jets thought that was too high a price and then focused on trading johnson to tampa bay so the redskins stayed put , and in the end knew that was the right thing to do there were a lot of teams that wanted to make trades with us , snyder said , but we thought , 'how can we not sit still and take these two great players \? ' keeping the picks was a brilliant move and do n't think it was an obvious one a number of teams would have made the trade with the jets and then missed out on two great players penn state linebacker lavar arrington is possibly the next lawrence taylor he is the kind of player who can almost singlehandedly turn the team s mediocre defense into a great one arrington is so undaunted by the taylor comparisons , he will be wearing a no 56 jersey , the same number taylor wore with the giants alabama offensive left tackle chris samuels , the perfect quarterback bodyguard , can anchor washington s offensive line for 10 years the draft picks , combined with the offseason signings of defensive end bruce smith , safety mark carrier , quarterback jeff george and running back adrian murrell , make washington a super bowl favorite the team may further distance itself from others after , as expected , it signs deion sanders and jerry rice when both are likely cut by their teams after june 1 sometimes the best trades , snyder said , are the ones you do n't make or do make the buccaneers , with the 13th and 27th picks , looked at the list of college wide receivers and liked what they saw , but none could compare to johnson once they discovered the jets were trying to trade him , the bucs moved quickly to see if they could afford a contract that would eat a significant portion of their salary cap after determining they could , they decided to lay low until the draft approached and then made the play for johnson the buccaneers got a proven talent whose big frame helps them inside the 20yard line , where they fared poorly last year johnson will also keep teams from stacking the line of scrimmage with seven men to slow tampa bay s running game riding its great defense last season , the buccaneers were already one play away from the super bowl now , with johnson , they are remarkably better doubleteam johnson , and tampa bay will hand off the ball to mike alstott stack the line against alstott , and johnson will do what he did with the jets pick a defense apart two great teams , two great drafts , two different approaches the redskins smartly keep their two picks and make two good selections the buccaneers give up their two picks but still have a successful weekend because they get johnson so get ready for lots of cigars in the nation s capital and lots of smiles in tampa bay and for one of the teams probably the redskins super bowl rings

washington , june 28 following are excerpts from the supreme court ruling today that a federal government program that places computers in parochial school classrooms does not violate the constitutional separation between church and state the vote in mitchell v helms was 6 to 3 justice clarence thomas wrote the majority opinion justice david h souter wrote the dissent from the decision by justice thomas as part of a longstanding school aid program known as chapter 2 , the federal government distributes funds to state and local governmental agencies , which in turn lend educational materials and equipment to public and private schools , with the enrollment of each participating school determining the amount of aid that it receives the question is whether chapter 2 , as applied in jefferson parish , la , is a law respecting an establishment of religion , because many of the private schools receiving chapter 2 aid in that parish are religiously affiliated we hold that chapter 2 is not such a law the establishment clause of the first amendment dictates that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools as we admitted in tilton v richardson , candor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area considering chapter 2 in light of our more recent case law , we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion we therefore hold that chapter 2 is not a law respecting an establishment of religion as we indicated in agostini , and have indicated elsewhere , the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action we have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid subsidizes religion , as our religion cases use that term in distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the state and indoctrination that is not , we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality , upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion if the religious , irreligious , and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid , no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government for attribution of indoctrination is a relative question if the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide , so to speak , a broad range of indoctrination , the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular indoctrination to put the point differently , if the government , seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose , offers aid on the same terms , without regard to religion , to all who adequately further that purpose , then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose the government , in crafting such an aid program , has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients as a way of assuring neutrality , we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals we have viewed as significant whether the private choices of individual parents , as opposed to the unmediated will of government , determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid , and how much for if numerous private choices , rather than the single choice of a government , determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria , then a government cannot , or at least cannot easily , grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for preexisting recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program , and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones applying the two relevant agostini criteria , we see no basis for concluding that jefferson parish s chapter 2 program has the effect of advancing religion chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination , because it determines eligibility for aid neutrally , allocates that aid based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren and does not provide aid that has an impermissible content nor does chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to religion
stepping up the race to stake out territory in the new world of digital books , random house , the largest united states trade publisher , plans today to announce the creation of a new purely digital imprint beginning in january , the house will publish under the name atrandom a list of about 20 purely digital books , by authors ranging from the editor of harper s magazine to a downtown dominatrix all will be sold online as electronic books or in single copies printed on demand , but they will not be shipped to bookstores random house becomes the second major house to begin a digital imprint , following time warner trade publishing , which this spring created a digital imprint of its own , ipublishcom all the biggest new york publishing houses are now moving quickly to prepare for the possibility that digital books will soon take off over lunches at michael s , the four seasons and other industry hubs , editors are quietly courting agents and authors , trying to sign deals for the digital rights to their new and previously published books as they acquire new titles , they are beginning to establish the rules of digital publishing , from authors' royalties to the prices consumers will pay in many cases , especially for brand name authors and older contracts , authors' agents have retained digital rights for publishers , that means there is a vast pool of potentially profitable literary properties waiting to be claimed , sometimes from another house s list time warner , for example , will publish the electronic versions of several books by the science writer , james gleick , previously published in hardcover by random house s pantheon imprint both random house and time warner are hoping to build their reputations as desirable places for authors to publish digitally , much the way places like random house s sister imprint vintage are prestigious names to appear under in paperback some in the book business wonder why the rush even ann godoff , president and publisher of random house trade group and creator of the digital imprint , admitted that she had not yet managed to enjoy reading a book off a screen , or read a whole electronic book neither has almost anyone else in the industry many others , meanwhile , worry that online copyright protection is open to question printondemand books , though roughly comparable in appearance to trade paperbacks , remain expensive to produce lightning source , which provides the service to publishers , charges a publisher 480 to produce a single copy of a 300page book , which is more expensive than traditional printing except in handling titles that sell fewer than 1 , 000 copies a year but many publishers have high expectations for the profits from the new digital books laurence kirshbaum , chairman of time warner trade publishing , says selling electronic books will boost the industry s annual growth rate from single to double digits the microsoft corporation will release a new version of its electronic book reader next week , the first version for reading on desktop and laptop computers as well as on expensive handheld devices publishers say the company has estimated that 2 million people will download free copies in the first two weeks dick brass , microsoft s vice president of technology development , believes that the market for electronic books will exceed 1 billion in five years this is the brave new world we want to see , said ms godoff at random house no printing , no paper and binding , no need for a sales conference or printed catalogue we do n't know the size of the market , but it could be potentially very profitable for us she has particularly high hopes for printondemand technology , because it enables publishers to profitably publish lowselling new and old titles with narrow readerships , and it obviates the risk of holding inventory jonathan karp , vice president and senior editor at the random house trade group , will head the new imprint he said he began this spring approaching authors and agents about signing allelectronic contracts for new books , swearing each one to secrecy and revealing none of the other writers' names many have verbal agreements but no formal contracts yet mr karp said he acquired the rights to projects he thought suited the medium the quest to end baldness by the new york post columnist , gersh kuntzman , and mistress ruby ties it together by robin shamburg , a dominatrix who also writes a column for nypress , may work better in electronic form because they can be bought and read in private without the embarrassment of taking them to a cashier others will be collections of previously published magazine articles by harper s editor , lewis lapham , and the writers tad friend and donald katz such collections do not sell many copies in paper , but the low volumes make sense in electronic form , and new material might be added to the collections over time some will be as short as the equivalent of about 150 pages others , like the collections , as long as 300page books
twenty years ago tonight , the result of the miracle on ice was well known before abc showed it in prime time the live lake placid scene behind the host jim mckay might have been a giveaway that the 1980 united states olympic hockey team had defeated the heavily favored soviet union , 43 joyous , smiling fans raised a banner saying , go for gold abc had tried , unsuccessfully , to shift the start from 5 pm to 8 pm what some have called the greatest sports moment of the century wound up on tape delay but mckay was not a spoilsport , saying the events you 're going to be seeing tonight have been completed it may be that many millions of you know the results however , we said at the beginning we would not tip the results the most striking thing about the game , to be replayed tonight at 9 o'clock eastern time on espn classic , is how refreshingly clean it looks no onice or dasherboard ads , no continuous score and clock , few graphics , no behindthegoal cameras , no rinkside reporters and few crowd shots \( among them , one of jamie farr \) the game s one unnatural additive blue dye to make the ice more telegenic the director ron harrison , a veteran of 15 years at hockey night in canada , used three cameras to tell the evolving drama it was enough it was basically 'hockey night , ' he said stick with the story he received only one instruction from roone arledge , then the president of abc sports he wanted to see the puck , that s all , harrison said the broadcast is also remarkable for the deftness of its announcers , al michaels and ken dryden , who was especially valuable in describing the american team s defensive lapses michaels had called one hockey game before the '80 winter games at the '72 winter olympics in sapporo and dryden had called none if i had n't grown up as a hockey fan , i 'd have been worried , michaels said but i knew the game , understood it and loved the game , and by the time we called the ussoviet game , we 'd done 14 or 15 games that week michaels and dryden practiced more by playing a tabletop hockey game in their hotel room without much else to do , they familiarized themselves with the foreign names playing for coming opponents of the american team we played it every night , said arthur kaminsky , dryden s lawyer and hotel roommate michaels is saying , 'kasatonov to krutov to kharlamov' michaels recalled dryden was the most booksmart athlete i 've ever worked with , yet he played this muckmuck style of tabletop hockey i'm trying to play sovietstyle offense and he s just whamming the rod of his defenseman to knock my goalie off his hinge what viewers may notice this time around is that abc did not carry the entire game to fit it into prime time and show men s slalom chunks were cut dennis lewin , then coordinating producer of abc s wide world of sports , edited out segments as the game was played vladimir krutov put the soviets ahead , 10 , at 9 minutes 12 seconds of the first period , but less than five minutes of action had been shown by then after aleksandr maltsev gave the soviets a 32 lead at 2 18 of the second , abc cut out an 8 27 chunk about 3 30 more was excised from the start of the third period it s easy to say afterwards , 'why did we do that \? ' said lewin , now the senior vice president for broadcasting for the national football league but going in , we did n't expect to carry it virtually in its entirety your fondest hope was that the us team would keep it close , not that they would win if i cut out too much , we 'd be dead meat one thing he added was an inset of the clock showing that mark johnson s tying goal in the first period came with only one second left had lewin left more in , viewers might have seen more of the pummeling taken by jim craig , the american goalie but little else the final 10 minutes whipped by , sped along by some of lewin s cuts with barely a minute left , dryden speculated on whether the soviets had practiced pulling their goalie \( they had n't \) on abc s platform , michaels recalled thinking stay calm and collected the hotter it gets , the cooler i have to be the feeling was so intense it was so loud , you could feel the sound harrison said , the mobile truck was shaking it was 40 feet outside in the final seconds came michaels s coda do you believe in miracles \? yes ! it s hard to remember that he said anything else what led in to it \? bilyaletdinov checked by ramsey mcclanahan is there the puck is still there eleven seconds you 've got 10 seconds the countdown going on right now morrow up to silk five seconds left in the game michaels had little time to wonder if he had said something indelible right after the american victory , he and dryden called the swedenfinland contest at 11 30 , michaels said , i got back to my hotel and somebody in the lobby said , 'it was great what you said at the end of the game' i had to think for a second i could n't remember exactly what i 'd said and he said 'do you believe in miracles \? yes ! '
a city bus driver lost control on 34th street yesterday evening , crossed two lanes of oncoming traffic and struck an onduty traffic enforcement agent before driving onto the sidewalk and smashing into a building , the police said thirty passengers and the driver were also hurt , though none of the injuries were lifethreatening , said detective john giammarino , a police spokesman the blueandwhite m34 bus was headed east on 34th street just east of ninth avenue about 7 20 pm when the driver apparently blacked out , an investigator said the bus veered to the north side of the street and hit the traffic agent who was talking to the driver of a parked car and hit the parked car itself , detective giammarino said the 19ton bus , picking up speed , went up onto the sidewalk , crushed several saplings and a mediumsized tree , shattered a large concrete planter and cracked the facade of 333 west 34th , home to offices of salomon smith barney and several other companies , witnesses and the police said someone yelled , 'where are you going \? ' and we just went over the tree and you could just see that you were going to crash , a passenger , anne roxone , told reporters a witness , jean bolcy , 34 , told the associated press that he saw the driver slumped over at the wheel as the bus headed for the building he did n't even slow down , mr bolcy said if he had n't hit that wall , he 'd still be going some of the passengers climbed out the windows of the bus the 25yearold driver , who had been driving for new york city transit for 18 months , was in serious but stable condition at st vincents hospital and medical center and was undergoing tests , the authorities said he could not recall the moments leading up to the accident , an investigator said the traffic agent , who suffered head and neck trauma , was in stable condition at bellevue hospital center , said john clark , a hospital spokesman twentyeight of the passengers were taken to hospitals in manhattan and one of them , who had upper body trauma , was admitted overnight at bellevue , mr clark said none of the victims' names were released 333 west 34th , a ninestory building , received only cosmetic damage , said paul wien , a spokesman for the buildings department the parked car , a 1999 toyota corolla , had its rear end badly damaged all in all , said the city s director of emergency management , richard j sheirer , the accident could have been much worse this may be a true miracle on 34th street , that you could have a city bus go up on the sidewalk at 7 o'clock on a warm summer night and have only one person get hit , he said mr bolcy s description of the driver slumped over at the wheel as the bus careered down the sidewalk was reminiscent of accounts of another midtown bus crash , in october 1997 in that accident , on fifth avenue , the driver suffered a seizure that pinned his foot to the accelerator he lost control of his bus for seven blocks , killing a foot messenger , critically injuring a bicyclist and plowing into two cars before crashing into a building photo a city bus hit a traffic enforcement agent and ran into a building on west 34th street last night \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
in his sparsely furnished apartment perched high above west end avenue and dominated by a steinway grand , the pianist robert taub was poring over musical manuscripts one recent afternoon , as he often does when i learn a piece , mr taub says , i ask myself , 'why am i learning it \? ' and the answer is that i feel a lot about it and think there s something about it that i can communicate but then i ask 'why did the composer write it \? what did it mean to him \? ' and the best answers are in the sketches and the autograph scores , where you can see what choices were made and why it is not impossible to interpret a piece of music from the printed score alone , and often an artist has no choice still , the printed score is the diagram of a result , whereas a manuscript captures the shape of inspiration on the wing that , ideally , is what mr taub wants to see no editor will print a double negative , mr taub declares by way of illustration the point arises apropos of beethoven s sonata no 30 in e , which mr taub will perform on friday evening in a rare piano recital in the coolidge auditorium at the library of congress in washington the library , not incidentally , owns the manuscript of the sonata , as it does those of haydn s sonata in e flat \( hob xvi 52 \) and milton babbitt s canonical form , also on the program the double negative occurs in the finale of the beethoven sonata , which starts out as a conventional theme and variations but after four clearly designated variations takes on a freer , more adventurous character the last bar of the theme appears in published editions without either a ritardando or a pedal marking quite rightly , since beethoven , having written them in ink , later scratched them out in pencil , his customary implement for registering second thoughts he brought out the pencil again at the end of the sonata , where the theme recurs in its original form here , he decided on reflection , the ritardando and the pedaling mark were in order , along with a new low e , for resonance the reverse adjustments at the beginning and the end of the movement point to the same conclusion that the theme and the opening variations are not modular segments on the contrary , the movement unfolds as a single trajectory , no pauses for breath along the way like other pianists , mr taub first learned the beethoven from printed scores to the best of his knowledge \( and he has not failed to look \) , no facsimile of the manuscript exists his path first led him to the library of congress as he was preparing his 10cd series of the complete beethoven piano sonatas for vox classics , a survey as remarkable for the intellectual grasp of the material as for its technical assurance and aura of poetic spontaneity that was when i really began to realize what treasures autograph scores are , he says the immersion in the spiritual world of the composer became so much more intense every printed edition is sterile compared to an autograph score the calligraphy is imbued with the composer s emotion while rehearing the music in the process of writing it down some of the beethoven sonatas look very neat others show evidence of greater struggle to find just the right artistic statement some are very messy , but they give you the sweep of the music thus , to an artist of mr taub s turn of mind , the spacious arrangement of an arpeggio of grace notes in the manuscript of the e major sonata gives a graphic image of the generous elasticity with tempo beethoven had in mind the same little notes squashed into minimum space in the printed score give priority to mere thrift , sending a subliminal and potentially misleading message the fact that a tempo marking that readers of the printed score simply know as prestissimo \( a rare term in beethoven \) is expanded in pencil from the original ink presto likewise strikes mr taub as powerfully suggestive the revelations of an autograph take many forms the haydn sonata on mr taub s program , the composer s last , written for the sophisticated taste of audiences in london , combines the masterly plan of a formal french garden with an english garden s lush , casual exuberance the printed editions do not obscure haydn s unfettered , apparently improvisatory panache , but the manuscript magnifies those impressions by orders of magnitude like the famously immaculate manuscripts of mozart , it is pristine , fluent , devoid of decorative flourish , essentially elegant rather than demonstratively so beyond the sheer beauty of haydn s hand , however , the autograph also holds a few hidden surprises mr taub , a practiced and eloquent guide to the music he plays , goes briefly off the record to fulminate against the reputable publishers who presume , in supposedly authentic editions , to correct mr haydn silently rather than face up to his occasional waywardness he points to the evidence of bars 40 and 48 of the second movement , where the composer s clusters of 32ndnotes add up , respectively , to an extra half beat and full beat per measure on no authority whatsoever , editors solve the equation by cutting 32nds in two , creating hasty flurries of 64thnotes that regularize the meter but disrupt the eddy and flow of the music no , the pianist admits with a broad grin , the arithmetic does n't up , and mr haydn just did n't care the reputation of an intellectual is a dubious asset for a performer among contemporary pianists , perhaps only alfred brendel and maurizio pollini have reconciled it with stardom

aftabuddin rayman smokes alone , in windowless rooms , deep into the night four times a week , as most people are getting off work , mr rayman eases his toyota camry into a narrow canyon of warehouses near the east river on the edge of greenpoint dressed in a blue cotton uniform , he enters the cool inner chambers of the acme smoked fish corporation , where , on a typical day , 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 pounds of salmon , brook trout , whitefish , bluefish , sable and chubs await his arrival the fish , whole or filleted , has already been cured in brine it hangs in neat rows on sixfoottall racks , above tiled floors that still glisten after being hosed down by the day shift almost alone in a silent factory that smells like smoldering campfires , mr rayman wheels the racks , one after another , into walkin ovens , creating a solid wall of fish in each one he sets the thermostat , leaving his charges to dry for several hours , and then returns like a sorcerer to conjure up the smoke that will give the company s fish its trademark flavor acme has its origins in the early 1900 s as a pushcart owned by a russian immigrant named harry brownstein , who sold smoked fish in lower manhattan and brooklyn today , under three of mr brownstein s grandsons , the 150employee company processes about eight million pounds of north atlantic , great lakes , pacific and south pacific fish a year , selling to all states except alaska , and occasionally to israel among its customers are some of new york s most discerning fish purveyors saul zabar drops in once a week to select stock for zabar s smoked fish counter aquavit gets its herring and smoked salmon there mark russ federman shops there for his lower east side store russ daughters and although mr rayman s name may be unknown among manhattan s epicurean glitterati , the idea that he should end up as smoker to the stars seems logical somehow , everywhere i turn i end up with fish , said mr rayman , 54 , who comes from guyana and spent his teenage years catching prawns on trawlers in the atlantic ocean he moved to new york in 1984 and found a job at acme , curing fish by day two years later , fate intervened the previous smoker , he took ill , mr rayman said one of the owners , eric caslow , showed him some techniques , and he became the fourth smoker in the company s history soon mr rayman , a softspoken man with a modest smile , was experimenting with his own tricks of course , at first it would n't come out right , he said some days i 'd give it too much smoke and it became dark sometimes i did n't dry it properly and it would n't cook over the years , he mastered the subtleties of the craft , like learning to tell , by squeezing with one latexgloved hand , when a fish is dry enough to be smoked \( when pressed together the two sides should feel tacky , so the smoke can adhere to the skin \) or knowing by sight which fish were wild and which were farmraised \( the wild fish , which struggle for their food are not as fatty and can have blood spots from writhing in nets or on hooks \) mr rayman also learned the difference between cold and hot smoking cold smoking , which gives nova its bright orange color and sushilike consistency , is more automated , requiring only periodic monitoring of the 72degree temperature to do so , mr rayman rides a slow electric lift through a twotiered chamber where sides of salmon lie in multilayered bunk beds , halfobscured by an opaque blanket of smoke but hot smoking is where the artistry lies the hot smoke is done through human initiative , mr rayman said , heaving a 50pound bag of sawdust into one of two smoke generators for the next few hours , the kilnlike contraptions , which look something like antique washing machines , burn through several bags of the sawdust , pumping dense smoke through pipes that lead to the ovens the fish is then cooked for several hours hot smoking , mr rayman explained , entails a lot more than just setting the oven to x or y the type and size of the fish dictate the methods whitefish and whiting are cooked at 180 degrees , but sable should go up only to about 120 , otherwise the bellies start to open up and it does n't cook , he said weather , too , plays a role on hot , humid days the fish require three or four hours of drying but less smoking time winter days call for more smoking , but then it s easy to make the fish too dry mr rayman s work includes cleaning the smoke generators every day to remove accumulated tar it can also involve grueling extra duty around christmas or passover , he regularly works 16hour shifts to meet all the extra orders but the job also allows for down periods while the ovens do their magic mr rayman , who is muslim , uses the time to attend to his religious duties a calendar of prayer times hangs behind the smoking machines , and mr rayman keeps a prayer rug and a plasticwrapped copy of the koran in a sootblackened locker along the wall mr caslow , who trained mr rayman , said there was very little turnover for the smoker s position it s kind of a lifetime job , he said it needs somebody who s reliable , conscientious and relatively bright otherwise a lot of other people s labor has gone for naught mr rayman contends that good training alone is not enough to make an expert smoker they 've got to care about it , he said they 've got to care about how the fish comes out not just to do it as a job it would seem that a fish smoker would run some of the same health risks as firefighters stinging eyes , irritated sinuses and lungs but mr rayman says that the smoke does n't bother him and that his doctor has given him a clean bill of health his wife , a former packer at the company , maintains certain rules , though when i come home , the clothes i wear , you 've got to put outside the bedroom , he said he takes a bath every morning to slough off his smoky outer layer , or else i ca n't go in the bed , he added , laughing mr rayman has three children , but none have followed him into his profession and if , somewhere in the city , there is a community of fellow smokers with whom mr rayman might compare technique and exchange tips , he has never heard of it but i never went out looking , he added , explaining that for him , solitude is a treasured part of his job i can do this as long as i'm able to do it , you know , because i'm happy here , he said i read the paper , read the koran , read whatever i 've got to read what about partaking in the delicacies that surround him 10 hours a day \? very seldom , he said with an abashed smile fish plays a big part in guyanese cuisine , he said , but it is rarely smoked we grew up using a lot of tropical fish , he explained we eat them in curries it is n't that this fish is n't tasty , but we have n't acquired a taste for it photos i can do this as long as i'm able to do it , you know , because i'm happy here , says aftabuddin rayman , fish smoker aftabuddin rayman stoking the

part of a retaining wall at a midtown construction site collapsed yesterday morning , disrupting rushhour subway service and traffic north of times square for several hours no one was injured in the relatively minor collapse , at the northwest corner of broadway and 55th street , but it led to delays for thousands of subway riders , as transit officials shut down service on portions of the 1 , 2 , 3 , 9 , a , b , c , d and q lines on the west side and police officials closed parts of broadway near the site of the collapse there was a partial collapse of a retaining wall on the 55th street side , about 8 45 am , said thomas dunne , the deputy chief in charge of the fire department s third division we do n't know what caused it but we are investigating the retaining wall was one that provided a temporary frame for the foundation of the building about to rise on the site , which covers the entire west side of broadway from 55th to 56th streets the building , an 850 , 000squarefoot tower being developed by related companies , will be the headquarters of random house fire department officials quickly established that none of the dozens of construction workers at the site were injured and then began shoring up the 40foot section of wall that collapsed paul wein , a spokesman for the city s department of buildings , said that building inspectors ordered the owner of the property , 56 st assoc , llc to stop construction until the wall was shored up and the contractor provided an acceptable plan to prevent further problems subway service was disrupted because city officials , concerned about vibrations causing a further collapse , asked new york city transit to stop trains running under broadway , the avenue of the americas , and seventh and eighth avenues trains were stopped at 9 28 am restricted service , with trains traveling no more than 10 miles per hour , resumed at 9 55 am full service was restored by 11 15 am , transit officials said for riders like rana dershowitz , a manhattan lawyer , the morning trip to work became an ordeal her normal 15minute subway ride from west 86th street turned into a much longer trip she was greeted at her station by commuters leaving , warning her that the trains were not running ms dershowitz hopped on a bus , but it became snarled in traffic at west 65th street the bus driver s jokes helped keep everyone in surprisingly good spirits , ms dershowitz said but she gave up after 15 minutes , she said , got off the bus and walked the last 10 blocks to her office elsewhere in midtown , buses overloaded with passengers passed by people waiting at stops last month an engineer for the moderne hotel on 55th street reported that he had found cracks running from the basement to the roof of the sixstory hotel the damage was so severe that the elevator shafts and building itself had slid slightly , the engineer , lewis l zickel , said mr zickel said he had not yet concluded that the hotel s problems were related to the construction it is unclear , but my experience tells me that adjacent construction does have some impact on the adjoining building , mr zickel said but , mr wein said , when fire and buildings department officials inspected both the hotel and the construction site , they found a couple of cracks , but it was not in imminent danger of collapse and there was no reason to vacate still , moderne officials evacuated the building on the recommendation of the engineer , until recently , related had planned to build an apartment house and hotel on the land plaza construction corporation has been hired to build the office space and the architectural firm of hellmuth , obata kassabaum to design it
gov george w bush is in top physical shape , has never had a serious illness , and there is no medical reason that he could not serve a full term as president , mr bush and the doctor who has performed mr bush s annual checkups since 1989 said in interviews mr bush , 54 , said yesterday that he was perfectly healthy his doctor , kenneth h cooper of the cooper clinic in dallas , said in earlier interviews that mr bush has no significant medical problems , period , and all the tests for mr bush were normal in his last checkup , on june 30 dr cooper said mr bush had not taken a sick day from work in many years and took no prescribed medications except for vitamins and minerals sold by dr cooper s clinic mr bush s running mate , dick cheney , 59 , has had three heart attacks , but none since a quadruple bypass operation in 1988 last summer , two doctors issued letters saying mr cheney was in excellent health and briefly summarizing his medical history mr cheney has declined requests to interview him and his doctors about his health , even though the doctors said they wanted to talk they are jonathan s reiner , a cardiologist , and gary malakoff , an internist , at george washington university medical center in washington in recent years , disclosure of medical data has become common because of the serious illnesses presidents have suffered while in the white house mr bush , in a 10minute telephone interview between campaign stops in minnesota yesterday , promised to disclose any illness he developed as president because i am on the people s time to relieve the stress of campaigning , mr bush said , he prays , laughs , even at his own mistakes , spends time with his family , and exercises i woke up this morning and felt pretty strong and got on a machine for 30 minutes and i ran yesterday and i 'll try to run tomorrow if i feel up to it , mr bush said he said he sleeps six and a half to seven hours a night i 've done a pretty good job of being able , you know , to get my mind at ease and to not let the moment of the crisis of the day trouble me , he said dr cooper said that individuals routinely had a psychological evaluation in their first examination at his clinic as a baseline to check for conditions like anxiety and depression , and that mr bush did not have them mr bush said he had never received psychiatric or psychological counseling at his last checkup , mr bush weighed 1945 pounds \( up two pounds from 1999 \) and had a normal body fat of 1994 percent \( up from 1911 percent \) , changes that dr cooper attributed to campaigning in june , mr bush s blood pressure was 110 84 and his pulse 45 beats a minute , which is normal for a wellconditioned athlete his cholesterol was 191 , high density lipoprotein \( hdl \) 51 , low density lipoprotein \( ldl \) 127 \( a ratio of 37 \) , and triglycerides 63 , all normal an xray known as an ultrafast cat scan detected no calcifications that would indicate damage to mr bush s coronary arteries , dr cooper said a similar cat scan and ultrasound of his abdomen were normal mr bush s psa test for prostate cancer was 07 last june , which is normal , and an ultrasound of his prostate , performed as a baseline test , was normal in 1999 , dr cooper said when mr bush s parents lived in the white house , both developed graves' disease , the most common form of thyroid overactivity it is an an autoimmune disorder that occasionally runs in families blood tests and an ultrasound have shown that mr bush does not have the condition and that his thyroid function is normal , he and dr cooper said as a child , mr bush said , he had an allergic reaction to a bee sting but has not had one in a while the secret service , he said , carries an emergency kit with epinephrine \( adrenalin \) as a precaution before selecting mr cheney as his running mate , mr bush said dick had talked to his doctor and then i got dr denton cooley to call dick s doctor to discuss the record and i talked to dick extensively about his health mr bush said that when dr cooley of houston told him that mr cheney was suited to be the vice president , i felt that was good enough for me dr cooley is a pioneer in heart surgery in a recent interview he said he did not examine mr cheney , did not receive any of his medical records , and relied on dr reiner s opinion over the telephone for his information dr reiner did n't tell me anything other than the fact that mr cheney had had a problem at one time and that he was ok now , dr cooley said dr cooley did not address mr cheney s prognosis over the next four years , which is a critical factor because the grafts used in bypass surgery tend to wear out over time that was n't the issue at all , said dr cooley , who added that all he did was pass along dr reiner s opinion dr cooley said dr reiner did not tell him what medications mr cheney was taking for his heart condition and gout , and did not provide a crucial number known as the ejection fraction , which is a main way that doctors monitor heart patients dr malakoff wrote that mr cheney takes a long list of medications to which he has shown no side effects that would impair his judgment or intellectual performance asked what provision he would have in place in the event mr cheney became ill or had to take over as president , mr bush said i do n't anticipate that happening medical experts interviewed said that because the letters from mr cheney s doctors omitted key information , they were inadequate to independently assess mr cheney s overall health for example , dr malakoff wrote that mr cheney had a skin cancer removed but he did not say when and whether the cancer was a common , generally harmless type known as basal cell or a potentially fatal type known as a melanoma dr reiner also wrote that mr cheney was essentially asymptomatic but did not say whether mr cheney has had abnormal heart rhythms or recent symptoms of heart disease such as chest pain , shortness of breath or lightheaded spells mr cheney has stopped smoking but people who have known mr cheney said he has gained substantial amounts of weight since he was secretary of defense in the bush administration through early 1993 the cheney campaign declined to disclose his weights in many ways , mr cheney s health record over the last 12 years has been a textbook story about the successes of the modern treatment of coronary artery heart disease mr cheney s statistical chances of survival for the next five years are 94 percent , slightly lower than for americans without heart disease , according to figures that a duke university cardiologist , dr eric peterson , calculated by comparing mr cheney s medical profile with those of other patients in a national registry of bypass operations kept at duke however , the duke data suggests there is about a 30 percent chance that mr cheney will need a second bypass operation or other procedure during the next five years the figures did not account for the types of bypass grafts the patients received most heart surgeons now use the internal mammary arteries , which course beneath the breastbone , because they tend to last much longer than vein grafts and reduce the risk for a second bypass operation dr benjamin l aaron , mr cheney s heart surgeon , said that he used internal mammary arteries for two of mr cheney s four grafts the other two grafts were veins dr douglas p zipes , presidentelect of the american college of cardiology and head of cardiology at indiana university school of medicine in indianapolis , said that the status of the grafts was needed to judge mr cheney s prognosis the three heart attacks left mr cheney with an unspecified amount of dysfunction of the heart s main pumping chamber , the left ventricle , dr reiner wrote he said the dysfunction was detected by a type of ultrasound test known as an echocardiogram and the affected regions of heart muscle correlated with the areas on the bottom of the heart that were damaged by the heart attacks photo dick cheney campaigning yesterday in port st lucie , fla \( eric hasert the tribune , via associated

as dov scheinerman prepared for the transatlantic journey he began last night , it became clear that he viewed the trip as one of the more mundane excursions of his young life there was packing to do and there were goodbyes to say , but not an iota of anything extraordinary , according to dov , 16 , and his friends binyamin tepfer and sholom schneider , who also were on a flight that left new york last night rain shoes , a sweater , socks and other essentials to go in dov s suitcase lay on the kitchen table as the young men talked friday at dov s house in flatbush , brooklyn if unexcited , they did seem resolute about going , and relaxed but when their plane lands today after the 17hour flight , they will be in the midst of a situation that is anything but placid they are yeshiva students on their way back to schools in and around jerusalem and despite the state department s warning against travel to israel , the west bank and gaza because of the heightened threat of terrorist attacks there , hundreds of students have already gone back many more will be leaving today they say they are on a mission , and go without any fear or a moment s hesitation it was a given that we 'd be returning after the holidays , dov said , having spent sukkot , the jewish feast of tabernacles , at home he and mr tepfer , 21 , and mr schneider , 20 , were unalarmed friday by the recent flurries of violence , including a recent incident involving a palestinian suicide bomber in gaza we checked into the situation and it is not grave danger , mr schneider said in smooth monotone , especially if we stay in our neighborhoods and learn to the students and their families , particularly in orthodox communities , sending your child back to israel is fundamental , it outweighs the potential explosiveness of the situation , rabbi moshe scheinerman , dov s father , explained we 're not crazies , but this is supreme this is our very existence i would not advise them to go into a war zone but since the state department only gave an advisory , we are more concerned about our children s spiritual needs the new semester for yeshiva students begins today the last one ended just as violence in the middle east began to escalate about three weeks ago that s when tourism began to wane , according to travel agents and a spokeswoman for el al israel airlines but through thick and thin , the students go , said judy tenenbaum , whose plane talk travel agency specializes in travel to israel i had a lot of synagogue groups and christian groups cancel , but the students , they do n't give up yeshiva students , who concentrate on talmudic studies , said they believed the nature of the learning experience would shield them from harm i believe that in yeshiva learning god will protect me , so there s nothing to worry about , said moshe friedman , 18 , from borough park , brooklyn , who is in his first year at yeshivas mir in jerusalem matthew frogel , 18 , added as a jew , i feel it s important to be there mr frogel said he was well aware of the story that went around the world in early october , when american yeshiva students unintentionally wound up in an arab neighborhood and were badly beaten by a palestinian mob i know that if i stay where i am supposed to be , there s nothing to worry about , he said my torah learning will help protect israel and that s what god wants mr frogel will be studying about an hour west of jerusalem in ashdod , where , he said , it s really not as horrible as you 'd think rabbi scheinerman said he had advised many parents in his congregation , kollel bnei yeshivos , in flatbush , not to let the current state of affairs in the middle east deter them from sending their children to yeshivas in israel some needed direction he said none canceled we feel very strongly that they should be returning to show solidarity with our brothers and sisters in israel , said rabbi avi shafran , spokesman of agudath israel of america , an umbrella organization that serves the orthodox community but still , among parents , everybody s talking , said gail weinreb , a yeshiva parent , asking , 'what are you going to do \? ' everyone i know is going back , though , and there are a lot of them mrs tenenbaum said she arranged travel for about 100 students sheryl stein , spokeswoman for el al , said that between last wednesday and today , at least 500 american yeshiva students would be leaving new york city some parents said they felt reassured because the yeshivas had taken extra measures to keep tabs on the students and update them about dangers as for mrs weinreb , she s given her son , meir , 18 , specific instructions what not to do , where not to go i do n't have fear , she said neither does he mr weinreb affirmed that my mind is on my schoolwork , he said photo dov scheinerman , left , sholom schneider and binyamin tepfer awaiting their departure from new york for their schools in israel the new semester for yeshiva students begins today \( ruby washington the new york times \)
washington , june 15 the agreement signed at the summit meeting in pyongyang on wednesday , just days shy of the 50th anniversary of the start of the korean war , was brimming with words that heralded the arrival of peace yet the two countries are still technically at war , and no one wants to raise the question of who would govern a unified nation japan s prime minister likened the breakthrough to the fall of the berlin wall , yet the dmz remains firmly in place , an ugly barbedwire scar across the korean peninsula there is no popular uprising against the communist government in the north , and no serious discussion of removing the troops and weaponry that line both sides of the border nonetheless , american officials trying today to puzzle their way through north korea s apparent , or at least public , change of attitude said they saw the first real glimmer of hope that one of the last remnants of the cold war could gradually erode , and that north korea might soon be regarded less as a rogue state and more like just another failed state exactly what s going on is hard to read , said nicholas eberstadt , a longtime korea scholar at the american enterprise institute here kim jong il proved that he really is a moviemaker , and he made himself the star , mr eberstadt said , referring to the north korean leader s obsession with the cinema , which once led him to kidnap a south korean director and a famous actress to build him a film industry but no one in washington pretends to understand the rest of the script in mr kim s latest production in meetings at the white house and the state department today , some wondered aloud whether the sudden emergence of the reclusive north korean leader was a onetime anomaly or a radical change of strategy is he prepared to pull his troops back from the demilitarized zone and dismantle the tens of thousands of mortar and missiles that could destroy seoul in an hour \? and , if so , should the united states be ready to talk about pulling its 37 , 000 troops out of the korean peninsula , as the north has demanded for years \? could a country whose major export consists of missiles and arms shipped to the middle east break off that arms trade , or satisfy the united states that it should be removed from the state department s list of terrorist nations \? if its actions match its good words , the desperately poor country will suddenly be eligible for a range of international goodies , including aid from the world bank and the imf but the aid would inevitably come attached to communications technology , an influx of foreigners and outside ideas all anathema in a country where radios can only be tuned to the official government stations this clearly has to be taken as a change in north korean tactics in how to engage the world , said robert gallucci , who negotiated the 1994 deal with north korea to freeze its nuclear program and is now the dean of georgetown university s school of foreign service whether it is a strategic change , or whether this is truly a new north korean approach to the world , it is simply too early to know there is a lot of history here war , terrorism , nuclear ambitions , incidents at sea that suggests the need for a lot of caution none of those issues were discussed at length at the summit meeting but south korean officials who telephoned washington today said kim dae jung had raised the questions of north korea s nuclear program and missile exports in his talk with his north korean counterpart but he did so chiefly to alert kim jong il that these issues remain stumbling blocks , american and south korean officials said , and he made no effort to address them in a meeting that was mostly about setting a tone of cooperation the full briefing for american officials will come tomorrow and this weekend , when south korea s national security adviser arrives here so the clinton administration today was clearly trying to balance caution with encouragement for kim jong il , a man until recently regarded as an asian saddam hussein there is a good deal of euphoria in the south , said one senior administration official who has been deeply involved in negotiations with the north for years but is there a change in the millionman army \? in the missile program \? in the north s nuclear ambitions \? the only conclusion the administration could safely reach , he said this afternoon , was not yet the depth of the new opening by the north will be plumbed repeatedly in the next few months by south korea , japan and the united states the united states has missile talks with the north that begin in a few weeks japan is negotiating a possible resumption of diplomatic relations if it can resolve the issue of japanese women believed kidnapped by the north , and the country s continued harboring of members of the japanese red army terrorist group south korea , once the euphoria dies down , will learn whether the exchanges of families , the communications links and the cultural exchanges all promised before turn into reality but there is no question that with this week s summit meeting , the clinton administration finds itself at a very different place from six years ago this week then , the united states was about to support sanctions against north korea for its refusal to allow inspectors to visit the site of its suspected nuclear weapons program mr clinton was warned by his top military advisers that the north could make good on its threat that it would respond to the sanctions by invading the south mr clinton was about to order more troops to the region , to back up the b2 bombers he had recently dispatched to within easy reach of the dmz now , a policy of rapproachment that the administration entered reluctantly at the urging of south korea s president , kim dae jung , when he came to office two years ago has radically changed the atmosphere the mystery is whether it has also changed the nature of the north korean threat
urbanfetch , the online delivery service that was started in new york less than a year ago to compete with kozmocom , announced that it was shutting down its web site and would lay off more than 160 employees urbanfetch officials said they would continue operating its business courier company cities were initially considered ideal for companies like urbanfetch and kozmo , which offer free delivery of goods ordered online within an hour but many online delivery companies have struggled in places like manhattan because of traffic congestion , logistical problems , tough competition from bricksandmortar businesses and low consumer demand for large quantities and highmargin items urbanfetch is one of several desktoptodoorstep service companies that have felt the effects of a drought in the market for initial public offerings and an unwillingness by investors to pour cash into unproven internet businesses since the nasdaq dropped sharply in april urbanfetch would not say how many employees it had , but company officials said they expected to lay off more than 100 workers in new york and about 60 in london the web site will operate for a few weeks until the inventory in urbanfetch s warehouses is sold , the officials said the demise of urbanfetch s online service , which delivered everything from movie videotapes to dvd players in much of manhattan and brooklyn , raises further questions about that sector of the internet industry , analysts said ross stevens , the chief executive of urbanfetch , said we were unable to raise sufficient capital to continue with our businesstoconsumer operation i think that is a reflection of the current market situation right now the financing markets have effectively shut down for companies like ours kozmo had been in talks to buy urbanfetch , but negotiations broke down on tuesday mr stevens said the two sides could not agree on a strategy for delivering goods to consumers but kozmo officials said they pulled out of the talks because of concerns that urbanfetch s finances were in worse shape than the company had indicated yesterday , urbanfetch said it was abandoning its consumer business entirely and focusing instead on its courier service for businesses , which was started six months ago urbanfetch officials had considered expanding deliveries to include wines and other goods , as well as offering its service farther into brooklyn and upper manhattan but that was several months ago , in a different market for technology stocks yesterday , the talk at urbanfetch headquarters at 538 broadway , in the heart of silicon alley , was more sober we are becoming just like any other courier service , one official said urbanfetch officials said its business service , called urbanfetch express , would place contract couriers in corporate offices many urbanfetch employees held out hope yesterday that they would be transferred to the courier operation , but one company executive said that few of them would be retained unlike urbanfetch , which operates in london , manhattan and brooklyn , urbanfetch express exists only in manhattan it has contracts with conde nast , ernst young , pricewaterhousecoopers and several other large corporations mr stevens said that urbanfetch express was already profitable and larger than its consumer operations the company plans to sell its assets , including the leases on its corporate offices and its warehouse at 560 west 34th street , officials said urbanfetch plans to retain the software and some of the technology behind the web site although none of the courier business is conducted over the internet mr stevens , a former hedge fund manager at integrity capital management , started urbanfetch last year soon after joseph park , a founder of kozmo , sought money from him kozmo sued urbanfetch , charging that it copied its business model , and the two sides eventually reached a settlement employees said yesterday that they had suspected for a long time that something either a merger or an acquisition was coming jean lee , who has been the art director at urbanfetch since the company opened , said that she was sad yesterday morning as she walked across the brooklyn bridge on her way to work and saw two urbanfetch couriers the last six months , since the big scare in april , things were starting to come together , and in my own department , they were clicking very well , ms lee said yesterday , officials at kozmo , which operates in 11 cities , said that they expected to soon be profitable in markets they had been in longer , like new york , where it opened in 1998 kozmo , which has raised more than 280 million from investors , is generally considered better financed than urbanfetch , analysts said both companies are based in new york the closure of urbanfetch makes kozmo the only game in town , and analysts said that it was likely to have some impact on investor confidence in the online delivery industry the industry has been criticized for ignoring many of the obstacles for such services in manhattan but yesterday , some were optimistic you have to have a profitminded business model in these times , said ned vickers , the president of nedexpress , a new online service scheduled to operate in tribeca , wall street and battery park city we have the benefit of learning from the mistakes of the old goldrush companies
pedestrians walking through times square often pause to glance up at the array of neon and electronic billboards in their midst , many of which combine the names and logos of wellknown companies with conspicuous and innovative visual images among the colorful and constantly changing displays are the giant panasonic tv screen , an abc news screen and the new nasdaq stockquote board , covering eight floors of the facade of 4 times square in this company , the two simple neon billboards at the top of a corner building on broadway seem unassuming , even archaic the 50foottall signs , one overlooking broadway and the other 45th street , feature a white background and , in red , the letter l inside a larger letter g along the bottom of the billboards are the words chemicals , electronics and communications although the ads may seem enigmatic to some viewers , an employee of lg , a 70 billion korean conglomerate of some 30 companies , said that the austere appearance of the billboards was intentional many of the billboards in times square are flashy , said the employee , dongwon lee , an account director for lg ad , lg s advertising division , but we would like to differentiate ourselves from other companies the company was renamed lg five years ago , and soon afterward the current billboards replaced yellowandwhite signs that had been at that location for a decade and had spelled out the company s old name , lucky goldstar none of a dozen people questioned in times square one day last week knew what the lg billboards meant , but many found them intriguing duncan cameron , a documentary filmmaker who lives on gold street in lower manhattan , said he had often wondered about the billboards i always thought it was a german company , probably a subsidiary of a subsidiary that s been merged a hundred times , he said his friend gordon gray said he thought that the letters l and g were currency oriented , whatever that means mr gray s wife , christine , jokingly suggested that they stood for large when informed of the meaning of the billboards , the three seemed surprised there s got to be someone around here who knows that , mr cameron said he began conducting an impromptu poll , stopping passersby and quizzing them about the images after several wrong answers , he gave up i guess no one here knows what those billboards mean , he said colin moynihan photo i always thought it was a german company , duncan cameron said of lg \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
entrepreneurial challenge is not a new concept to w park kerr after all , he and his mother had started the el paso chile company by selling chile ristras , or garlands of redhot chiles , on a roadside in el paso , their hometown now , 20 years later , the closeknit family business which includes his mother , norma sister , monica and brotherinlaw , sean makes a line of salsas , hot sauces , dips and chips that brings in more than 10 million a year though business was great , mr kerr hit a selfproclaimed midlife crisis a few years ago and was itching for a new crossborder thrill in our company , any family member with a really good idea can pitch it , he said so , i said 'i want to make tequila are you guys in \? ' they gave me 30 , 000 and a credit card to explore the venture with their blessing \( so far , he has spent about a halfmillion dollars \) his decision to enter an already crowded market and take on another country s national obsession raised eyebrows in the spirits industry and those who know the mexican tequila world had their doubts that mr kerr could accomplish his goal of making a customdistilled premium product after all , the nonmexican companies in the business were just distributors , buying readymade tequila and slapping private labels on it , like don eduardo , from brownforman , or porfidio from martin gassl bob emmons , an industry consultant who wrote the book of tequila , said the mexicans jealously guard their tequila it s highly unlikely that any outsider could pull this off robert denton , who imports two premium tequilas , el tesoro and chinaco , was also skeptical no one rents out their distilleries for an american to come and make their tequila , believe me , he said but the charismatic mr kerr was indeed able to convince a distiller to make a tequila the way he wanted it after almost three years in development , the el paso chile company s new offering , tequila nacional silver , has hit the united states market 6 , 000 bottles strong the tequila , already available in texas , will reach stores in new jersey this week , with new york and several other states to follow in the next few months it was not easy , mr kerr said recently over a perfectly chilled margarita \( with salt \) but perseverance and connections helped learning all he could about the tequila process went smoothly enough he hired a mexican bottle manufacturer that , in turn , introduced mr kerr to its distillery clients such links were crucial these people are very traditional , mr kerr said it s probably only because of the personal nature of my introduction , and that i speak spanish , that i eventually won their trust he learned about growing , harvesting and distilling the spiky agave plant s fruit , the pina , which looks something like a pineapple on steroids and can weigh 100 pounds by last winter , mr park was ready to contract with a distillery , though he had a laundry list of criteria it had to be midsized small enough so an extra 500 , 000 in annual income would make a difference , yet large enough to handle the planned volume it could not have competing brands in the united states it should be in los altos , in the state of jalisco , where , mr kerr said , the earth is red and the agave grow sweet that was not all the tequila would have none of the ammonia nitrate , flavoring or urea often used in commercial tequila the pinas were to be roasted before fermentation in the traditional adobe ovens called hornos , and the distiller had to agree to roast the fruit slowly and to let it cool for a full 24 hours before distillation , to improve taste mr kerr wanted to supply his own yeast and yeast food he insisted on potstills made of stainless steel instead of copper , for a purer flavor to ensure purity , all production had to be above ground , in an immaculately clean plant free of chemical contamination did i tell you my favorite story \? he asked i visited one distiller who was very proud of how clean his plant was , because every day he scrubbed the machinery and floors down with pinesol what do you think his tequila tasted like \? distillers he visited told him to be a good boy , buy readymade tequila and put his own label on it who would know the difference \? and once the distillers understood that mr kerr , an american businessman , was seeking control over how his tequila was made , none would play they did not return his phone calls as despair was setting in , mr kerr met thomas fernandez , the owner of cocacola bottlers in five mexican regions , at a cocktail party i play in two worlds america and mexico , he said he told mr fernandez in frustration i live on the border i speak spanish i love everything about this culture and its food yet no one understands me mr fernandez thought that one of his sons might be able to help when mr kerr got together with miguel fernandez , a man of american and mexican parentage who attended schools on both sides of the border , he knew he had found an ideal ally
albany , feb 25 by this afternoon , what had once seemed unlikely that a jury would find four officers blameless in the killing of amadou diallo seemed almost inevitable soon after hearing lengthy legal instructions and beginning deliberations on wednesday , the seven white men , one white woman and four black women seemed to begin what one defense lawyer called an inexorable march toward acquittal while the jury took two and a half days to reach a verdict , the actual time spent deliberating was just over 21 hours , and at least a third of that was spent hearing rereadings of testimony and the different charges when the 24 not guiltys on six charges for each officer were finally read , there was tension in the courtroom , but little suspense the atmosphere had started to shift on wednesday , when the judge instructed the jury on the charges the officers faced and the three legal reasons that could justify the shooting a fourhour instruction that clearly came down on the defense s side today , the judge , justice joseph w teresi , further refined his instruction in the defense s favor , noting that a police officer should not be considered the aggressor in a situation just because he gives chase or pulls his gun our system of justice is designed to protect defendants , the bronx district attorney , robert t johnson , said of the judge s instructions from the start , the prosecution had the heavy burden of disproving the justification the officers put forth in the shooting in a typical murder trial , prosecutors have to prove that the defendant killed the victim in this trial , they had to prove that it was unreasonable for the officers to claim that they shot mr diallo because they believed he had a gun they tried to show that the vestibule where mr diallo died was well lighted , which should have allowed the officers to not mistake his wallet for a gun , and that the officers should have realized their mistake and stopped firing ultimately , their approach apparently failed to register with the jury of all the testimony reheard by the jury , none of it was from the prosecution nothing from civilians from mr diallo s street , nothing from the prosecution s key witness , the medical examiner who did the autopsy on mr diallo raymond kelly , an albany lawyer who was on the defense team , said it was the first time in 50 murder trials that he had seen a jury not ask for a rereading of a single prosecution witness s testimony instead , the jury quickly focused on what the defense had long said would determine the verdict the dramatic testimony by the officers on what they said happened that night when the officers took the stand , their lawyers were able to humanize the men , especially sean carroll , one of the two officers who fired 16 shots each , who broke down in tears and when officer carroll and officer edward mcmellon not only withstood badgering crossexaminations , but appeared consistently remorseful , the prosecution seemed to back off and deflate , only lightly questioning the next two officers the jury not only focused on the officers' story , but a very specific part of it despite a passionate prosecution summation that argued that mr diallo was doomed from the moment the officers spotted him , the jurors' first request for a rereading of the officers' testimony asked that it begin from the moment the officers stepped out of their car that suggested that the jury was not even considering the officers' decision to stop mr diallo a subsequent request , for testimony from officers carroll and mcmellon ending with the beginning of gunfire , was equally revealing it suggested that jurors were focusing on the first shot fired and the officers' belief that mr diallo had a gun and not the duration of firing or the number of bullets all of a sudden , noted one of officer carroll s lawyers , john d patten , the 41 shots dropped out of the case stephen c worth , mr mcmellon s lawyer , who had said in his summation that verdicts do not send messages , seemed to suggest after the verdict that the acquittals did just that maybe the jury realizes the danger of having criminal juries sit as firearms review boards and engage in secondguessings in shootings , he said police officers legitimately have to be aggressive in the twinkle of an eye we pay them to do that as a society we ca n't afford to put a hitch in their step maybe the jury knew that as significant as the officers' speaking about what happened was mr diallo s inability to do so without his version , the defense made his actions his refusal to listen to the officers , his darting into the vestibule , even what crimes the officers thought he was committing almost as much of an issue as what the officers did again and again during his legal instructions to the jury , justice teresi told them that part of the test of whether the officers acted reasonably was based on mr diallo s actions the jurors' deliberations seemed methodical starting wednesday evening , they began periodically asking to rehear a charge , starting with the most serious , murder it suggested they were dispensing with charge after charge , and thursday night , they asked for the elements of justification the officers could claim at 3 10 pm today , the jury asked for the reading of the last charge , reckless endangerment an hour later , there was a verdict
opinion now seems to be divided on whether this is the 400th anniversary of the birth of claude lorrain \( as one would suppose from the inscription on his gravestone in rome \) but the chance to see nearly 40 of his drawings and eight of his etchings at the pierpont morgan library is always timely it was pierpont morgan himself who set the tone for claude drawings in 1910 , when he bought the large group that , in part , has prompted the library s present show , claude and the ideal landscape among much else he bought the landscape with aeneas landing at carthage , which relates to the grand passion for virgil that powered many of claude s finest paintings in his later years \( he died in 1682 \) morgan also bought a drawing for claude s sermon on the mount , a painting acquired by the frick collection in 1960 the show owes much to loans from two holdings the thaw collection of the morgan library and the estate of peter jay sharp a good case can be made for the variety and the versatility of claude s ambitions there are preliminary drawings for paintings , like the aeneas hunting now in the musee des beauxarts in brussels , and the david with three heroes , now in the national gallery in london there are souvenirs of the excursions that claude , a french expatriate artist who spent most of his life in rome , made to the italian countryside , often with painter friends it was one of his colleagues on these country walks , a german named joachim von sandrart , who left us the most convincing account of how claude actually went to work ordering the given landscape with total clarity and bringing everything together in correct harmony by accentuating the front strongly and shading off the back in proportion this we can see for ourselves at the morgan library the show offers some telling examples of claude s interest in animals there was , in fact , a socalled animal album by claude , which was kept in a roman family for generations until it was sold at auction in 1957 in particular , he was fascinated by cows and is said to have made some 50 drawings of them that the relationship between the herdsman and his beasts was one that claude studied with great tenderness is clear here from the monumental drawing of two men tending an ox , which comes from the thaw collection claude did more for the cow and the ox with pen and ink than he normally did for human beings there is a sparkling little drawing of the temple of vesta at tivoli , which was a favorite destination for painters who wanted a day out in what was then unspoiled country claude delighted in the temple and often used it to stand in for antiquity and there are drawings of unaccompanied travelers to remind us that making one s way on foot among rocky hillsides in the late afternoon could be a very lonely business it was often held against claude that he had no gift for portraying the human figure in the big paintings of his maturity this mattered less , because the human figure was incidental what mattered were the sky , the sea , the splendid trees , sometimes the ships , and the carefully fabricated architecture the people were tiny stock figures who came with gestures to match if they gave any trouble , perspective could fix it in his drawings claude carries us away by his skill with trees , with water , with the movement of the light and with his mastery of complicated textures his david and the three heroes here is a capital example it is done with brush and brown wash over black and red chalk , heightened with white body color , on paper tinted with brown wash , as the text panel explains claude did his very best , and the four figures have the makings of a heroic group but it does n't quite come off as a momentous occasion claude lived in rome for many years , but he does not seem to have been a bigcity man at heart if his subject called for a city , he made one up from bits and pieces of antiquity this show does , however , have a view of santa maria del popolo the view has the charm of some cows in the foreground as he lived in the via margutta , the church was an easy walk away , just beyond the city walls , and the view was not cluttered with men and women the eight etchings in the show are on loan from the metropolitan museum of art , which has been acquiring claude s etchings since 1917 and now owns 30 one of the most curious items is the print called time , apollo and the seasons this is said to be related to poussin s dance to the music of time in the wallace collection in london as the poussin is one of the most beautiful pictures ever painted , this is great company but claude s image , though undeniably curious , does not in any respect keep company with poussin s claude s is undeniably rather droll apollo leads four none too stable women across some tricky ground toward a rather daunting figure of time given the multiple overtones of the poussin , and his incomparable handling of the subject , there really can be no comparison but in his drawings claude did not aim to tell a story or to deal in depth with human nature he just had to sit down and watch nature at her work his eye and his hand did the rest for proof we have only to see the little tiber landscape here the river , its banks and the big blue sky all are touched in to perfection it is done with almost nothing , and it has no particular incident yet the tiber is all there , with nothing unsaid this is the claude who would one day send john keats into ecstasy \( so people said \) with his great painting the

merrick by anne rice 307 pages alfred a knopf 2695 we must speak of the elegant undead and of the woman , the one , she who has told the tales of what the beautiful vampires see and wear and do sixteen times the woman has brought forth these stories , and now it is 17 on account of merrick , the latest to be penned , to use the word that is her own her powers have served her mightily , so mightily that the stories now grow weary , but still she tells them , still she continues , on and on how well she knows that some things never die now she tells of beautiful merrick , the young one who is tied to the white mayfair witches in ways that must be made plain by the 16 other stories , though not by this one , since much of it is not plain to the stranger and since that family is not now our concern it is the voodooiennes of merrick s other family who are more present , the ones who gave her exquisite cafe au lait coloring and strange apparitions and the kind of memories that may be summoned with the help of a bubbling caldron and a boa constrictor and a wealth of votive candles at the altar merrick is of that world and she is also of another , a world in which she collects rollsroyces and drinks much costly rum and lives in the finest hotel suite in new orleans and is so often said to love the particularly wonderful scent of chanel no 22 perfume that perhaps the one , the woman , the teller of vampire stories , loves it too the paranormal is not necessarily beyond earthly privilege it is david talbot , he who died as an old man in miami and now inhabits a fine new 6foot4inch angloindian body , having moved on in the manner of the hermit crab , as a consequence of an illfated experiment with astral projection , who speaks in merrick of the events that unfold and it is he who shares living quarters with the vampire lestat , who sleeps in a trance in the manner of an ideal roommate , and with louis de pointe du lac , who was once made to resemble the earthly creature named brad pitt on the movie screen , and who is still said here to be a vision of male perfection because david talbot is a member of the talamasca , the secret society that oversees undead affairs , and that has also taken charge of beautifully decorating merrick s girlhood bedroom , david does not see the potential in the household of three undead bachelors for television situation comedy there is much to be remembered and retold about bygone stories before the slender tale of merrick can begin and she , the one who writes , will not be hurried in her task she invites david to say , i had done her evil , i knew it , and it was exciting , and i needed her , and i was selfish , and i missed her , and it was as plain as that when it is not plain at all , and it is certainly not swift in speaking of the everyday use of nonoccult powers in the home , david explains entering the flat , i turned on all the electric lights in every room , a detail which was our custom by this time , and one upon which i depended heavily for some sense of normality , no matter that it was a mere illusion , but then , perhaps normality is always an illusion who am i to say \? when at last the lights do go on in merrick , and the story rises from its bed of flashbacks to lumber forward , there are spells to be cast this is because louis would like david to ask merrick to summon claudia , the young girl who was loved by louis and who died and who it seems has spent her time in limbo studying the exorcist in case she should return home there is another spell that brings forth spirits of merrick s lost relatives through the use of a voodoo mask , one that is obtained through a trip to a strange and exotic place in the guatemalan jungle where the hidden jade artifacts are like those found in museums only better finally comes the vampirical exchange of vital bodily fluids , though these matters are by now ancient and halfhearted , even if the words of the teller continue to bring about some confusion about the real nature of these activities harder , more of it , take it , take all that i have to give , says an undead blood donor , reminding us of the wicked early books that came from her , the woman , exit to eden and the several others she gave to the world under names that were not her own among the bewitched are editors , those meant to know the ancient laws of reason and the dark secrets of grammatical construction none questioned what mysteries we are , human , vampire , mortal , that we can love and hate simultaneously , and that emotions of all sorts might not parade for what they are not none would challenge he was very startled when i laid down this part of the story , but would n't have me pause just yet but encouraged me to go on none wondered what was amiss as the sky grew ever more lighter but those are the labors of mortals what mortals would dare \? photo anne rice \( grevy photography alfred a knopf \)

in the fall of 1994 , when america online , with just about a million subscribers , lagged behind its competitors and when the smart money was betting that the free world wide web would quickly eclipse the paid online services time warner unveiled a site that aspired to be the emerging web s prime destination gerald m levin , time warner s chairman and chief executive , proclaimed that the web site , called pathfinder , would turn the company s magazines into an indispensable daily electronic information guide that , of course , was one of the things that america online was trying to be , and its chairman and chief executive , stephen m case , did not fail to take notice in 1995 , as mr case s company suddenly surged past its online rivals prodigy and compuserve , he even discussed a joint venture with pathfinder executives we thought pathfinder was a good idea , mr case recalled in an interview last week thankfully , it was poorly executed i thought they had a great opportunity , but for them at the time the internet was a curious peripheral for us , it was the beall , endall the story of why pathfinder ultimately failed along with the story of mr case s singlemindedness goes a long way toward explaining how it happened last week that the media world turned upside down the agreement by america online , known for divebombing the nation with free diskettes of its software , to acquire time warner , whose cartoon characters and magazines are some of the most recognizable icons of popular culture , has been seen as a startling triumph of the new media over the old at 165 billion , it would be the biggest merger ever but on some grounds , the deal should n't have been all that startling a close look at time warner s history of earnest efforts to harness the digital media business shows a predictable set of obstacles , underscoring why virtually no traditional media brands are central players in today s frothy internet industry despite a longstanding commitment by mr levin to digital technology , time warner was stymied by corporate politics , distracted by other , more profitable ventures and unrealistic about how quickly it could master the technology to suit its needs moreover , it was focused on promoting its editorial and entertainment products , while america online pursued mr case s belief that connecting people was the internet s most addictive application time warner s mixed experience in the digital realm also explains how the company came to appreciate its own weaknesses and see the benefits of the merger asked last week why time warner , with all its resources and reach , did not simply start its own online service , ted turner , the company s vice chairman , said simply it s not that easy to build an aol even so , it may be simplistic to label the deal a triumph for america online mr case s eagerness to make an acquisition at a huge premium that will surely slow the momentum of his company s stock is an indication that he expects the formula of america online s success to change radically in the coming years as the internet becomes available over television , telephone and particularly over highspeed networks , mr case believes that content , even more than communitybuilding , will grow in importance that is where his company has stumbled in the past and at 2195 a month , its main service faces new competition from several fastgrowing free internet services mr case sees the need to diversify we went from one million to 20 million subscribers in the last five years that s great , but a billion people watch cnn , mr case said we 've gone from members spending an average of one hour a week to one hour a day on the service but there are 23 other hours in a day this is the reality of how consumers live their lives , and if we really want to have an impact , we have to paint on the broadest possible canvas the most obvious benefit of the deal to america online is that , in buying time warner , it is acquiring the nation s secondlargest cable provider without guaranteed access to the cable modems that will increasingly enable subscribers to surf the internet at 50 times today s average speed , america online could have been shut out of a big chunk of what looks to be the lucrative future of broadband service but whether the two companies will be able to find other kinds of synergies ways of serving up time warner s rich media brew to america online s loyal users may ultimately depend on how much they have learned from their past successes and failures in many ways , steve case and gerald levin were both ahead of their time in 1981 , mr case , just out of college , took a job at procter gamble in large part because it was in cincinnati , one of two places in the country where interactive television was being tested but the neighborhood in which he chose to live did not have access to the service , called qube which happened to be provided by a company , warner amex cable , that was a venture of a predecessor to time warner
espn had a plan find an agent who would let its cameras record contract negotiations from the inside for the sunday morning program outside the lines espn found him in jeff moorad , the agent for manny ramirez , following him from october until he agreed with the boston red sox last week on an eightyear , 160 million contract moorad was really into it , said vince doria , espn s vice president for news , who added that the agent was granted no control on one hand , i was surprised he agreed to do it , but on the other , it s no surprise to learn that agents have big egos scott boras , who negotiated a 10year , 252 million contract for alex rodriguez , had also agreed to let espn into his round robin of talks i think scott might have wanted to show less of the process and talk more about it , doria said although espn knew that such a show could glorify moorad , doria said he risked making outrageous statements that would make him fall on his sword at the top of the show , he said he was going to ask for 200 million over 10 years and make him the highestpaid player in the game he got the 20 million , but he did n't make him the highestpaid player the program , which was shown sunday , was a fascinating video document , showing moorad meeting with ramirez and with executives from boston , cleveland and seattle none were told they were being taped until they arrived at the meetings sometimes , people need to have an idea of what s going on , said pat gillick , seattle s general manager in one phone call , brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , said , we 're going to put our best foot forward on a few guys , and wanted to move quickly with the free agents who desired the yankees most moorad , sensing inadequate devotion to his client , said , well , that does n't sound like a real compelling reaching out to manny ramirez later , in a meeting with the mariners , chuck armstrong , the team s president , said he would consider moving the fences in at safeco park to accommodate ramirez the program was not a fullaccess account espn was not with moorad constantly , and team officials could tell the espn crew to leave if their talks turned sensitive still , espn was luckily present when lee thomas , the red sox' assistant general manager , called to ask if the red sox could still get into the ramirez bidding despite the discomfort of dan duquette , boston s general manager , he did n't shoo espn out in the final moments when he agreed to the deal behindthescenes access is the raison d'etre of running down a dream , an 88minute documentary about nicole kaczmarski , the long island college basketball star from sachem high school , which recently ran on cablevision systems and is available on home video kaczmarski s father , pete , was the film s gatekeeper , providing entree to leandra reilly lardner , the producerdirectorwriter lardner s cameras followed kaczmarski from ninthgrade stardom through the college recruitment process until she committed to attend ucla nothing was off limits , but in doing a film about a minor , i used my judgment about what advanced the story , lardner said a lengthy sequence depicting a backyard squabble between father and daughter over her reluctance to discuss the recruitment process with him is the emotional core of the film she was a bit squeamish , but she allowed it to be in , lardner said although the final effort is an objective , wellintentioned look at the furious recruitment of a major talent , the access came with considerable accommodation to pete kaczmarski , offering the illusion of his control he is listed above the title of the film , as if he were a producer , and is credited as a story consultant lardner said he was not paid which would violate ncaa rules but the titles were something we owed him primarily for helping alert her to when kaczmarski would be traveling he steered the project ncaa rules also barred the taping of coaches' recruiting visits to kaczmarski , which would have greatly enlivened the film in the end , the documentary offers prescience the coach who best articulated the recruitment dance was andy landers of georgia , whose campus kaczmarksi did not visit before she chose ucla but kaczmarski , who has so far sat out her sophomore season because of a foot injury and unspecified personal reasons , last week verbally agreed to transfer to georgia newest silly network trick the jets had just lost 107 to detroit sunday when cbs sent viewers back to the nfl today studio jim nantz , looking at an offscreen monitor , reported that adam vinatieri was preparing to kick a gamewinning field goal for new england against buffalo with a second left yet viewers were not permitted to see what nantz saw live we 'll give you the result when we get back , he said thanks so much after a commercial break , cbs showed vinatieri s botched kick why \?

almost nine years ago , carlos daniel grullon confronted his estranged wife in the basement of the tarrytown hilton inn , where she worked as a chambermaid believing she had dishonored him by her independent behavior , he shot her twice , the police said his wife , yolina arcenia camacho , died at the scene , and mr grullon became a fugitive , fleeing to the protection of his homeland , the dominican republic despite repeated requests for his extradition , mr grullon remains there , protected , in part , by a weak judicial system and cultural biases , which tolerate socalled honor killings , a form of culturally sanctioned murder by husbands who believe their wives have disrespected them , united states and united nations officials said detective sgt gene buonanno of the tarrytown police department learned of those cultural biases early in the investigation in his initial discussions with the dominican authorities , detective buonanno said he was told that in some cases , murdering one s wife might be justifiable we said 'justifiable \? what cases would that be \? ' he recalled the official replied that in the dominican republic , if a wife discredits the husband , killing her would be allowed it s hard to accept that the man committed murder here and can leave to a protective country , detective buonanno said he s like a hero over there since he fled , the authorities said , mr grullon has threatened to kill his two children , dahiana , now 14 , and richard , now 10 , who live with their maternal grandmother in sleepy hollow , and has harassed his wife s family in the dominican republic the united states ambassador to the dominican republic , charles t manatt , has spoken out about the issue , calling for his immediate arrest , an embassy spokeswoman , sophie folly , said until recently , however , none of this has moved the dominican officials to extradite mr grullon but in early february the house international relations committee , headed by representative benjamin a gilman , a republican from tarrytown , cut off 61 million in aid to the dominican republic until mr grullon is extradited much of that aid was earmarked for judicial reform since then , activity surrounding the case has picked up in late february , mr grullon was tried in absentia by a dominican court and found guilty of murdering his wife and of bail violations , and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison mr grullon , however , remains at large the dominican ambassador to the united states , roberto b saladin selin , said , all the judicial power of the dominican republic and the national police are doing all the necessary efforts to capture mr grullon and put him in jail but his conviction in the dominican republic has complicated the chances of extradition to the united states , mr selin said regional judicial and law enforcement authorities in the dominican republic are independent of the national goverment , he explained and while mr selin insists that the dominican republic , will not be a refuge for these criminals , the regional court of moca , where mr grullon was tried , will be given the chance to excercise its authority first regional judicial power and law enforcement are independent authorities , and it s up to them to put him in jail , mr selin said ms camacho was 22 when she arrived in this country with her two children in 1990 from the outset , her sister , ana garafolo , said , she tried to give them a better life she worked two jobs and attended night school to improve her english six months later , ms camacho returned to the dominican republic to marry mr grullon , her high school sweetheart and the father of her children on march 22 , 1991 , mr grullon arrived in new york and moved in with ms camacho , who was living with her parents , amado and juana camacho , in sleepy hollow ms camacho arranged a job for him , but a family member said mr grullon , a truck driver , did not like the work schedule he lost his job , and relations between the couple started to deteriorate , ms camacho s sisters said when ms camacho asked mr grullon to leave , they said , he refused and threatened to kill the whole family despite incidents of domestic violence , ms camacho would not seek help from the police because of the respect she had for mr grullon s mother and father she did n't want to embarrass them , mrs garafolo said and she kept thinking he would change she always trusted him until the end ruchira gupta , a consultant to the united nations on violence against women , believes that ms camacho was the victim of an honor killing such killings are typically found only in developing countries but more and more women from these societies are migrating to developed nations as they gain independence from their husbands , they challenge the traditional attitudes and roles played by the men in their families , ms gupta said as a result , honor killings are spreading whether mr grullon believed his wife had disgraced him or felt an overwhelming frustration trying to adapt to life in the united states , ms gupta said , he felt his honor was at stake and , in these societies , she said , a man has the right to have the life of his woman to jeanine pirro , the westchester district attorney , the term honor killing is irrelevant you can term a killing anything you want , she said what matters is the law of the country where the murder occurs she said she was prepared to prosecute mr grullon as soon as he is extradited because a dead mother is the issue here she added , no honor code should be used as an excuse to get away with murder the stress of the last nine years is obvious on the faces of ms camacho s mother and sisters as they sit in the cramped nursery of mrs garafolo s home tears stream down their faces when they recount the steps the tarrytown police have taken to bring mr grullon to justice juana camacho , the victim s mother , is now raising ms camacho s children immediately after their mother s murder , they were put in foster homes and hidden for two years because of the death threats mr grullon made they could only visit their mother s family for 30 minutes every week in a protected , neutral location richard , 10 , is coping from day to day in front of his classmates , he calls mrs garafolo his mamy they say dahiana , 14 , is at the age where she needs her mother wiping tears from her eyes , ms camacho s sister fiordaliza says the worst times are family gatherings when an unbearable sadness hangs in the air when we are all together , she said , something is missing the camacho family has heard that mr grullon has repeatedly changed his appearance over the last nine years , but they say they would know him anywhere i want to see him in court , fiordaliza camacho said i want to see those eyes over here photos yolina arcenia camacho , above her children , richard camacho , 10 , and dahiana , 14 , at their sleepy hollow home their father , carlos daniel grullon \( photographs by richard l harbus for the new york times \)
garden city , ny , may 18 as nervous investors from major wall street firms held a conference call on nassau county s shaky finances , county officials began a new round of bickering today over the numbers in their plans to cut spending the quarrel erupted after county comptroller frederick e parola , a republican , criticized a list of costcutting measures proposed by the democrats who control the county legislature the democrats said the items would save the county 50 million mr parola said their plan fell some 30 million short of its goal the democrats , clearly angry , sent the county comptroller a new calculator then , after some consultation with the democrats , mr parola agreed that their list would actually save 47 million but warned that 27 million of the savings would be in oneshot deals that would not recur the dependence on nonrecurring revenues is one of the things that got the wealthy county into fiscal trouble in the first place the democrats countered that this year , under the terms of a fiscal recovery plan proposed by gov george e pataki , the county is allowed to use nonrecurring revenues to help it achieve 50 million in savings if the county does not find the 50 million in savings by june 30 , the plan calls for the state to take control of nassau s finances as the arguments played out , anxious investors held a conference call with analysts from standard poor s , the creditrating agency , to discuss the outlook for nassau county the agency has warned nassau that it will downgrade its bonds to junk status if it does not make progress in fixing its finances by june 30 many callers said that they wanted to know whether the governor s plan which calls for 100 million in state aid and the creation of a financing authority to restructure some of the county s debt and oversee its attempts to cut its budget would help others asked whether the county had shown much progress in fixing its finances so far they would probably not have been reassured by the sparring here in nassau judith a jacobs , the democratic presiding officer of the legislature , accused mr parola of conducting a superficial review and of failing to take into account the fact that the governor s plan allowed the use of nonrecurring cuts this year it shakes our confidence in him , she said of the comptroller he did n't do his homework mr parola said he did not care that the state had said it would allow the county to use nonrecurring savings it is the position of this office that they cannot wait to find recurring revenues until next year , he said they have to bite the bullet and he accused the democrats of acting like county executive thomas s gulotta , whose reliance on nonrecurring revenues in the past has drawn heavy criticism they campaigned and got elected to end that kind of gulottaism , he said to which ms jacobs replied nobody has been more critical than us about the use of nonrecurring revenues no one understands better than us but we 're halfway through 2000 and we have to act a spokesman for republicans in the county legislature , robert lazaro , said the most important thing is that we all work together none of this is helpful adding to the uncertainty , many county officials now have their eyes on albany the governor s plan requires the approval of both county officials and the state legislature officials in the county say they are waiting for a final draft of the bill from albany so that they can examine the details and act on it and some are worried that a battle that broke out this week for the leadership of the state assembly could change the reception it gets there
plowing the dark by richard powers 415 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 25 much of richard powers s new novel takes place inside two tiny rooms the first a place you 'd be panicked to find yourself in , the second a place you 'd never want to leave at first glance , however , it would be hard to tell which room is which one is a nondescript chamber where the primary amenities are a cheap mattress and an erratic radiator the other space is equally generic , a windowless affair where every surface has been blanched institutional white though each room resembles a lousy manhattan rental , these places are worlds apart the first is a makeshift prison cell in beirut where an american hostage named taimur martin finds himself shackled in solitary confinement and immersed in perpetual torment the second is a virtualreality laboratory in seattle , nicknamed the cavern , where thrilled , goggled visitors zoom over a forest canopy or float beneath the marble canopy of a cathedral plowing the dark is a novel of brute juxtaposition , a work that crosscuts between these two disparate realms in order to draw connections between the virtual reality of cyberspace and the virtual reality of the human mind both places , it turns out , are screening rooms desperate to forestall succumbing to a graygreen , tidal emptiness during his years in captivity , taimur casts mental projections on the paintchipped walls of his cell that are just as ravishing as the bitmapped images crafted by adie klarpol , the artist who lends the cavern its lush , illusory textures in the end , which is a more dazzling act of creation , adie s digitized jungle , so convincing that its fake fronds leave real scratches on the adventurers scrolling through it , or taimur s resurrection of his old chicago neighborhood , in which his memory maps out every contiguous brick and block of concrete \? a fiercely visual book , plowing the dark sometimes feels less like a novel than the project of a stern museum curator locking you inside his private picture gallery the seattle lab in one frame , the beirut cell in the other powers forces you to stare for hours , your eyes flitting back and forth in an attempt to fuse the stories of taimur and adie into a threedimensional whole such a stereoscopic union is delayed until the final chapters of plowing the dark when the two pictures finally do merge , the effect is spectacular but like most special effects , it s an empty sort of razzledazzle as singular as it sounds , plowing the dark heavily echoes its author s previous fictions , with their cleverly braided narratives and fascination with cuttingedge science most american novelists portray technology as scary stuff they fill the sky with toxic clouds and screaming rockets powers s last novel , gain , which glumly chronicled environmental damage in an industrial town , fell prey to such fingerwagging but his best work like galatea 22 , in which some witty professors create a computer brainy enough to pass a literature exam finds beauty in the process of scientific inquiry the laboratory is as central to powers as the sitting room is to jane austen he loves placing brilliant characters inside a fluorescent incubator , then watching ideas hatch on the page adie is a classic powers character a former prodigy whose ideals have curdled into premature bitterness \( think of stuart ressler , the young biologist in the gold bug variations who falls apart when he fails to crack the code of human love \) a new york painter whose exquisite landscapes briefly captivated soho , adie has since lost faith in her craft , resorting to hack illustration but salvation beckons from seattle a friend cajoles her into visiting terasys , a digital graphics outfit on puget sound that needs a human hand to lend grace to its photoshopped forms during her tour , adie steps into the cavern first dismissing it as a glorified walkin closet and tests a simulation called crayon world she is quickly transported to a nubby , colorful world where she cavorts alongside waxy honeybees , and her conversion is immediate for the first time in as long as she cared to remember , the future held more pictures than the past joining terasys , adie begins creating virtualreality environments that make the first cavern simulations look like lascaux with the help of some hackers who subsist on doritos \( and indulge in the kind of sardonic wordplay that typically sets a powers lab humming \) , adie creates a program transforming henri rousseau s 1910 painting the dream into a rain forest filled with ripe fruit and rustling leaves this feat is meant to be thrilling , and it almost is powers does his florid best to make the moment feel magical dreamlike bananas floated up to tickle the insouciant moon but his prosepoem riffs never fully take flight , not even when adie giddily tosses botticelli s venus into her jungle with all the precious arthistorical references , the effect is none too trippy instead of the pulsing energy of the matrix , powers offers the staid alchemy of sunday in the park with george other terasys simulations are similarly stuffy one researcher develops a pictogram charting the impact of oil prices on geopolitics the effect is less like crawling into a cavern than plunging into a think tank
washington , july 27 two advocacy groups called on the justice department today to investigate whether the democratic and republican parties were violating federal election laws by using large unregulated political donations to pay for tv commercials promoting the campaigns of vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas leaders of the nonpartisan groups , common cause and democracy 21 , asked attorney general janet reno to consider again an issue that was at the center of a prolonged and bitter controversy among law enforcement officials over accusations of improper use of campaign donations in the 1996 presidential campaign four years ago , common cause challenged the legality of millions of dollars used for similar advertising , charging that the commercials promoted specific candidates , not party issues although some lawyers and officials at the justice department and the federal election commission agreed , neither agency took action the two advocacy groups also asked the election commission today to review the issue at issue are advertisements that have been running in at least 15 states for more than a month and are paid for with soft money donations made to political parties without limits as long as the money is used for party building activity under the law , advertisements for candidates are supposed to be paid with hard or federal money that is , donations limited by law and matched by federal money but scott harshbarger , the president of common cause and a former massachusetts attorney general , and fred wertheimer , the president of democracy 21 , contended in their letter that the advertisements they opposed violated election law the gore and bush soft money ads are clearly campaign ads designed and intended to promote the presidential candidates , are created by members of the presidential campaigns , are targeted to run in key presidential battleground states , are indistinguishable from other presidential campaign ads and are without question 'for the purpose of influencing' the presidential campaigns , the letter stated the phrase , for the purpose of influencing is from the federal election campaign act , which requires that advertisements with such a purpose be paid for with regulated money the advertisements cited by mr harshbarger and mr wertheimer are , in fact , paid for both with hard and soft money , spokesmen for each party said the democratic national committee and the republican national committee defended the advertisements , noting that none explicitly called for the viewer to vote for mr gore or mr bush the organizations of mr harshbarger and mr wertheimer advocate the overhaul of federal election laws the men estimated that if the justice department and the election commission did not act , as much as 100 million in illegal funds will be raised and spent in the 2000 presidential election common cause filed an almost identical complaint in 1996 about the campaigns of president clinton and senator bob dole , and the result was a battle lasting years in the justice department over whether to investigate the accusations ms reno opened a preliminary investigation in september 1998 to determine whether she should seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate at least the clinton part of the accusation mr dole was not covered under the independent counsel law , which has since expired and had applied solely to actions by officials in the same administration as the attorney general louis b freeh , the director of the federal bureau of investigation and many of his assistants vigorously contended that the accusations required an independent investigation , according to memorandums that were later disclosed charles labella , the head of the justice department s task force , also believed that the common cause complaint had merit , according to other memorandums addressed to ms reno in the end , ms reno sided with other justice department officials who said that mr clinton and mr dole could not be shown to have broken any laws because each acted on the advice of his lawyers that the socalled issue advertisements were legal the advice was based on the fact that none contained what courts had called the magic words that defined a campaign advertisement , such as language urging viewers to vote for or vote against a specific candidate the elections commission deadlocked 3 to 3 this february on whether to go forward with enforcement action against the clinton reelection committee
gaza , nov 21 glancing warily overhead , gazans ventured out today to inspect the bombedout police stations , the crippled television studios , the wrecked office suites and the other physical evidence of an unnerving night of missile barrages from israeli helicopters one palestinian was killed and others were seriously wounded in the israeli raids but major property damage appeared to be confined to the designated targets , all of them symbols of the palestinian military establishment that israel contended was complicit in the bombing on monday of a school bus from a jewish settlement in the gaza strip the israeli missiles smashed carsize holes in the headquarters of the palestinian preventive security services , the command center for several local police and intelligence agencies another rocket tore the exterior wall off the thirdfloor office of a local director of yasir arafat s fatah movement , leaving his desk exposed to the mediterranean breeze next to the soccer field in the central training compound for force 17 , mr arafat s elite presidential guard , israeli helicopters leveled a small onestory building that officers there guessed had been chosen randomly a lifesize statue outside of a grinning , khakiclad mr arafat , his pistol holstered and arm aloft in a frozen triumphal wave , remained intact none of the damage appeared crippling to the police or political institutions involved but the psychological impact of the israeli attack was profound , people said here today unfounded but fastspreading rumors of further israeli attacks today sent jittery police officers running from their headquarters this afternoon principals sent schoolchildren home early by nightfall , gaza s normally bustling commercial center was unnaturally quiet as a selfimposed curfew closed shops and kept families indoors the missile volleys started at 6 pm on monday , as power outages plunged gaza into darkness , and continued for three hours , while helicopters hovered overhead the noise was horrible , and all the children were screaming , said zaher yazge , who watched the raid on the force 17 compound from his home across the street his windows were shattered by the blasts today , he and his neighbors gathered outside the force 17 compound to discuss the airstrikes , the internal israeli roadblocks that have cut off gaza city from the rest of the strip , and the israeli import blockages that have them hoarding dwindling supplies of flour , powdered milk and gasoline this is the mind of barak at work , mr yazge said , referring to prime minister ehud barak of israel are we supposed to pay the price for everybody s sins \? mr barak came to gaza today to personally assess what he termed a broad operation against palestinian authority infrastructure in gaza this resolute response has one purpose , he said in a visit to the main israeli army base in gaza , to clarify that violence has a price and that we will not tolerate any form of violence almost simultaneously , a gaza sniper a few miles away shot and critically wounded an israeli settler palestinian leaders reiterated their denials of collusion in the school bus bombing and other attacks against jewish settlers we , as the palestinian authority , have nothing to do with this , muhammad dahlan , the security chief for the gaza strip , said after visiting the missileperforated police headquarters here once considered a behindthescenes ally of israeli security forces in their fight against radical islamist groups here , mr dahlan himself has been singled out by some senior israeli officials for his alleged acquiescence or even involvement in the school bus attack and other recent attempted bombings in the gaza strip at a meeting in jerusalem between mr barak and israeli opposition leaders after the monday night attack , the likud party chairman , ariel sharon , expressed dismay that mr dahlan had not been killed in the raids and called for his liquidation , according to israeli press reports mr dahlan today shrugged off the threat sharon has always been known for doing bloody things against the palestinian people , and now he wants to drink more cups of our blood , he said aggression will not solve the problem blood only produces more blood mr dahlan said he still had a slim hope that negotiations with israel could resume , even if palestinian protests continue we had an intifada for seven years without negotiations , then we had seven years of negotiations without an intifada , and maybe now we can have negotiations with an intifada , he said but mr barak said again today that talks could resume only after a halt to palestinian street violence and terror attacks the school bus bombing killed a schoolteacher and a handyman and maimed three children , siblings who were sitting together at the front of the bus orit cohen , 12 , lost part of her foot in the blast sevenyearold yisrael cohen s mangled left leg was amputated below the knee today the missiles fired in reprisal killed one palestinian police officer and seriously injured several bystanders , including young children and teenagers three youths were treated today at the orthopedic ward of gaza s main hospital for debilitating shrapnel injuries , including samir elsawir , 15 , who was walking past a palestinian government television station when it came under fire by israeli helicopters his right leg was amputated below the knee
miami , sept 20 eight cuban survivors of a plane crash in the gulf of mexico were taken today to key west for medical evaluation , a move that is likely to allow them to remain in the united states united states coast guard officials decided late this evening to take the eight cubans to hospitals in key west so they could be treated for their injuries and evaluated by doctors , a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service said once the eight cubans set foot on united states soil , they can legally apply for political asylum a ninth survivor is already being treated in key west for head and neck injuries and is expected to be moved , perhaps as early as tonight , to be with friends and relatives in miami the decision to allow the cubans off a coast guard vessel and onto american soil was made according what greg gagne , a spokesman for the immigration agency , called medical necessity ten people in all were inside the small cropduster plane when it took off from western cuba on tuesday and then crashed into the gulf of mexico the crew of the cargo ship chios dream pulled all 10 from the water , including one man with serious head injuries who was flown to a hospital in key west for treatment at a hospital and one man who was killed in the crash earlier reports from the american authorities had led many here in miami s cubanamerican community to believe that the eight remaining passengers , none of them with lifethreatening injuries , would not be transferred to american soil anytime soon or at best , that they would be taken to the united states naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba , where their requests for political asylum would be heard but coast guard officials apparently decided that all the crash survivors needed medical attention the decision at least appears to head off another confrontation between the clinton administration and miami s cuban americans , who had clashed over elian gonzalez the coast guard has decided to go ahead and medically evacuate the remaining eight cuban migrants from the chios dream , petty officer scott carr was quoted by the associated press as saying , referring to the cargo ship we made the recommendation that all the people would be brought in to the hospital so they could be checked out medically the survivors were transferred from the cargo ship to the cutter nantucket they were to be treated at florida lower keys hospital , petty officer carr said earlier in the day , representative lincoln diazbalart and representative ileana roslehtinen , both republicans from south florida , and the politically powerful cuban american national foundation sent letters to the clinton administration asking that the nine survivors be granted political asylum certainly they will face persecution in cuba for their involvement in such a highprofile and risky attempt to flee the island , wrote mr diazbalart and ms lehtinen , referring to early news reports that the plane had been hijacked from an airfield in cuba
santa fe , nm , may 14 as david lewis explained , you have to hit bottom before you can bounce back and this morning , when mr lewis had his first opportunity to look out of a bus window and observe the blackened ruins that were his house in los alamos , he said he found himself plunging to an emotional nadir after the fire that has swept through the deeply scarred , austerely beautiful canyons here i 've started all over before , but i 've always carried those boxes that have those mementos that are really heavy duty , said mr lewis , who works as a systems specialist at the los alamos national laboratory , which conducts nuclear weapons research i do n't have that this time there was nothing the fire that has destroyed more than 42 , 000 acres continued to expand today , driven by a resurgence of the winds but today also marked the symbolic beginning of the area s emotional recovery the new mexico national guard organized bus tours for residents whose homes had been destroyed , which left every 20 minutes starting at about 8 30 am from an armory outside town the people who joined these emotional journeys were told they could not leave the buses or collect any belongings the purpose was just to end one process , clinging to false hopes , and begin another , rebuilding the scene at the armory under a scorching sun was solemn , melancholy and resigned , with only faint sparks of the kind of restorative energy that will be needed to rebuild the city of los alamos , 30 miles to the north the authorities , however , announced one particularly satisfying piece of news the roughly 7 , 000 residents of white rock , a suburb of los alamos that suffered no actual fire damage , were permitted to return to their homes they said the roads to white rock were crowded , but people were moving in an orderly manner the roughly 11 , 000 residents of los alamos may have to wait until the end of the week to return home that was little solace to the more than 300 people who had accepted the offer to take the sobering bus trip back to their neighborhoods in los alamos these were people who had already been told their homes had been reduced to cinders and twisted scraps of steel and plastic the roughly fourhour trips began quietly each bright yellow school bus took 20 to 35 residents , along with two grief counselors and several national guard troops as they boarded , many residents were handed little brown teddy bears and a bag containing work gloves donated by an insurance company i just kept thinking none of those things we had can be replaced , lou pierotti , a retired store owner who had lived in los alamos for 49 years , said after he got off his bus people were kind of emotional , but it was quiet , very quiet all you could see was the outlines of where our house had been mr pierotti said he had lived on arizona street , where all the houses had been destroyed as he stood by his car in the armory s parking lot , absorbing what he had experienced this morning , he said his most painful feelings were for the small , sentimental losses , like his softball trophies you just realize you can never , never get those things back , he said kim lalley , a spokeswoman for the new mexico national guard , said that in spite of the warnings that no one would be allowed to get out of the buses in los alamos , several people had demanded a closer look at what was left of their homes they were upset , and they wanted to inspect their property , ms lalley said we ca n't force them to stay on the buses so we let them off and then informed the state police they were there robin peterson , who works for los alamos county , said people on the buses mostly watched , took photos and stared in silence there were a few tears , she said mr lewis said he had decided to take the trip because , i just wanted the closure but you still do n't know what it s like until you really see it , he said robert olson , who also lost his home , said i'm numb i'm confused firefighters said today that they did not expect the fire , which had been set on may 4 by the national park service in what was supposed to be a controlled burn , to return to heavily populated areas but swifter winds were causing the flames to leap across some canyons the more than 1 , 100 firefighters were focusing their efforts in three zones , mostly to the north and northeast , as the fire threatened archaeological sites on the santa clara pueblo , an indian reservation , and the baca ranch , 95 , 000 acres of meadows and fircovered mountains that is home to about 7 , 000 elk a spokesman for the united states forest service , jim paxon , said that if the high winds continued , firefighters might be pulled back and the fire allowed to run its course many of the people getting off the buses here today expressed appreciation for the efforts being made by firefighters and relief officials you truly ca n't believe how generous people have been , ms peterson said you see it everywhere it just feels great they had computers at one of the relief centers and my 16yearold daughter was able to get online and find her friends it just made us feel really good she said there had long been some resentment in the region of the people who lived in los alamos because , with their jobs at the nuclear weapons laboratory , they were generally wealthier and better educated you saw none of that , not even a little , she said but there was also a steady undercurrent of anger at the park service for starting the blaze when all is said and done , i had to ask myself this morning , 'why was i on that bus \? ' mr lewis said darn right , i'm mad photos residents returned to los alamos , nm , yesterday , left , to survey the fire damage renea andersen consoled her daughter , nicole , 5 , above , at a church service the andersens' home had been spared \( reuters \) \( associated press \)
tampa , fla , feb 15 coach john muckler decided the timing was right tonight to experiment with his lineup after all , the rangers were playing a tampa bay team that was 2221 with 4 regulation ties in its last 25 games so muckler started kirk mclean in goal instead of mike richter for the first of two road games on consecutive nights muckler shuffled his defensive pairings , too he did the same with his offensive lines , leaving left wing adam graves centering his own line and there was brian leetch , in the same arena in which he had experienced his most frustrating moment this season , gaining a small measure of satisfaction with a tiebreaking , milestone goal in the third period and yet , for all muckler s tinkering , the rangers still had to settle for a 22 tie with the secondworst team in the national hockey league tampa bay s super sophomore , vincent lecavalier , had a big hand in that by poking home a loose puck from the crease with just 1 minute 22 seconds left in the third period and with the lightning using an extra attacker on the ice while its goaltender was removed mclean , who made 30 saves , probably deserved better but the tie was surely more than the rest of the rangers deserved their last two games , against two of the three worst teams in the league \( the islanders and the lightning \) , have resulted in a loss and a tie we needed that extra point tonight , graves said we 're not making things easy on ourselves we 're in no position to be letting points slip away and , unfortunately , we let 3 points slip away the last two games with 24 games to play , the rangers , at 24259 with 3 regulation ties , have 60 points , tied with the pittsburgh penguins for seventh in the eastern conference eight teams in each conference qualify for the postseason and carolina \( 56 points \) , buffalo \( 56 \) and boston \( 55 \) are lurking right behind these were two games where we 'd probably like to come out with 4 points , mclean said we do n't want to look back and say these things haunted us but that is exactly what could happen come season s end and that is because the rangers let another late lead slip away leetch , who broke the ulna bone in his right forearm here at the ice palace on nov 24 blocking a slap shot by fredrik modin , knocked home what looked as if it might be the gamewinning goal at 9 minutes 46 seconds of the third period leetch s third goal this season , and first since nov 3 , came on the power play as is his trademark , leetch jumped into the play , pounced on the rebound of a petr nedved shot and beat his former teammate , dan cloutier , inside the left post with a shot from the left circle to break a 11 deadlock the goal was the 180th of leetch s career , all with the rangers , moving him past ron greschner for goals by a ranger defenseman and into 15th place on the team s career list it would have been special if it would have been the gamewinner , said leetch , who was on the ice for lecavalier s gametying goal it was a disappointing way to end the game no one was more disappointed or frustrated than theo fleury , who had three golden scoring chances snuffed out by cloutier at least that , said fleury , who broke at least three of his sticks in disgust fleury has scored just 13 goals this season , none on the power play , while playing in all but one of the rangers' 58 games fleury is on pace for an 18goal season the fewest goals he has scored in a season is 14 , in 198889 that was his rookie season , and fleury played just 36 games it s unbelievable , fleury said of his season i 've never seen anything like it in all my life when asked if this season could get any more frustrating for him , fleury said i do n't think so it s most frustrating knowing that the reason why i'm here is to score goals and i'm not scoring goals fleury also lost a key faceoff to chris gratton following a lightning timeout five seconds before lecavalier s goal it was our inability to win a faceoff in our own end zone at the end , that s what lost it , muckler said , adding that tim taylor \( who missed his second consecutive game with the flu \) would have taken the draw instead of fleury had taylor been able to play slap shots rich pilon returned to the lineup after missing two games with a strained left shoulder the rookie defenseman kim johnsson was a healthy scratch for the first time this season kevin hatcher was reunited in a pairing with pilon brian leetch was paired with stephane quintal mathieu schneider remained teamed with sylvain lefebvre adam graves centered johan witehall and john maclean graves has played most of his career at left wing he agreed to do it , said coach john muckler , for whom graves centered edmonton s kid line in 198990 , when the oilers won the last of their five stanley cups it s kind of an experiment more than anything else we 'll have to wait and see whether it works or not mike york centered valery kamensky and theo fleury forward eric lacroix took 18 stitches in the left ear after being hit with a puck in the first period
jesse orosco reached into the thick files in his memory he had been asked if , in his 20 years in the majors , he had ever pitched for a staff with six lefthanders he searched and searched and found nothing last year in baltimore , orosco recalled , the orioles had three lefthanders in the bullpen , but none in the rotation thinking out loud , he remembered the 1986 mets , who had bob ojeda and sid fernandez as starters and orosco and randy niemann as relievers four is probably the most i 've seen , said orosco , the 42yearold reliever who is one of six lefthanders on the mets' projected staff that s a lot of lefties it s a good balance a great balance the mets introduced four of their winter acquisitions at a news conference at the official allstar cafe in manhattan yesterday , and three were lefthanded pitchers along with the new starters mike hampton and bobby m jones , the mets employ the lefthanders al leiter , dennis cook and john franco there is a good chance all six will remain with the mets when the season opens march 29 against the chicago cubs in japan , general manager steve phillips said but if he wanted to , phillips could use that depth in a deal it s a nice commodity to have , because generally , lefthanders have greater value on the market than righthanders do , phillips said when you have two guys of equal ability , you 'd rather have a lefthander than a righthander last year , 13 of baseball s 30 teams had no lefthander make 25 starts only three clubs started two lefties regularly , and no team started three hampton and leiter anchor the mets' rotation , and two candidates for the fifth spot , jones and glendon rusch , are lefthanded that is a change for jones , who was traded from the rockies last week for masato yoshii in colorado , most of the time we only had two on the whole staff , jones said to have six on one team is definitely a luxury dave wallace , the pitching coach , understands he coached for los angeles during their major leaguerecord streak of 681 games started by righthanders the dodgers went from september 1992 until july 1997 without starting a lefthander if you 're in a situation where you think you have too many , you usually do n't , wallace said because at some point something will happen , and you 'll just be thankful you have those options available to you wallace and the rest of the coaching staff will meet with manager bobby valentine this weekend , partly to discuss what roles to assign the lefty relievers all three averaged fewer than an inning per appearance last year , with cook holding lefthanders to the lowest average , 211 orosco and franco were actually more effective against righthanders , but their presence may give the mets an advantage you have some options that probably make it a little more difficult for the opposition to manage the game , wallace said you 've got the availability of one guy to come in in the sixth inning to get a hitter out , and somebody else to come back in the seventh or the eighth one of the lefthanders in the baltimore bullpen with orosco last year , arthur rhodes , signed a fouryear , 13 million freeagent contract with seattle last month the mariners needed the help they had no lefthanded relievers with even 20 appearances last season every year you see teams starving for a lefty at the winter meetings , orosco said there s no lefties on the market , starters or relievers it keeps pitchers like orosco , who was acquired in december for another lefty reliever , chuck mcelroy , in demand i keep getting a job somehow , orosco said inside pitch the mets' biggest need is a lefthandedhitting outfielder , and one team with a surplus of those is the anaheim angels , who have only one righthanded hitter , tim salmon , among their four productive outfielders jim edmonds and garret anderson can be free agents next year , and the 25yearold darin erstad is a former allstar bill stoneman , the angels' general manager , said yesterday that he has talked about trades with several clubs , including the mets , but felt no pressure to move an outfielder the way i look at it , we 're strong with all four of them , stoneman said we 've been discussing more than one of them , but we 're not going to make a deal unless it makes sense for us the angels nearly traded edmonds to oakland last month , but the a s would not part with three top prospects after dealing the young starter octavio dotel in the mike hampton deal with houston , the mets would seem at a disadvantage in trading with the angels , who want young , inexpensive players , especially pitchers we have a few things we 're still talking about , steve phillips said nothing that would go down in the books as a major trade the mets invited three players to spring training yesterday , including the righthander paul wagner , who could compete for the fifth starter s job wagner , who is 2945 in parts of eight major league seasons , pitched in three games for the cleveland indians last year and went 84 with a 382 earned run average at class aaa buffalo also signed were catchers alan probst and jason phillips
oakland , calif , dec 10 it had all been laid out perfectly for the jets , the stars lining up yet again for a team that has seemed to enjoy a dose of divine intervention now and again this season the giants had done the neighborly thing early in the day and beaten pittsburgh to give the jets a wide opening through which they could saunter into the playoffs with a victory over oakland tonight almost simultaneously , the jets' fortunes grew even brighter tampa bay defeated the dolphins , to provide the jets with a chance as glistening and elusive as gold beat the raiders and move into a tie for the division lead with two games to play and the tie breakers in the jets' favor the jets , though , are a team that looks prosperity in the face and shudders they do best when things are the worst loss of key personnel , huge deficits , crushing losing streaks so they should do just fine next week against detroit but tonight , with so much that mattered giftwrapped for them , the jets came apart and came away with only an ugly lump of coal , a 317 loss to the raiders that , at least temporarily , halted their drive to the playoffs physically we got beat along the front quite a lot , jets coach al groh said it happened with the defensive front , the offensive front , our linebackers , all phases the jets \( 95 \) can clinch a playoff berth next week against detroit , but they may have to do it without vinny testaverde he did not play in the second half tonight , spending his time with an ice pack on his pulled left groin muscle after the game , he said he hoped to play next week testaverde , who completed 14 of 25 passes for 149 yards and was intercepted twice , appeared to have been injured when he was sacked late in the second quarter , a surprising development for the bestprotected quarterback in football but it was that sort of upsidedown night for the jets all that they had done so well in recent weeks the revived play from testaverde , the power running game , the stalwart defense was gone as quickly as the jets' best chance to snatch the american football conference east from the dolphins everything was in our favor , and we did n't take advantage , cornerback marcus coleman said of the jets' playoff chances we came all the way here for nothing when the backup quarterback ray lucas , who was intercepted twice , had to leave the game for two plays when he appeared to be injured early in the fourth quarter , it was clear that the jets' dream situation had devolved into a nightmare the defense revealed gaping holes and showed shades of former disaster , giving up several bigyardage plays the offense , which seemed to have gotten on track in recent weeks , was stifled by a defense that is middling at best it s just one of those games , linebacker mo lewis said in the first quarter , we felt like we stayed with it , and then everything they did after the first quarter went their way and we just went downhill we just needed that one score in the first half , all the warts that had threatened to scar the jets' season early on inexplicably returned the offense , coming off a 203yard rushing game by curtis martin that pulverized the indianapolis defense , established none of that kind of rhythm it frequently stumped itself with penalties \( six in the first half \) and allowed testaverde to face an unusual amount of pressure in the second quarter , testaverde was sacked for an 8yard loss while scrambling he came up limping , left the game and never returned the jets gained 104 yards in the first quarter , but tom tupa also had four punts in the second quarter , the jets gained just 38 yards testaverde , who had thrown just two interceptions in the last two games , threw backtoback interceptions early in the second quarter , although neither was his fault the first did not cause damage , but the second did testaverde s pass bounced off richie anderson s hands and eric allen picked it off and went 50 yards down the right sideline for the first touchdown that play seemed to set the tone for a second quarter straight out of the jets' nightmares the raiders , who had been so dysfunctional in the first quarter

greenwich , conn , jan 19 nearly 25 years after 15yearold martha moxley was bludgeoned to death on the lawn of her family home here , the police today charged michael skakel , her former friend and neighbor and a nephew of ethel kennedy , in the slaying but in a legal twist that is sure to lead to further complications in the highly publicized case , mr skakel , 39 , was charged as a minor because he was 15 at the time of the october 1975 killing in belle haven , a gated section of this affluent town the charges against mr skakel came after prosecutors disclosed today that a grand jury had found that enough evidence existed to arrest him but they would not discuss that evidence , or their plans but legal experts said they would almost certainly file a motion to have mr skakel tried as an adult , a prospect that the law at the time of the killing did not address for now , mr skakel s legal fate is up to a juvenile court judge in stamford , who will decide whether the case should be heard there or in connecticut superior court , which could sentence him to prison it is not clear what penalty mr skakel would face if he was convicted as a juvenile the old law required that juvenile offenders be released at 21 mr skakel surrendered today to the greenwich police , who charged him with murder he posted a 500 , 000 bond , was released and left the station smiling his lawyer , michael sherman , said mr skakel was not guilty today s arrest was a major break in a murder case that has long confounded local and state authorities and produced several books written by journalists and detectives lured here in hopes of unearthing the clues that would crack the case none did , although a 1998 book written by mark fuhrman , the former los angeles police detective , named mr skakel as the likely killer during the years of investigating , first by the greenwich police and later by the state s attorney in bridgeport , mr skakel and his older brother , thomas , emerged at the top of prosecutors' list of suspects both have denied any role in the crime , in which miss moxley was beaten and stabbed with a golf club wielded so powerfully that it shattered during the attack police later traced the club , a 6 iron , to a set owned by ann reynolds skakel , the boys' mother mrs skakel , the sisterinlaw of ethel kennedy , the widow of robert f kennedy , had died two years earlier michael skakel lives in a gated complex in hobe sound , fla , with his wife , young son and father , rushton skakel michael skakel arrived in greenwich by train this afternoon after learning last night that prosecutors planned to issue a warrant for his arrest he s not guilty , his lawyer , mr sherman , said this morning , adding that his client s spirits were good , all things considered everyone s been telling him this was going to happen for years the prosecution of mr skakel will begin later this month or in early february , when he may become the first 39yearold defendant to appear in stamford juvenile court there , judge maureen dennis will decide whether or not mr skakel should be charged as an adult in superior court , prosecutors said what may keep mr skakel s case in juvenile court , though , is a 1975 connecticut law that required judges to find probable cause before moving any case involving a defendant age 14 to 16 to an adult court but legal experts say that under the judicial philosophy of that time , juveniles were not typically tried for murder , but sent for rehabilitation though the law has been revised to make the transfer of juvenile murder defendants automatic , a legal battle is sure to erupt about which version of the law will apply to mr skakel if the case is kept in juvenile court , the court will probably have little power to punish him , said david rosen , a lecturer at yale university and a senior research associate at yale law school s child studies center the only way to punish him would be through a transfer to the superior court , but a transfer may not be a maneuver available to the prosecutor , depending on how the judge interprets the law , mr rosen said in a telephone interview today under the law as it stood in 1975 , he added , the only thing this guy can be prosecuted for is being a juvenile delinquent prosecutors , mr rosen added , may be walking into a thicket that there is no way out of hugh f keefe , a criminal defense lawyer in new haven , said prosecutors most likely would not have hunted down mr skakel if they did not expect his case to be heard in superior court the pressure s going to be on the judge to transfer him out of juvenile court and have him tried as an adult , he said mickey s job , he said , referring to mr skakel s lawyer , is going to be to get the law that applied 25 years ago as mr skakel was surrendering to the police in greenwich today , dorthy moxley , the mother of the slain girl , sat beaming next to a painting of martha in the dining room of her new jersey home conceding her confusion over the legal complexities involved in trying mr skakel , mrs moxley said she was hoping for a trial , any trial wild horses could n't keep me away , she said since yesterday , she said , when she first heard there was a new development in the case , she has been a bundle of nerves when my husband died 12 years ago , she said , we thought there was no hope
havana , jan 27 toting bags bulging with everything from slick brochures for sophisticated surgical equipment to packets of peptobismol , crowds of cuban doctors , nurses and technicians strolled along the redcarpeted aisles of the first american trade show here since the united states imposed an economic embargo four decades ago sure , the whole affair could have been limited to the handful of cuban officials actually responsible for purchasing medical products but many of the 8 , 000 medical professionals expected to attend the united states health care exhibition were eager to participate in a curious encounter that was part seminar on modern medical knowledge , part windowshopping for american medical devices and part political opening in some ways the scene at the pabexpo convention center with cuban doctors calmly talking shop with american sales representatives was oddly juxtaposed with the cuban government s recent clamor for the return of the 6yearold refugee elian gonzalez the american executives , in turn , expected few quick deals , if any , because of the intricate regulations governing the embargo the exhibition is the latest small gesture , like last year s visit of the governor of illinois to explore agricultural exports , where politicians and businesspeople seek to raise awareness of opportunities with the ultimate goal of lifting the embargo that has yet to topple president fidel castro why should we lose out \? said tony delio , the president of adm nutraceutical , a division of archer daniels midland , a sponsor of the exhibition the economic embargo has not worked it has not accomplished its political objectives opening up trade and normalizing relations with cuba would be in the best interests of america economically and politically we trade openly with vietnam , with whom we had a war working for the cuban health care system , which is an ofteninvoked accomplishment of the very revolution that eventually provoked the embargo , the cubans crowded around demonstrations of optical equipment , tried on leg braces and chatted about the latest technologies and techniques that remain tantalizingly beyond their reach now we only need two things , concluded one cuban as he left the exhibition hall more equipment and the money to buy it both things are in short supply here , ever since the collapse of the soviet union pushed cuba into an economic slide from which it has yet to recover fully replacement parts for medical equipment can be scarce , as are some medicines at pharmacies cubans with relatives in the united states treasure their regular shipments of vitamins and aspirin , poring over bottle labels as if they were deciphering scriptures medical goods and food are eligible for sale despite the embargo because they are considered humanitarian aid american officials said that in the last 18 months they had licensed 45 million in medical sales to cuba , although that only means companies were approved to begin negotiations they said they did not know how many sales had taken place , but cuban officials insisted none had because the deals fell through after delays or because financing or transport could not be obtained cuban officials chafe at other american regulations , like the requirement to document that medicines and equipment supplies have not been used to treat foreigners and hence earn hard currency from hospital charges how can i ensure that every patient is a cuban \? said rodrigo alvarez cambras , the director of the frank pais international orthopedic complex , where almost a third of the patients are indeed foreigners they want a clinical history that is crazy if we pay for it , what does it matter if we give it to a cuban or a foreigner \? if you get hurt and come here , do i have to say to you i cannot help you and let you die \? most of the american products the executives brought here with them bandages , vitamins and , in one case , a 365 , 000 radiation therapy device will be donated as a gesture of good will , not to mention brand awareness and a first step toward the day when business and diplomatic relations between the two countries are normalized befitting a medical show , several executives said that would come only through the biological solution , a thinly veiled allusion to the aging mr castro this is a learning experience , said jeff dziura , the director of international sales for the ferris mfg corporation , a woundcare products company in suburban chicago you have to test the water whether you make a deal or not things change politically that s the beauty of international trade a lot of people in the states are afraid of it but if you have action in many countries , when one country is suffering problems you can enjoy prosperity in another part of the world you spread your risks although some people noted that the companies at the show did not send any highpowered delegations , it mattered little to the cubans a halfdozen people waited patiently to have their vision tested , while others gingerly tasted free samples of chile without carne , made from soybeans and while the exhibition was devoted to health , cigarette smoke wafted through the air , a reminder that american medical attitudes against smoking have yet to filter down here what i have yet to see are any little pills to help me stop smoking , said xiomara rodriguez , as she sheepishly crushed out her cigarette in a potted plant she said that while cuba had made its own medical advances , in the field of natural medicines in which she works , for instance , the displays of new equipment reminded her of the gap that remained in both technology and politics we hope they remove the blockade so we can get ahead , she said nobody has the right to take away our right to develop we have been trying to advance , but they do not let us intent on at least advancing her own knowledge , dr vilma lisnar spent hours instead of dollars learning about physical therapy equipment , disposable syringes and nutritional supplements at a booth sponsored by pfizer , she discussed with a sales representative the side effects of some new antibiotics this is marvelous , because in the clinic where i work we need these a lot , said dr lisnar , a family doctor another company had a product to improve your memory how wonderful that would be of course , in some quarters , memories of the last four decades of revolution and embargo have persisted perfectly well without it photo nearly 100 companies are taking part in the united states health care exhibition in havana this week , the first american trade show held there in four decades a big hit with visitors was a machine for testing vision \( david gonzalez the new york times \)
william edmondson of nashville had his first oneman show in new york in 1937 , when a dozen of his elegantly spare limestone sculptures went on view at the museum of modern art despite the venue , the new york art world seems to have regarded edmondson less as a modern artist than a folkloric primitive according to the blithely condescending press reports of the time , an innocent negro \( newsweek \) whose guileless use of plastic symbol language \( new york times \) revealed the imaginativeness of true naivete \( new yorker \) on saturday the museum of american folk art opens the first major new york retrospective of edmondson s work since the 1937 show and despite the venue , edmondson this time around is being presented not as a simple folk carver but as an outstanding 20thcentury artist prominent in both the pantheon of selftaught art and the history of american modernism what has changed over the last 63 years is not only the nation s racial politics but the perceived value of art created by people like william edmondson , a man with no formal education whose life and artistic practice unfolded far outside the narrow precincts of the fineart world edmondson s work is gorgeous in its simplicity and striking in its sophistication , said brooke anderson , director of the folk art s contemporary center , its new department for modern selftaught art he was very rooted in the south and in the africanamerican community and very much a man of his time , but his work also transcends those things that s part of its greatness the art of william edmondson , which will be on view through aug 27 in new york before traveling to rochester , atlanta and orlando , fla , aims to bring the artist to a wider audience after the 1937 show , edmondson s life did n't change he got hardly any recognition , said rusty freeman , associate curator at nashville s cheekwood museum of art , which organized the current exhibition today the artist is highly regarded by art insiders familiar with his work , but he needs to be exposed to the mainstream , mr freeman said he s been an artworld secret for too long the ups and downs of edmondson s public career are a reminder that the current popularity of what s variously called vernacular , outsider or selftaught art reprises the craze for naive artists that swept the american art world in the 1930 s back then modern art was widely attacked as the alien spawn of european decadence modernism s proponents , who found inspiration in everything from african masks to the daily newspaper , turned their omnivorous gaze on folk art and the idiosyncratic work of untrained artists , and found proof that modern art s radical visual ideas had deep american roots one of the first museum exhibitions of american folk art was organized at the museum of modern art in 1932 , drawing from the collection of abby aldrich rockefeller , also a prominent modernart collector at the same time , john kane , morris hirschfield and anna \( grandma \) moses were among the scores of modern primitives welcomed into the modern and important new york galleries it was during this era that edmondson came to the attention of the art world , an intersection that was otherwise unlikely in the extreme born just outside nashville in 1874 , the son of freed slaves , barely able to read or write , edmondson worked as a railroad laborer , then as a hospital janitor in 1931 he left or lost his hospital job , but shortly thereafter he found a new , divinely inspired career according to edmondson , god appeared at the head of his bed and announced he had come to confer the gift of cutting stone edmondson obediently made himself a crude hammer and chisel , and soon god appeared again with models of tombstones for edmondson to copy i looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight he hung a tombstone out for me to make , edmondson later recalled the novice stonecutter put up a sign reading tombstones for sale and went to work his raw materials were limestone blocks from demolished buildings and curbing torn out when the city replaced stone with concrete he sold only a few tombstones to his neighbors , but the love of carving for its own sake drove him on as he grew more adept he began carving animals , angels , nurses and preachers first he told me to make tombstones , then he told me to cut the figures , edmondson reportedly said he give me them two things judged by the standards of ordinary funerary monuments , edmondson s handiwork might look unskilled and crude but to sophisticated eyes the sculptures' pareddown forms , subtly varied textures and enigmatic presence evoked the work of such modernist masters as constantin brancusi and elie nadelman , while at the same time looking like nothing except themselves word about this phenomenon spread through the local white art community and from there to new york , and in 1936 louise dahlwolfe , a rising fashion photographer , went to edmondson s house and took a series of photographs of the artist and his sculpturefilled backyard
the chase manhattan corporation , the thirdbiggest banking company in the united states , is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire j p morgan company , one of the most storied banks , for 309 billion in stock , executives close to the talks said yesterday chase has been striving to transform itself into a global financial powerhouse , and acquiring morgan could sharply accelerate the process since the early 1980 s , morgan has changed from a commercial bank with a bluechip list of clients into a firm focused on investment banking buying morgan could catapult chase into the big leagues of investment banking , the business of raising money for large corporations and advising them on mergers and acquisitions it would also continue the consolidation among the nation s largest banks , leaving only a handful of huge institutions at the top of the industry page c1 together , chase and morgan would have more than 650 billion in assets , ranking second to citigroup s 800 billion this is the deal that should have been done a year ago , said michael mayo , an analyst at credit suisse first boston it s a logical progression while the companies have released no details on the likely deal , executives close to the negotiations said that job cuts were expected some analysts speculated that several thousand jobs could be eliminated most of chase s banking customers would probably not notice much immediate change as a result of the combination most of the overlap between the two companies would be in investment banking functions , like underwriting stocks and bonds and trading currencies chase is one of the biggest creditcard issuers in the country and a major lender to individuals seeking to buy houses and cars in contrast , even as it has labored to reinvent itself , morgan has continued to focus largely on serving the needs of bluechip clients , both corporate and individual page c1 still , both have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks , which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the resulting organization would clearly be powerful because both firms are both bank and investment bank , said robert albertson , president of pilot financial , an investment firm in new york the old chase and the old morgan a decade ago would have been oil and water , but now they 're made of the same liquid they 've grown closer rather than further apart the new firm would be called j p morgan chase , the executives said william b harrison , chairman and chief executive of chase , would be chief executive of the combined institution douglas a warner iii , chairman and president of morgan , would be chairman of j p morgan chase chase agreed to exchange 37 shares of its stock for each of morgan s 159 million shares , the executives said at chase s closing stock price of 5250 yesterday , the proposed price was about 309 billion chase has total assets of 396 billion , compared with 266 billion for morgan while both companies are among the five biggest banks in the nation , neither has been able to crack the top tier of investment banks chase ranks 9th and morgan 10th this year among advisers to corporations on mergers and acquisitions around the world chase has operations in 65 countries and nearly 80 , 000 employees j p morgan has about 16 , 000 employees the deal , if completed , would end months of speculation about who might acquire the 150yearold morgan several firms , including deutsche bank of germany , have recently considered buying morgan as consolidation has picked up speed on wall street in the last few months , there have been several highpriced acquisitions of midsize american financial companies , including the painewebber group , the brokerage firm , and donaldson , lufkin jenrette , a midsize investment bank the commercial banking industry has been consolidating as well but none of those deals involved two companeis with the heritage and power of chase and morgan chase , which was founded in 1799 , has grown rapidly in recent years through mergers with some of new york s biggest banks , including chemical bank and manufacturers hanover more recently , it has been buying up smaller investment banking firms to strengthen its position as an underwriter of technology companies , it acquired hambrecht quist , a san franciscobased firm , last year this spring it bought the beacon group , a merger boutique run by geoff boisi , a former investment banker at the goldman sachs group who is now overseeing chase s investment banking operations in june , chase added robert fleming holdings , an investment banking and moneymanagement firm in europe , for 77 billion but even with those purchases , chase faced the prospect of losing ground as competitors made even bigger acquisitions ubs , the giant swiss bank , agreed to pay more than 12 billion to buy painewebber earlier this year last month , the credit suisse group , another swiss bank , agreed to pay about 128 billion to buy donaldson , lufkin jenrette from axa , a french financial conglomerate those deals nearly wiped out the ranks of independent middletier securities firms , increasing the pressure on wouldbe buyers to rush in at the beginning of this week , only three remained morgan , lehman brothers holdings and bear stearns for its part , morgan has worked for years to transform itself into a company focused on investment banking but has stayed away from mergers and major acquisitions but according to one adviser who had talked with j p morgan , mr warner has been shopping the company to prospective buyers for several months that person said that morgan was asking for a premium of 15 percent to 20 percent over the current stock price , a sum some investment banks thought was too rich of particular concern was j p morgan s fixedincome trading business , which competitors say made up too much of its business deutsche bank was one suitor interested in j p morgan , but that bank would have to register shares here before it could complete any transaction , and that would take more than a year late last week , morgan s chief financial officer , peter hancock , quit suddenly , adding more fuel to the speculation then , tuesday morning , mr warner , the chairman of morgan , set the rumors flying when he canceled an appearance at a banking conference sponsored by merrill lynch morgan s stock shot up 1613 , to 18544 , yesterday chase s shares fell 488

washington , aug 14 plaintiffs' lawyers and safety advocates called on bridgestone firestone today to considerably widen the scope of its recall of tires for sport utility vehicles and pickups they contend that the tire maker and ford motor were misleading the public about the safety of many firestone tires and of ford explorers equipped with them the lawyers' statements highlighted an escalating squabble over how to apportion the limited numbers of replacement tires available ford and firestone , a unit of the bridgestone corporation of japan , have tried to conduct the recall in stages , giving top priority to people in hotweather states where firestone s data indicates that its tires are most likely to fail but at a news conference here today , the lawyers and safety advocates urged consumers in all states to immediately replace all firestone wilderness at tires on ford explorers , including many tires that have not been recalled separately , the attorney general of south carolina , charlie condon , sued bridgestone today , contending that his state should be among the first to receive replacement tires , instead of being in the recall s third and final tier tire dealers and ford dealerships across the country have been swamped since last week s recall announcement with people angrily demanding replacement tires ford and firestone are trying to steer the first batches to arizona , california , florida and texas , where 85 percent of the accidents involving tire failure have occurred they want to send the next batches to oklahoma , nevada , alabama , georgia , louisiana and mississippi , which have accounted for another 4 percent of the accidents ford and firestone say there have been very few accidents elsewhere , including virtually none in new york , new jersey or connecticut ken zino , a ford spokesman , said that calls for a wider recall ran counter to the longstanding policy of regulators and automakers to give priority to motorists most at risk of injury he criticized the plaintiffs' lawyers and safety advocates for urging people nationwide to seek immediate replacements of their tires what we 're trying to do is precisely the opposite , which is to try to get people to replace bad tires , he said tom baughman , a senior ford engineer , said that ford had been having more luck than expected in lining up alternative sources of tires but replacement tires will remain scarce until at least early september , he said christine karbowiak , a firestone spokeswoman , said that the company hoped to replace all the recalled tires before next summer , a little faster than the oneyear target set last week at the news conference , the tire critics discounted assertions some by ford , some by firestone , some by both companies that problems with the tires resulted from poor manufacturing practices , hot weather , overloaded vehicles or inadequate tire maintenance by motorists instead , the lawyers and safety advocates accused ford of doing a poor job of designing the ford explorer s suspension and setting technical specifications for the tires the combination , they said , made the tires more likely to come apart at high speeds and the vehicles more likely to roll over as a result i think it s a design defect , said joan claybrook , a former vehicle safety regulator who is now the president of public citizen , a safety advocacy group ford strongly denied that there was anything wrong with the explorer or the tire specifications we 've built explorers with brands of tires other than firestones and had absolutely no problems , mr baughman said , blaming poor tire quality as the source of the problem firestone tires not covered by the recall have worldclass safety records , he added , arguing that replacing them with other brands , as the critics proposed , would not improve motorists' safety on sunday , ford released an analysis of firestone data showing that very high claims rates for injuries and property damage had been confined to the tires being recalled 15inch atx and atx ii tires of the p235 75r15 size produced at various firestone factories , and wilderness at tires of the same size made at firestone s factory in decatur , ill the lawyers and public citizen criticized ford for not releasing warranty claims information too , and said that all 15 and 16inch wilderness at tires should be recalled c tab turner , a lawyer in little rock , ark , who has a number of lawsuits filed against both companies , said at the news conference that the call for a wider recall was not motivated by a desire to strengthen plaintiffs in court ford has already replaced 16inch wilderness tires in hotweather countries like saudi arabia , a fact he said could be used against the company in litigation firestone estimates that it has made 48 million atx , atx ii and wilderness at tires last wednesday s recall covered 14 million of these tires , but the company estimates that only 65 million of them are still in use because the atx and atx ii tires have not been made since 1996 by contrast , most of the 56 million 15inch tires and a large but undetermined number of the 16inch tires that lawyers want in the recall are likely to be still on the road because they are all wilderness tires , a brand made only since 1996 , when it replaced the atx and atx ii photo c tab turner ,

for most of the past decade the west african nation of sierra leone has been riven by a vicious civil war as rebel groups terrorized the country last fall the united nations sent a peacekeeping force to carry out a tenuous peace accord and disarm the combatants but in recent months rebels have ambushed and disarmed some of the peacekeepers in february the security council nearly doubled the force , from 6 , 000 to 11 , 000 troops the move is clearly needed , but it will benefit no one and could damage the credibility of un peacekeeping efforts elsewhere if the troops continue to be ineffectual the security council first authorized a peacekeeping force for sierra leone in october to help institute a peace agreement signed last july between the elected government of president ahmad tejan kabbah and rebel forces , chiefly the revolutionary united front , led by an erratic warlord named foday sankoh but the rebels still control more than a third of the countryside and frequently attack civilians the security council belatedly ordered un troops to use their weapons against the rebels to protect themselves and civilians in their vicinity one troubling element of last july s peace agreement was a broad amnesty granted to rebel fighters for crimes committed during the war it allowed rebel leaders , including mr sankoh , to assume positions in government even as their followers continued to plunder the countryside and refused to lay down their arms pending an election scheduled for next year the amnesty reinforces a destructive culture of impunity and undercuts un efforts in rwanda and the former yugoslavia to hold parties to armed conflicts accountable for war crimes a truth commission is planned as part of the peace accord that would at least document abuses it deserves western support none of the un s efforts will bring peace to sierra leone if they do not also address its booming illicit trade in diamonds as in angola and congo , capturing diamondrich regions and participating in the blackmarket diamond trade are main objectives of sierra leone s war mr sankoh now heads the government agency that oversees the diamond trade , and his rebels control the diamondrich regions , trading diamonds for arms an important dimension of the problem is neighboring liberia president charles taylor , who helped trigger sierra leone s war and backs mr sankoh , has turned liberia into a laundering site for illicit diamonds as well as a transit corridor for weapons purchased in exchange by accepting liberian diamond exports as legitimate , the diamond industry supports this destructive trade unless legitimate businesses cooperate to stop the illicit diamond trade from arming west africa s rebels and warlords , the best efforts of peacekeepers are bound to fail
his eyes sparkling like a little boy playing with a favorite toy , bob bender cranked the gear intently , winding the rubber band running through the fuselage of his homemade airplane tighter and tighter then mr bender , 75 , walked to the center of the nearly empty hangar at the cradle of aviation museum at mitchel field , delicately placed the tissue paper and balsa wood aircraft with a 13inch windspan on the floor and released the propeller driven by the rubberband motor , the tiny copy of a 1932 de havilland puss moth with a red fuselage and white wings raced forward and lifted into the air , climbing higher and higher in a looping arc standing on the side , a group of volunteers who spend wednesdays restoring old aircraft for the museum watched , counting the seconds of its flight , their mouths agape as it descended to a perfect landing on the cement floor 47 seconds later none of my planes are going to fly for a minute , mr bender hedged , worried that having switched to new rubber bands the previous evening would affect how his lilliputian fleet was going to perform for each minute each craft remained aloft on a recent morning , the spectators agreed to a dollar donation , a grassroots fundraiser for the museum , which is scheduled to open next spring the meister , declared bob schwartz , 65 , of hicksville , a retired elevator constructor and one of the volunteers nothing to it , mr schwartz said ten cents worth of balsa wood five cents worth of tissue paper , three cents worth of glue and 50 years of experience and he 'll help any kid who wants to learn i wish i could build airplanes the way he does to see something like this fly is fantastic but the planes follow a strictly indoor trajectory to keep mr bender s gossamer winged , rubberband powered , aeronautical models from tumbling to the ground , the air needs to be perfectly still the least little breeze affects these planes because they are so light , mr bender said the lighter the craft , the longer they can fly five of his planes together would weigh no more than a penny under perfect conditions , the lightest aircraft can fly for over an hour the rubber band provides the thrust to overcome the drag the curvature of the wings creates lift to overcome gravity and the rudder is offset to keep the plane flying in circles in a confined space mr bender , a retired new york city police officer from mineola , was a radio operator on a b24 during his service in the air corps during world war ii in the phillipines he never earned a real pilot s license he has found clear skies inside the cradle s hangar for more than 15 years , frequently giving model flying demonstrations but this fall , as 64 aircraft begin to be rolled into the museum for a chronological display of aviation history from the hempstead plains to the golden age of aviation , the jet age and the space age , mr bender s hobby may be short a runway so far , only a newly restored 1909 bleriot , the fourth oldest airplane in the united states , and several missiles are in the hangar it s not the best place to fly , but it s almost the only place to fly , said mr bender , though he also flies monthly during the academic year at east memorial public school in farmingdale tom gwynn , senior planning coordinator for the cradle , said the museum would try to help mr bender secure a new location inspired by lindbergh s first flight , mr bender started building model airplanes at age 7 , beginning with stationary models by the time he was 12 , he had shifted focus to the matchstick wings that could soar as an adult , his passion for rubberband aviation never wavered he has constructed about 75 flying machines one creation is crafted for endurance another does aerobatics and one will take off from a standing stop on a concrete floor , sail to within inches of the ceiling and then land by itself with neither computer chips or remotecontrol toggle to direct it if i had to be at work at 5 o'clock , i would get up at 4 o'clock and go down the cellar even if i only put one stick on that board , mr bender recalled while preparing a hang gliderlike rogollowing plane for a quick takeoff next , to keep the fuselage from rattling , mr bender wound a braided rubber band inside his 20inchlong manhattan , designed with a fishtype body and a 20inch wingspan that did n't stop it from flying smack into the skywalk , then getting lodged in the crossbeams he poked the airplane with a long pole and it resumed its glide though most paperplane enthusiasts move on to gaspowered or electricpowered models , mr bender said he was a purist , sticking with his own rubberband designs and those taken from blueprints in model airplane magazines he belongs to a rubberband fliers club with about 15 members on long island using a jeweler s loupe for the precision work , mr bender builds his aircraft from scratch in his basement to test the planes , he glides them down the cellar stairs those that do n't fly right away are added to his static model collection , including the world s first seaplane from 1910 and a korean war mash helicopter model made with a plastic pantyhose cover for a canopy
soaring prices and persistent bidding at christie s sale of contemporary art last night proved how few good works are on the market these days and how much money people have to spend the prices were scary , said douglas cramer , the television producer and collector , after the sale it was such a young audience i thought for a moment i 'd wandered into 'gladiator' it must be internet money the

in tub , a 1988 sculpture of a woman sitting in a bubble bath , grabbing her breasts , as someone with a snorkel attacks her from the bottom of the tub in a scene reminiscent of the shower sequence in psycho four bidders tried hard to buy the work , estimated at 800 , 000 to 12 million , and it finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for 17 million another top seller was two women , a 1968 dot painting by sigmar polke the painting , which depicts a pair of modellike figures clad in short , furtrimmed coats and kneehigh boots , comes from an unnamed german collection and was been exhibited only once , in frankfurt in 1983 german pop paintings like this are hard to find , but two women came with a hefty estimate 1 million to 15 million that did n't stop two bidders from wanting it badly it sold to thomas h lee , founder of the snapple beverage company and a seasoned collector , for 16 million it was almost twice the previous record for the artist 882 , 500 , set in 1988 when christie s sold his loesungen iiv last night , christie s had given the sellers a guarantee a undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller , regardless of the sale s outcome of

collection mr saatchi helped to finance the show , as did christie s , which contributed 50 , 000 both were said to be purposely using a museum show to inflate the value of the artists on view while ms antoni is an american artist and was not in sensation , she has been a trendy figure in the art world for the first time , christie s included 20thcentury furniture in its contemporary art sale because executives there thought it would bring higher prices in the context of art in some cases this was probably true , but bidding was less competitive for these works and tended to slow down the

perth amboy , nj , sept 26 not every pedestrian on washington street here sees an apparition of the virgin mary in the smudgy colored streaks of the thermal pane window but just as in the miracles frequently reported in small southern towns , or the one that played out for months in a suburban yard in marlboro , nj , a few years back , none of the faithful here are demanding unanimity the streaks in the window , in ramona and marcelino collado s secondfloor apartment , started changing colors and producing an image last week , family members said , and the collados' apartment was transformed into a religious shrine today , hundreds of people came to their workingclass , hispanic neighborhood and stood in the rain , peering up at the window some squinted , struggling to discern an image that others , their lips moving in apparent prayer , had already perceived others climbed the stairs to the apartment and trooped through the collados' kitchen and living room in soggy shoes to pay homage at the window some knelt in the living room to pray beneath a large framed picture of christ some said the rosary others walked to the window and pressed their hands to the glass one elderly man rubbed a candle against it the collado family welcomed all , most of them strangers some visitors brought candles that were placed on a table beneath the window others came with bouquets of roses two teachers' aides on their lunch break from a local elementary school pressed their hands to the window and came away in silence i think most want to believe , that s why we 're here , said one , maria tirado it s very mystical you just have to believe her colleague , patricia defex , said anything is possible if you have faith if it is true and you 've touched it , you 've touched something holy , like a relic jose rivas , 32 , of nearby carteret , stood in the living room , clutching a crucifix attached to a gold chain i find it to be breathtaking , he said to the uninitiated , the living room window facing washington street seems nothing more than a blur of discoloration the colors take on different hues , depending on the viewing angle from the sidewalk from the right , the streaks have a reddishorange tint from the front , white and brown and from the left , grayishgreen with a flameshaped trace of red in the lower left corner from indoors , the doublepaned window exhibits none of the streakiness it appears misty or covered with steam for now , the roman catholic church is saying nothing about the window rayanne damiano , a spokeswoman for the diocese of metuchen , which includes perth amboy , said the diocese had no official comment she said the bishop , vincent d p breen and all diocesan priests were at a threeday retreat and not available for questions they had left instructions , she said , not to discuss the window this afternoon , as visitors filled the family living room , the collados' soninlaw , felix pratts , said that the window began changing colors last tuesday or wednesday at first , he said , his wife , isaura , thought her mother had put a religious picture in the window and it had somehow left an impression on the glass but when she learned that nothing had been put in the window , she began thinking that the window bore an image of mary and she began sharing those thoughts with neighbors word spread fast through perth amboy and surrounding parts of middlesex county strangers began turning up friday , some with candles , to gaze at the window and pray crowds grew through the weekend , and the turnout monday , which included film crews from new york television stations , was so large that the perth amboy police closed washington street to all vehicles from 1 to 8 pm the crowd was sparser in the rain today but in the early afternoon , cars crept by , bumper to bumper , their occupants straining for a glimpse of the window four police officers kept onlookers and visitors behind barricades on either side of the street those eager to go upstairs lined up silently in the rain some neighbors watched from front porches they did not seem upset by all the strangers michael felicis , who lives next to the collados , said to us , it s not a problem we 're happy with this another neighbor , vincent alba , 71 , said some people on the street were upset late last week , but now they 're resigned to this he said he did not mind the commotion if some drew religious strength from it one of today s visitors , laraine colucci , 60 , of north plainfield , nj , said she believed the window held the same image that juan diego , an aztec convert to christianity , saw in the hills outside mexico city in 1531 the virgin of guadalupe ms colucci said she was hospitalized by a stroke for seven days last year it was through her intercession that i made a complete recovery , she said i have a tremendous amount of devotion and i wanted to be a part of this i think there s a message that has to be brought to the people look at the way the world is going god wants his people back like others who came today , mr rivas , the visitor from carteret , said he was struck that the window displayed colors from the outside and yet looked only misty from inside the apartment i can vaguely see the mother of jesus from the outside and from the inside i ca n't see anything , mr rivas said it s the first time in my whole life i 've seen something like this another visitor , thomas connelly , a 48yearold salesman of lab equipment , stopped by washington street while returning from a business trip to manhattan mr connelly did not seem quite convinced in 1992 , he said , he had visited the marlboro home that attracted thousands after the owner , joseph januszkiewicz , said mary appeared near his backyard spruce trees on the first sunday of each month when i was there i got an emotional feeling and smelled the scent of roses , he said after looking for minutes at the window i do n't get that same feeling i had in marlboro the window s very vivid in color , but i do n't know what to look for i can see kind of a face if i imagine it photos inside , the window appears misty outside , changing colors reveal the face of mary , some say \( richard perry the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) crowds have been gathering to pray the rosary at an apartment in perth amboy , nj , where some say an image of the virgin

cleveland , march 15 six weeks ago , syracuse was 190 and seemed to be floating dreamily above the rim , if not the cloudsthe orangemen were the only undefeated men s team in division i , and all was right with the world shots went in without prayers fans poured on the praise and then the losing began when we were 190 , people were so high on us , now they 're totally writing us off , said forward ryan blackwell , one of three senior starters for syracuse from perfection and a no 4 ranking , the orangemen tumbled to mediocrity and no 16 , finishing 55 in their last 10 games , the latest one an inexplicable defeat to georgetown in the second round of the big east tournament , after sharing the regularseason conference title syracuse \( 245 \) slunk back to campus to retool its defense the hallmark of its perfect start and prepare for redemption in the first round of the national collegiate athletic association tournament but talk of early exits and upsets follows syracuse here in the midwest regional , where the orangemen are seeded no 4 last year , syracuse , then no 8 , lost to no 9 oklahoma state in the first round the orange s firstround opponents this year the no 13 samford bulldogs describe themselves as a more uptempo princeton , only with better athletes people are looking at that samfordsyracuse game as prime for an upset , blackwell said we are out to prove something it s definitely a motivational factor that s the way it is in this sport when you 're winning , people love you but the orangemen lost their last two games , to connecticut in their regularseason finale and , with a horrible defensive showing , to georgetown in madison square garden and this with the top defensive player in the big east , center etan thomas , and jason hart , the point guard whom coach jim boeheim calls the best ontheball defender in conference history i do n't know why we played that way and i still have n't figured it out , boeheim said we just did n't come out with the intensity on defense that we had to have samford \( 2110 \) enters the tournament having won its last five games the bulldogs could not be shooting any better , leading the nation in fieldgoal percentage at 503 percent , averaging 97 3pointers a game , while befuddling opponents with backdoor cuts a la princeton samford , the trans america athletic conference champion , relishes its role as the plucky underdog unafraid , and realistic although samford defeated st john s in its first game of the season , coach jimmy tillette understands the relative difference i do n't think if we line up and play our best game and syracuse plays their best game that we 're going to win the game , tillette said there s got to be some things that have to go right for us and obviously the biggest variable is that we have to shoot the ball , which is what we 've done all year that is the perception for syracuse , which lost in the first round last year , in the regional semifinals to duke in 1998 and did not make the tournament a year after finishing as runnerup to kentucky in 1996 talk of firstround upsets baffles boeheim that s what people remember , that one time , boeheim said , referring to the loss to richmond in 1991 and to last year s we lost twice in the first round in the last 20 years i think i read an article , well , syracuse gets beat in the first round a lot' i did n't realize that two is a lot in 20 tries , but maybe it is in terms of its current slump , syracuse s 190 start might have given its players and fans a false sense of security none of its first 10 victories came against a team that made the ncaa tournament it s obvious we had a lot more easy games in the 19game stretch , boeheim said , although we won some games we probably would n't have had in the later 10game stretch despite the naysayers , syracuse s experience lends the orangemen a sense of confidence i wish they were a team not playing their best down the stretch and they were a younger team , tillette said , because they would always have next year to look forward to with the fact that they have seniors , they 're one and done samford remembers the feeling last year the bulldogs traveled to orlando for their first ncaa appearance and stayed on magic mountain the entire time , spotting their firstround opponent , st john s , a 150 lead when the game began last year we went to a party and a ncaa tournament broke out , tillette said it was a dreamlike season , and it was obvious because we sleptwalked through that game this year our guys want to come well and play better kentucky , winner of seven ncaa championships , two in the last four years , is seeded fifth in the region and comes to cleveland on a far different mission than syracuse or even samford the wildcats lost their fourthleading scorer and starting shooting guard , the sophomore desmond allison allison , 20 , was arrested early last sunday morning and charged with driving under the influence and marijuana possession coach tubby smith suspended him indefinitely we want to rally around him and this situation and adversity , said the sophomore saul smith but the wildcats \( 229 \) have only nine players on their roster , a depleted bench facing no 12 st bonaventure \( 219 \) i think the advantage is to st bonaventure coming into it , smith said our lack of depth is their strength photo

john avery , a tourist from birmingham , england , had only one complaint about his ride through manhattan in a new york apple tours doubledecker bus yesterday the roads need repairs , mr avery grumbled after a bumpy 40minute ride from west 57th street to west fourth street mr avery , 62 , was among the hundreds of tourists who boarded the nearly 60 apple tours buses on the road yesterday it was the company s second day of operation since a panel of state appellate judges on monday rebuffed city and state efforts to sideline the buses while regulators try to shut down the company but mr avery , in town with his wife , sue , did not care about apple tours s problems with the city or its safety record all he cared about was the view of the empire state building from the top level of the bus we wanted to be able to see everything , he said and you ca n't do that from the subway the company , which has been cited for hundreds of regulatory and safety violations in its nine years of carrying tourists around the city , became a primary target of city and state authorities after may 22 , when one of its buses struck and killed a 71yearold actor at 45th street and ninth avenue in clinton gov george e pataki issued an order pulling the registration of the company s 63 buses pending the outcome of an administrative hearing the city had begun before the accident in an effort to shut down apple tours the city was acting on complaints that many apple tours drivers did not have commercial driver s licenses , that the buses were not environmentally certified and that they were being driven along cross streets , from which they are generally prohibited apple tours challenged the order , saying it violated the company s rights to due process on june 14 , a state supreme court judge in manhattan agreed , reversing the governor s order and appointing a former city official to monitor the company the city and state filed an appeal , which kept the buses off the streets and hundreds of apple tours employees out of work until the appellate court ruling on monday community advocates in clinton said they were planning to post fliers to warn tourists about apple tours s problems the times square business improvement district and new york city company , the city s visitors bureau , have removed new york apple tours brochures from their offices and from information packets given to tourists but none of the efforts seemed to keep the people away yesterday , the first day of one of the busiest tourist weekends most of the company s red doubledecker buses were on the street by 6 am by late morning , the buses packed with tourists were winding along crowded streets in neighborhoods like greenwich village and the rockefeller center area some in neighborhoods where apple tours has racked up violations were unhappy john fisher , who lives on west 45th street in clinton , said he was disheartened when he woke up yesterday morning to see an apple tours bus on his block the one thing that people need to understand is that this operation has not been given a clean bill of health , he said so , we 'll see photo employees of new york apple tours tried to draw customers yesterday for a sightseeing ride in manhattan \( edward keating the new york times \)
following are excerpts from mayor rudolph w giuliani s announcement yesterday at city hall of his withdrawal from the united states senate race , as recorded by the new york times thank you very , very much i'm a very fortunate man , and this is one demonstration of why i'm a very fortunate man god has given me a lot , and whatever obstacles that are placed in your way , i think the way to deal with it is to try to figure out how to make it , make it make you a better person the reason i'm such a fortunate man is that i have people that love me and i love them , and they care for me and i care for them and that s the greatest support that you can have in life when i was , when i was first told that i had cancer , i thought this was going to be a much easier decision i thought all of it was going to be easier i thought the decision about treatment would be made like i , you know , like i 've made lots of other decisions in my life , some of them real tough , none like this and i thought the decision about running would be sort of a calculation that you would make about how tired you would be or not be , and i 've found that it s much , much more difficult than that and i find myself unable to make , really make the treatment decision yet , even though i 've been over and over it and about the decision to run , i was almost in the same position , not being able to make it , which has never really happened to me i 've always been able to make decisions i 've also found in thinking about it , suffering over it , that something it s very painful and very difficult , but something very beautiful happens it makes you figure out what you 're really all about and what s really important to you and what should be important to you , you know , what , where the core of you really exists and i guess because i 've been in public life so long and politics , i used to think the core of me was in politics , probably it is n't i 've decided that what i should do is to put my health first and that i should devote the focus and attention that i should to running , to being able to figure out the best treatment , and not running for office this is not the right time for me to run for office if it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different , maybe it would be different but it is n't different and that s the way life is i do n't feel that if i take on the commitment to run , that i have the kind of confidence that i should have , that i 'd be the candidate that i should be i do n't know that i 'd be able to campaign the way i should i do n't know that i 'd be able to concentrate on it the way that i should and i do n't know completely whether in august or september that i 'd be able to continue you know , sometimes i think yes and sometimes i think no and it is n't right to take on that commitment if you do n't feel a strong sense of certitude that you can complete it so i called governor pataki and i called bill powers the chairman of the new york state republican party and i called joe bruno the state senate majority leader and many other people and i told them that i would not be able to make the race and that i would do anything that i could to help them support and assist the candidate that they support and that becomes the candidate of the party i called rick lazio and told him that if he s the candidate of the party , he can count on my help and my support and the focus that i'm going to have now is going to be of fighting cancer , making a decision about my treatment i'm not going to give daily updates about it and i'm not going to deal with it as a political matter i'm going to deal with it clearly and completely as a personal matter and you know , when i feel it s appropriate to announce a decision , since i'm the mayor of new york city , i certainly am going to announce it but i'm going to ask you to give me a little space to be able to make that decision properly i thank god that it gives me another , really another 18 months to be the mayor of new york city , which i love very , very much it s really my deep passion , the love for the people of this city and the love of this city and i'm going to devote the time that i 've been given , the extra time that i 've been given , not only to do the things we have done and the things that we 've accomplished together and the remarkable things that have been done , but to overcome , maybe , some of the barriers that maybe i placed there , and figure out how to overcome them i do n't know the answer to that yet , i do n't know exactly how you do that but i'm going to try very hard to do that many people in the city have felt a big change , a great sense of optimism they 've gotten a lot of help and they 've gotten a lot of benefits , and they feel very differently but it has n't reached everyone in this city and there are a lot of people that have n't felt that and i'm going to dedicate myself to trying to figure out how we can get them to feel that , too , including maybe changes i have to make in the way i approach it , the way i look at it it does n't mean there s going to be a new rudy i think that s silly i think maybe it s going to be a different , maybe somebody who grows from the fact that you confront your limits , you confront your mortality you realize you 're not a superman and you 're just a human being and in addition to turning my attention to straightening out the health situation , i'm going to try to make sure that i'm a better mayor , that this is a better administration and that it accomplishes the goal of , you know , reaching every person that we can reach and making sure that every new yorker feels that i'm dedicated to them , that i want to protect them , that i want to help them and that i want my time as mayor to count for everybody i have to express a tremendous sense of gratitude and even and i feel like i should apologize to the people that wanted me to run , the people that , when i went in last night to the town hall meeting and i saw the people outside saying , 'run , rudy , run , rudy , run , rudy , ' i had , you know , half the time last night i felt like i wanted to run and the half the time i felt like i should n't do it and when i stayed up last night i do n't usually sleep very much , so i did n't sleep very much last night at all and i stayed up last night going back and forth about what s the right decision and what is n't the right decision i believe this is the right decision and i think somehow , somewhere , some way this is all for the best and it s going to mean that i can be a better mayor
hempstead , ny , oct 27 aaron glenn was nearly begging , trying to prevail upon a few people to plead his case to coach al groh let me do a reverse , the cornerback said i do n't care if i'm a decoy i just want to play offense a couple of times i could line up and block i'm not even asking for the ball just let me run an out route you do n't even have to look at me perhaps glenn is somewhere down on groh s trickplay list , the one that has already had running back curtis martin throw a touchdown pass , cornerback marcus coleman line up as a receiver and catch a desperation pass , linebacker mo lewis run on a fake field goal and , perhaps most astonishing of all , the 6foot7inch , 305pound offensive tackle jumbo elliott making a bumbling , rumbling touchdown catch to send the jets' monday night game against the miami dolphins into overtime could anyone have imagined that behind groh s stern facade , which would fit an internal revenue service investigator , lies the heart of a guy dying to spin the roulette wheel \? honestly , no , said coleman , who became a receiver when quarterback vinny testaverde asked the coaches if he could have coleman on offense the call he made in new england , mo s run , i was standing right next to him he called it , it worked i patted him on the butt that s a gutsy call from a team standpoint , when you see your coach doing that , taking chances like that , he s trusting the players that they 'll make the plays all that does is give you more confidence in him groh is reluctant to take on the role of gambler , despite a playbook that has yielded almost one surprise a game his predecessor , bill parcells , liked to pull the occasional surprise , too , but nothing like this during training camp , groh had linebackers line up in the backfield on goalline situations that may be the only trick that failed the jets tried to complete a short touchdown pass to linebacker bryan cox during preseason , but he dropped the ball since then , though , it is as if groh had sprinkled pixie dust onto the playing field they 're not in there for any purpose other than they are plays in the system , groh said you lose a lot of money in the market and in casinos gambling you do well trying to play odds in your favor maybe it s my own validation of it , but i prefer to think of it in those terms none of the plays are an accident they are practiced repeatedly players teased martin during practice that he would tip off the opponent when he shucked the gloves he normally wears in preparation for throwing the ball martin s pass was wobbly and a photo showed that his hand was nowhere near the laces , but wayne chrebet was able to stretch to make the grab to beat the tampa bay buccaneers lewis said he had been shocked when groh called for his fourthdown run against the new england patriots , figuring that the play they had practiced , in which punter tom tupa takes the snap and pitches to lewis , would be kept in reserve for later weeks and elliott , the backup left tackle , may have caught the ball six out of seven times in practice , as coleman estimated , but he bobbled it almost as many times before clutching it to his chest as he hit the ground for the touchdown , and the first reception of his career i had to make an adjustment on the ball , elliott said , in jest it was swanlike martin said more important that i'm stunned that we did it is i'm surprised so many have worked usually you might get one out of every five trick plays that may work for us , they 're all working groh recalled that when he prepared to play don shulacoached dolphins teams , there was always the suspicion that miami would try an unusual play to get an edge trick plays not only terrify opposing teams , but they also demonstrate that a coach will try anything to win it seems like a special year , coleman said of the remarkable success the trick plays have had sometimes you can go out and line everybody up and beat everyone straight up but you do n't want to keep it the same all the time if it works in practice , it will work in the game we do n't just let it work in practice we definitely cover each other being open like that , you give yourself an edge i'm sure he 'll come up with something else extra points al groh continued to express disappointment with the play of the safeties , and a change could be coming scott frost , who has spelled the starter , kevin williams , at free safety the last two weeks , could replace williams as the starter , although groh would not reveal his plans both williams and frost were burned for big plays by the dolphins , as was strong safety victor green it s not just the freesafety situation , groh said the entire safety position has to play better photo jets cornerback aaron glenn \( 31 \) would like to play on offense this season , even if he is used only as a decoy \( barton silverman the new york times \)
trenton , oct 31 a new jersey judge dropped all charges today against two state troopers stemming from the 1998 shooting of three unarmed black and hispanic men during the traffic stop on the new jersey turnpike that made racial profiling a national issue the decision stunned prosecutors and outraged civil rights leaders , who have seen the case as a test of the state s determination to fight discrimination by the state police the troopers , john hogan and james kenna , had faced attempted murder and aggravated assault charges for firing 11 shots at the occupants of a van that they stopped on the turnpike in april 1998 but the judge dismissed all charges in the case today , ruling that prosecutors had violated the troopers' civil rights by taking so inappropriately adversarial an approach before the grand jury that the hearings were essentially a minitrial the judge also said prosecutors had tainted the grand jury deliberations in the shooting case by announcing that another grand jury had indicted the officers on charges that they had falsified records in an attempt to conceal a practice of singling out minority drivers today s ruling did not affect those charges members of society engaged in law enforcement deserve no less protection from the criminal justice system than that which is afforded to other citizens , said the judge , andrew j smithson of state superior court , as he handed down a 35page decision heavy with criticism of the prosecutor s actions but the judge s most pointed criticism was directed at a state supreme court justice , peter j verniero , who was state attorney general when several crucial decisions in the case were made judge smithson found that powerful and intimidating forces compelled prosecutors to announce the indictment in the falsified records case at the same time that the second grand jury was deliberating and the legislature was considering mr verniero s court appointment the motivation to allow the return of the indictments at that time was considerably more a matter of political expediency than of concern for the substantive rights of defendants hogan and kenna , he said , suggesting that the indictment was announced to quiet a frenzy of public interest in racial profiling gov christine todd whitman , who has been criticized for failing to heed complaints of racial profiling for two years before the shooting , said the state would appeal the ruling even if the appeal fails , the state attorney general can resubmit the evidence to a grand jury and ask for a new indictment civil rights leaders and lawyers for the shooting victims said they were so angered by the ruling that they would ask the federal justice department to take over the prosecution , as it did in the beating of abner louima in a new york police precinct house the rev reginald t jackson , executive director of the black ministers council of new jersey , said the judge s decision was the latest sign that the state government lacked both the ability and the resolve to address the problem of racial discrimination what is it that makes africanamericans , especially africanamerican men , still feared at large , especially when the officers are the ones with the guns \? mr jackson said they were trailed , they were stopped , they were pulled over because they were minorities they were suspects because they were minorities they were accused because they were minorities they were lied on because they were minorities and today this judge says none of that matters because the state did n't follow procedure three of the four occupants of the van were wounded by the gunfire and were treated at hospitals the ruling surprised many of those in the courtroom , and troopers hogan and kenna appeared emotional as the judge read his decision as he walked out of the courthouse , trooper hogan said only , i'm happy for my family and myself only last week , prosecutors withdrew attempted murder charges against trooper hogan because a witness had recently corroborated his claim of selfdefense legal experts said it was unusual for judges to grant dismissals because of prosecutorial misconduct , but the decision , while embarrassing to the state , did not end the troopers' legal problems they still face charges of official misconduct the other grand jury accused them of changing arrest records to conceal the fact that many of the drivers they stopped were black prosecutors may also seek to reinstate the aggravated assault and attempted murder charges that judge smithson dropped today i do n't know that the cost is actually that devastating , because they can go back to a grand jury and seek a new indictment , said frank askin , a law professor at rutgers university jack arsenault , the lawyer for trooper kenna , said he was gratified by today s ruling but expected the legal battles to drag on it s important for everyone to understand that there s no joy in this , mr arsenault said this is a continuing tragedy , and it s far from over

san francisco , june 30 the oracle corporation , the world s secondlargest software publisher , said tonight that raymond lane , its president and chief operating officer , had abruptly resigned mr lane , 53 , had been at oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996 though he was the secondranking executive in one of silicon valley s most powerful companies , he has always been overshadowed by oracle s flamboyant chief executive and cofounder , lawrence j ellison mr lane s departure came just days after the company admitted that it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival , the microsoft corporation , in an effort to prove that microsoft was secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the federal antitrust lawsuit against it the spying operation led to several exposes based on documents that were supplied to reporters at the new york times , the wall street journal and the washington post in a short statement announcing mr lane s departure , oracle gave no indication why mr lane had chosen to resign mr lane made no public statement today and could not be reached tonight mr lane will continue to serve on oracle s board of directors , the company said i am grateful to ray for all of his efforts , mr ellison said in a statement he will be missed we wish him nothing but the best an oracle spokeswoman , jennifer glass , declined to comment on why mr lane was leaving his post but she said his departure was not due to the microsoft controversy it is absolutely unrelated , she said , to the events that exploded this week when oracle executives admitted the company had hired the washington detective firm of investigative group international in an effort to link microsoft to public relations efforts in its behalf during the trial mr lane s departure has been rumored for months tonight , several people familiar with the company s internal strategy said that mr lane s role has decreased in the past year and that mr ellison has increasingly guided the company in a direction different from the one advocated by mr lane
first came the flashing video images then the dancers in psychedelic body paint , the new age pianist , the opera singer in a white fur stole who descended on a construction crane and three men in gas masks who banged on garbage cans to disco music white smoke billowed finally , the lights went up to reveal the boys choir of harlem , singing spirituals this sumptuous show last fall at the hammerstein ballroom in manhattan represented the avantgarde not of theater but of internet hype it introduced a new home page and ad campaign by altavista , the search engine , to about 100 journalists and wall street analysts , and laid the groundwork for an initial public offering altavista prompted by its new owner , cmgi , one of the most successful incubators of internet companies promised to take on yahoo with a portal as powerful and immediate as life itself to do so , it would spend 120 million on a new slogan , smart is beautiful these days , that strategy does not look very smart , and the prospects for the cmgi empire are not very beautiful hopes for altavista s offering were dashed by the tumble in internet stocks last spring cmgi is closing other units , laying off employees and facing tough questions about the viability of the business behind the flashing lights and neweconomy rhetoric in recent weeks , an increasing number of investors , analysts and even cmgi executives have wondered aloud whether david s wetherell , cmgi s chairman , founder and driving force , was too emboldened by his early success largely investments in some pioneering internet companies that earned stratospheric returns now that the market will not let him profit by taking companies public , these skeptics are asking whether cmgi has the vision , strategy and management skill to make its sprawling portfolio worth even the sum of its parts cmgi was the ultimate bull market creation , said gene derose , president of jupiter media metrix , the research company cmgi , he said , claimed credit for what was just extraordinary good luck it epitomizes strategy in hindsight , he added , rather than a disciplined process for incubating and managing companies mr wetherell , 46 , says the company is taking the steps that are needed to thrive in tough times our foundation is solid and mission is clear , he wrote by email after five years of hypergrowth , we , like the market over all , are taking a step back planning the coming steps and phases that can and will maximize growth and enhance investor support a year ago , cmgi was the model incubator , a new corporate creature somewhere between a conglomerate and a venture capital fund it started some companies , invested in others and kept operating control of many , hoping to take all of them public mr wetherell was hailed as the warren buffett of the web , by the daily news of new york , and cmgi ended 1999 with a market value of 41 billion it was the bestperforming united states stock of the preceding five years , returning 4 , 921 percent in its fiscal year ended july 2000 , cmgi lost 14 billion on revenue of 898 million today , cmgi s main companies , like alta vista and engage technologies , an internet advertising business , are scaling back the chief executives of both of those companies resigned recently smaller companies are being sold or merged and cmgi s shares are off 91 percent this year , to a value of about 38 billion , closing on friday at 1194 a year and a half ago , people were saying this was the best business model ever , said vik mehta , an analyst at goldman sachs now the financial markets are telling them they will go out of business mr wetherell , whose 112 percent stake in cmgi is now worth just 430 million , still has defenders they say he is a tough executive with an eye for financial detail , but he also understood that the early days of the internet demanded growth , not profits most people thought he came by all this by accident , but he is a guy who has been very thoughtful and very strategic early on , said david bohnett , cofounder and former chairman of geocities , the online community that was one of cmgi s greatest successes you ca n't blame him for taking advantage of the opportunities in a bull market mr wetherell declined to be interviewed for this article , choosing instead to answer some questions by email and he ordered many cmgi directors and executives not to respond to interview requests but more than 20 current or former directors and executives , all of whom insisted on anonymity , were willing to discuss cmgi and mr wetherell several former employees also took the risk of speaking , despite the confidentiality provisions that cmgi regularly writes into its severance agreements they , too , requested anonymity from those interviews , a new picture emerges not so much of a company working from a visionary blueprint but of one in which decisions on everything from hiring to strategy are made on the spur of the moment and reversed just as fast many moves were made largely to generate optimistic news releases , helping the stock to surge , the executives said
sometimes the most engrossing television is also the hardest to watch , and that is certainly the case with wellfounded fear , which opens a new season of the pov series on pbs tonight the twohour documentary by shari robertson and michael camerini takes an amazingly unflinching look at the process for seeking political asylum in the united states the viewer who sticks with it ends up rewarded but deeply rattled , on several levels the filmmakers managed to get permission from the immigration and naturalization service to record the secretive hearings at which the fates of asylum seekers are decided , and they have fleshed out those vignettes with interviews of both the applicants and the hearing officers the mix of emotions at play is dramatic the strength of this film is that it is largely left to speak for itself , and that requires work on the viewer s part from a sheer technical standpoint the film is not one that can be watched casually , while paying the bills or whatever it jumps abruptly from case to case , and when the asylum seekers talk , there are subtitles \( to show the often alarming contrast between what they said and what the translators tell the hearing officers they said \) but what truly makes this a difficult film is the discomfort and dismay it makes the viewer feel hearing the asylum seekers' tales of woe is only one part of this , though a big part throw a dart at a map of the world , it seems , and there is an excellent chance of hitting a spot where people are arrested , persecuted , abused for scant reason algeria , romania , china , sudan americans take everything for granted , one asylum seeker says they have no clue what s out there this is wrong , of course americans know full well the beauty of the freedoms they enjoy but even the most attuned american will be distressed anew at this stark reminder of how so many others live the most gripping part of wellfounded fear , though , is not the tales of the applicants but the portraits of those who have to decide whether those stories are true and whether they merit asylum the hearing officers here speak with rare candor they know how imperfect , almost random , the process is , and how their own prejudices affect it they talk about how they are more likely to approve an applicant who is well educated , about how they sometimes have to resist the impulse to hug the person across the table they talk about how when they started on the job all of the stories sounded true , but now none do wellfounded fear leaves us wanting to know more about these heroic and , it sometimes seems , heartless people how are they recruited and trained \? how do they adjust to drab domestic life after such a wrenching day \? it also leaves us wondering about the asylum process what finally lands applicants in the hearing office , when some have been living comfortably in this country for years \? mostly , though , this film leaves us sighing at the great disconnect that we see so often between high ideals and oneonone reality the ideal of dignified care for the terminally ill comes down to finding people willing to change bedpans the ideal of feeding the hungry comes down to people willing to work soup lines and the ideal of having the united states be a place of refuge comes down to a snap judgment in a hearing room , based on fuzzy stories told across a language barrier they stay fuzzy forever , one hearing officer says , and we still have to make a decision based on fuzziness pov wellfounded fear pbs , tonight at 9 \( channel 13 in new york \) michael camerini and shari robertson , producers and directors mr camerini , camera music by mark suozzo karen schmeer , suzanne pancrazi and christopher osborn , editors john dildine , sound for pov cara mertes , executive producer the series is produced by american documentary inc ellen schneider , executive director ward chamberlin , chief executive officer photo asylum seekers waiting to be interviewed in wellfounded fear \( leo hsu pov \)
the doctor by patricia duncker 375 pp new york ecco press 24 patricia duncker s second novel tells the story of a niece of the english painter james barry who , at the age of 10 , was dressed as a boy , given her uncle s name and packed off to medical school , then became a military surgeon and passed as male for the rest of her life duncker , whose first novel , hallucinating foucault , won britain s mckitterick prize , bases the doctor on historical fact james miranda barry , born at the end of the 18th century , has been the subject of several biographies as well as of a previous novel apparently , however , the facts are ambiguous , enabling duncker to use her novel to explore not only this one life but also the nature of historical truth in the process , she completely invents a major character , changes the life spans of several real figures and , for his last posting , places dr barry in jamaica , not canada none of this is especially shocking after all , works of historical fiction must still function as fiction , being guided as much by their own inner necessities and their author s imaginative extravagance as by fact told in six parts , the doctor alternates between the first and third person , and between the present and past tense it braves an opening exploration of barry s childhood in the firstperson present tense and generally succeeds in suggesting a narrator whose act of remembering , though couched in the language of an adult , is at the mercy of a child s earliest perceptions , with all the hallucinatory vividness and blind spots we expect of a child these opening sections culminate in the 10yearold s first ball , for which her mother wants her to wear a dress fighting for the right to remain interesting , she refuses and bowls everyone over by appearing in smart blue regimentals custommade for the occasion the next day , the men of her freethinking family , recognizing her unique abilities , ask if she 'd like to attend medical school disguised as a male you 'd be wasted as a woman join the men , one of them tells her her \? at this point , it might be best to adopt the novel s convention and refer to its central character as him , for duncker has a point to make gender , she informs us in myriad ways , is a question not of biological destiny but of performance and dr barry s performance over a long and successful medical career survives the expected perils the nearmiss exposures whose occasions range from uninvited grasps at his anatomy to the tendency of women to fall madly in love with him to the many duels he successfully fights much of this is delightful fun the doctor is written with spirit and a good heart its historical details are rich and authentic , and its tone combines sensory immediacy and ironic detachment part 4 , which describes the diminutive and rather formal dr barry s stint as chief medical officer on an unnamed britishcontrolled island in the mediterranean , is especially good here , his sexual misadventures with the governor s daughter , his visit to a miraculous monastery , his collaboration with the local witch and the courageous battle he fights against a devastating cholera epidemic all make for lively reading yet readers may wonder why the palpable sense of the past that one expects from historical fiction seems largely to be missing from the novel in part this is deliberate duncker s running metaphors involve theater and the art of performance the places in her book often look like stage sets , and dr barry , we are constantly reminded , plays a role he has scripted for himself but in part this is accidental , an effect of the novel s often inattentive language firstperson narrators or other characters inform us that the heat one summer beat all previous records or that a relative suffers from paranoid fantasies such anachronisms are hardly playfully postmodern , as are those in charles johnson s middle passage or thomas pynchon s mason dixon they are simply lapses but the biggest lapse of all is the one major character not based on historical fact , a shropshire servant named alice jones when barry meets this girl , who is tall as wild nettles with hips slender and supple , they fall in love , and in one especially breathless passage their youthful passion is paraphrased by the song of songs slowly , he reached out and turned the ring gently in her ear she put her fingers over his and smiled at the chill of his touch come into the garden , my sister , my love behold , thou art fair , my love also our bed is green the beams of our house are of chestnut and the rafters of willows and fir let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth , for thy love is better than wine nothing contained in this scene suggests that it was written with a wink from her first appearance , alice either stretches our belief or makes us squirm in a crucial oversight , her language is bleached of any historical markers , of any class or regional dialect even at the end after she s become a legendary actress and she and dr barry , now in his 60 s , have set up house together she utters such clunkers as i was a big star and what a bitch ! to cap it all off , she delivers a lecture straight out of a late20thcentury english department about the performative nature of reality perhaps duncker wishes to avoid the pitfalls of what one historical novelist has called gadzookery the stumbling about of characters uttering quaint tidbits in a painted environment but in doing so she has fallen into a pitfall of the opposite sort a character who sounds like a refugee from the sitcom next door the final passages of the doctor contain a series of letters written after dr barry s death in which his true gender is revealed to the press and denied by surviving friends then , in the novel s one unequivocally postmodern invention , a journalist shows up to settle the matter once and for all by interviewing alice jones this journalist turns out to be henrietta stackpole , fresh from henry james s portrait of a lady , who decides to write alice s version of dr barry s story for american readers as a marvelous narrative , filled with secrecy , passion and adventure in other words , as something not unlike duncker s novel some readers will find this sendup of the author s own fictional devices immensely playful and entertaining others will feel robbed , will think that this very talented writer is trying to have it both ways and will lament so belated a deconstruction of her own fondness for the trappings of romance

this act was calculated and unprovoked , the parole board said in its decision today you had planned this crime for a protracted period of time and it is apparent that you were obsessed in causing fatal harm to john lennon in addition to being an international celebrity , mr lennon was a husband and a father of two young children neither of lennon s sons , julian , who was 17 at the time of the murder , and sean , who was 5 , were present in attica today but among the television vans lined up across the street from the castlelike walls of the prison , one fan kept a vigil the fan , kristy

nothing is recorded about the life of a slave named jack who belonged to a woodbridge family beyond what is marked on a headstone in the cemetery of the first presbyterian church , which dates his death at 1825 the original stone was crumbling and in danger of disintegrating completely until robert j mcewen , cemetery superintendent , church elder and local historian , raised money to replace it with a duplicate the old stone was moved inside the church jack s grave is on the edge of the small church cemetery , where it was once isolated from those of white parishioners , although it is now surrounded by more modern graves mr mcewen talked recently the headstone and about woodbridge s past q why did you save this headstone \? a this is a part of woodbridge s history , although not necessarily a proud part jack s owner was jonathan freeman , who was a carpenter who built the first presbyterian church that was erected in 1803 to replace the original one built in 1675 we are one of the six oldest congregations in new jersey and woodbridge is one of the six original towns founded in what was then east jersey and west jersey the freeman family was a prominent family in town and jonathan and other family members are buried in the church cemetery jonathan freeman must have had a great deal of respect for jack to bury him in the church cemetery and erect a decorated headstone the headstone says , 'jf in memory of jack a colourd man who belonged to jonathan freeman he was a faithful servant and died july 23 , 1825 , in the 43rd yr of his age' the initials j f at the top probably stand for jonathan freeman and the stone is decorated down the side , which would have been elaborate for a slave q what was woodbridge like at that time \? a woodbridge is now 27 square miles at that time it was twice that size and had about 3 , 000 residents the small town center was surrounded by farms new jersey passed a law in 1786 banning the importation of slaves after 1804 , children of slaves were to be freed when males turned 25 and females turned 20 in 1800 there were about 300 slaves here , but the number gradually declined until 1820 there were less than 100 and by the outbreak of the civil war there were none for years this was a summer resort community there were bath houses lining the beach in sewaren on what was then known as boynton beach presidents vacationed here there are oil tanks there now q what else is in the cemetery \? a our oldest headstone is from 1690 and we believe some people were buried here before that the headstone for the first person born in woodbridge is here next to jack s grave is buried a black civil war soldier named cpl joseph williams who was in the united states colored infantry , but there is no indication of when he was born , died or was interred , which is typical of monuments for all civil war soldiers we replaced one other headstone that of rev dr axel roe , who was pastor of the church for 52 years and fought in the revolutionary war next i want to replace the headstone of jonathan freeman the grave of captain nathaniel fitz randolph , who was a revolutionary war hero , also is here his headstone was apparently used as target practice by the british because it has bullet holes in it there are a couple of hundred old brownstone markers and we think we lost about that many already brownstone was a common material for markers back then unfortunately , we cannot save all of the old headstones that are crumbling karen demasters photo robert j mcewen by the newly replaced headstone of a slave in a woodbridge church graveyard \( dith pran the new york times \)
mount kumgang , north korea a few miles north of the demilitarized zone that has divided the korean peninsula for nearly a halfcentury , the largest corporation from the enemy south has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to install deepwater docks , build a domed theater and a spa with a glass atrium , pave roads and string electric cables it has plans for a 1 , 000room seaside hotel , a 45hole golf course and a ski slope and it has done all this with the approval of north korea s reclusive communist leaders many years could pass for the hyundai group to even begin to recoup its bet on the future of tourism at the base of mount kumgang , where sternfaced soldiers in olivedrab uniforms keep constant vigil and the only practical mode of transportation is by foot a gasoline station , built by hyundai to accommodate tourist vehicles , seems oddly premature but the investment by hyundai , which could reach 1 billion or more , is more than just a bet on tourism something the north only recently sanctified as part of a gradual thawing of relations it is the biggest business risk taken so far on the notion that north and south nominally still at war will peacefully reunite jang whan bin , director of investor relations for hyundai s asan subsidiary , is a positive thinker we believe the mutual trust that we establish in becoming business partners with north korea will not only help improve relations between the two countries but also lead to lucrative business opportunities in the long term , said mr jang , whose company oversees the parent s operation in the north when the north and south are eventually integrated , mr jang added , we believe koreans will remember that hyundai helped play a role in reunification , and that memory has broad applications for business hyundai is now the sole operator of sightseeing tours for south koreans , who arrive on its cruise ships at the port of changjon , where the company built docking installations the cruise ships , which hyundai has been operating since november 1998 , depart from south korean ports hyundai s effort to develop mount kumgang , one of the most spectacular landscapes on the korean peninsula , has been welcomed by south korean and western corporate executives many of them have been trying to figure out for years how to develop commercial relations with the repressive leadership of a country weakened by prolonged isolation and painful food shortages hyundai has become a de facto ambassador to north korea , and everyone is watching with bated breath to see what they can achieve , said james rooney , chief executive of templeton investments in seoul , the south korean capital after 50 years of military threats from north korea , if hyundai can be a catalyst for peace , help reunite separated families , and put rice on the tables of starving people , south koreans view that as far more important than investors earning an extra buck a share , mr rooney said templeton has no investments in hyundai moreover , many business leaders said economic integration would help stabilize north korea and enable it to better feed its more than 20 million people , who will one day offer a lucrative market opportunity , just as south korea did a generation or two ago but not everyone agrees that hyundai is wise to invest so heavily in a country where the risks seem to far outweigh the potential payoff i admire what hyundai is doing in north korea , said a seoul fund manager whose portfolio has substantial hyundai stock , but the bottom line is that these projects are highly risky and offer little hope for significant financial return our money would be better spent on another investment , but so far none of our clients are complaining because it s difficult to publicly criticize what hyundai is trying to do , said the fund manager , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the subject is politically sensitive hyundai has been the most aggressive company in pursuing the socalled sunshine policy of south korea s president , kim dae jung actively engaging north korea as a way of hastening reunification on the peninsula president kim lifted restrictions on travel and trade with the north to encourage liberalization there the driving force behind hyundai s expansion into north korea has been its billionaire founder , chung ju yung , the son of a poor farmer in tonchon , in kangwon province in north korea mr chung has made numerous visits to the north and is said to have met with the country s leader , kim jong il in addition to the mount kumgang tours , hyundai has announced plans to build an industrial complex to make consumer products after 10 years of onagain , offagain negotiations , north korea gave hyundai permission to begin the tours in november 1998 under an agreement , hyundai estimates that it will pay north korea a total of 942 million in royalties to operate the tours through 2005 , when the deal is to be renegotiated the royalty figure is based on a formula under which hyundai pays north korea a fee of 100 a day for each tourist since 1998 , about 150 , 000 people have taken these trips hyundai estimates that over the length of the contract , an average of 500 , 000 people a year will visit the mountain region for at least three days
the internal revenue service is on a collision course with an indianapolis church , one of a small but growing number of new testament churches that say they are not subject to federal tax laws requiring employers to withhold income , social security and medicare taxes from workers the confrontation comes at a time when the irs has been reluctant to seize property to collect back taxes the church , however , is eager to establish what it believes are its rights by forcing the irs to act eventually , the irs must foreclose on the indianapolis baptist temple or find a way to avoid enforcing a federal judge s ruling last july that the church owes 59 million in taxes , penalties and interest for 1988 to 1992 the church has planned a demonstration in downtown indianapolis on saturday to protest the ruling , and says it expects as many as 2 , 000 members and supporters to march between two federal buildings the church s pastor , gregory j dixon , said the 1 , 000 members would be peaceful and sgt paul ciesielski , a spokesman for the police , said he did not expect any difficulty with church members the case has caught the attention of conservative radio talk shows and rightwing paramilitary organizations , including the michigan militia , whose commander , norman e olson , has pledged to help the church resist foreclosure mr dixon , 67 , said the people who worked at the church were not employees and called the money they received love gifts on which the church could not withhold taxes most of the workers , about 60 people , had their tax returns audited , he said , but none had a significant adjustment to their tax bills he said that they had paid the taxes on their own , but that the irs refunded the half of their social security and medicare taxes normally paid by an employer , telling them it should have been paid by the church mr dixon accused the irs of fabricating an issue by returning the payroll taxes and then taking the church to court to collect them he said the agency was interfering with the church s first amendment rights in her ruling last july , judge sarah evans barker of federal district court said that requiring a church to withhold taxes on money paid to its pastor , teachers , secretaries , janitors and others did not interfere with free exercise of religion unfortunately for the church , judge barker wrote , the supreme court does not share its creative interpretations of the first amendment , making resolution of this issue straightforward the church , in its newsletter the trumpet , said judge barker has literally declared war on christ and his church the irs would not comment beyond stating that federal law required all employers to withhold taxes judge barker had stayed foreclosure on the church s chapel , school and parsonage , which are appraised at 8 million , so the church could take its case to the united states court of appeals in chicago last month , at the request of the justice department , she modified her order , requiring the church to withhold taxes and turn them over to the court , to be held in escrow , if it wanted to stay foreclosure while it appealed we will not comply , mr dixon said in an interview we cannot because we are subject only to the authority of our lord jesus christ refusal to put the money in escrow is likely to speed the foreclosure process , which otherwise could drag on for months or years in the courts mr dixon described churches that issue receipts for gifts and withhold taxes from workers as statelicensed churches and said that the irs has declared that the only legal religion in america is irsapproved religion requiring the collection of taxes , he said , violates our religious liberty and what this means is the end of religious freedom in america the church s lawyer , albert r cunningham , who is also a pastor in redding , calif , said he represented about 200 new testament congregations , which believe that the separation of church and state is absolute new testament congregations do not register as nonprofit organizations and discourage members from claiming a charitable deduction on their tax returns for contributions to the church none of the churches withhold taxes , mr cunningham said indianapolis baptist temple is the only church facing foreclosure for its actions it complied with federal tax laws from its founding in 1950 until 1983 , mr dixon said but then he became convinced that the church had sinned the name of the church corporation was changed to not a church , inc and then dissolved ownership of the church s real estate was transferred to mr dixon as a trustee he said the property belonged to god judge barker took note of these and other arguments , writing that the church apparently believes it can evade federal tax law by metamorphosing into various different forms of entity on this , she said , it is sadly mistaken although defendant s tactics may have resulted in enough confusion to cause the irs to use an incorrect employee identification number in assessing its tax liabilities , such tactics do not save defendant from the harsh ramifications it now faces as a result of years of tax evasion while mr dixon was once national secretary of the moral majority , he said he had since parted from the organization s founder , the rev jerry falwell mr dixon said he had not filed a personal tax return since 1983 because he believed he was not required to do so photos facing foreclosure in a tax dispute , the indianapolis baptist temple is trying to establish what it says are its rights by forcing the irs to act gregory j dixon says his church s property belongs to god \( photographs by mary ann carter for the new york times \)
the disclosure last weekend sounded like a wired consumer s nightmare a technical lapse at western union left its cashtransfer web site vulnerable to hackers , and someone downloaded credit and debit card numbers for about 15 , 700 customers western union was advising them all to cancel their cards and start fresh , just in case coming on the heels of a fraudulentbilling verdict in los angeles against operators of a pornography web site who had bought access to thousands of credit card numbers from a california bank , the incident at western union left many consumers wondering whether credit cards and the internet were a safe combination despite the occasional highprofile breaches , though , credit cards remain a very secure way to make internet purchases , experts say in fact , incidents of credit card data being compromised by an online transaction are far outnumbered by reports of fraud connected with other online internet activities , like auctions that said , though , there are precautions that internet users can take to reduce the risk of credit card fraud , just as there are in brickandmortar commerce and consumer concerns about security are prompting the development of new technology to protect online payments figures are scarce for security breaches at ecommerce sites , in part because companies are reluctant to publicize such incidents , and because consumers tend to report credit card problems directly to even tighterlipped card issuers still , several organizations track complaints about internetrelated fraud in general , and the credit card variety ranks low on the list the internet fraud complaint center , an fbilinked organization in morgantown , w va , said card fraud accounted for just 48 percent of the complaints it received since it opened in may ten times as many complaints 488 percent involved online auctions , while 192 percent involved goods ordered online that never arrived and 169 percent had to do with securities and commodities trading internet fraud watch , sponsored by the national consumers league , reported a higher proportion 95 percent of the complaints it received in the first six months of 2000 but that figure included all problems with credit card purchases , not just compromised card numbers we 've never received a complaint from a consumer about their credit card number being stolen during a secure transaction , said holly anderson , a spokeswoman for the organization most highprofile incidents of online credit card theft including the western union case and a january incident in which a list of 350 , 000 credit card numbers was stolen from a music site , cd universe have occurred because companies failed to protect their files from hackers in the western union incident , the company attributed the security breach to human error , the digital equivalent of leaving the keys to the customer database dangling in the lock , where they could be found and used by anyone who knew how elias levy , chief technology officer at securityfocuscom , an internet security company , said that even though more attention was being paid to security issues , the number of incidents in which credit card data is compromised was likely to increase as more businesses and individuals go online mr levy said many web sites' security audits were not thorough enough to find problems a situation he attributed to the absence of severe consequences for failure to maintain tight security the ecommerce industry resists government regulation but has generally been unsuccessful at regulating itself , he said , so the credit card companies themselves need to force the vendors to implement security measures american express and visa have taken several measures in recent months intended to encourage internet merchants to adopt stricter security and to provide consumers with more secure payment options on sept 7 , american express announced a new private payments service that is rather like having a disposable credit card customers who use the free service , which the company said would be available within a month , will register on american express s own web site , enter a name , password and account number , and obtain a singleuse private payment number that temporary number is used in place of the customer s real credit card number when making a purchase online because it expires as soon as the transaction clears , it is of no use to anyone who intercepts it or retrieves it later from a database american express uses a different approach with its blue card , introduced earlier this year a smartcard reader , supplied by the company , is attached to a consumer s home computer and works in much the same way as a card reader at a supermarket checkout , authenticating transactions when a pin number is typed in visa followed suit last week with a similar smartcard technology but visa is not following amex s lead toward singleuse numbers as an alternative instead , according to jim mccarthy , senior vice president for member and merchant sales at evisa , the ecommerce unit of visa usa , the company is testing a payer authentication technology that it hopes will be the electronic equivalent of a customer s signature on a sales receipt
there s an old saying on wall street never fall in love with your assets what this really means is that you should be willing to trade everything you own for a price most collectors are too sentimental about their antiques to part with them readily , but a few collectors do when they do , it is often for an unexpected reason , not greed this seems to be the case with virginia ramseypope cave , an american folk art collector and former dealer from dorset , vt on aug 5 , mrs cave is selling her personal folk art collection the contents of her house and barn at northeast auctions in manchester , nh she has promised 10 percent of the proceeds to the museum of american folk art , whose new building is under construction at 45 west 53rd street in manhattan this is part of her effort , as head of a committee drawn from the folkart trade , to raise 1 million for the museum s new library mrs cave is retiring to manhattan after spending 25 years in the business and rearing five children this sale is the culmination of my years as a student , dealer and collector in this field , she said these things have been part of my life in vermont putting them back on the market was the best thing to do with them you cannot skim the top i'm selling it all it is n't that i 've lost my affinity for american folk art it s just that that part of my life is over ralph o esmerian , chairman of the museum s board , explained , the museum is an important part of her focus he pointed out that it had raised only 24 million of 34 million needed for the entire project we 've raised enough to build the building , he said as for the library , the trade loved the idea of being related to the scholarship side of the museum the 400 items for sale range widely in content and quality virginia loves things that are artful and serious as well as things that make her smile , said allan katz , a folk art dealer in woodbridge , conn , who sold her some of the toys in the sale she has an impeccable eye the sale includes antique card tables , shaker chests of drawers , whirligigs , appliqued coverlets , hooked rugs , weather vanes , blanket chests and game boards i used to buy things wherever i went , mrs cave recalled when i had a house in georgia , i would just get in the car and go , for fun i even bought folk art in london , at the olympia fair the catalog prepared for mrs cave by northeast auctions has few estimates most lots will be sold without a reserve , the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the auction house that makes it nice , honest and clean , mr katz said i think the sale will do exceedingly well there is an absolute shortage of material , and she has n't held anything back it s extremely unusual to have no reserves when a seller is still alive mrs cave has also been careful to list the provenances on most items ronald bourgeault , the auctioneer who owns northeast auctions and a longtime friend of mrs cave s , said , virginia wanted to have everyone s name in the catalog , including all the dealers and people in the trade , because they are the ones who will use the new library at the folk art museum mr bourgeault added that he planned to donate part of his commission to the museum as well the more the excitement about the sale grows , the more i think i'm going to give , he said one of the best lots , acquired from the manhattan gallery america hurrah , is a pair of miniature painted whirligigs in the form of a man and woman each wears a green and brown outfit and has green paddle arms the figures , which had belonged to the collector ben mildwoff , were auctioned at sotheby s to a private collector , barry cohen , who then gave them to america hurrah , which sold them to mrs cave in good condition and with great charm , they are expected to sell for 40 , 000 to 60 , 000 a carved and painted noah s ark , with an army of 200 animals and figures , was originally acquired from mr katz these were primarily religious toys , he said they were the only toys that could be used on sundays because they were biblical this one is either german or pennsylvania german and is in wonderful shape the estimate is 4 , 000 to 6 , 000 folk art paintings include an oil by franklin howard bullis \( 18611937 \) depicting the passenger steamer vermont approaching the port kent dock on lake champlain a vermont pennant and an american flag snap sharply in the wind beneath a blue sky dotted with scudding white clouds a large ketch sails by the dock , which has kegs on it a train chugs toward burlington , barely visible in the background it s rare to find vermont depicted in folk art , mrs cave said vermont was not as sophisticated as massachusetts or new york she acquired the painting from timothy j stevenson , a former dealer , and his partner , phyllis carlson , in vermont the estimate is 6 , 000 to 8 , 000 one of the most spectacular quilts in the sale is a 77by92inch pieced and appliqued floral and feather coverlet signed annie sanford in ink its center has six large blocks , each depicting red roses and teal blue leaves and stems on a white ground the border has a meandering motif of stylized flowers and feathers i'm a gardener , so i'm attracted to floral quilts , mrs cave said , but one with this french blue is very unusual the auction house offers neither a date nor an estimate , but since the quilt appears to be in good condition and is signed , it may be valuable one of the highest estimates in the sale , 40 , 000 to 60 , 000 , has been placed on a copper goddess of liberty weather vane with the label of j w fiske iron works of new york , from about 1880 to 1893 this 17inchtall gilded goddess wears a liberty cap decorated with a laurel wreath and holds an american flag with pierced stars and stripes according to the catalog , it was found near contoocook , nh , and acquired by mrs cave from david a schorsch , a dealer in woodbury , conn fiske produced castiron garden ornaments , benches and copper weather vanes for decades , which makes one wonder if such a massproduced piece is truly a work of art none of these things were thought of as art when they were made , mr esmerian said they were functional and part of the daily lives of the people who built this country we call it folk art , but they made these things for domestic use and practical purposes fiske weather vanes were made to tell the direction of the wind the makers took the time to make them special it does n't matter if there were 20 made it s not only the unique object that we call folk art the northeast auctions viewing begins today through monday at treadwell house , 93 pleasant street , portsmouth , nh , \( 603 \) 6276200 it continues at the armory at the

ricky ledee heard fans screaming at him from the leftfield stands at yankee stadium the other day , nasty stuff , brutal words meant to hurt some of the fans screamed about how much they wanted darryl strawberry back in left field , rather than ledee even though ledee understands the fickleness of fans , he sounded disappointed , at the very least , at the suggestion this is part of playing for an organization that is expected to win championships the scrutiny comes from outside and inside the organization , and sometimes the yankees' prospects are given only a few games to establish themselves thrive quickly or move on derek jeter , andy pettitte and mariano rivera responded to the pressure others have wilted by yankees standards , ledee and shane spencer are getting significant opportunities to prove themselves brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , argued vehemently in spring training against trading top prospects for outfielder jim edmonds rather , cashman pushed to keep the young players and pitcher ramiro mendoza , and to give ledee and spencer time to blossom like many of the yanks this year , they have struggled serving in the role of designated hitter , spencer has hit four home runs but is batting 197 ledee is hitting 196 , and after leading the team in home runs in spring training , he has none during the regular season while mostly playing against righthanded pitchers paul o'neill , who departed from wednesday s game in the third inning because of blurred vision in his right eye , is expected to be in the lineup tonight when the yankees begin a threegame series against the toronto blue jays o'neill , who was bent over in front of his locker as he coped with the problem before wednesday s game , underwent a series of tests at beth israel hospital and was cleared it cleared up today , cashman said , adding that the doctor who examined o'neill robert dellarocca was n't exactly sure why o'neill s vision was temporarily impaired chuck knoblauch , who has missed the last three games with a sprained wrist , is also expected to return to the lineup david cone , having adjusted the placement of his foot on the pitching rubber , will try to reverse his slow start , facing the righthander kelvim escobar ledee will most likely be in left field and as long as the scoreboard shows a low batting average next to his name during each of his atbats , ledee will hear fans screaming at him and screaming for strawberry they 're just so used to seeing success that they forget they 're not going to always have good times , ledee said we do n't want to have bad times we do n't want to strike out , or throw the ball away it s just the way it is we 're getting a chance to play on an everyday basis , but until we do something , things wo n't change , i guess everybody goes through the same stuff ledee paused when asked whether he believed the job in left field was his last year , i kind of felt that way after i came up from the minor leagues and i played in the playoffs , ledee said i realized that s not good enough i have to come back and do the same thing this year it s not that i want anything to be given to me , but that s just the way it is ledee has had some good atbats , line drives smashed to left field and leftcenter field he ripped two balls in wednesday s game and neither resulted in a hit he has five doubles he has also had days when he looked confused and seemed to lack confidence , flailing at pitches out of the strike zone because the yankees faced a string of lefthanded starters in the first weeks of the season , ledee did not play regularly so he is still trying to regain the good feelings he had at the plate at the end of spring training spencer , on the other hand , said he felt good at the plate i actually hit the ball pretty good on the road trip , spencer said , but i just did n't get any hits one hit here , one hit there it happens i do n't know if there s really any pressure i do n't know how they 're going to stick with it i 've been known to get off to a slow start every year i 've never had a good start in eight or nine years , but i swung the bat well and got a lot of rbi early and the production is fine it s just that the average is n't there , and i think that 'll come around the yankees are 137 , despite playing below their own standards i think as long as we 're winning games , they 're going to stick with this , spencer said , referring to the playing time given to ledee and to him when ricky is hot , he s one of the hardest outs around and if i'm going good , i 'll at least drive in some runs i think we 'll be fine but they are being scrutinized , from inside and outside the organization if the yankees fall in the standings , if they continue to struggle for

tempe , ariz , feb 28 if uncertainty resides in the anaheim angels' clubhouse this spring , it is more welcome than the chaos that dominated the clubhouse last season one or more of the players who are here now may not be by the time the season begins jim edmonds , for example , has been mentioned in trade talk for months darin erstad is a player the yankees are said to covet they are discussed in possible trades because the angels have an excess of starting outfielders last year they had an excess of intramural strife the turmoil , coupled with a series of injuries to key players , resulted in a lastplace finish and the resignations of the manager and the general manager what went on was n't pretty and it was n't something that we 're proud of , tim belcher , at 38 the oldest player on the team s roster , said today it s not something i was proud to be a part of belcher , who wanted to leave the specifics in the past , called the season bad , frustrating and embarrassing it was , in essence , a freeforall in southern california players against manager and players against players if someone could have developed a more selfdestructive method , the angels would have used it in the past this team had come up short so many times , mo vaughn said what you needed was for everybody to be on the same page and go for that one common goal that s where we went wrong we were going in many different directions recalling his time in boston under manager jimy williams , the burly first baseman said the best situation i 've ever been in to this point was with jimy you know he s in control and he s in charge it just seemed that there was none of that here it seemed like everybody was going in opposite directions we were n't on the same page vaughn , who arrived in anaheim on a lucrative freeagent flight , was supposed to lead the angels to a division championship , but instead was right in the middle of the mess some players questioned his loyalty to his teammates when he failed to join them in defending troy percival , the team s closer , when he became involved in an onfield fight vaughn was in the clubhouse and explained later that he could not get out fast enough on an ailing ankle that he had injured on opening day edmonds was disliked by some players who questioned his desire and his willingness to play hard erstad at one point called his teammates soft gary disarcina , the shortstop , said the team from top to bottom was the most unprofessional organization he had seen one group of players did not like the highstrung manager , terry collins another group did not like the first group for complaining about collins there was a little bit of everything that should n't be going on , but not a lot of any one thing belcher said vaughn became more immersed in the morass over his view of collins the stories that emerged had vaughn going to the front office with complaints about the manager , but vaughn said today that a club official had solicited his opinion , not the other way around he did not say who had approached him , but the official was believed to be tony tavares , the club president , who was not at the angels' camp today they asked me some questions and i answered them , vaughn said i was asked about the situation i made my comments truthfully i did n't really want to make them that s how the whole thing came down in spite of , or perhaps because of , the negative feeling in the clubhouse about collins , the angels extended his contract but the situation continued to deteriorate , and collins finally became fed up with the players and resigned with a month left in the season bill bavasi resigned four weeks later as general manager mike scioscia , the former catcher for the los angeles dodgers , is now the manager bill stoneman , a longtime executive of the montreal expos , is the general manager scioscia , best remembered for a gametying home run against dwight gooden that led to the mets' demise in the 1988 playoffs , said he had not brought up the events of 1999 in talking with the players this spring i was n't here last year to experience it , he said it s a nonissue from where myself and the staff are coming from we 're letting guys know where we 're coming from what s important is what we do with these players now and the trust factor the players said they had learned from their experience last year i learned a lot , vaughn said my job as a player is to go out there and do my job the general manager is going to do his job it s not for me to be a general manager if people ask me questions about this or that , i'm not going to comment belcher said the turmoil is being left behind it was hashed out throughout the year last year , he said by the end of the year it was understood that mistakes were made and lessons learned this year will be a time to figure out if , in fact , lessons were learned i think they were how can he be certain \? part of what makes me confident , he said , is that the guys who were involved in some situations are the same guys who took the lead in rectifying it , saying we ca n't let this happen again but you do n't want to completely forget , because there were some lessons to be learned in order not to repeat itself i think we 'll be all right

los angeles , july 14 from the dawn of the nuclear age a half century ago , when j robert oppenheimer moved from berkeley to the new mexico desert and led the effort to build the atomic bomb , the university of california has been the government s close partner in running its nuclear laboratories even in the postcold war era , this historic relationship has endured because of a belief that the university was uniquely suited to nurturing the independent scientific minds needed for creating these complex weapons but suddenly , and unexpectedly , the partnership is poised for unsettling changes , and not because the threat of nuclear war has all but disappeared and the mission of the laboratories altered the series of security lapses that have swamped the los alamos national laboratory over the past year have disrupted that bedrock partnership and put the government on an uncertain new course of breaking free , at least partly , from the university of california system the arrest last year of a scientist on charges of mishandling vast amounts of secret data , the unexplained disappearance and then reappearance of computer hard drives packed with classified material , and a growing climate of anxiety about further criminal investigations related to misplaced secrets have prompted the government to consider contracting out some duties to private companies energy secretary bill richardson has announced that he will strip the university of its oversight of security at los alamos and the other two government labs it manages , as well as some functions like construction management the university would still manage the most significant tasks , for example research , insuring the reliability of the nuclear stockpile and administration it is a shift , though , that some people feel could have subtle but profound implications for the scientists at the labs in many ways the current tension between the government and the university reflects a wider historic clash present at los alamos since it inception the scientists have long argued that without a free flow of information they cannot accomplish their tasks , while the government has contended that too much openness can harm national security the fear is that tightening security now outside of the university s control could undermine the whole rationale for having an academic institution overseeing weapons research maintaining a semblance of intellectual freedom , required for scientific innovation , even while following strict secrecy provisions the university has long argued that its solid academic reputation and influence traditionally shielded the laboratories' scientists from some potentially stifling government restrictions on communication so that sophisticated scientific research could still be conducted the question now is , if the university loses its ability to control security will it also lose its ability to protect the laboratories' limited intellectual freedom \? mr richardson insisted that it would not , but said the scientists would simply have to cope because , as he put it , the status quo is n't working what i want to do , mr richardson said in an interview , is to use what the university of california does best , and take away what it does n't do well , to enhance the overall management of the labs and perhaps establish a pattern of joint ventures with the university he added we 're not punishing or scapegoating the university of california we want to use their strengths and eliminate their weaknesses sidney drell , a professor emeritus of physics at stanford university and a member of the presidential commission that criticized security at the government s nuclear labs last year , put it more bluntly it s painful for me to say , because i'm one of those scientists , dr drell said , but i think the freedoms they had in the past and the open attitude are unacceptable now there is an even more basic concern many officials at los alamos are girding for the possible indictment of some respected , senior laboratory scientists on criminal charges for their mishandling of the disappearance of the hard drives earlier this year the fear is that this could not only harm the lab s already substantial problems in recruiting young scientists , but could cause an exodus of senior scientists fearful of heavyhanded government prosecutions those fears have led some of those in charge at los alamos to warn that any reductions in the university of california s role should be prudent , thoughtful and modest i believe that whatever appears to have broken can be fixed , said john c browne , the lab s director and a university employee the benefits to the country of this relationship far outweigh the problems to me , if you go too far , it s like you 're going to throw away the whole system because of a couple of bad apples in principle , mr richardson agreed , saying that dropping the contract with the university and bringing in a private defense contractor to run los alamos could be devastating if a large government defense contractor were to take over , mr richardson said , then you would have an exodus from our labs university officials have expressed a willingness to negotiate a new arrangement with the department of energy , but clearly the institution s pride has been wounded
police officials said yesterday that they would review the tactics employed monday by plainclothes officers , including at least one with his gun drawn , who chased a drug suspect through a brooklyn schoolyard crowded with children parents angered by the incident at ps 305 in bedfordstuyvesant confronted police commanders at two meetings in the school yesterday to question whether the officers , in their pursuit of a suspected marijuana dealer , had lost sight of the risk to the children the parents were angry and they were frustrated because they could not get answers to their questions , said the president of the school s parentteacher association , jacqueline ferrell three children were hurt , none seriously , as many of the 200 students who were in the yard during a lunchtime recess panicked and scrambled to get away from the chase although no shots were fired , the incident has resonated in part because the officers involved work for the gang investigations division , the unit involved in the shooting death of patrick m dorismond this month although police officials have said the children were never in danger , commissioner howard safir said , we 're taking a look to see if there was a violation of procedure or a violation of judgment several political leaders and school officials said they had already decided the incident was evidence of poor judgment , and possibly poor training , on the part of the police william c thompson jr , president of the board of education , called the police action irresponsible and in a letter to mr safir suggested that disciplinary measures be taken against the officers the city council speaker , peter f vallone , called the chase inconceivable logic dictates that drawn firearms , fleeing drug dealers and a playground filled with children is a dangerous situation , mr vallone said in his own letter to mr safir according to the police , the incident began when one of four men arrested near the school on drugrelated charges ran off and two officers chased him in an unmarked van at one point , the van crashed into a tree , creating a loud noise that many children mistook for gunfire , school officials said the suspect then ran into the schoolyard , where the two officers caught him some school officials said they believed that as many as three officers had drawn their weapons , but police officials said it was only one and that the officer had kept it pointed toward the ground police officials said that the unit was trying to eliminate drug activity in a park adjacent to the school and that the officers did not know if the suspect was armed it is not uncommon for drug dealers to carry guns , said deputy chief thomas fahey patrick lynch , the president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , said the city had been overtaken in recent weeks by an antipolice atmosphere in which officers' actions were being unfairly secondguessed the danger , he said , is those officers are going to secondguess themselves and that might result in injury to the police officers or others
for two decades , american politics were defined by what david stockman , the reaganera budget director , memorably proclaimed to be deficits as far as the eye could see with the arrival of this new year , the united states economy will shortly break the record set in the 1960 s and achieve the longest boom in history as a result , political candidates are now debating how to spend surpluses rather than how to reduce deficits but the new game can be as tricky as the old one the true size of any surplus is debatable even its existence is provisional , depending on yet unrealized spending cuts so far the presidential candidates are more interested in talking about what a surplus might buy than in the painful choices that lie ahead all four major presidential candidates agree that 2 trillion of a projected 3 trillion in budget surpluses should be used to pay down the national debt or otherwise set aside for social security all of them also have ambitious schemes for the remaining 1 trillion vice president al gore would use the money for health care , education , military spending and other initiatives former senator bill bradley would focus most of it on health gov george w bush would use most of the money for a tax cut and military spending , and senator john mccain would spread it out for spending and tax cuts but none of the candidates emphasize what congress will have to do to make these dollars materialize these figures assume that congress and the president will agree to steep budget cuts in domestic and military programs as envisioned in the budget act of 1997 , with its notoriously tight caps on expenditures in fact , the caps from that law have been circumvented in each of the last two years if current spending levels are not cut this year and are instead allowed to rise at the rate of inflation , the 10year surplus shrinks to 250 billion , according to the congressional budget office if congress sets aside as much for emergency spending as it has in the last two years , the projected 10year surplus would shrink to less than 50 billion these numbers could improve later this month , when new economic forecasts are due , but the hard reality remains producing trilliondollar surpluses will require cuts in existing domestic programs it is true that discretionary domestic spending has been shrinking in theory , there ought to be room for the next president to advocate some increased spending for antipoverty programs , schools , environmental improvement , law enforcement and other areas , without provoking a political firestorm but the costs of federal retirement programs and health care are exploding the congressional budget office projects that social security , medicare and medicaid , now 45 percent of the federal budget , will grow to 65 percent by 2030 with the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary only a few weeks away , voters must start demanding that all the presidential candidates face up to these realities when they talk about using the surplus for either tax reductions or new health plans but voters may turn out to be less interested in these subjects than in the question of who can keep the economy cooking one lesson from the clinton years is that an expanding economy can do more than any social program or tax cut to improve the lives of americans an enduring lesson of the reagan years , of course , is that it really does take smoke and mirrors to produce tax cuts , spending initiatives and a balanced budget at the same time
following is the acceptance speech of dick cheney , the republican vicepresidential candidate , as delivered last night at his party s convention and recorded by the new york times i am honored by your nomination , and i accept it before proceeding , i want to say a special word to president ford i would n't be here tonight if it was n't for him and the trust and confidence he placed in me 25 years ago and i know all of you want to join me in wishing him a very quick and speedy recovery i want to thank you for giving such a warm welcome to lynne and me and to our family and to my friends in the wyoming delegation , i especially want to thank you for your support the first campaign stop that lynne and i were privileged to make with governor and laura bush was in our home town of casper , wyo , where lynne and i graduated from high school some 41 years ago the love and support and enthusiasm of the people of our home state have buoyed our spirits and strengthened our resolve we are going to win this election we will prevail i have to tell you that i never expected to be in this position eight years ago , when i completed my service as secretary of defense , i loaded a uhaul truck and drove home to wyoming i did not plan to return to public office lynne and i settled into a new private life there was time for fishing and grandchildren , and we were very content but now i am glad to be back in the arena , and i want to tell you why i have been given an opportunity to serve beside a man who has the courage , and the vision , and the goodness , to be a great president gov george w bush i have been in the company of leaders i was there on aug 9 , 1974 , when gerald ford assumed the presidency during the gravest constitutional crisis since the civil war i saw how character and decency can dignify a great office and unite a great nation i was a congressman when another man of integrity lived in the white house i saw a president restore america s confidence and prepare the foundation for victory in the cold war i saw how one man s will can set a nation on a new course and i learned the meaning of leadership from president ronald reagan i left congress to join the cabinet of president reagan s successor and i'm proud to say that i'm not the only man on this ticket who has learned from the example of president george bush i saw resolve in times of crisis , a steady hand that shaped an alliance and threw back a tyrant he earned the respect and confidence of the men and women of america s armed forces i have been in the company of leaders i know what it takes and i see in our nominee the qualities of mind and spirit our nation needs , and our history demands big changes are coming to washington to serve with this man , in this cause , is a chance i would not miss this country has given us so much opportunity when lynne and i were growing up , we had so many blessings we went to good public schools , we had fine , dedicated teachers our mothers , like our fathers , worked outside the home so we could go to college we lived in a caring community , where parents were confident that their children s lives could be even better than their own and that is as it should be , and as it can be again we can make our public schools better we can reform the tax code , so that families can keep more of what they earn , more dollars that they can spend on what they value , than on what the government thinks is important we can restore the ideals of honesty and honor that must be a part of our national life if our children are to thrive when i look at the administration now in washington , i am dismayed by the opportunities squandered , saddened by what might have been , but never was these have been years of prosperity in our land , but little purpose in the white house bill clinton vowed not long ago to hold onto power until the last hour of the last day that is his right but , my friends , that last hour is coming that last day is near the wheel has turned and it is time it is time for them to go george w bush will repair what has been damaged he s a man without pretense , without cynicism a man of principle , a man of honor on the first hour of the first day , he will restore decency and integrity to the oval office he will show us that national leaders can be true to their word and that they can get things done by reaching across the aisle , and working with political opponents in good faith and common purpose i know he will do these things , because for the last five years i 've watched him do them in texas george w bush came to the governor s office with a clear view of what he wanted to achieve he said he would bring higher standards to public schools , and he has walk into those schools today , and you will see children with better scores , classrooms with better discipline , teachers with better pay he pledged to reduce taxes , and he has he did it twice , with the biggest tax reduction in state history and not only is the budget in balance , it s running a surplus of more than a billion dollars he promised to reform the legal system to get rid of junk lawsuits , and he has today the legal system serves all the people , not just the trial lawyers none of these reforms came easily when he took office , both houses of the legislature were controlled by democrats , and the house of representatives still is but governor bush does not accept old lines of argument and division he brings people together , reaching across party lines to do the people s business he leads by conviction , not calculation
here is a very sound reason the yankees may not get sammy sosa the baseball wisdom of george steinbrenner stop laughing sosa is not a good fit for the yankees , and steinbrenner is going to see the light before he does anything foolish , like breaking his salary structure and team chemistry to import a slugger when the yankees really need pitching steinbrenner has won three world series in the last four years and , yes , he helped win them by ignoring the hairtrigger impulses of his bad old days he has learned to listen to logic and logic says sammy sosa is quite likely to unsettle what the yankees have been building the sosa rumors would not quit last night , after steinbrenner had a rare meeting with joe torre , and before the yankees lost their game against the red sox , 53 , at a damp yankee stadium did sosa come up during the meeting with steinbrenner \? the name was mentioned , torre said with a smile torre admitted that players asked him about rumors from time to time and conceded that the yankees are talking , but it s not close the manager could not say much about sosa , other than express admiration , because that would be tampering and he insisted that an imported star no names mentioned would not be a distraction however , the best players in the yankee clubhouse , with their biggest contracts still ahead of them , including derek jeter , mariano rivera and jorge posada , just might see sosa in terms of millions of dollars not available to them in the savage gouge of newage baseball ticket prices , even the yankees can only go so far the players are not indulging in such ethical deliberations , but surely have reason to feel threatened and if they do n't make the financial connection , they all have agents who will this is not a diatribe against sosa , by the way sosa is a decent gent who plays with zest and grace , and was more fun than mark mcgwire during the home run derby of 1998 also , he can hit the only reason he is suddenly available is that he was not happy when his manager , don baylor , suggested sosa is not a wonderful right fielder cub fans have learned to put up with the sight of balls getting lost in the ivy or bouncing around in the corner sosa wears no 21 , a lovely gesture , but he does not play right field the way the great roberto clemente did cubbie fans sip another coldie and wait for the bottom of the inning to see if sammy can hoist one toward waveland avenue that s all cub fans want , or expect but this all changed when baylor , who came up with the old baltimore orioles and has never lost his passion for the total game , spoke the truth suddenly , sosa was on the market , inducing a typical onlyinnewyork backpage feeding frenzy this , too , is understandable since sosa would light up the night for a mediocre ball club in new york except that there are none the mets are charmingly trying to get into the playoffs again this year with a nice bunch of players they should n't go after sosa because that would jeopardize the pot of gold they are saving for alex rodriguez next season besides , the mets are in the wrong league for sosa in the curious bipolar setup in which one league uses the designated hitter and one league plays baseball , sosa would be a great boost for an american league team that needs one great player to blast deep into the playoffs the yankees should not think of getting sosa merely to keep him from one of their potential opponents in october they can win it all with the regulars they 've got , but only if their dubious pitching holds up steinbrenner has done a fine job from the moment he signed torre after the 1995 season \( he had his own moments of doubt when he read the wacko back page headlines the next day , but that s another story \) steinbrenner has not imported many disruptions recently the club got a world series out of cecil fielder it got mileage out of a fading doc gooden \( the latest gooden signing is harmless good will by steinbrenner \) and for all the energy that darryl strawberry demanded , he was worth it because he became a role player who terrified opposing managers just by sitting on the bench no fault of his , but sosa needs more money and space and attention than the yankees ought to give him steinbrenner will figure it out that s how george earned his last three world series rings do n't laugh photo sammy sosa \( agence francepresse \)
coroneo , mexico , aug 22 for eight hours each day , in a desolate warehouse with stone walls , some 12 men and a couple of women in this village of squat adobe houses learn to build furniture with circular saws and power drills the government pays for the training and gives each aspiring carpenter a small stipend , but the goal is not to prepare them for scarce and poorly paid jobs at home it is to give them skills they can use when they migrate usually illegally to the united states the program is one of many begun here in the central mexican state of guanajuato by the former governor , vicente fox quesada , who is making his first visit to washington on thursday since being elected president in a landmark victory in june mr fox plans to use his informal meetings with president clinton and the two american presidential candidates , vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas , to encourage them to join in his vision of a sea change in relations along the 2 , 000mile border , in particular one more open to the flow of mexican laborers as he does so , the voices of those workers he has helped train in his home state will echo in the background mexico has many working hands and america has many jobs , said claudio torres resendiz , 33 , one of those being trained in coroneo we do the work they need , and they pay us the money we need to take care of our families both sides benefit american officials have so far been less than enthusiastic about mr fox s idea and his jobtraining programs , like the one here , have been criticized both within and outside mexico as encouraging the exodus of mexican laborers for menial jobs in the united states about 340 , 000 already migrate each year , some legally , others illegally but mr fox defends his initiatives which mostly offer training in lowskill jobs as landscapers , construction workers , factory workers and maids as a pragmatic way to increase the earning potential of workers that mexico simply cannot sustain a straighttalking son of ranchers and a former business executive who focuses on the bottom line , mr fox considers the labor force one of his nation s proudest and most lucrative assets his plans for the border , he says , would force the united states to face up to its need for mexican workers , rather than treating the migrants' contributions to the american economy as a kind of dirty economic secret we have the people , and people are an asset mr fox said in an interview at his family ranch in the state of guanajuato before leaving for the united states i know many people in the united states want to see people as a burden , as a problem , but people are an asset that is why we are going to invest and invest heavily in people , the presidentelect went on if we have talented people , not only will mexico progress , the united states will benefit and progress when asked to explain his visions for an open border and better working conditions for migrants , the typically practical mr fox turned suddenly passionate and cast back to life here in his home state it is the state with mexico s thirdhighest rate of migration to the united states during various seasons of the year , isolated villages are almost completely abandoned by ablebodied men and women as they go to the united states to work the carpentry training program mr fox began here is far from cutting edge students work primarily with outdated tools and learn the most rudimentary techniques while assembling tables and chairs but for workers like mr torres , who has worked illegally on peanut and cotton farms in mississippi for the last 15 years , the workshop means not only the possibility to make more money abroad , but also the chance to seek work with his head held high working in the fields is very hard and the pay is getting worse , he said but i did not have the chance to finish high school , i had to take whatever work i could get i am trying to better myself so i do not have to take that humiliation anymore during his campaign for president , mr fox was widely criticized for a private initiative that has sent some 300 men from guanajuato to work legally as landscapers on golf courses in michigan over the last three years one of the more popular promises of former president carlos salinas de gortari as he negotiated the north american free trade agreement with the united states and canada was that mexico would strive to increase exports of products , not people but the benefits of nafta have been felt less among mexico s 40 million poor , and the number of mexican immigrants to the united states has not significantly declined unlike many of his predecessors , mr fox publicly accepts his country s inability to offer its workers the kinds of salaries and living conditions offered in the united states until his administration is able to begin narrowing the wage gap he has pledged annual economic growth of 7 percent and the

ask anyone in the direct response industry to describe ecommerce , and you 're bound to get the same response internet retailing is simply another kind of direct marketing , not fundamentally different from the catalog and club businesses that have long made their money selling directly to consumers but , at least until recently , many online sellers did not agree when making advertising decisions , they viewed theirs as a business apart , a totally new endeavor with new rules or , more accurately , no rules and with little direct marketing experience of their own , few paid attention to the lessons of an industry that long ago learned to choose its media carefully and to control the costs of acquiring customers call it naivete or silicon valley arrogance , said jim nail , an analyst with forrester research in cambridge , mass , who specializes in online marketing and advertising either way , the result was the same online retailers spent lavishly on general advertising , often paying full price for print and broadcast ads while eschewing cheaper and often more effective direct response advertising their focus was on branding , and on the hope that getting themselves known would be enough to garner customers and win the good will of wall street but branding is not sufficient by itself to generate sales , mr nail said all it does is implant an idea in the consumer s head to get actual customers , he said , you have to target your advertising to highquality prospects , measure the value of your customers and constantly use your data to finetune your strategy in short , you need direct marketing of course , it is hardly surprising that this is the view of h robert wientzen , president of the direct marketing association he is not surprised that branding alone has yielded etailers too few customers at too high a cost indeed , he and other direct marketing industry members used to scratch their heads , he said , and wonder just how long such a mistaken strategy could last not very long , as it happens the internet bubble has burst wall street is less interested in branding than in bottomline profitability , the kind that few online retailers can demonstrate many internet sellers are watching their colleagues and competitors go bellyup , and are realizing that they , too , may soon be in trouble and they are turning to direct marketers and direct response agencies for help , said robert johnston , president of the new york ecommerce association , an industry trade group whose members include software companies , internet service providers and a number of internet retailers for etailers , he said , the trend of the future is direct marketing basically , i think that what the internet has done is that it has validated direct marketing , said wendy riches , president of d'arcy marketing communications group , a division of b com3 group her agency is among those that have recently seen a number of new etailer clients so has mediacom digital , a division of grey global group , according to its president , harvey goldhersz and the trend is not limited to large shops smaller boutique agencies like iris shokoff associates , a direct media buyer , are also benefiting what do they offer their new clients \? accountability , mr goldhersz said ms shokoff agreed dotcoms need to find out just who is buying from them so they can target those people again , she said and they need to figure a way to get to new people , cheaply and efficiently , by using media wisely and by negotiating rates in the past , many internet retailers did none of this indeed , if they measured at all , they limited their observations to what they could see online , generally doing little more than counting impressions that is , the number of people who saw their banners and clicks on a given site hardly a coherent strategy , ms riches scoffed clicks alone mean nothing , she said it s not enough to bring a client to a web site , you 've got to get them to buy how badly were the eretailers doing \? well , ms shokoff said that she heard tales of internet retailers spending as much as 5 to 50 to acquire each sale , even though direct marketers generally consider 10 or less a customer to be appropriate under most circumstances , according to mr wientzen of the direct marketing association he said that he had heard of worse numbers , too , of internet companies paying customer acquisition costs anywhere from 80 to 400 a customer they would even brag of customer bases of perhaps 100 , 000 , he added , a figure traditional direct marketers many of whom count their customers in the millions would generally consider to be unprofitably low ms shokoff , ms riches and mr goldhersz all said that they could do better they have techniques of measurement , or metrics , media buying resources and research capabilities that the internet sellers do not , they said , not to mention years of experience in the field but none would name specific internet clients or give specific examples of how they were helping them , for fear of offending those that might be embarrassed by their prior missteps nevertheless , mr goldhersz did allow that his clients included companies like the vitamin shoppe and goamerica , a wireless internet service provider and he said that one of his clients not necessarily one of the two had suffered rather acutely from its ignorance of direct marketing before turning to his agency they spent 14 or 15 million in the last quarter of last year , all of it on branding , he said and nothing happened
tanjung , indonesia having champagne recently with a small group of journalists his only guests the general manager of a luxury resort here on the island of lombok looked out over his empty beach chairs and recalled the most terrifying moment of his career truckloads of rioters drove up to the gates , said joseph polito , who manages the oberoi hotel on this remote , sleepy island but they only asked for cool drinks before moving on to wreak havoc elsewhere as churches burned and residents fled in midjanuary in the latest eruption of indonesia s sectarian violence , mr polito said , he loaded his guests onto a ferryboat for the 20mile trip across the sea to the island of bali almost no one has come to stay since then , here or in any of the other hotels on lombok , an exquisitely beautiful island that had recently begun to attract travelers who find bali too developed and commercial we were near 100 percent occupancy and all of a sudden , boom , the bottom just dropped out , mr polito said lombok is just decimated there is no business here with occupancy nearing zero around the island , officials say , about half of lombok s 4 , 000 hotel workers have lost their jobs or have been placed on leave the shock of the violence here between muslims and christians has highlighted the damage caused to indonesia s tourism industry by the unrest that has gripped the nation in the last two years tourist arrivals nationwide dropped by 16 percent in the second half of last year from the comparable period in 1998 , according to the central bureau of statistics recent unrest in several places has given the world a negative impression of security in indonesia as a whole , which has impacted on the number of tourists traveling here , the bureau said recent brief outbreaks of violence in the country s two most popular destinations , bali and the ancient city of jogjakarta on the island of java have raised fears of a further downturn we have worked hard to assure foreign travel agencies that there would be no riots in jogjakarta , said stefanus b indarto , chairman of that city s hoteliers' association and now a small group of people have destroyed everything within a few hours in bali , one brief , destructive riot in october caused tourist arrivals to fall to 88 , 934 in december , from 134 , 153 in september lombok , a quiet island of brilliantly green rice terraces , fogcovered mountains and tiny fishing villages , had happily joined the race for tourists and in the last few years had gained a favorable reputation among foreign travel agencies it offered the placid beauty that has endeared indonesia to visitors files of men in robes and skullcaps trooping toward their mosques , flocks of children heading to school in the early morning with their snacks of sugar cane , groups of women waiting patiently by the roadside for transportation with huge pots and bundles balanced on their heads since the start of the 1990 s , dozens of new hotels have opened , roads have been paved and the economy has converted itself hungrily into a dependence on tourism annual tourist visits reached 300 , 000 , and taxes from hotels , restaurants and souvenir shops rose to make up threefourths of the local government s budget then on jan 15 , a huge rally to protest attacks on muslims in the nearby maluku islands erupted into rioting like those attacks , the rioting in lombok was provoked by antigovernment instigators , according to a number of reports officials here say 14 churches were set on fire and 150 houses were burned in three days of rioting five people were killed , 150 were injured and thousands fled into refugee camps hundreds of foreign tourists were evacuated almost none returned the island is quiet now , as peaceful as ever but as the former military spokesman , maj gen sudrajat , said in a recent interview the sentiment is still there how to calm the emotions of the people \? like other parts of this sprawling archipelago of 210 million people , lombok has been shaken by the instability that followed the overthrow of indonesia s strongman , president suharto , nearly two years ago in my opinion , democracy had been hidden by the government for a long time , said arie arcana , an engineer who moved here from java five years ago now we are in a period we call euphoria , he said people are in a very , very open democratic condition they do not know what is a proper activity they think they can do anything they think now is the time to correct social problems , to assert their rights but there are stupid people who do not understand how to do this a result , across much of the country , has been destruction , uncertainty and hardship here in lombok , where people began to transform their lives in hopes of a new prosperity , nobody knows now how long it will be before life returns to normal along the newly paved roads through the steep hillsides , small , bearded monkeys who learned to beg from tourists now stare forlornly as a lone van passes by photo a worker at the oberoi hotel swept the path leading to the beach but the beach chairs were empty , as they have mostly been since midjanuary , when violence between muslims and christians swept the vicinity \( anastasia vrachnos for the new york times \) map of indonesia highlights tanjung tanjung is a resort town on the remote , sleepy island of lombok
no ring cycle guarantees customer satisfaction wagner s fourevening , weeklong operatic monster , known officially as der ring des niebelungen , has too many spiritual and physical moving parts to inspire consensus barter and negotiation occupy the minds and hearts of every audience member what must i surrender to gain what i most value \? the trades are not easily made magnificent wagnerian voices are , more often than not , housed in outsize and virtually immobile bodies those who look the parts too often cannot sing them , at least not for the hourafterhour , dayafterday work schedules that these events demand good voices of less muscularity can manage wagner in smaller opera houses \( the tenor siegfried jerusalem comes to mind \) but at the metropolitan opera , where the last of three ring cycles ran its course last week , size and presence equal to a 3 , 800seat house are demanded next to the met s presentations , those in vienna or london seem like chamber music \( not necessarily a bad thing \) next , what is it we want to see \? wagner s gods and demigods have been parsed by every psychiatric , social , religious and political faction one can think of those unsatisfied by the face value of high and ancient people committing low deeds have had many metaphors to turn to george bernard shaw reimagined the ring as class struggle , and the evils of capitalism have run amok through ring productions ever since surreal collisions of modern and ancient dress and props continue to create the images that ambitious directors hope will make wagner relevant for us right now the met s 13yearold production takes another tack otto schenk and gunther schneidersiemssen peer through wagner s eyes , as midway through the 19th century he assembled in his mind the spears , swords , helmets , rocks and trees through which his dubious characters would move the era s creaky stage machinery would be updated , however , with crafty backlighted projections , psychologically calculated colorcodings and all the magic tricks a wellequipped new opera house can muster wagnerites have been alternately dismayed and relieved conservative german listeners , ignoring snide critical comments in their own newspapers , flock to the united states to seattle , chicago , san francisco or new york hoping to escape the drastic interpretations their countrymen present them with i have stayed at hotels during american ring cycles and heard barely a word of english hip americans appalled by a literalism they call listless and archaic flock to bayreuth or vienna , eager to be brought up to date by the latest vision of wagner there seemed to be fewer foreigners at the met last week , perhaps because tickets were in such demand among the house s regular patrons the met s press department , usually happy to provide free entry for visiting journalists and critics , found its cache of tickets drastically curtailed the three ring cycles this spring stood outside regular subscription series , and top seats brought prices \( ticket plus mandatory donation \) close to 300 no one seemed to mind people at the house do not deny that had its players , singers , stage hands , ushers and financiers possessed the lasting power , the met could probably have sold out the cycle several more times the principle tradeoff last week involved eyes for ears musically , there was orchestra playing under james levine breathtaking for its clarity and sophistication visually , suspension of disbelief was stretched to its breaking point but rescued by consistent singing quality jane eaglen as brunnhilde was a trumpet of triumphant proportions ms eaglen s physical size cannot be put aside out of politeness virtually immobile and nearly dwarfing last week s siegfied , stig andersen , her contributions to theater during the early stages of this cycle consisted of a raised arm or two and none too convincing plays of joy and sorrow across the face confronted with such paradox , the eye rises up and says this will not do , but then there is the sound of that voice , which by its physical presence alone occupies the role and then there were brunnhilde s final sequences in gotterdammerung , in which all disbelief melted away , allowing both eye and ear to be equally moved mr andersen , who is from denmark , handled one of opera s truly punishing roles with admirable reliability his tenor is in good health , he moves well and there are blessedly few retreats into barking semispeech the size of mr andersen s voice would fill a smaller hall , say covent garden or the vienna staatsoper , more fully one had a hard time hearing him in early acts , but gratitude for what he was and forgiveness for what he was not in this impossible part gradually formed a truce elsewhere , james morris soldiered satisfyingly on he is our wotan for the generation , and may have a few good ring cycles still in him deborah voigt and placido domingo as sieglinde and siegmund knew that their duties were relatively brief , and brilliantly held nothing back mr levine s wagner remains very slow , but i for one do not mind one values the breathing space that frames every detail nothing crude or careless could escape notice at these tempos , and one hears neither quality the final barter the production i find some of the scenes insipid , like the 19thcentury aquatints that chronically overstock bad antique shops \( act i of siegfried , for example , or the start of act iii in gotterdammerung \) also , a mark morris or some choreographer like him should be brought in to do something about the rhine maidens and the valkyries , whose gyrations are embarrassing the great virtue of the met s ring , on the other hand , is that it does not get in the way there are no metaphors of modern life to puzzle out wagner s characters are carried , as the old advertising slogan goes , factory to you with no directorial middlemen to intervene i have always been fascinated by the many serious musical people who ardently champion the original intents and historical integrities of 18thcentury performance style and at the same time dismiss the met s ring as hopelessly oldfashioned just as i love stokowski conducting bach , i would n't mind seeing wotan as homer simpson or norns as the supremes but , if you want wagner faithful to his time , new york may be the place to be
shadow baby by alison mcghee 243 pp new york harmony books 23 though not yet 12 years old , the precocious heroine of alison mcghee s second novel exhibits all the symptoms of a future fiction writer including a jumpstart on that unhappy childhood said to be essential for anyone worth her underwood a preadolescent of hazy provenance , clara winter is preoccupied by the dim places beneath the canopy of her family tree her mother , tamar , will not speak of clara s father or her grandfather tamar also refuses to reveal anything about clara s twin sister , who died at birth in the cab of a pickup truck that spun into a ditch in the midst of a blizzard no wonder clara insists on writing her last name with a lowercase w , as a rejection of winter , an acknowledgment of what winter really is and how it can kill were she a daughter of privilege downstate , this anxious little girl might wind up on a psychologist s couch end of story but this is the backwoods of upstate new york , and clara is left on her own to tease out the answers to her questions while the singlemindedness of her pursuit can make the plot of shadow baby feel claustrophobic and mcghee s symbolic freighting of that search could benefit from a lighter touch the novel still manages to be a suspenseful and moving account of clara s coming of age portraying a mensagrade child as anything but a cartoon is a tricky proposition , yet mcghee has made clara a credible if exasperating heroine she quotes shakespeare she uses words like suttee in conversation , and she has a long list of other favorites veritable belongs to me it s one of my words i like the way all the syllables after the 'ver' go mumbling into each other old soul though she may appear , clara turns out to be a babe in the adirondack woods when it comes to understanding life or , to be more precise , when it comes to understanding that life seldom lends itself to easy comprehension people make choices chance intervenes the two congeal into a personal history that ca n't always be explained but must often simply be accepted clara , however , is a girl who badly wants a happy ending when her badgering of tamar yields few clues about her family , she turns to her lavish imagination she fills in the blanks surrounding the death of her twin \( the shadow baby of the title \) with fanciful details she writes fake book reports about brave pioneer children who , like her , have an unclear past and an uncertain future clara even conjures up a heroic childhood for her surrogate grandpa , a laconic old metalsmith who lives nearby these fictions serve both as a blanket to warm her and as a shield against a truth that , when revealed , will not prove so neat or satisfying much of this novel recalls rainlight , the author s 1998 debut , also set in the same region in mcghee s fiction , this is a place where children and adults reach out almost obsessively for those who are gone but hardly forgotten , a place where people grieve over lost opportunities , their thoughts lingering on what might have been her characters marvel at the cruel interjection of chance that has rearranged their lot in life , and all the while the same few memories play torturously on a permanent loop in their minds a stylistic tactic that can grow as wearying to the reader as it can to the characters themselves the craft of metalworking is the abiding and nonetoosubtle metaphor for redemption in shadow baby , as the old man shows clara how castoff tin cans , bent by force and fire , may be transformed into delicate lanterns that brighten the adirondack woods he teaches her to train my eyes to see the possibility of beauty around her the analogy is plain in fact , mcghee zealously hammers it home from epigraph to final page life s uninvited hardships may warp us , but they can also make us stronger and our new selves , however changed , are still able to cast a clear light by the novel s end , clara has only begun to digest this message one suspects that , like mcghee herself , she will make a career of working it through in her writing
vice president al gore has shaken the persistent sense that he is not particularly likable and is now as highly regarded as gov george w bush on matters of character , leadership and overall personal popularity , the latest new york times cbs news poll shows now that public opinion has settled somewhat since the democratic convention nearly four weeks ago , and voters say they are far more interested in the race , the survey makes clear that mr gore s enhanced fortunes are deeper and more sustained than a postconvention glow mr gore has achieved substantial gains among women , independent voters and those from middleincome groups while mr bush s support has diminished somewhat over all , he retains the overwhelming support of men , midwesterners and southerners the poll shows that the presidential race is neck and neck and that mr bush and mr gore are facing off in the tightest competition just after labor day in 20 years fortytwo percent of registered voters said they would back mr gore if the election were held today , and 39 percent said they would vote for mr bush four percent said they would back ralph nader , the green party nominee , and 2 percent would favor patrick j buchanan of the reform party mr gore has gained on mr bush in recent weeks , but not to a degree that is statistically significant the nationwide telephone poll , conducted saturday through monday with 843 registered voters , has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points and there was some encouraging news for mr bush in the numbers fortyseven percent of mr gore s supporters said they had reservations about him only 38 percent of mr bush s backers registered concerns about their candidate by far the most pronounced shift in the survey is the marked improvement in the public s perceptions of mr gore for months , americans said they found mr gore s positions on various issues more appealing than mr bush s , but the vice president s most persistent problem was that voters said they had significant misgivings about him on issues of character now , while mr bush has held his own in retaining impressive favorability ratings , mr gore s favorability ratings have increased substantially to the point where the two men are now equally popular fortyfour percent of voters say they have a favorable view of mr gore , while 29 percent have an unfavorable view mr gore has not done that well by this measure for years in recent months , the public either had more negative views of mr gore than positive ones , or , more recently , had given him positive ratings that equaled his negatives in a striking example of how perceptions have transformed , voters no longer view mr bush as the runaway winner in the november election they are now split on whether mr gore or mr bush will make it to the white house as recently as two months ago , mr bush led mr gore on this question by more than 20 percentage points voters are also more confident in mr gore s ability to deal wisely with an international crisis fortynine percent said they were confident in mr gore , a gain from 43 percent in a times cbs poll in july mr bush s standing on that issue has remained steady at 46 percent while 63 percent of the public thinks mr gore cares about the needs and problems of ordinary people a figure that has not changed since july mr bush has shown some slippage fortynine percent say that mr bush cares about ordinary people , a decline from 55 percent in july it is not altogether clear what has prompted the more kindly feelings toward mr gore but in followup interviews yesterday , many voters who now back mr gore said they were impressed by what they saw at the democratic convention repeatedly , they said , mr gore seemed to be coming into his own and moving out of president clinton s shadow at the convention , he did a better job of concealing anything that was negative , if he had anything to begin with , said wilma akins , 69 , a retired office manager in statesboro , ga he made me feel hopeful and optimistic about the future joyce taylor , 46 , a grocery store manager in philadelphia , said he s become stronger and seems to be speaking out more since the convention he s becoming his own man now , and he s not as stiff as he once was although there is still not a single overwhelming issue that defines the race as the economy has in the past the survey found that the closest contender this year was health care , and the related matter of medicare nearly twothirds of voters said the high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly was quite important to them personally voters said they thought the government not insurance companies would do a better job of providing coverage to the elderly for prescription drugs mr gore was seen as more likely than mr bush to succeed in reducing the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly mr bush has proposed allowing private insurance companies to compete for medicare clients , while mr gore has proposed adding a subsidy for prescription drug coverage to the current medicare plan
mexico city , july 16 rafael gimenez predicted the outcome of mexico s presidential elections with great accuracy , but few mexicans knew because his newspaper refused to publish his polls indicating that vicente fox was leading the race ricardo de la pena was accused by a colleague of violating professional ethics after he produced a survey showing mr fox with a healthy lead over the candidate from the party that governed mexico for 71 years and maria de las heras , a third mexican pollster , received phone threats after her nationwide poll two weeks before the july 2 vote showed mr fox winning by a wide margin before the elections , officials of the institutional revolution party , the governing party , known as the pri , pressured editors and producers not to publish or broadcast surveys showing mr fox in the lead mr gimenez and at least one other pollster were sidelined at newspapers after producing such surveys and most of the polls published just before a final deadline two weeks ahead of the vote showed francisco labastida , the governing party candidate , leading by a three to fourpoint margin as a result , mr fox s victory by seven percentage points stunned nearly everyone , even mr labastida , who had hired a wellknown washington pollster , stanley greenberg , to produce his campaign surveys several of mr greenberg s polls , which were given wide publicity here , showed mr labastida with a sweeping lead , and none ever showed mr fox ahead according to the offical returns , mr fox received 44 percent of the votes and mr labastida 37 percent now a debate is under way here about whether many respected pollsters erred or whether millions of voters changed their minds at the last minute some , including mr greenberg , said most of the millions of mexican voters who were counted as undecided chose mr fox once in the polling booth others said fear of the governing party prevented voters from confiding their real intentions the july 2 exit polls by the newspaper reforma accurately predicted the result , but its influential polls during the previous months never showed mr fox in the lead alejandro moreno , reforma s chief pollster , said many of the governing party s hardcore supporters , disciplined voters in previous balloting , had stayed home on election day ms de las heras , who over a decade has conducted many polls on contract to the governing party , said its tactic of giving away washing machines and other items to supporters distorted surveys because many voters told pollsters they intended to vote for the party in hopes of receiving a gift ms de las heras s survey in midjune , which was privately financed , showed mr fox with 44 percent and mr labastida with 34 percent it was not published in mexico , but the dallas morning news reported its findings in an article on june 21 she was interviewed that morning by mexican talk show hosts astonished over her conclusions then suddenly my phone went silent , she recalled the pri put out the order to the radio and tv stations bury that witch ! in the following days , she received several anonymous letters and calls accusing her of being a traitor , she said virtually every poll published in mexico that showed mr fox in the lead provoked a stir the first , by mr de la pena , was financed by a consortium of parties including the pri he caused an uproar when he reported in february that mr fox was leading with almost exactly the percentages that emerged in the election governing party officials criticized mr de la pena s techniques to his face and ridiculed him behind his back mr gimenez , who has a master s degree in survey research techniques from the university of connecticut , was treated more harshly in january , february and march , his polls in the newspaper milenio showed mr fox running strong , and mr gimenez told associates in april that a new survey would show mr fox taking the lead but those results were never published instead , milenio announced that he had been replaced , and its new survey showing mr labastida ahead mr gimenez was later hired to do surveys for mr fox s centerright party , and his final poll in late june showed mr fox with 43 percent , mr labastida with 38 and the third major candidate , cuauhtemoc cardenas , with 17 those results turned out to be more accurate even than some exit polls all of us who concluded that fox was going to win were made to suffer , mr gimenez said the pri discredited all of us , saying we were careless , inept or sold out so the election took the pri by surprise mr labastida said in a television interview last week that he never dreamed he could lose until exit polls announced mr fox s victory

cypress hill sneers in its recent single then do n't trust nobody gotta look over your shoulder constantly in the meantime , for all of the criticisms hurled at eminem , he did teach us one lesson on his last album that we do n't want to be him but for all its problems , complications and loneliness , stardom does have one perk it fosters the illusion of selfimportance , something that for many people is as necessary to survival as food , shelter and clothing but selfimportance is a fragile thing it can be washed away in an instant by anything from war or pain to a dirty look or cross word thus , knowledge of one s own presumed importance leads to a certain selfconsciousness and , as the breakup of the smashing pumpkins has proved , that can be a dangerous thing on chocolate starfish , mr durst s selfconsciousness is even more palpable than that of the pumpkins frontman , billy corgan from the yannilike spirituality of his liner notes \( these songs are the gateway to our souls \) to the unconvincing attempt at creating an alter ego named chocolate starfish , he reeks of insecurity and confusion all over the album , he s licking his wounds , parodying nine inch nails lyrics in indignation over disparaging remarks made by mr reznor in my generation , he responds to his critics following woodstock '99 with the worst attempt at a generational theme song since the police s born in the 50 s as part of his bid to appeal to every demographic \( old , young , male , female , gangsta , nerd \) , he poses as a misogynist rocker in the song my way and a sensitive boyz ii men crooner minutes later in the one the album also shows that he s avidly monitoring his contemporaries , offering lukewarm imitations of eminem , kid rock , dmx and rage against the machine mr durst s rapping and singing , poor to begin with , become even more lackluster when he overuses the technique of cracking his voice to feign intensity , making it as meaningless an identifier as his red baseball cap sure , the album has some great hooks , wes borland keeps getting more adventurous as a guitarist and the band s collaboration with dmx , redman and method man on rollin' \( urban assault vehicle \) is as nearperfect as a 2000 rockrap crossover can get , but rock music deserves better angst that s not to say that u2 , in transcending angst to reach some sort of plateau where everything is cool and beautiful , man , is perfect all that shares a trait endemic to both u2 s very worst and very best albums a tendency to scream , look at me , i get it i get it better than you do , whether it s the secret of life \( on the new album \) , the skindeep imperialism of pop culture \( on its 90 s albums \) , the value of humanity over violent patriotism \( on its early 80 s albums \) or the hubris of four irishmen coming up with one of pop s greatest tributes to the rev martin luther king jr \( on the unforgettable fire in 1984 \) in an interview with bob dylan in 1984 , bono lamented that u2 s music did n't plug into any deep roots or heritage , as dylan s did it s as if we 're caught in space , he said , later adding , i'm hungry for a past in recent years , bono has embraced his rootlessness and pronounced himself a citizen of the world when not recording , he has been cozying up to everyone from president clinton to pope john paul ii to kofi annan in a crusade to alleviate third world debt this universality declares itself from the new album s first single , beautiful day , a rosyspectacled joyride from shanghai to the arabian desert , to its overwrought call for peace on earth in a way , all that is also an album of defeat \( bono sings of the last of the rock stars when hiphop drove the big cars \) after all , the best way to coax a success out of u2 is to let it fail first \( its previous album pop \) in that interview with dylan , bono taunted him and van morrison for not trying to catch up with the younger musicians but in letting go of those ambitions and returning to being a sincere band that believes in the power of rock and roll again , u2 finds vindication for its past , complete with the edge s ringing guitar again and larry mullen beats that are n't programmed like a drum machine sure , you might want to snicker when a starryeyed bono sings lines like life should be fragrant , but for some reason it s hard to laugh especially when you have people like fred durst rapping , life is a lesson you learn it when you 're through better to swallow the fragrant pill that offers some relief than the bitter pill that offers none photos u2 performed on the roof of dublin s clarence hotel in september and brought a film crew along from left are adam clayton , the edge and bono \( reuters \) fred durst of limp bizkit in concert at the nassau coliseum in uniondale , ny , last year \( rahav segev \)
talk about laboring in obscurity consider for a moment the life of joseph antonacci , a man whose lot is to try to distract commuters from their newspapers and novels with mileposts , his information pamphlet about metronorth all right , so mileposts is not exactly sexy it arrives on commuters' seats once a month with its folksy graphics and surprisingly witty copy but mr antonacci , a 41yearold brooklyn resident with a droll smile and a goofy sense of humor , thinks of his work with the pride of a true auteur unlike most writers , however , he finds glory not in bylines or public accolades but rather through telephone calls to the railroad from customers wondering what advertising agency the metronorth commuter railroad is using there is none mr antonacci , his assistant and his editor are it writing about schedule changes and safety issues each month can be a challenge mr antonacci entertains himself by trying to entertain others his item on holiday fairs last year began ok , so the subscription to popular body piercing you gave as a gift last year went over like well , like a poke with a sharp object he described metronorth , with its many service awards , as the tom hanks of commuter railroads and this is how he needles cell phone users who have taken to using headsets when worn in public , they often make you look 'different' to everyone else and not in a good way mileposts has been part of metronorth for almost 20 years , but it was n't until 1996 that mr antonacci took it over and recast it with his blend of information , pop culture , chat and jokes hey , if it s boring and you have to spend all day writing it anyway , why not make it funny \? he said metronorth says its riders , in general , love the publication as evidenced by the fact that they read it when mr antonacci wrote about the lost and found department , traffic there increased 68 percent i know it s silly , said lynn leahey , the editor in chief of soap opera digest magazine , who takes the train from irvington , but commuting can be so impersonal , it s nice to see that they know there is a person sitting in that seat , not just a ticket obviously they 're trying to reach out to people still , mr antonacci gets his share of gripers it s too cute , and it s a waste of money , said michael muscaro , a hairdresser from sleepy hollow it s like , 'are n't we great \? and do n't forget , winter s coming ! ' maybe the occasional tourist likes it sometimes readers miss the jokes altogether a reference to jackie gleason s classic comedy , the honeymooners , was lost on one rider who , fuming over an apparent grammatical gaffe , decided that mileposts was written by illiterates actually , mr antonacci is a pace university graduate with a degree in journalism , who previously worked as a press officer at the museum of natural history at metronorth , he takes pride in his work , griping about changes to his copy that kill the flow in general , however , mr antonacci s manager , donna evans , lets him have his way she is as demented as i am , he said we sort of have to be because we produce so much stuff if we did n't laugh i think we 'd sort of freak out with one assistant , mr antonacci pumps out new issues of mileposts each month , along with mileposts west \( for commuters west of the hudson river \) , outposts \( which is bilingual for bronx riders \) and two metronorth employee publications much of the information appears again and again in different forms , a fact that would leave most writers dizzy and bored but mr antonacci shrugs it off i'm the master of recycling , he said i use everything from bugs bunny to brian wilson lyrics if i can make people laugh , they might read my stuff he continued , talking to a reporter remember , i'm competing with you guys the news , the times and the post just to get read what good is it if it just sort of lays there \? this all started when mr antonacci , working as a security guard , decided that his destiny lay in public relations because it appeared to be just taking people to expensive lunches and talking a lot , he said he completed his degree at pace , got a job at the rockland review , a weekly , where he wrote restaurant reviews as the stranger , and in 1987 wound up in the metronorth media relations office the idea was to gain some experience and get out quickly thirteen years later , mr antonacci says that he ca n't wait to get back to work when he s home and that during vacations he ponders future issues of mileposts while lying on the couch his is a corporate office , with the standard computer , files and gray carpeting but during an interview there , shrieks and guffaws from mr antonacci s coworkers could be heard next door , and people kept popping by to wave hello in a decidedly unbuttoneddown way when things go badly , he said , the staff starts barking woof ! at each other as the yuksmaster of metronorth , he says he is the quiet one in his family , which consists of his wife , joanne , their 6yearold daughter , ariana , and two stepsons , peter , 21 , and alex , 18 they live in a restored country victorian in the flatbush section of brooklyn when you start your career writing as 'the stranger' it s somehow logical that you 'd end up writing mileposts , he said , laughing at the nonsequitur i like to hook people with humor because , let s face it , how else are you going to get them to read through a whole article on schedule changes \?

dongo , congo , sept 13 it takes nearly nine hours to get here from the next big town , in a boat that leaks its slow way through swampland and walls of jungle with few hints of human life but then , there it is a war rarely seen up close , and getting worse dogs gnaw through new graves rebel soldiers , the winners of a battle here just days ago , hold up shredded posters of congo s pudgy president , laurent kabila they seem surprised even a little afraid at the amount of weaponry they captured after five days of fighting hundreds of machine guns , mortars , rocket launchers , mounds of newly bought ammunition that showed , with little doubt , that mr kabila meant business if we knew all these guns were here we would never have dared to attack them , said rugaza ndayisenga , who at only 28 is a commander here for the rebel group , the movement for the liberation of congo for more than two years , a complicated war has been fought in hidden places like this in congo , the thirdlargest country in area in africa , it is a scramble for political power as much as for its bounteous diamonds , gold , timber and coffee it is sometimes called africa s world war i because the troops of at least seven nations are battling here , along with three fractious rebel groups and countless militias the fighting has gone on despite a peace accord signed in august 1999 by all the major parties even though that accord has checked the war s intensity but in recent months violence has surged , here in the northwest along the ubangi river , as well as in congo s far eastern reaches next to rwanda and uganda the number of refugees is soaring united nations officials say mr kabila is attacking more by air , and rebel officials say his ground attacks involve far more weaponry , like the large cache captured here soon the stakes may grow yet greater , in a way that could unravel the few surviving strands of the peace accord and make the united nations' hope of stationing peacekeepers in congo even less likely a few days ago , jeanpierre bemba , the rebel leader in equateur province , issued a challenge to mr kabila and major western nations that pushed the accord with more vigor than any of those who signed it he wants mr kabila to declare whether he will abide by the peace accord , signed in lusaka , zambia if not , he says he will not feel constrained by it either we are at a turning point , mr bemba , a 38yearold businessmanturnedrebel , said this week in gbadolite , his headquarters is lusaka alive still or not \? that is the question mr bemba s target is specific , and gaining it would probably intensify the fighting he wants to close down the airport at mbandaka , the last major city along the congo river before the capital , kinshasa he contends that mr kabila is using the airport there to initiate bombing raids , a violation of the lusaka accord , even as mr kabila says he will honor other parts of the accord lusaka is a package , mr bemba insisted you must take all of lusaka you ca n't say to a woman , 'i take your head i leave your heart' it is not certain whether mr bemba is capable militarily of closing the airport nor is it clear if his major sponsor , president yoweri museveni of uganda , would give his approval given that mr museveni s own friends , the united states and many european nations , would probably hold him responsible for such a departure from the lusaka accord but , at a minimum , mr bemba s challenge may finally add some clarity to the status of the accord signed in lusaka on paper , the accord calls for a ceasefire , disarmament of militias , negotiations among congolese political leaders and a withdrawal of all foreign forces uganda and rwanda are fighting on the side of the rebels zimbabwe , angola and namibia on mr kabila s side burundi has had troops there , though only to protect its border , it says almost none of the agreement has been fulfilled so no one with a stake in congo warring parties or outside nations eager for stability in central africa can say whether it is moving toward peace or further from it aid agency officials say the confusion has made their job especially hard because rich nations are reluctant to give money without the guarantee of a peace accord and suffering has grown with the uptick in fighting along the ubangi , an estimated 30 , 000 to 80 , 000 people have fled their homes in eastern congo , where an ethnic war tied tightly to the larger war is growing worse , relief officials estimate that there are 750 , 000 refugees , compared with at most 200 , 000 a year ago humanitarian needs and suffering of the people will continue whether lusaka works or not , charles petrie , the top united nations aid official in congo , said this week in a visit to gbadolite without the accord in place , he said , it does make it a lot more difficult because we are in a logic of greater conflict experts say all sides have violated the accord in one way or another for example , rwanda and uganda , nominally allies , fought three times in kisangani , most recently this summer , killing hundreds of civilians rwanda has since pledged to pull back about 125 miles from the front lines uganda recalled about 5 , 000 soldiers , roughly half its congo force , this summer
al gore believes his role in streamlining the federal bureaucracy was one of his major achievements as vice president the sale at auction of the huge , governmentowned elk hills oil field in bakersfield , calif , to the occidental petroleum company grew out of that effort the winning bid was 365 billion it was the largest sale of a government asset to private industry ever , and it got the federal government out of the oil business the elk hills transfer may or may not have been a good deal for taxpayers , and there is no suggestion the vice president did anything wrong but the interests of democracy would have been better served if it had been widely known that occidental petroleum has for years been a major benefactor of mr gore s family charles lewis , the executive director of the center for public integrity , a nonpartisan investigative organization in washington , notes in a new book , the buying of the president 2000 , that occidental has been a steady supplier of campaign funds to mr gore \( who is known for his fundraising excesses \) and the democrats occidental has also given substantial sums to republicans but back in 1970 , when mr gore s father , the late senator albert gore sr , left the senate , he was given a 500 , 000ayear job as chairman of an occidental subsidiary and a seat on occidental s board of directors by 1992 , said mr lewis , the gore family held occidental stock worth 680 , 000 john mccain campaigns on a bus known as the straight talk express and has made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of his campaign while his misadventures as a member of the notorious keating five are well known , it is not as well known that he went to bat for the del webb corporation , a large residential developer , when it ran into trouble in its effort to exchange some of its own land for a choice governmentowned parcel near las vegas the deal that del webb eventually made was criticized by the inspector general of the department of the interior senator mccain is a big deal to del webb , which is headquartered in arizona and has been involved in a number of controversial land swaps with the government del webb executives and employees have contributed more than 56 , 000 to mr mccain s campaigns more than ever , politicians are anxious to portray themselves as straight talkers but most voters know that hypocrisy is part of the essence of politics what voters seldom know are the disheartening details of the treacherous webs of influence that often are woven by big money in politics in an interview , mr lewis said , the media , frankly , need to get a little bit away from the horse race , using the money as a litmus test of how viable a candidate is , and get a little bit more into those relationships that exist and that the voters do n't know about in his chapter on bill bradley , mr lewis wrote that during one year in the late 1980 s , a period when corporate takeover artists were flooding congress with money , the top recipient was none other than bradley , who supported tax policies favorable to corporate raiders he also wrote that mr bradley , who is now a fervent advocate of campaign finance reform , was a champion recipient of other kinds of largess during his three terms in the senate , wrote mr lewis , he went on one junket after another more than 160 in all in 1996 alone , he took more allexpensepaid trips than any us senator george w bush has been held aloft throughout his career by favorseeking special interests mr bush s experience as an oil industry entrepreneur was , for the most part , a series of expensive stumbles but in the late 1980 s he swung a sweet deal with harken energy corporation , an oil exploration company near dallas phil kendrick , harken s founder , was quoted by mr lewis as saying his name was george bush that was worth the money they paid him mr bush has raised more than 100 million in his two runs for governor of texas and his current run for president , an astonishing total how much of that money was spent in expectation of special access and special favors is a mystery to voters the straight talk of the candidates dissolves into silence when it comes to penetrating such mysteries
nagoya , japan akio toyoda is japan s willliam clay ford jr widely regarded as the heir to the throne at the toyota motor corporation by virtue of both his bloodlines and his experience , he seems well on his way to taking over one of japan s most distinguished and financially sound companies but mr toyoda has chosen a somewhat unorthodox means of proving himself he has set out to demonstrate that even a bastion of the economic old guard known as japan inc can make waves in the new economy his pet project , a web site called gazoocom , is widely regarded as evidence that japan s corporate monoliths will find it far easier to thrive and compete in an informationtechnologyenriched economy than many experts originally imagined gazoo is helping toyota speed up the disposal of used cars , cutting the time between orders placed and payment received and providing a treasure trove of customer data it is also enabling the company to retain young , restless employees who might otherwise strike out for bit valley , japan s version of silicon valley the big companies were slow to move at first , but now everyone is incubating new businesses inside of them , said joichi ito , president and founder of neoteny , an incubator backed by whitney company their delay has actually become an advantage because they have all of the cash and the markets are cheap right now similarly , the corporations' reluctance to cut jobs , long criticized as a major drag on the japanese economy , is also now working to their benefit , mr ito said the brains are still at the big companies , he said they 've never quit or been pushed out , so all the good new economy people are still sitting in the old economy companies thus , toyota s web venture is thriving , and fujitsu and the nec corporation are locked in a fierce battle to determine which of them will be the america online of japan even ntt , the former government telephone monopoly whose high prices make it the new economy s worst enemy , is embracing new technology that is likely to make it the leading provider of lowcost , highspeed internet connections and sophisticated telecommunications services that shift will be much to the chagrin of several small , new companies that have been counting on ntt to be too big , too dumb and too slow to compete in new markets to the extent that japan s economy is a reflection of the efforts of companies like these , their metamorphoses suggest there are reasons for optimism despite statistics indicating that growth over the short term may be stagnant at best , and despite fears that the financial sector is lurching toward another crisis still plagued by too much bad debt japan s big companies , only recently dismissed as the brontosauruses of the global economy , are reinventing themselves to stay competitive , and therein lies hope for the economy to be sure , not all japanese companies understand the need to transform themselves , and even those that do are moving cautiously gazoo the name is derived from the two japanese characters for visual , celebrating the site s ability to bring the showroom to the customer was started as a venture business inside toyota , largely to retain young employees chafing at the seniority system of advancement the company has been up and running for the last two years , but planning for it began about five years ago the directors thought gazoo was just a hobby for young kids , said mr toyoda , who is 44 and the only son of shoichiro toyoda , the company s honorary chairman so we did n't get any money to develop it when the gazoo team wanted to buy a computer to test its online venture in a dealership in shikoku , the smallest and least populated of japan s four main islands , the board turned down the request for money so mr toyoda put up a little less than 2 , 000 of his own money to buy components , and the team assembled a computer we did it at less than onethird of what it would have cost to buy the same thing , mr toyoda said proudly maintaining the computer was a frustration during a meeting in hokkaido , mr toyoda received an urgent call on his cell phone from the dealer in shikoku , complaining that it had crashed and asking him to please send someone immediately to repair it a gazoo team member was hastily dispatched , only to discover that the plug had been pulled out of the socket that cost me 80 , 000 yen , mr toyoda said not costefficient one might even assume that toyota had it out for gazoo the company housed its fledgling web business in a brand new office building , but on the 42nd floor a floor that companies in this country traditionally shun because the number 42 is read shi ni , which means death in japanese a toyota spokesman insisted , however , that the floor number said nothing about corporate sentiment toward gazoo the rent was cheap because of the floor number , he said that s what we care about at toyota however skeptical headquarters may have been , the company now appears fully committed to gazoo in june , mr toyoda who studied business at babson college in wellesley , mass , and has worked in various parts of the company since 1984 was named to toyota s board , an unusual appointment for one so young also this year , gazoo was officially placed into a separate division , along with some of toyota s other businesses related to venture capital the action was regarded as a sign of commitment to them top executives have supported us , mr toyoda said
deland , fla , nov 15 the threemember canvassing board that oversaw the vote tally here in this quiet , oldfashioned seat of volusia county was not supposed to be entirely hostile territory for gov george w bush and his team of powerful campaign lawyers two of the three board members are republicans so is the county supervisor of elections and yet the republicans have faced a rocky road here in this central florida town of 18 , 000 against bitter opposition from republicans , the canvassing board completed a hand recount of all 184 , 339 ballots tuesday and handed al gore 98 more votes the board unanimously voted to conduct the hand count last thursday and has unanimously stood behind the results what happened here this week revealed how the endgame for the presidency is more than simply a highprofile joust between warren christopher and james a baker iii the outcome is also being shaped by local personalities and circumstances , from the canvassing board chairman , a small claims judge known for bucking the political establishment , to two lifelong friends from opposing parties who by chance alone found themselves on the canvassing board their choices were driven also by a distinct irreverence toward hired guns from the beltway , and by a deeply territorial sense of pride in how democracy here at home goes down in the history books this is my home , patricia northey , the lone democrat on the canvassing board said today it was on tv , and the world was watching what we were doing none on the board seemed the least cowed by party chiefs last week , before the board had approved a hand recount , its chairman , county judge michael mcdermott , a republican , received a phone call from robert a butterworth , the state attorney general and gore campaign chairman , who wanted a manual recount in volusia not even two minutes into the call , judge mcdermott cut him off i said , 'mr butterworth , with all respect , i think you should disqualify yourself , ' he recalled judge mcdermott was equally blunt with republicans at a board meeting , judge mcdermott recalled , a bullying attorney from his own party refused to stop arguing the republicans' position , even after both sides had been heard and the board had ruled i said , 'you 're out of order , ' judge mcdermott recalled he said , 'you 're out of order' i said , 'remove him immediately' a local attorney , he observed , would not have done that the board members said they felt more loyalty to their home county , suddenly thrust into the national spotlight and potentially facing ridicule as a corrupt backwater if volusia was going into the history books , it would not go in under a cloud of suspicion and embarrassment , they resolved pressure from washington lawyers the heavy artillery , judge mcdermott called them seemed to have little effect judge mcdermott , more accustomed to settling disputes over stolen lawn mowers in his courtroom , shut them up as easily as he did the county s own lawyer , holding up a large hand , as if to indicate , like a school principal enough ann mcfall , the other republican on the board , had sharp words for her party member , katherine harris , the secretary of state and one of mr bush s closest allies in florida it was mrs mcfall who suggested yesterday that mrs harris should have recused herself from ruling on the county s procedures and so it went for three days sure , judge mcdermott and other board members said , some people may regard them as traitors to their respective parties i can handle it , he said plainly after a week filled with moments of enmity , comedy and exhaustion , judge mcdermott finally retreated today to his modest single story home a few minutes' drive from the county administration building a man who expresses contempt for all forms of pretension , judge mcdermott padded about his spartan living room in dark blue socks on one couch was a stack of laundry from his recent trip to new york city a place he said he adores for its restaurants , its culture and the concierge at his favorite hotel , the lowell , on east 63rd street judge mcdermott is considered something of a maverick here , a loner with an intellectual streak by all accounts he does not club around at republican fundraisers and he eagerly took on the volusia county establishment a few years ago during a protracted dispute over where to build a new county courthouse i'm a very private person , he said , all the while clearly enjoying his newfound prominence as chairman of the canvassing board , judge mcdermott was responsible for one of the more bizarre and troubling images in the florida election after a republican lawyer raised allegations later unfounded about the possible theft of ballots from the volusia elections office , judge mcdermott ordered deputies to secure the building with crime scene tape according to judge mcdermott , powerful party officials from both sides complained but he refused to budge until he extracted public pledges from both sides that they were satisfied with the security of the volusia ballots the episode , he said , set a tone for the days to come a sense that no group of outsiders , no matter how well connected , would be allowed to sully this county s reputation or steamroll its officials on one occasion mrs mcfall dismissed a republican monitor from the counting room for making a fuss the matter was resolved , but not before angry republicans denounced mrs mcfall as , of all things , a democrat it s affidavit time , they cried , gearing up for legal action against her except for the phone call from mr butterworth the board members said they were not lobbied by highranking state and national officials from either party nobody said to me , 'pat , we need you to find us some ballots , ' mrs northey said this is a place where democrats and republicans have worked together for years , and in the case of mrs northey and mrs mcfall reared their children together mrs mcfall s husband , bob , was scoutmaster to both of mrs northey s children mrs northey appointed mrs mcfall to a panel to review the county charter mrs mcfall appointed mrs northey to serve on a school superintendent search panel i know how ann operates , and she is absolutely ethical , she said , adding that their friendship of 20plus years is probably stronger because of this mrs northey was a lastminute appointment to the canvassing board , replacing james ward , a democrat who would not cancel his vacation to aruba , constitutional crisis or not today , as the cnn truck pulled out of town , life returned to its usual rhythms in his living room , judge mcdermott spoke wistfully of his retirement plans he wants to take two classes at nearby stetson university one , he said , is on ethics and greek tragedy the other \? ideas in mathematics , he said photos two of the leading principals in the florida dispute are intensely political and partisan figures , attorney general robert a butterworth and secretary of state katherine harris vice president al gore and his mother , pauline , talked with mr butterworth in a campaign visit in may gov george w bush

first thing first if the yankees had any class , they would withdraw from the playoffs and not foist an embarrassing team on major league baseball s brightest time of the year where is george steinbrenner when an apology is really needed , not just to the people of new york \( see 1981 world series \) but to all of baseball \? none of the previous 37 teams in the yankees' glorious history that won pennants or division championships \( except for the 1981 strike season \) finished with as few victories as this team s 87 certainly none lost its last 7 games or 15 of its last 18 if a fisherman catches 37 fish , each weighing 15 to 25 pounds , then catches a twopounder , he throws the twopounder back but operating under the hope and the prayer , not to mention the baseball cliche , that anything can happen in a short series , the yankees are at oakland poised to fake it as well as they can they were joined there yesterday by the mets in a twopronged new york assault of the bay area new york vs oakland , new york vs san francisco baseball has never had such a geographical and philosophical encounter if not for the yankees' humiliating collapse , the metropolitan areas would have traded home spotlights the athletics playing the first two games at yankee stadium , then taking the yankees to their home , while the giants returned to new york for two games against the mets at shea stadium after two at the spanking new pacific bell park but both series are in the bay area for the first two games , then switch to new york for nos 3 and 4 , including a potential doubleheader saturday with the yankees playing in the afternoon , the mets at night subway series \? before the first pitch of the first playoff game is thrown , a bart battle seems more likely eleven years ago , the giants and the athletics played a world series by bart , as the bay area rapid transit is known , and no one has played a more memorable world series when the yankees used to play the giants or the dodgers that was the new york giants and the brooklyn dodgers the rivalries and game developments produced the excitement the thrills in the 1989 bart battle came courtesy of an earthquake , 71 on the richter scale but the giants and the athletics reached that world series by defeating the chicago cubs and the toronto blue jays , respectively those pairings did n't have the glamour and the pizazz created by two new york teams simultaneously invading the bay area at the same time , the new york teams hope their visits do n't suffer the interruption the 1989 world series did , a 12day hiatus between game 2 in oakland and game 3 in san francisco , while the area struggled to rebound from the devastation play two games and get to new york , where highways do n't collapse but teams do the difference is that the way the yankees spend money , they can make repairs far faster than a highway crew they did that just before and just after midseason and very likely would not even have returned to the playoffs had they not fixed the team but the september swoon \( no , the mets did not copyright that phrase \) came too late for external repairs whatever aid the yankees generate will have to come from within that they have the richest roster in baseball history from which to seek help can serve as some consolation the mets , too , have one of the wealthiest rosters this season the other half of the dual duel , on the other hand , are among the bottom half of the salary standing , though with differences in payroll level nearly as great as the differences in their home parks the giants \( 54 million payroll \) and the athletics \( 32 million \) combined pay their players less than the yankees pay theirs \( 102 million or 112 million , take your pick \) but these bay area contestants should not be confused with each other just because of their geographic proximity they are n't even distant cousins the giants played this season in a new 319 million park they financed and built they attracted 33 million fans , an increase of 12 million over last year the athletics play in an unappetizing coliseum that is as old as they are they drew 17 million fans , their most in seven years , but still in the bottom third of major league attendance just as the mets have struggled and , more recently , spent to gain an equal share of new york , the athletics have had to scrap in search of equal status in the bay area despite their greater success on the field their owners would like to move the team 40 miles south to san jose , the heart of silicon valley , but the giants claim that territory and say they will block the athletics from usurping it with that potentially damaging difference between them , the bay area teams could hardly be expected to mount a united front against the invaders from new york damn civic pride , full speed ahead win our series and let them lose theirs now , nothing like that attitude could separate the mets and the yankees , could it \?

auckland , new zealand , saturday , feb 19 after a long week in which tongues , not sails , were the main things flapping in the breeze , the time for talking appeared to be over the first race in the fiveofninerace america s cup finals between the local heroes , team new zealand , and the pride of italy , the prada challenge , was scheduled to begin today but there was barely a breath of air under a blazing sun , the crews waited 90 minutes before the race was postponed to sunday the breeze was just two knots at the scheduled start , and light winds are forecast for sunday as in most of the 29 cup matches that have preceded this one , a touch of controversy has been floating in the air but it has been overshadowed by the probing chatter concerning the one and only question that truly matters who s bringing the faster ride \? the primary bone of contention regarded two proposed additions to the sailing rules by the cup s current minder , the royal new zealand yacht squadron the kiwis wished to place an official observer aboard the boats who would work in concert with the onwater umpires to make rulings in tight situations they also wanted all penalty turns to be executed immediately after a foul , a change from the challenger trials , when boats were free to exonerate themselves in most situations at any time during the course of the race the italians took umbrage to both suggestions , the first on the grounds that the englishspeaking observers would be making calls in what for many crewmen is their second language , and the second because in a prestart situation they felt that the burden would unfairly affect the outcome of the race in a match race , spotting the opposition an early lead is a huge and often decisive advantage and , in fact , it may well have given the aggressive new zealand helmsman russell coutts an important edge prada would have none of it , and filed a formal request to the cup s international arbitration panel to rule on the dispute but the larger matter became moot when a mediator negotiated a compromise between the camps , and the instigation of immediate penalty turns was dismissed and the observer problem took care of itself when the designated judges simply refused to board the boats they had been delegated to a spot on the transom under the boat s antennas and other electronics , and feared the possible exposure to radiation they had a nice seat , too , right in an electric chair , said torben grael , prada s tactician the outcome of a potentially larger issue has yet to be resolved in the challenger trials , no race was started when winds blew consistently above 18 knots no lower wind range was established , but the race committee regularly began races in breezes below 10 knots it has been thought that the kiwis would relish sailing in fresher winds , a fact confirmed by the principal race officer , harold bennett but regarding the matter of lightair racing , which many believe would favor prada , he remained noncommittal in winds of seven or eight knots , the conditions can be very shifty and unstable , and i doubt we 'd want to start a race , he said at the top end , if we have 25 knots of southwest wind and flat water , those are good conditions prada s designer , doug peterson , stirred the pot all week , telling anyone within listening distance that he believed nzl 60 , the kiwi boat , was riddled with speedsapping flaws , particularly a ballast bulb with wing in its center , not aft though coutts has maintained an incredibly low profile for the last several weeks , he finally spoke about peterson s comments at a friday news conference , calling the prada designer s opinion disconcerting coutts added everyone thinks what we 've chosen is so wrong i guess we 'll have to wait and see whether it is or not coutts was less diplomatic when an italian journalist asked him why he had skipped a midweek reception for both crews , and about reported riffs between the sailors and the administrators behind the gates of the kiwi compound i think that s a ridiculous question , he snapped let s move on those wondering if the kiwis are feeling the pressure of their first defense have nothing to go on but idle speculation as for prada , rod davis , the americanborn head coach , believes his crew is ready for whatever lies ahead if there s anything i 've learned about the italian style , it s that it s understated , he said but these guys have proven again and again that they 're a tough bunch i guarantee that whatever happens , they wo n't fall apart there is no more to be said the next important sound will be the starting gun
there are easier things to do than run a community theater , especially one with a native american theme it s a concept that escapes most people , said marty black eagle carl , founder , president and producing artistic director of algonkuin theater company in hamden they have no clue , said mr carl , who bills the algonkuin as the only native american theater in connecticut really some would guess that we do only native shows or that we 're connected to one of the casinos and have money or that we do cowboy and indian shows algonkuin theater company has existed since 1993 after mr carl directed his own adaptation of gaston leroux s phantom of the opera for talent hut players in seymour , he and a handful of friends decided to start their own company we based it around the idea of promoting native theater when we could find it , mr carl said also , to do other interesting plays that we enjoyed or would like to direct and act in because there is not exactly a surplus of native american plays , algonkuin stages a shakespeare production every summer of the group s four to five annual productions , one or two are native american plays since the algonkuin has no permanent home , it presents plays in new haven at the church of the redeemer , the educational center for the arts and the little theater , and in hamden at the miller memorial library and the eli whitney barn mr carl , who claims blackfoot , african and european heritage , said his aim was to bridge the gap of understanding of native american culture by producing plays by and about native americans so far , mr carl said that most of the native shows have been historic in essence , including elegy for an icon and please do not touch the indians this year we doing a modern time frame native play called someday' by drew hayden taylor , said mr carl marty has always been very into his native american background , said peggy hackett , a longtime friend of mr carl who has helped with set design and lighting since the company was founded as it turned out , most of us that formed the original board had native american blood in us also , so we thought that would be a neat way to go since there did n't seem to be many other native american theater companies around once the algonkuin s founders committed to a native american agenda , they had difficulty finding accessible plays we did n't have plays like the euros did , mr carl said but there was native theater , mostly being religious in content as all theater none of it survives except what s still used in religious practices ms hackett added that most native american plays she is familiar with are not exactly comedies either they usually center around the problems that native americans have gone through such as alcoholism , depression , rape , suicide and of course the mass destruction of their way of life it s stuff that needs to be said and remembered but a more upbeat show would probably draw more people in but the algonkuin might still have a tough time marketing them if they have not run on broadway , which very few have and so the company survives on a calculated mix of popular plays and native work \( its first production , in 1993 , was phantom of the opera with a native spin \) small theater is tough outside of new york because most people wo n't come out to see plays that they 've never heard about , mr carl said people who have seen our work know that we do a wide range of shows , so that s how we get the audiences who come back they 've seen our shakespeare or our neil simon , and some will come back for our artsy shows , or our obscure native shows , because they know they 'll see something good since new haven is n't known for having a large native community , we just try to keep producing good , professional shows all the way around , he said we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today the algonkuin theatre welcomes anyone wishing to work on productions tanya feduiksmith started volunteering last summer when her husband played the title role in hamlet she directed the algonkuin s most recent production of much ado about nothing , which was presented last month at the eli whitney barn i 'd gotten really interested in directing and marty gave me the chance to direct a couple of shows for the company , which i really enjoyed doing , she said mr carl s wife , margaret , stage manager for many of the theater s productions , said the company s financial constraints have not been all bad it really forces us to be creative , and we are fortunate to find actors who are willing to put their best efforts into a project they do n't get paid for it s great when we get people , especially friends and relatives of the actors , who rarely or never go to live theater and tell us how much they enjoyed it , she said algonkuin theater s next production is the area premiere of someday , by drew hayden taylor , running nov 3 to 18 the production , directed by mr carl , will be presented at the black box theater at church of the redeemer , whitney avenue and cold spring , new haven the algonkuin theater s web site is www algonkuin org photos props for the latest show by the algonkuin theater company at right , marty black eagle carl , left , the group s founder , talking to john benedetto , an actor we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today , mr carl said \( photographs by michael doolittle for the new york times \)
two ellen burstyns can be seen on new york screens this week there is the 1973 ellen burstyn , starring in the exorcist the version you 've never seen , a reissue of the horror classic with scenes restored by the film s screenwriter , william peter blatty and then there is the ellen burstyn of 2000 , starring in a different kind of horror movie requiem for a dream , a toughminded independent film about a brighton beach boy \( jared leto \) and his housebound mother \( ms burstyn \) , who become involved with drugs in different but equally dangerous ways \( review , page 27 \) it is the work of darren aronofsky , who made an impressive debut with pi in 1998 unlike the exorcist , this movie shows ms burstyn becoming a monster as she grows addicted to diet pills to provide a visual correlation to her character s initial blossoming and subsequent collapse , ms burstyn brought in her longtime hairdresser , paul leblanc , and had him make some sketches as soon as darren saw them , he said , 'go , do it ! ' she said he gave paul full range to do all of those wild hairdos those were very radical concepts paul actually had flames coming out of my head ms burstyn received an oscar nomination for the exorcist and won an oscar for alice does n't live here anymore in 1975 there is already talk of a nomination for requiem , but ms burstyn , who is also appearing in a cbs drama , that s life , says she finds job satisfaction in things other than awards there are moments when i'm acting when i'm doing my work , let s say onstage and on film , where 'it' happens , she said and when 'it' happens , i'm just taking a ride i'm not doing it when that happens i can feel the force coming through me , and i know for sure i'm channeling it you know how i think of it \? van gogh s painting starry night , ' and the church is down here , about this big in the painting and there s this little tiny spire sticking up into all of this energy up in the sky the stars and the cosmos and everything that s going on up there and we 're down here it s like the church is our little teeny attempt to penetrate and call to and understand these enormous forces it seems to me that any kind of artist , a skilled artist , learns the way to open so that you can be a receptor and a sender of those forces , ms burstyn said but you do feel it go through you and when that happens , it s so humbling , it s such a blessing and that s what i'm always working for once i felt that , i wanted it to happen all the time sarah bernhardt used to say when it happened to her , when she came off the stage , 'god was there tonight' that s an intoxication it happened three times during this movie learning on the job if john turturro seems a little peaked , it s understandable it s been a busy year , even by the standards of this hardworking performer after directing his own film in 1998 , illuminata , and spending months on the offandon shoot of tim robbins s cradle will rock , mr turturro said , he realized i'm going to have to go back to work and support my family i kept looking around , reading things usually when you want to do that , there is n't a lot but then what happened was that all the things i was interested in were suddenly financed or mostly financed and suddenly mr turturro found himself committed to five films in a row normally , i 'll do one or two films a year if i'm acting but five s like , too much but mr turturro survived the experience , even turning it to his advantage the whole year i kept learning new things , going from being a straitlaced guy to a mississippi guy to being a russian chess player that s how i ate lunch learning the dialect for the next thing in some ways , it was like being back at yale drama school you would be studying ibsen or strindberg and then at night you would be in a cabaret mr turturro first signed up for 2000 and none , a canadian comedy to be directed by arto paragamian , a firsttime director , in which he would play an armenian paleontologist dying of a rare brain disease while he was waiting for that script , he did a role for a director friend , doug mcgrath , in the political farce company man once 2000 and none wrapped in montreal he went straight to mississippi and had his head shaved for his part as a fugitive from a chain gang in joel and ethan coen s depression comedy , o brother , where art thou \? i literally did n't know where i was for a few hours , mr turturro said thank god i was with the coens , who i know really well from mississippi , mr turturro flew to paris , where he played an italian tenor with fascist leanings in the man who cried , a drama by sally potter \( who wrote , directed and starred in the tango lesson \) after a twoweek break home in new york , he returned to europe to shoot the luzhin defense for the director marleen gorris \( antonia s line \) the film is based on nabokov s story of an eccentric chess genius did you see 'the luzhin defense , ' how tired i was by the end \? he said i was n't acting anymore i really was sort of a basket case mr turturro is making the festival rounds on behalf of the lighthearted 2000 and none , which is still seeking an american distributor in spite of its subject , imminent death , mr turturro said this was fun i was curious to see if you could find the right tone for something like that it was a very elusive thing , because you could n't underpack it or overpack it when you 're doing it , you ca n't think about whether or not it s going to be funny , though somewhere in the back of your brain you know it could be in retrospect , it was a really good year , in terms of playing all kinds of different parts , mr turturro concluded but right now , he s ready for some sleep photo ellen burstyn , who is in exorcist and requiem for a dream

the 2000 giants could win their remaining games , win the national football conference east , earn a playoff bye and then defeat a team like the philadelphia eagles in the second round of the playoffs they would have won 13 of 17 games , the thirdbest record in the modern era of the franchise only the two super bowl teams won more games the giants would be preparing for the nfc championship game , and if a team like the minnesota vikings stumbled along the way , the giants could even play that game at giants stadium they would be a game away from the super bowl and what would people be saying about the giants \? that they have n't beaten anyone good yet it would be funny if it were n't so true without question , the giants have not yet passed the essential crossroads of their season they could still bow out early from the playoffs , or they might still collapse and not make the playoffs at all no one should be labeling them super bowl contenders but the skepticism about their achievements this season has gone too far people are confusing aesthetics with accomplishment at some point , the giants deserve praise for making so much of a season that began with insignificant expectations they have played well , and maybe it s time to just say that and leave it at that the giants have an image problem and it has little to do with football yards , first downs , points the problem stems from the fact that the giants are rarely fun to watch when they are bad , as they were against detroit two weeks ago , they are revolting when they are good , as they were against washington on sunday , they are less revolting but do not miss the larger point the giants are winning the way they have to right now if it eventually catches up with them against a team like minnesota , remember that super bowl teams are usually not built in a season it does not mean that the giants are not making progress they are it s true there is no dynamic quality to the offense in fact , the giants can be frustrating with the ball are they a runbased team , led by tiki barber and ron dayne , or a mediumrange passing team directed by kerry collins \? why do n't they throw the ball deep more \? why do n't they stick to the run when dayne is going good \? why do n't they throw more to the tight end \? but the offense this season is still vastly improved it is without question the best giants offense since phil simms s last season , in 1993 statistically , it is the team s best since 1985 this year s team is averaging 3372 yards gained per game , the most since the 1985 team averaged 3678 the giants' redesigned offensive line consistently opens holes for the running backs , does not commit many penalties and protects collins dayne is getting better , and barber , if he can just stay healthy , is the most dangerous player on offense collins is maturing , showing leadership and grit in difficult situations late in the game sunday , with the crowd at fedex field in washington on its feet after the redskins' only touchdown , you could feel the giants wobbling collins dropped back on third down needing 9 yards no one was open and the crowd screeched because collins was about to be hit in the pocket collins thought he saw amani toomer breaking over the middle , but he did not know if he had time to fire the ball in there how many recent giants quarterbacks from dave brown to danny kanell to kent graham would have taken a sack there \? all three collins later said of the sequence , sometimes , you 've just got to throw it he did it sailed just past toomer , but joe jurevicius , who was running the wrong route , jumped over two redskins for the football first down how many recent giants wide receivers from thomas lewis to kevin alexander to david patten would have found a way to go up and make that play \? none the giants' offense is getting better the giants' defense , meanwhile , is already capable of playing with virtually any team in the conference it cannot be overstated how commanding it was on sunday against a team whose offense had toyed with the giants in recent games the giants have one or two holes defensively , but defensive tackle keith hamilton is playing well enough to be in the pro bowl , michael strahan is coming on and free safety shaun williams is all over the field knocking people silly the giants have a future star in defensive lineman cornelius griffin and , if jason sehorn can stay healthy , he still has the talent to win a game by himself if their defense continues to solidify , the giants will be a tough opponent for anyone when the season is over , people may still be saying that the giants did not beat anyone good do not believe it the giants are a work in progress , but one of the things they are good at is making other teams look bad or as coach jim fassel said in a perfectly idiosyncratic moment , we force the other people not to play good , too at times like these , with the playoffs a heartbeat away , it s worth appreciating the art in that , too
las vegas , march 3 in a punishing 12round duel , felix trinidad pounded david reid to score a unanimous decision and take away reid s world boxing association superwelterweight championship at an outdoor arena here at caesars palace tonight it was a completely different trinidad than the one who had won a majority decision over oscar de la hoya in a welterweight title bout here on sept 18 tonight , trinidad was ferocious as he sent reid to the canvas four times in thoroughly dominating the last seven rounds reid sent trinidad to the canvas in the third round with a right cross , but trinidad bounced right up it was reid s last best chance of getting to trinidad the knockdown did not bother me , trinidad said if you do n't get me in the first few rounds , the fight is over i came here to win that s what i told everyone i was going to do , and i did it the judge duane ford scored the bout 114106 , while the judges stanley christodolou and jerry roth both scored the bout 114107 reid did not win a round on any judges' scorecard after the fifth round reid \( 141 \) lost the first bout of his professional career , while trinidad \( 370 \) remained undefeated and can now try for a rematch with de la hoya he hit me with some good shots , reid said i have to be a gentleman and take the loss and come right back experience played a factor in the later rounds i should have been hitting him with more punches as a man , as a fighter , the referee saw that i could continue i was n't going to quit i have respect for every opponent tito was the better man tonight reid , an olympic gold medalist on the united states team in 1996 , had done a good job of using his speed to control the first five rounds but he began to go on the defensive in the sixth round , and in the seventh round , when trinidad opened a cut over the side of reid s eye , reid went into an even more conservative mode perhaps sensing that he was trailing in the fight , trinidad opened up his offense at the start of the sixth round and came out throwing power shots he caught reid with a couple of shots , but was penalized a point by the referee mitch halpern for throwing a low blow in the seventh round trinidad caught reid with a blistering combination , landing a left on the chin that stunned reid and sent him reeling into the ropes reid went down to the canvas while trying to avoid more shots from trinidad reid made it up by the count of seven as the round ended in the eighth round halpern called timeout to have the ring doctor , flip homansky , take a look at a cut on the top of reid s right eye halpern let the fight continue trinidad continued to press in the ninth round , and reid was not doing anything to keep him off of him by the 10th round reid was in bad shape he was holding on with sheer courage trinidad had taken him where none of his other 14 opponents ever had in the 11th round trinidad battered reid , knocking him to the canvas three times now , it seemed like only a matter of time before he would be hoisting reid s title over his head despite dire predictions by de la hoya s promoter , bob arum , that he did not think this bout would happen , because he believed don king , trinidad s promoter , would lose too much money on the fight , it happened king s critics had poohpoohed the idea of having this fight outside at caesars palace the way that so many world championship bouts had been held in the 1980 s but it was a beautiful march night outside the temperature was in the mid60 s when the card began reid , who had won his wba championship after just his 11th fight , had called this the first defining fight of his career and he was right though trinidad had fought only once at 154 pounds three years ago , knocking out troy waters in the first round of a bout at madison square garden trinidad , 27 , had been the welterweight champion since 1993 three years before reid won a gold medal at the 1996 olympics in atlanta this was a 40 million risk for trinidad that is the amount of money that trinidad had waiting for him in a contract that calls for two bouts against de la hoya de la hoya fulfilled his end of the deal by getting past derrell coley last week in new york trinidad was looking to get past reid to keep hopes of the rematch alive he did in convincing fashion i'm fighting de la hoya i 'd love to fight him he s fighting mosley next , so i do n't care if i fight him , trinidad said i plan to move up in weight slowly , up to the 160 s and maybe fight joppy then , maybe to 168 and fight roy jones punch lines the moment that everyone in boxing knew was coming from the time lennox lewis defeated evander holyfield last november to win the undisputed heavyweight championship has arrived the world boxing association has scheduled a hearing in philadelphia for monday to determine whether to strip lewis of its title lewis was supposed to defend the wba version of the championship first however , the no 1 contender , henry akinwande , was not available because he had not been cleared of the hepatitis virus that had scuttled a june 1998 bout against holyfield the wba made john ruiz the no 1 contender , but lewis bypassed ruiz to fight michael grant , the international boxing federation s no 2 contender , on april 29 at madison square garden the wba will hear from lewis s representatives on monday as to why he should not be stripped of its title for not fighting ruiz the wba could decide to give lewis an extension on defending the title or it could strip him outright ruiz and holyfield are scheduled to fight on may 20 if lewis is stripped of the title , that bout could be for the vacant title photos felix trinidad , left , knocking down david reid during the seventh round last night as

phones in cars in a 12to6 vote , the suffolk county legislature made driving with a handheld cell phone a crime , carrying a 150 fine officials said that even if the county executive , robert j gaffney , vetoed the bill , there were enough votes to override the veto suffolk is believed to be the nation s first county and its largest entity , with about 14 million inhabitants to adopt such a ban similar ordinances have been passed recently in marlboro , nj brooklyn , ohio and three towns in pennsylvania a similar bill is under consideration in westchester county , and at least 13 nations , including britain , israel , italy and australia , have bans the laws have been prompted by a conviction among lawmakers that drivers using cell phones are distracted , and are more likely to harm themselves and others the bill prohibits the use of a cell phone while driving unless it is equipped with an earpiece or can act like a speakerphone , leaving the driver s hands free emergency calls are exempted from the ban people are allowed to dial while driving , and to hit a button to answer incoming calls , as long as they do not hold a phone gerard mccreight , an aide to the bill s sponsor , jon cooper , said the debate lasted two and a half hours last night mr cooper , a democrat from huntington , said , the goal is to prevent accidents and save lives , and i believe this bill will accomplish that while acknowledging that conversing on a cell phone could be distracting , he said the public would not tolerate a total ban on cell phones in cars research on the dangers of cell phone use in cars is scant , as many law enforcement agencies do not yet collect data on whether use of a cell phone contributed to an accident a 1997 canadian study published in the new england journal of medicine , however , found that the risk of an accident increases fourfold if the driver is on a cell phone mr mccreight said that calls from the public to mr cooper s office had favored the bill by a ratio of 10 to 1 but the new law met with rolling eyes yesterday in the hamptons someone is reckless as a driver with or without a cell phone , said julie keyes , owner of the keyesrobbins art gallery in sag harbor it s a bandaid on cancer anne megyas , a photographer , yoga instructor and cell phone owner , said she did not believe it was possible to regulate people s behavior so closely people need cellphone availability in their cars for safety reasons , professional reasons and to maintain contact with child care providers , said ms megyas , a parttime resident of sag harbor but some see the danger in driving while using a cell phone , especially in the hamptons there are too many people with too much money talking unnecessarily , said dr shawn p cannon of east hampton half the population in the hamptons is driving around talking about dinner reservations marek janota of east hampton , a 21yearold college student and plumber , said he thought the ban would hurt his business i do n't think they should pass it because i spend a lot of time driving , and part of my business is being on the cell phone and talking to customers , he said the suffolk legislature has a certain bent for banning things in 1984 , it adopted one of the first and most restrictive bans on smoking in public places within the last year it banned the sale to minors of herbal cigarettes and laser pointers , and passed a law allowing the police to place boots on the car wheels of parents who were behind in child support payments new york and 26 other states have considered bills banning the use of cell phones while driving , but none have passed , said melissa savage , a policy specialist with the national conference of state legislatures in denver some who raise questions about the cellphone ban say a crackdown is needed on all forms of driver distractions , including reading newspapers , applying makeup , trying to settle small children and managing pets kevin moore , a spokesman for verizon wireless , praised the new jersey senate s move last month to create a task force to study driver distraction we do favor that approach , to look at all distractions , whether or not people are properly using their cell phone or fumbling putting a cassette into their tape deck or reading at the wheel , he said mr moore noted that the company had pledged that by 2002 it would sell only phones with builtin speakerphone and voiceactivateddialing capabilities and with a universal jack that allowed virtually every headset to plug into it , so people could make calls without using their hands one suffolk resident , arthur herzog of wainscott , the author of such books as the swarm and orca , saw a silver lining in the ban perhaps , he suggested , there is just too much yammering going on anyway , on or offroad this is cellphone land , he said i think people talk too much already , and anything that cuts down unnecessary conversation is positive
camden ian hawker was convicted and sentenced in bergen county last year for a fairly simple offense , hindering arrest , and was eligible for parole march 10 that was the day when unless the parole board established that he was likely to commit another crime he was supposed to be able to walk out the door at riverfront state prison here last week , more than six months after it was due , parole officials put together the paperwork necessary for a hearing the 36yearold brooklyn man could be out soon , but his problem will remain before the federal district court here although his case is far from the most egregious in the system , where delays of a year are not uncommon , he is one of three named plaintiffs at riverfront in a lawsuit claiming that the troubled new jersey state parole board is leaving hundreds of inmates without hearings while their parole eligibility dates come and go the suit , filed last month , has brought new attention to an agency determined to avoid it while parole board officials say they are catching up with a problem that was much worse a year ago , news reports of the backlog has raised questions which the board will not answer because the matter is in court as to whether its official reports to other state agencies wittingly omitted several hundred cases nor is that the end of the accusations the board s chairman , andrew b consovoy , is himself under investigation for irregularities in several cases , according to people contacted by investigators and for months the board has shut off the public its telephone line is answered by a recording that instructs all callers , including attorneys , that inquiries can be handled only in writing the problem , the board s critics say , is an agency that answers to no one except the governor while serving or disserving a group that has little public sympathy or official representation they operate with nobody over them , said atiba kwesi , an inmate at riverfront who collected hundreds of complaints for the lawsuit the only person who tells them what to do is the governor , and she s , like , 'do what you want to do' in an interview at riverfront , mr kwesi said that between pursuing his own case , now in federal court in trenton , and working as a law clerk in the prison library , he had become a magnet for inmate grievances pulling folders from a carton , he described a blitz of 100 letters asking for help initiating a class action lawsuit except for the american friends service committee in newark , nobody wrote back , he said nobody cared joseph a osefchen , one of two haddonfield lawyers who took on the case , acknowledged that telling people he represents criminals is kind of like saying , 'i work at the leper colony' it could n't happen to any other group they do n't answer their phones , he said of the board , with some incredulity if you were a year behind on social security payments , there 'd be blood in the streets the suit claims that the number of inmates who have passed their parole dates without the required hearings could be as many as 1 , 000 the board s latest report lists about 300 but according to a document given to reporters by sources close to the board who described it as an internal accounting of cases that are in a special investigative unit and not included in the board s official report another 729 inmates were awaiting hearings as of last month no one knows how many others are past eligible but not counted as such because the case files required for hearings are incomplete a problem that parole board officials blame on the department of corrections hundreds more have been heard by a panel , but deferred , some of them for years , without any decision this seems to go well beyond the bounds of what s permissible , said marc mauer , the assistant director of the sentencing project , an advocacy group in washington while no one keeps statebystate numbers on parole backlogs , mr mauer said , nobody here is aware of that being a substantial issue in other states it s worse in new jersey than in other places , he said they literally just do n't do it on time in other states , he said , inmates may complain that they get five minutes with the parole board or the governor does n't want to parole anybody , but technically they follow the law jayne o'connor , governor whitman s press secretary , said that the governor has consistently directed the board to eliminate the backlog the backlog has been significantly reduced , and the governor expects it to be reduced further , ms o'connor said in new jersey , the courts are inmates' only avenue of redress against state agencies and unlike new york , which has a statefinanced agency that litigates on behalf of prisoners , new jersey leaves them to represent themselves or find a private lawyer the department of the public advocate , which had an office that represented prisoners in civil suits , was abolished by governor whitman in 1994 , and the public defenders office only represents inmates in their criminal cases
how quaint the literary criticism of lionel trilling can seem , now that successive waves of structuralism , deconstruction , cultural studies , postcolonialism and other literary technologies have transformed university departments of literature it has been a quartercentury since trilling died , and more than a half century since he published the liberal imagination , his first collection of essays and most important book who now would think to write essays called art and neurosis or manners , morals and the novel except to question whether the words art , neurosis , manners , morals or novel have any permanent meaning \? in fact , in the 1940 s , when trilling first became a prominent intellectual as an english professor at columbia university , the most fashionable approach to literature was known as the new criticism it boasted an abstract , furiously modern vision each literary work could be analyzed without reference to the author , his life or time criticism was to become a science trilling insisted on just the opposite criticism , like literature , had to engage with the full mess of human life , most notably the customs and beliefs we call politics he got more than he bargained for politics can now seem to be a main point of literary studies in a new collection of essays about trilling lionel trilling and the critics opposing selves even the editor , john rodden , acknowledges that for many contemporary readers trilling may seem little more than a curiosity of literary history , a period piece his prose style can only accentuate the impression of things long past it is almost baroque in its winding , hesitating , qualifying , venturing gestures the words variety , difficulty , modulation , complexity abound each phrase is limpid , but the arguments themselves are tentative , often ambiguous so faded has his intellectual aura become that it provides no immunity from the recent biographical accounts by members of his family his widow , diana trilling , in her 1993 memoir , the beginning of the journey , recalled his anguished depressions , petty squabbles and nasty outbursts in the journal the american scholar , his son , james trilling , recently suggested that his father s behavior and intellectual style were consistent with a psychological diagnosis of attention deficit disorder yet mr rodden s anthology reminds a reader that trilling was complicated enough to be hailed by such disparate figures as edmund wilson and irving kristol a second , more significant , new anthology , the moral obligation to be intelligent , edited by leon wieseltier , shows just how much is at stake it is the most capacious and pungent single volume of trilling s work ever published , with writings spanning his entire career classic essays on the kinsey report , on wordsworth , on jane austen and on kipling it also includes trilling s magisterial discussion of henry james s novel the princess casamassima what gives these pieces enduring importance is not trilling s judgment that the kinsey report fetishizes science or that kipling gave nationalism a bad name the essays' subjects really were occasions for trilling to brood on much larger themes that , far from being dated or quaint , have lost none of their urgency the liberal imagination , for example , was partly a critical response to the stalinism that tinged the era s liberalism but in the book s influential preface trilling uncovered deeper tensions within liberalism itself one of the great achievements of modern times , he suggested , was the liberal conception of humanity the view that there were universal and inalienable human rights , and that the powers of reason could both honor those rights and eradicate the world s evils the problem , trilling went on , was that liberalism , in its search for freedom and justice , had to exert power it required legislation and organization stalinism was an extreme oversimplification of liberalism , one in which the social engineering was ruthless but even democratic liberalism , trilling believed , exhibited a simplified view of the world and an unwavering conviction about how the world might be regulated since these qualities of simplification and certainty were themselves illiberal , the enlargement of freedom risked producing a contraction of freedom some paradox of our natures , trilling wrote , leads us , when once we have made our fellow men the objects of our enlightened interest , to go on to make them the objects of our pity , then of our wisdom , ultimately of our coercion the impact on the mind could be even more baleful the ambition of rationally reforming society tended to minimize the importance of the inner life , shrinking the conception of the mind all dark desires , untamable impulses , ambivalent feelings and contradictory thoughts would then be considered failures of the outside world , imperfections in the social order that could be controlled or legislated away in this way , liberalism risked evolving into doctrinaire puritanism or worse
the departures are the talk of station house hallways in a matter of days , the new york police department will be losing its commissioner , howard safir , and his second in command , patrick kelleher within weeks , the deputy commissioner who directs narcotics enforcement will be leaving , as will the chief who supervises police hiring but those departures , however high profile , are only part of a larger surge in retirements by police officers this year in the first seven months of 2000 , 703 police officers of various ranks have filed for retirement , a 38 percent increase over the same period last year police department officials say this represents but a trickle in a department with 40 , 000 officers , but leaders of the their unions say it is the beginning of a major exodus , as officers hand in their badges to pursue betterpaying , less dangerous jobs where no one calls them names we predicted this would occur back six or seven years ago , said capt john driscoll , president of the captains endowment association , a union representing many supervisory officers police officials chose to ignore it because everybody felt that , by the time it became a big problem , they would be retired , he said the reasons for this retirement surge are many but two leading factors are the lure of privatesector jobs in a booming economy and the discontent many officers feel after several years of heightened criticism and pay that lags behind that of some of their suburban counterparts and police officials attribute a large part of the increase to the number of officers who became eligible for retirement in the last two years if the trend continues , the police department will have to recruit enough officers to replace the retirees if it is going to maintain the current size of the patrol force that could be daunting , given the results of recent recruitment drives in new york , as in cities around the country , interest in police careers has fallen even with an unprecedented 10 million recruiting campaign by the new york police department last year , only 15 , 000 people signed up to take the qualifying test although many of the candidates were city residents , which the department had identified as a prime goal , that number was only half the number of candidates who had signed up for the same exam three years earlier this summer , recruiters have had a hard time finding people to fill the next police academy class , which has 1 , 589 slots and is scheduled to begin training late next month at this point we are working very hard to get to that number , said inspector george anderson of the personnel bureau compounding the problem is the fact that the number of officers eligible for retirement those who have completed 20 years of service is about to jump sharply in the mid1990 s , very few officers became eligible for retirement because virtually none were hired two decades before , during the city s fiscal crisis even this year , only 419 officers who were hired in 1980 are scheduled to complete their 20th year but beginning next year , thousands of officers who were hired in the early 1980 s as the city began to rebuild its force will be eligible to retire with a pension equal to half their salary patrick lynch , president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , the union that represents police officers , said he thought that most of the newly eligible officers would choose to retire police officers are not staying on this job , he said that s a firm bet police officials have characterized that sort of statement as union bluster intended to gain leverage at the bargaining table , where the union is seeking a new contract with a sizable wage increase a rookie officer is now paid 31 , 428 a year , and typically earns about 3 , 000 more in overtime , holiday pay and a differential applied for working the night shift department officials said they did not believe that widespread departures were imminent rather , they said , they have made the sorts of adjustments , like an expansion in the number of captain positions so as to create promotion opportunities , that would help prevent an exodus police officials say the recent rise in retirements seems startling only because it follows several years in which retirements fell in 1998 , for example , 617 officers , of all ranks , retired from the department last year , the number of retirements rose to 888 officials project that the number will exceed 1 , 200 this year but the increase in retirements cannot be completely explained by the rise in the number of officers who have become eligible indeed , over the last two years , the rate of retirement has outpaced the rate at which officers have become eligible retirement has become a particularly attractive option in new york because the pension system , as now formulated , rewards people who retire most officers who retire can bring home almost as much money as they did walking a beat with tax breaks and a special benefit known as the variable supplement fund , which provides retired officers with 8 , 500 a year on top of their pension , officers often find that their yearly takehome pay is only several thousand dollars less than what they were earning on the job and those interested in starting a second career could make a windfall compared with what they would have made had they stayed on the job it is not good to lose a large number of veteran officers , said thomas a reppetto , author of nypd a city and its police \( henry holt company , 2000 \) , and some police departments have tried to counter this by making it very attractive for veteran officers to stay , by raising their pay or giving them enhanced status some departments are also trying to bolster their manpower by heavily recruiting for officers in new york city police forces from sunny climes like los angeles and las vegas now make efforts to lure new york officers a prime part of their recruiting strategy , which has only added to the obstacles facing police officials in new york we are going to look at as many strategies as we can to make sure we get the candidates that we need to take our test , said inspector anderson of the personnel bureau one of the city s new strategies was unveiled thursday a 10 million advertising campaign with a compelling story line that features people like the actor ray romano , of the television comedy everybody loves raymond in one ad , he speaks with admiration about his brother , a new york police sergeant i may get the attention , mr romano says of his brother , but he s the one who deserves it mr romano s brother , sgt richard romano , ended up receiving quite a bit of attention , however , at the news conference announcing the campaign in remarks to reporters at the event , sergeant romano said that as much as he loved his job and the department , he was retiring next month i 've done 20 years on the streets , he said , and every man has his point where he says it s his breaking point chart ledger police retirement ranks the number of police retirees is rising and so is the number reaching the required 20 years of service for

while the postelection turmoil boiled on in florida , in other states where the vote was close , officials continued to examine vote totals , and republicans and democrats considered whether to seek recounts none of the states iowa , new mexico , oregon or wisconsin have enough electoral votes to swing the election , but together they could determine the winner , depending on who wins florida s electoral votes recounts might also change the national popular vote , where vice president al gore is narrowly ahead in new mexico , mr gore shot ahead of gov george w bush for a second time after officials in dona ana county said on tuesday that they had misread the total of absentee ballots and had accidentally shortchanged mr gore by 500 votes the dona ana county clerk , rita torres , said election workers thought a handwritten notation about the absentee votes from one precinct indicated 120 for mr gore , when the actual number was 620 immediately after the election , mr gore was leading in new mexico by about 5 , 000 votes out of nearly 600 , 000 cast but late wednesday , officials discovered that 67 , 000 absentee and early ballots had not been counted then on thursday , 257 missing ballots were found in bernalillo county , and officials there decided to recount by hand another 379 ballots that had been rejected by electronic voting machines those votes tilted the state in mr bush s favor , giving him a 4vote lead with the latest results from dona ana county , mr gore was ahead by 374 votes other counties continued to conduct their final canvasses under new mexico law , requests for recounts cannot be made until state officials certify the results on nov 28 republicans have not indicated whether they will seek a recount , but lawyers for the republican party on saturday asked the state police to impound absentee ballots and ballots turned in early in case of a challenge or a recount in iowa , mr gore s lead over mr bush narrowed by about 1 , 000 votes as all of iowa s 99 counties completed their canvasses , tabulating absentee and special ballots and doublechecking their math on the rest of the votes as of tuesday night , mr gore led mr bush by 4 , 053 votes , according to the associated press mr bush picked up most of his extra votes from sioux county , a republican stronghold in northwest iowa one precinct in orange city had inadvertently recorded the same number of votes for mr bush and mr gore the bush total ultimately was correct , but the gore total was actually 895 votes lower , said the county auditor , dennis lange , a republican a few other counties voided several hundred ballots because voters chose more than one candidate for president iowa republicans , who have assigned a monitor for the canvasses in each county , said that after all the totals were in late tuesday they would meet to consider whether to urge mr bush to seek recounts in specific counties or statewide we 'll be poring over them to see if we can find anomalies , or extreme closeness in the vote , said kayne robinson , chairman of the iowa republican party right now , mr robinson said , the total votes from mr bush and mr gore are still quite a ways apart if at the end of the day , he continued , it gets closer and closer , then you 'd say yes and recommend recounts the state democratic party chairman , rob tully , said democrats might recommend that the gore campaign seek recounts , depending on what the republicans do one possible focus of a recount would be cedar county , in eastern iowa , where officials last week recorded the only tie in the state 4 , 025 votes each for mr bush and mr gore on monday , after counting 9 absentee ballots and 6 ballots from people whose registration could not be verified on election day , mr gore squeaked ahead 4 , 033 to 4 , 031 i do n't believe that there s anything that would change anything during a recount , said betty ellerhoff , the cedar county auditor i think it would be a waste of time and energy for everyone , but it s the candidates' choice the campaigns have until 5 pm thursday to request recounts for those counties that finished their canvasses on monday , and until friday at 5 pm for those that finished their canvasses on tuesday in oregon , which had a mailin ballot , nearly 99 percent of the votes have been counted , and mr gore leads by 4 , 765 votes out of about 14 million cast about 23 , 000 remain to be counted if the margin falls below onefifth of 1 percent , about 2 , 800 votes , an automatic recount is required if not , the bush campaign may decide to seek a recount on monday , in a preliminary step , the bush campaign sent a letter to the oregon secretary of state s office asking for information on the number of people allowed to reregister and receive mail ballots right before election day in wisconsin , where mr gore won by 6 , 099 votes , republicans have until nov 22 to decide whether to seek recounts , and republican officials said on monday that they were waiting to see what happened in florida they have set up a telephone hot line and have received about 1 , 000 complaints of voting problems , mostly in milwaukee , including cases where identification was not checked and ballots were not secured republican officials have referred about 30 complaints to the milwaukee county district attorney , e michael mccann , who said he had verified one accusation , that a democratic worker , acting on her own , gave cigarettes to 15 to 25 homeless men to persuade them to fill out absentee ballots mr mccann said he had found no evidence of massive voter fraud , but was continuing to investigate rumors that some students at marquette university voted more than once on tuesday , the student newspaper , the marquette tribune , reported that in an anonymous survey , 174 students admitted voting more than once the students' actions are not likely to make much of a difference , though michael mcgraw , a tribune editor , said of all the multiple votes the students cast , only 25 were for mr gore or mr bush the rest were for themselves , friends or relatives photo steve tingwall of the new mexico state police sat guard

american airlines , the nation s secondlargest airline , said yesterday that it would rearrange flights at its two largest hubs to improve its overall reliability after this summer s high number of delays and cancellations american said that it would slow the number of arrivals and departures and add more time between connecting flights at its hubs in dallas and chicago and in a bolder step , the airline plans to isolate its operations at o'hare international airport in chicago , which it said was one of its most unreliable hubs , so that delays there will not upset its flights elsewhere in the country what we 're doing , in fact , is building a firewall between our o'hare operation and the rest of our network so if there s a snowstorm in chicago it wo n't affect your flight from new york to dallas , said donald j carty , the chief executive of the amr corporation , american s parent the changes , which will take effect oct 1 , appear to take into account criticisms made by the federal aviation administration , air traffic controllers and some members of congress that the major airlines contribute to delays by scheduling more flights at peak hours than the air traffic system can handle the accusation that airlines overschedule is absolutely true , mr carty said yesterday at a meeting with wall street analysts in manhattan his statement contradicted the longheld position of the air transport association , the airline industry lobby the association s current chairman is none other than mr carty himself as delays have increased in recent years , other airlines have also tried revamping their schedules to improve ontime performance with mixed results for example , at newark international airport , continental airlines has shifted flights frequented mostly by holiday travelers to offpeak times to relieve congestion during the busy morning and afternoon hours , when business travelers most want to fly newark has now moved from being the airport with the most delays to being the fourth worst , said greg brenneman , continental s president united airlines , the country s largest airline , extended the scheduled length of all its flights this summer after it experienced a steep decline in ontime performance indeed , the transportation department s inspector general recently concluded that such schedule stretching over the last decade had succeeded in masking how greatly airline delays have grown mr carty said that american planned to eliminate some morning flights at dallasfort worth international airport , its biggest hub , and extend its operations at the airport by about 30 minutes each day to give its passengers and employees a little bit more breathing room american has been making minor changes to its schedule to make it run more smoothly for years finally , several months ago , its operations staff decided to start from scratch after running computer models , they were surprised to learn that they could make changes that would not only increase ontime performance but also enable their jets to spend more time in the air carrying passengers for example , mr carty said that the changes at o'hare would enable american to fit nine more flights into its schedule using the same number of aircraft it flies today cutting off its o'hare flights from the rest of its nationwide network means that american jets will fly back and forth between chicago and their destinations rather than connecting to other airports from chicago , as they do now for many passengers , the changes may be invisible the guy in burbank who never understood why a snowstorm in chicago affected his flight to atlanta will probably never know the difference because his flight will now simply get to atlanta , said timothy j doke , an american spokesman the extent of the improvements that will result from the changes remains to be seen and despite american s latest moves , mr carty did not hold out much hope that overall reliability of the airline industry would improve significantly during future peak travel seasons the next two summers are going to be pretty ugly , he said , until some new air traffic control technology comes into use he attributed much of this summer s problems to high demand , unusual weather and a covert job action by pilots at united airlines american suffered similar disruption last year when hundreds of its pilots called in sick mr carty also commented on recent speculation that british airways , american s principal european partner , might be forced to back out of its deal with american to complete its proposed merger with klm royal dutch airlines even absent the comprehensive deal we seek with ba , we are , from an alliance standpoint , well positioned in europe , he said , referring to american s partnerships with swissair and sabena of belgium the americanbritish airways alliance has been stalled by regulators on both sides of the atlantic for four years because of fears that it would give the two airlines too strong a position at heathrow airport near london klm has a much closer partnership with northwest airlines that would be difficult to unravel , leading many analysts to say that british airways would link up with northwest instead of american but mr carty said that british airways might find that buying klm would nullify the antitrust immunity now enjoyed by klm and northwest , making a british airwaysklm partnership less attractive photo donald j carty , the chief executive of american airlines' parent company \( associated press \)

unlike most hiphop acts of the 1980 s , de la soul did n't hone its skills at block parties on the streets of new york city or los angeles its members practiced on turntables set up in their suburban long island bedrooms they did n't make a name for themselves at clubs like hotel amazon , a former hiphop mecca on the lower east side in manhattan they performed at their high school in amityville and though gangsta rap and hardcore acts were emerging as dominant musical forces , de la soul rhymed about peace and whimsically proclaimed that it was the daisy age \( da inner sound y'all \) all the same , its 1989 debut album 3 feet high and rising , which eventually sold more than a million copies , shot to the top of the rhythmandblues chart and showed that hiphop could infiltrate top 40 music by reaching no 24 on the pop chart the long island trio has been on center stage in the hiphop universe ever since their fifth album , art official intelligence mosaic thump \( tommy boy \) , the first of an ambitious threepart series , hit stores last tuesday it reveals just how far the three posdnous \( whose nickname is plug one \) , dave \( plug two \) and maseo \( plug three \) have come from the days of throwing parties at a room they called the dugout on dixon avenue in amityville it was a small hole , maseo recalled we would sell sodas for 1 or 2 , have mc s battling \( for those who are n't hiphop savvy , mc is another term for rapper \) the album also certifies each de la souler as a veritable elder of their trade , even though each of them has just edged past the age of 30 old or not , de la soul exudes at least as much youthful energy on art official intelligence as on any of its previous releases the group hasalso just headlined the spitkicker tour , which traveled to cities across the country with a lineup that includes thoughtprovoking artists like common sense , talib kweli and pharoahe monch , and hiphop s jester , biz markie , the tour has provided a more lighthearted alternative to this summer s up in smoke tour up in smoke includes dr dre , snoop dogg and eminem , gangsta rappers known for violent lyrics influential from the start , de la soul , along with its former producer prince paul , pioneered on its debut album the use of skits a running dialogue between the song tracks as they wove together a narrative about a tongueincheek television game show now , skits are routine de la soul was also in the vanguard of sampling a once controversial practice of appropriating other artists' music the group was so willing to experiment that a lawsuit was filed against de la soul by the former turtles for sampling their 1968 hit you showed me without their permission it s not unusual to hear snippets of rock , vintage jazz , soul , funk or reggae in contemporary hiphop , but that eclecticism sounded novel when de la soul mixed samples from songs by michael jackson , steely dan , johnny cash , funkadelic and a recording of a french lesson in 3 feet high and rising this sampling style continued on their 1991 gold album , de la soul is dead , which lifted samples from bob marley , chicago , stevie wonder , lou donaldson , parliament and even the soundtrack of grease so how did a group from the suburbs of long island become trailblazers in what is thought to be innercity music \? that answer has a lot to do with long island or strong island , as de la soul refers to it in the 1970 s and 80 s , there was an exodus of black families from new york city to the suburbs dave \( david jolicouer \) and maseo \( vincent mason \) moved with their families to amityville from brooklyn as adolescents posdnous \( kelvin mercer \) moved at a young age from the bronx our parents moved us into a world of boredom , maseo said it allowed our imaginations to go wherever they wanted with proximity to new york city , de la soul could spend time in the capital of hiphop while having space to develop a singular style at home it allowed us to see what was going on in new york city , maseo said and then bring our own ideas to the table , because we did n't always have a lot of outside influence dave agreed the island has given us the opportunity to see more things it broadened our horizons if the three had grown up in the city , they would have rhymed about the same subjects as other artists we had the opportunity to soak in a lot more , dave said and that s why we are who we are today in their lyrics , maseo , dave and posdnous , all of whom still live in or around amityville , have always paid tribute to the island and a quick glance at some of their song titles , which include long island wildin , long island degrees , and wonce again long island , makes it apparent that the trio draws inspiration from their surroundings de la soul was part of the native tongues , a loose alliance of artists including a tribe called quest and the jungle brothers known for idiosyncratic word play and a relatively lighthearted tone , and was the first of them to record while other artists have embraced the violence of gangsta rap acts like nwa or the materialism of rappers like sean puffy combs , de la soul has stuck to making music that mixes a goodtime party vibe with rhymes that have intellectual weight
it s not that martin jacobson is a patient man he is not but mr jacobson , the soccer coach at martin luther king high school , is a realist come on this is new york you put up with it what he and his team tolerate is hard to believe , even in new york changing clothes on the subway because of inadequate locker rooms in the school on manhattan s west side spending 90 minutes taking two trains and a bus to a playing field on randalls island lugging 40 pounds of nets to practice raising money to buy uniforms all of this when new york city has a budget surplus and is committing generous capital dollars to building two minorleague baseball stadiums for the yankees in the st george section of staten island and for the mets in coney island let them have their stadiums , that s ok , mr jacobson said but they are neglecting teenagers in high school we need more cooperation and more money it s not school athletic facilities vs professional sports stadiums there can be both there are both but look at the relative numbers for public school ball fields , in the new city operating budget 10 million for minorleague stadiums , in the new city capital budget 142 million that s 71 million for the yankees complex on staten island \( which includes local improvements like a new esplanade \) 61 million for the mets ballpark , including 30 million to spruce up the boardwalk area and 10 million for temporary ballparks plus plans down the road to contribute 30 million to an amateur sports complex for southern brooklyn , subject to future budget votes all this spending , while mr jacobson and his team ranked among the top five in the country have to finagle just to get playing time at randalls island or at riverbank state park and they are hardly the only ones with such problems only a third of the city s high schools have their own playing fields , and many are in bad shape finding playing space anywhere is a challenge not only are athletic fields in this vertical city scarce , but public schools have to compete with private schools and adult teams that can pay higher users' fees the board of education has a new physical fitness initiative , but the city is still spending almost a third less on sports equipment and supplies than it did on the eve of its fiscal crisis in 1974 this has to make one wonder about priorities especially since none of this is new the problems were documented in a series of new york times articles last year , portrayed on 60 minutes , and cited just last week by mark green , the public advocate the bad publicity did get attention a new private group , take the field , was begun in february and is raising money it is already adding about 3 million to the city s 10 million for athletic fields enough to build at least one major track and field facility in each borough but school officials estimate that they need 300 million to upgrade fields and playgrounds , not to mention pools and gyms it s hard to justify spending over 100 million on minorleague stadiums when not even 40 percent of our high schools have outdoor playing fields , mr green said , adding that the staten island project seems more like patronage than investment , because the borough has been such a stronghold for mr giuliani , until recently a senate candidate in pursuit of votes the mayor says that economic development , not politics , was his motive , and contends that the stadiums will act as catalysts michael g carey , president of his economic development corporation , expressed confidence yesterday that improving barren areas will bring private investments but many an economist disputes that theory building a stadium does n't create development , does n't generate jobs , raise per capita income it does just about nothing , said andrew s zimbalist , an economics professor at smith college who consults with governments about sports facilities just take a drive up to yankee stadium and see all the activity it s spawned there is n't any but city hall is betting that investing in st george and coney island will be different and the city council did what legislatures generally do when voting on spending money in their own communities approve so the yankees and the mets will have their farm teams , if litigation does not get in the way and mr jacobson and his players will continue to scramble nothing s changed , he said i 've learned to accept deplorable conditions hey this is new york
coachella , calif , march 9 the modest indian gambling hall near a truck stop here in the california desert has little of the flamboyance of donald j trump s taj mahal in atlantic city or of numerous las vegas resorts about the only glitz is provided by illuminated starshaped wall plaques autographed by tom jones , crystal gale , shirley bassey and other entertainers who have performed at the casino s combination theaterbingo hall the taj has incredible crystal chandeliers that will absolutely knock your eyes out , said charles j irwin , general manager of the casino , the spotlight 29 , and a former vice chairman of the new jersey casino control commission the vegas places have water effects and pirate ships and that kind of thing this is just a small indian casino but maybe not for long on wednesday , trump hotels and casino resorts announced that it had signed a letter of intent with the twentynine palms band of mission indians to take over the spotlight s management the tribe and trump hotels will raise up to 60 million to turn the betting parlor into more of a resort , which is expected to take on the trump brand name and a dash of mr trump s trademark extravagance the announcement came a day after california voters approved a measure to legalize las vegasstyle casinos on indian lands throughout the state , setting off a scramble by tribes to expand existing casinos or open new ones casino companies from nevada , new jersey and elsewhere are angling to get in on what could become a huge gambling market three las vegas companies , harrah s entertainment , anchor gaming and station casinos , have already announced deals to build and manage tribal casinos , each costing roughly 100 million lakes gaming , a minnesota company that specializes in managing indian casinos , says it has signed up two tribes other deals are expected soon tribal gambling , of course , is already widespread but the expansion of tribal casinos in california is noteworthy because the large population could allow the state to grow quickly into one of the largest gambling markets , perhaps rivaling new jersey bear , stearns has estimated that casino revenue in california will grow to 47 billion in 2004 from about 1 billion a year now but robertson stephens estimates the california market will reach only 26 billion by then by contrast , nevada has about 9 billion in casino revenue and new jersey 4 billion it is also noteworthy because california , next door to nevada , supplies about a third of the visitors to las vegas and an even higher percentage to laughlin , reno and lake tahoe california could thus pose a bigger threat than other states to nevada s gamblingbased economy it s not a positive for las vegas , i can tell you that , said mr trump , whose company runs three casinos in atlantic city and one in indiana but none in las vegas one of the most attractive markets , he and others said , is this area around palm springs , already a sizable tourist spot people from los angeles can drive here in about two hours , less than half the time needed to get to las vegas nevada casinos spent more than 20 million to try to defeat a ballot measure in 1998 to legalize california tribal gambling the bill was approved overwhelmingly , though it was later overturned in court so this year the casinos did not oppose the measure , which got 65 percent of the vote , and instead are trying for a slice of the tribal revenues even the master casino builder stephen a wynn has been scouting , although the planned acquisition of his company mirage resorts by mgm grand will take any decision out of his hands the cabazon band of mission indians , which runs a casino a few minutes' drive from the spotlight , has held talks with mirage and other casino companies , said brenda soulliere , first vice chairman , who said no decision had been made yet there are already about 40 tribal casinos in california with about 19 , 000 slot machines but the state constitution bans nevadastyle gambling , so officials had threatened to shut the casinos down now , casinos will be able to put in fullfledged slot machines , not the socalled video lottery terminals they have now , which do not have arms to pull and print out winnings on a piece of paper the tribes will also be able to have card games like blackjack in which players play against the house \( now players pay 50 cents or a dollar a hand into a pool that is used to pay winners \) but craps and roulette will not be allowed all this could make gambling more attractive in california and with the threat of shutdown eliminated , the tribes will find it easier to get financing to expand i'm just so relieved , said richard m milanovich , chairman of the tribal council of the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians , which spent millions of dollars to win approval of indianrun gambling the tribe s fiveyearold spa casino is housed mainly in a huge canvas tent that stands somewhat incongruously in the middle of upscale palm springs now the tribe is wasting little time on monday , the tribe is expected to announce plans to invest more than 100 million to build a permanent casino with an entertainment center and restaurants , and to replace the adjacent spa hotel with a larger one the tribe , one of california s wealthiest , is also expected to announce an investment of 80 million or more to build a second casino the total number of slot machines is expected to grow to 2 , 000 from 1 , 150
trenton as the state s frontier hills and meadows fill with new housing , they fill with new voters , mysterious and intensely interesting to the political powers in places like somerset , hunterdon , warren and sussex and they may be doing damage to a republican landscape so who are these people bringing so many dual incomes , sport utility vehicles and schoolage children into rural and republican townships \? it s not like they 're democrats , said stephen a salmore , who as a republican political consultant is examining the new exurban wave , but they 'll move off line if needed as mr salmore sees it , and his democratic counterparts concur , the newcomers are largely independents , undeclareds , leaners and ticketsplitters these are the sorts of people who wavered , wrinkled their noses and voted for bill clinton moving off line , of course , is a suburban tradition and a national trend but a little local volatility can burn longstanding political organizations , as republicans learned last fall in some of new jersey s fastestgrowing areas the registration figures are notably unhelpful in a state where every voter is counted as undeclared until he or she votes in a primary the undeclareds make up 56 percent of the electorate in this state , up 10 percentage points just from 1990 and the democrats' share dropped to 25 percent from 32 percent in that decade , while republicans only dipped to 19 percent from 21 percent despite that drift , there are signs that all of new jersey is taking on a more democratic tinge cliff zukin , director of the starledger eagletonrutgers poll , points to a question in his surveys that over the last few years has tried to elicit the political sympathies of all those unaffiliated voters and finds good news for democrats the poll asks those who say they are independents or something else whether they consider themselves truly independent 10 to 15 percent in the end or lean toward one of the major parties when the leaners are added to the affiliated voters , the democrats claim about half the total and the republicans 35 percent to 40 percent more important , mr zukin said , the gap has been growing it opened wide , with democrats taking a 5038 lead during the 1997 gubernatorial campaign it opened wider , reaching 5235 points during president clinton s impeachment hearings the gap now stands at 14 points there is some evidence , too , that the shift is most visible in the fastestgrowing counties , republican territories all take the three that have registered the biggest population gains since 1990 somerset \( 194 percent \) , hunterdon \( 151 percent \) and warren \( 91 percent \) in recent elections , even while republicans enjoyed a hefty and growing registration edge , all three have seen democratic incursions the democratic chairman in somerset , elia pelios , said the party elected 19 municipal officials last fall in 1990 , there were 2 hillsborough and montgomery , filling fast with pricey new houses , were two of the prizes democrats won all four seats in the township committee race in hillsborough , and in montgomery they turned out a republican mayor with 70 percent of the vote in those races , the democrats benefited from hostility to development a pattern cast neatly in hopewell , hunterdon county , where they have taken over the township committee over the last few years with the votes of residents infuriated by merrill lynch s plan to build a huge office complex there it s ironic because many of those who are newly moved to the area are upset about development , mr salmore said , and they 're saying , stop what permitted us to come here where sprawl is the issue and nothing could be more local republicans may be threatened not because they are republicans but simply because they are there still , the restiveness has given democrats a lease on life in places where they had none a lot of local republican elected officials would tell you that when they moved in they had to get active with the republicans because there was n't much of a democratic party , mr pelios said in the last generation s migratory pattern , democrats moved to the suburbs , acquired mortgages and started behaving and voting like republicans but most of those moving to the exurban townships now already have white collars , and ambiguous voting habits the demographics of this inmigration are young people trying to get as much of the good life as they can as quickly as they can , said steve demicco , a democratic political consultant in new brunswick they tend to be independents , people who do not have a strict party affiliation but who are responsive to the kinds of policies that are promoted by clinton democrats a lot of democrats running for congress have latched on to this agenda no one serves the hypothesis better than mr demicco s client rush holt , who won the 12th congressional district , reliably republican for years , in 1998 the 12th district could be described as the growth belt , encompassing hot spots like hopewell , montgomery , monroe and bernardsville representative holt will have a hardfought , bleedingly expensive , nationally watched fight this fall and the results will tell more about the exurban sensibility than the registration numbers can photo
what is most striking about the celebrity portraits that arnold newman photographed for life , look and other magazines is their elegant simplicity as shown in arnold newman \( taschen , 3999 \) , the photographer has focused his camera primarily on artists , writers and political figures for the past 60 years he usually captures his famous subjects with revealing backgrounds or telling compositions a pensive stravinsky is seated at a grand piano that dwarfs the composer as its raised lid resembles an abstract sculpture of a musical note poised on a sofa with wide stripes and matching wallpaper an amused diana vreeland makes her fashion statement with a robe that clashes , yet oddly complements the pattern robert moses is depicted standing messianically on a steel beam suspended over the east river , with blueprints in hand and the manhattan skyline as backdrop as if to remind us that photography is , in a sense , painting with a newfangled brush , newman had several artists pose with an easel or a blank canvas framing their heads , including mondrian , de chirico , man ray , georgia o'keeffe and hans hofmann recent photos of woody allen and president clinton testify that newman has lost none of his skill for apprehending an inner mood with an outer expression david kaufman photo jean cocteau , photographed by arnold newman in paris , 1960 \( from arnold newman \)

princeton your firsthalf property tax bill is coming due do you know where your local politician is \? for nine years , new jersey politics has been fueled by arguments over taxes forget megan s law , forget parental notification over abortions for minors , and forget even auto insurance for now the florio tax debacle , the republicans' skilled exploitation of the opening it provided and the muddle since then have left new jerseyans about where they started , with the highest property taxes of any state with an income tax , which means every place but new hampshire the elderly on fixed incomes and the young buying first houses and having first babies feel it sharply , but so does everyone in between everyone suffers from a system where high local costs \( every little borough with its own 90 , 000 police captain and 150 , 000 schools superintendent \) drives a 13 billion annual property tax bill the result is well known the elderly are forced out of houses they can no longer afford , the young are forced to move farther and farther from where they want to be so when people complain about high taxes in this state , they are usually complaining about property taxes yet governors and legislatures have said property taxes are local and that the only contribution they can make is to cut state income taxes , which governor whitman did with such fanfare early in her administration but what good did it do \? the public will not perceive a tax cut as a reduction unless it involves property taxes , said john h adler , a democratic state senator from cherry hill we saw that when governor whitman tried to get a political benefit from lowering the income tax and found out that it did n't buy her the popularity she expected the governor , when confronted with the problem of property taxes , reasonably pointed out that the problem was a local one , and she did what she could to help municipalities share services and cut costs the next governor will have to face the same realities , and leonard lance , a republican assemblyman , believes that the time to get some thinking done on the matter is during the coming campaign for governor i do n't know the answers , but i do know this , said mr lance , of clinton township the two candidates for governor next year should be asked this allencompassing question of property tax reform and they should not be allowed to dance around it mr lance is part of a movement in the legislature to call a constitutional convention specifically to address the property tax issue , and he has introduced legislation to that effect in the assembly , with senator william e schluter sponsoring a senate bill mr adler supports this idea , as does senator robert j martin , a republican of morris plains new jersey has held three constitutional conventions and they have all improved the state , mr martin said the first , in 1844 , got rid of a britishlike parliamentary system , the second , in 1947 , the big one , produced the state s strong governorship , and the third , in 1966 , was called to have new jersey comply with the united states supreme court s oneman , onevote decision by ending the practice of giving each county one senator ok , we have a convention what are some of the solutions \? not surprisingly , even politicians who favor opening the subject of property tax reform are reluctant to commit themselves to an answer still , it seemed fair to ask the backers of a convention for some possible answers so ideas , please \? mr martin suggested that a statewide property tax would at least stop municipalities from chasing commercial development at the expense houses with schoolbound children i'm not suggesting that i have an answer , but one thing i think we need is wholesale reform , mr martin said and i think we should at least think about a statewide property tax to end the ratables chase mr adler \? have each town have an income tax with the money raised staying in that town , he offered as a possibility that would shift revenues away from property taxes to a fairer tax system without cheating a town of any tax revenue or having it go to bureaucrats to be wasted or having it go to other towns mr lance \? we do n't tax food and clothing in new jersey , he said , speaking the unspeakable i do n't say we should start taxing them , and it may be regressive , but many states do tax food and clothing or maybe we should not tax food but maybe we should tax mink coats the department of the treasury has not calculated the impact of a mink coat tax , but it estimates that extending the 6 percent sales tax to food and clothing would bring in about 2 billion , or about 15 percent of the 13 billion in real estate taxes now paid if all of that money were passed directly to municipalities as if ! to offset housing taxes , it would cut a 4 , 000 property tax to 3 , 600 of course , none of these solutions address the cost side of the problem new jersey s wildly expensive checkerboard of 566 municipalities and about the same number of school districts , about 30 of them without even any schools so here s one more idea singledistrict countywide school systems , ditto for the police keep the volunteer firefighters , bless them , and local zoning other states do it that way , and they are the ones with lower property taxes think about that when you write that check make it out to municipal treasurer photo iver peterson
an oldtime english player and writer , edward mayer , used to insist that to open the bidding at the onelevel it was essential to have an ace this was of course an extreme position , but there is a grain of truth in it aces are undervalued by the standard pointcount , and a borderline hand that lacks an ace should usually remain silent an example is the diagramed deal , on which east failed to heed this principle it was played three weeks ago at a new regional championship in waterbury , conn , and helped an experienced group capture the knockout team title east might have passed or bid two spades , but he chose to open one spade and later regretted it he had 11 highcard points , no aces and a singleton king of limited value north was tom smith of stamford , conn , and he doubled the one notrump response this is one of the very few situations in which a double of a notrump bid is for takeout rather than penalties south was gene saxe , also of stamford , and he eventually balanced with three clubs against two hearts west doubled this confidently , since his partner had opened the bidding and could presumably contribute to the defense north had promised some club length with his double , and felt slightly guilty when he produced a dummy with only 9xx of trumps as it turned out , there were four losers in the trump suit , but none outside it , a rare situation south won the opening spade lead , with the queen over the jack , and ruffed a spade , as west discarded a diamond it seems obvious that south wished to ruff more spades , so his next move was a surprise he led a trump from dummy he had worked out correctly that east held a singleton honor , for west no doubt held four for his penalty double and would have led a trump if holding all the honors when east produced the king , west could not afford to overtake if he had done so , south would have been able to drive out the remaining top trumps and make nine tricks two trumps in his hand , one ruff in dummy and two tricks in each side suit as it was , east shifted to a diamond and south won with the ace now south ruffed another spade , with west throwing a heart dummy s top hearts were cashed , allowing south to discard his remaining low spade west made his three top trumps , and saxe scored 670 since his teammates collected 500 against four clubs doubled , this was worth 15 imps , and he won the title with smith , alan messer , richard demartino and augie boehm east must take the blame for opening the bidding and tempting his partner , eventually , to double three clubs by mayer s rule , he had the worst hand at the table diagram

in their latest effort to rid the city of big tracts of land in harlem , officials are selling 13 large vacant lots for 1 apiece and expect to receive about 50 applications today from developers offering plans for new housing the sales are the second round under a city plan to divest itself of properties in harlem it acquired over the years because of abandonment by landlords , tax foreclosures and arson in april , the city sold eight vacant lots to six developers for 1 each all told , city officials said they expect to see the 21 sites developed with about 2 , 500 units of middleincome and market rate housing over the next two years this round includes the largest remaining parcels of vacant land in the city s inventory what we 've done is taken most of the really conspicuously blighted property and put in on an accelerated timetable for development , said james f lima , assistant commissioner for the division of new construction of the city s department of housing preservation and development there is a tremendous amount of vacant land that was cleared by urban renewal and has remained vacant for years the 1 price tag is intended to encourage nonprofit developers to apply for the lots , according to the housing department although 145 million in public and private subsidies were available to developers who were awarded the last round of lots , no such subsidies are attached to the new group of sites the city acquired many of the properties in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s , and by 1975 , the majority of harlem s property about 65 percent had fallen into the city s hands some properties , including many along a swath of frederick douglass boulevard in central harlem , have remained there ever since , costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in maintenance costs alone the plan to require developers to submit specific housing plans for the property was formed by the manhattan borough president , c virginia fields , and the housing department they were responding to concerns from community leaders that too much property was being auctioned to the highest bidder without any specific plans in mind , and that the buyers would merely hold the land until they could resell it for a higher price without a plan for the land , it will be at best accidental that the vision of the community is fulfilled , said councilman bill perkins , who represents central harlem what usually happens is they auction off the lot , but the same ratinfested , garbageinfested conditions continue after the sale , because it goes to speculators and profiteers who hold on to the lot until they can get a better deal three months ago , mr perkins blocked an auction of 24 plots of land in his district to thwart speculators denise collins , a spokeswoman for city s department of citywide administrative services , said the harlem lots were considered surplus because when they were offered to other city agencies , none were interested in making use of them all we 're asking is that the city remove it from the city s portfolio and sell it to whoever can make use of it , ms collins said ms fields wants at least six of those lots to be earmarked for new housing , and they could potentially become part of a future round of 1 sales the city is in a position to drive the development of housing , by developing a plan , as opposed to putting it on the auction block for the highest bidder , she said the highest bidder does not necessarily know what s best for a community but her housing plan has drawn criticism from some neighborhood groups who fear the property could end up in the hands of developers from outside harlem , who they say may not have the neighborhood s best interests in mind in april , when the city sold the first group of eight vacant lots for 1 , only one of the six developers chosen was based in harlem among those whose proposals were rejected were the abyssinian development corporation , a nonprofit developer affiliated with the abyssinian baptist church of harlem , and hope community , a nonprofit developer responsible for hundreds of new units of housing in east harlem among the companies chosen were the richman group of new york , the glenwood management corporation , which has erected several buildings on the upper east side , and citywide builders , a consortium of minorityowned development firms in new york carol abrams , a spokeswoman for the housing agency , said the city selected those developers based on the merit of their proposals but was working with local nonprofit community developers on other sites in harlem
one of the socalled supermodels is sashaying to the rescue of a troubled cereal marketer seeking to improve stagnant sales of its flagship brands cindy crawford , part of the elite corps of mannequins who gained super status in part by peddling a lengthy list of products for bluechip advertisers , will for the first time serve as an endorser for the kellogg company in a campaign beginning this week by leo burnett usa in chicago , ms crawford will become the face and body representing special k , the brand of multigrain flakes that is kellogg s principal entry in the crowded category of cereals aimed at healthconscious women ages 25 to 49 the crawford campaign , with a celebrity endorser as its focus , marks an abrupt return to more traditional sales pitches for special k after a recent effort that took an unconventional tack by addressing the issue of women s complaints about unrealistic portrayals of body imagery in the media those ads , also by burnett , first appeared in canada in 1996 and were subsequently exported to this country the bestknown element of that campaign , which carried the theme look good on your own terms , was an unusually frank and humorous commercial in which men uttered the kinds of selfcritical statements about their looks that are typically voiced by women the spot was a reason why marketing magazine , a canadian advertising trade publication , selected kellogg canada as one of the 10 marketers that made a difference in the 1990 s it is unfortunate that the look good campaign so on the edge for a mainstream product is disappearing in the united states it continues to run in canada but it seemed too risky for kellogg at a time when the company confronts intensified competition in the cereal market , which has been flatter than a corn flake as busy breakfast eaters seek more convenient fare it was designed to be disruptive , said betsy andersen , vice president and account director at leo burnett usa , part of the leo burnett company unit of the leo group , but we may have been a little too far ahead of the curve women loved the advertising , she added , but we did n't highlight what the brand did for you and the role the product can play as a sensible way to manage your weight we 're really excited about the cindy promotion , ms andersen said the category is tough , so we 're doing everything we can to keep our brands relevant indeed , according to information resources inc , a market research company , in the four weeks ending dec 5 , kellogg lost its longtime ranking as the cereal volume sales leader to general mills inc , which surpassed kellogg in july as the cereal sales leader in dollars we 've done extensive consumer research on the look good campaign , said celeste clark , senior vice president for nutrition and marketing communications at kellogg in battle creek , mich , and found the key component missing was the aspirational aspect of wanting to look better , feel better , than you actually do cindy crawford embodies what the brand represents and adds back in the aspiration , she added another problem with the previous campaign , ms clark said , was that it ignored the diet proposition , including special k as part of your regimen to look and feel good by comparison , she added , the new campaign , which includes a contest and displaying ms crawford on special k packages as well as advertising , emphasizes the importance of eating healthy in a commercial , ms crawford is seen in garb and hairdos from the 1960 s and 1970 s fads in fashion can be as silly as fads in diets today , she says that s why i eat special k it s not one of those fad diets that makes your weight drop down and then shoot right back up again at the end , as ms crawford appears in a casual , contemporary outfit , she declares make a new year s resolution that will work for years to come would n't it be nice to look back and think 'i looked great \? ' in a telephone interview , ms crawford said she believed the campaign in no way appealed to stereotyped images of female beauty i can relate to women feeling intimidated by those images , ms crawford said at shows , i'm the biggest one i 'll go to a shoot and none of the clothes would fit because kate moss was wearing them kate moss is not anorexic , ms crawford hastened to add about her sister supermodel that s who she is but the fashion world could be a little more responsible , said ms crawford , who also endorses brands like pepsicola and revlon i'm hopeful we 'll see more diversity in body types in the new millennium , just as we 've seen more diverse skin colors women would embrace that that s the biggest complaint i hear that s one reason i'm popular , she concluded people can relate to me i'm not superskinny and ms crawford also had a baby , a boy named presley , six months ago it s flattering to me , she said about kellogg s endorsement offer , terms of which were not disclosed special k has always stood for being in shape ms andersen , too , mentioned ms crawford s recent motherhood cindy brought a lot to the party , she said , who she is , what our target s perceptions of her are the budget for the campaign is estimated at 7 million the contest offers prizes that include five trips to have breakfast with ms crawford and makeovers by team cindy , her stable of personal care professionals like radu , her trainer , and steven knoll , her hair stylist can monica lewinsky and jenny craig match that \?
washington , nov 7 after months of beseeching americans for their votes , gov george w bush of texas and vice president al gore could find that the one who collected the most might not win the race the electoral college , a complicated and indirect system of choosing the president , trumps the popular vote it was put in place by the framers of the constitution as a compromise between supporters of a strong presidency , who opposed having the chief executive named by congress , and others who were worried that direct elections by the masses would produce instability the electors , who are equal in number to each state s delegation in congress , typically award their votes on a winnertakeall basis two exceptions are maine and nebraska , which pick two of their electors by statewide popular vote and the remainder by the popular vote in each congressional district the votes of the electoral college have been critical in four previous presidential elections , and in three instances , placed a candidate in office who failed to win the most popular votes a prominent example was the election of 1876 , in which rutherford b hayes edged out samuel j tilden by a single electoral vote , though he lost to mr tilden at the polls both candidates had gone to bed on election night believing that mr tilden , the governor of new york , had won but the electors , including three voters from the newly admitted state of colorado , subsequently tipped the college to mr hayes , a threetime governor of ohio a dispute over the legitimacy of mr hayes s electors led to the creation of a 15member bipartisan commission , which confirmed the results , along party lines , by a single vote the contingency plans for selecting a president were first put to the test in 1800 , when thomas jefferson , the sitting vice president , and aaron burr , a fellow democraticrepublican , each won 73 electoral votes the vote was decided by the house of representatives , which chose mr jefferson with the blessings of federalists led by alexander hamilton mr burr became vice president the house was also called on to name a president in 1824 , when none of the four candidates achieved an electoral majority although andrew jackson received the largest popular vote , house speaker henry clay delivered a majority for john quincy adams in 1888 , the race between president grover cleveland and benjamin harrison , a republican from indiana , resulted in another split verdict mr cleveland captured a plurality in the popular vote , but mr harrison far outstripped him in the electoral college , 233 to 168 four years later , mr cleveland took his revenge , beating mr harrison and becoming the only president elected to nonconsecutive terms
millburn the paper mill playhouse s choice of victor victoria , nowhere near a musical of choice , is unfathomable although the dearth of doable new musicals coming off broadway s assembly line , does not signal the death of musicals , desperate times need not require desperate measures anyone familiar with how a fondly remembered 1982 film devolved into a best forgotten 1995 broadway show need n't be reminded that the desire to welcome julie andrews back to broadway turned a misconceived musical into a preordained event the sheer stamina of its star kept the show astir but its life as a musical was so tenuous at birth , it required , and apparently still receives , resuscitation by content after postopening broadway changes , none for the better , the show continued to change , emphatically for the worse inexplicably , the first act curtain song at paper mill \( who can i tell \? \) was substituted for the original \( crazy world \) during the broadway run it is not on the cast album , available at the paper mill concession stand for 19 crazy world , of course , is recorded , and has been restored , now being sung in the second act , though it was eliminated on broadway does anybody care \? yes , if only because the current first act curtain song provided the sort of flat moment that signals fatality a musical comedy is meant to hit you with visceral stimuli there are no singular sensations , musically or choreographically , at paper mill only recycled songs and derivative dances the audience did not know the first act was over when it was over , only when the house lights were on with the screenplay s wit extracted , not a scintilla of grace and subtlety preserved , and an amorphous score , victor victoria is a failed hybrid class has been displaced by crass jokes , a charmless book and smarmy attitudes why rub it in \? that s just what a perfunctory production that leers throughout does it lumbers , then creates traffic jams during farcical scenes that depend on precision in program notes , mark s hoebee , paper mill s new associate director , writes of surprises , revisions and rethinking of songs for the version he staged here one wonders what the director was rethinking , as opposed to reordering mr hoebee has carved a minicareer out of a faux musical a swing \( a standby for several roles \) in the original cast , mr hoebee took charge of two national tours , including one that passed through new brunswick , at the state theater , this year for two performances why new jersey s prime showplace for professional musical theater is producing the commonplace , especially when a touring production played at the state theater as recently as six months ago , is a mystery although mr hoebee has directed other shows here , paper mill s current production amounts to a debut , given his new , important title it should have been made with dash , signalling a great new hope in its pointless journey from screen to stage , victor victoria reveals but one psychologically telling moment of sexual ambivalence that s when an american macho man in paris , played and sung with flair by robert cuccioli , kisses victor , not knowing if he is kissing a man or a woman in the movie , he knows she s a woman , which means he shares the ruse with the audience , and that was a copout otherwise , the theatrical possibilities of a delectable cinematic achievement are uninvestigated in defiance of the odds , an insightful director could go for characterization , subtext and truth after all , a bad show can be made better not here , not even with a nofault cast , robin wagner s sleek deco sets and willa kim s characteristically glittering costumes , both from the original indeed , paper mill s three principal players \( judy mclane , lee roy reams and mr cuccioli \) are in prime vocal estate , each proving that singing actors can elevate songs , each raising the question why bother \? when ms mclane , a performer of proven acting credibility as well , is victor and when she is victoria , is neither clear nor discernible the songs , no problem for ms mclane as some were for ms andrews , put her interpretive efforts to waste it is dispiriting to observe mr reams , like his costars a paper mill mainstay , attack the role of toddy , resident entertainer in a gay club , so stereotypically , as if he were priming all evening for a gratuitous final moment in drag since mr reams gave a real performance in paper mill s la cage aux folles , the extent of his performing gifts remains unquestioned , simply unchallenged in a plotdriven show , musical embellishment so uninventive appears intrusive therefore , directorial disservice is another mystery , given mr hoebee s vast experience with this odd show , or is it mere overexposure \? somehow , though , tara o'brien , broadway s replacement norma , the floozy who mangles words and seduces everybody , emerges as the victor , as if she can put it all together by herself , and does but then here is a show in regress rent the video victor victoria paper mill playhouse , brookside drive , millburn through dec 10 today and next sunday at 2 pm and 7 30 pm wednesday and friday at 8 pm thursday at 2 and 8 pm and saturday at 2 30 and 8 pm \( 973 \) 3764343 photos julie andrews starred in the movie and the broadway show \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
a decadeold ideological wrestling match over the editorial soul of the forward , often described as america s best jewish newspaper , appears to be ending with the forced resignation of seth lipsky , founding editor of the englishlanguage weekly with the paper s staff pleading for their boss s job and prominent jewish figures lamenting his dismissal as a major loss to jewish journalism , mr lipsky is being forced out by some owners of the forward who regard him as too rightwing for the paper s socialist traditions , said editors and executives the game is just about over , said one executive , who said mr lipsky s departure would probably be announced early next week the forward association , a group that owns half interest in the manhattanbased weekly , threatened to close the paper unless mr lipsky was fired the general manager of the association , sam norich , did not return repeated phone calls yesterday , nor did the paper s chairman , harold ostroff mr lipsky also would not discuss his future at the newspaper i can say anything i want , but i do n't want to give an interview at this time , he said mr lipsky , 53 , a former senior editor at the wall street journal , created the forward in 1990 to revive the crusading journalistic traditions of the jewish daily forward , a paper that was founded in 1897 and helped define jewishamerican life for millions of yiddishspeaking immigrants at its peak in the 1920 s , after the great rush of immigration from eastern europe , circulation exceeded 250 , 000 the paper , known today as the yiddish forward , is a sister publication of the forward and still exists as a weekly , but has a small and dwindling circulation in a dying language among an aging readership what seems to have cost mr lipsky his job was a dispute about the forward s journalistic traditions and how the paper could best serve readers who do not speak yiddish but remain intensely interested in their jewish identity and in the fate of israel mr lipsky , who describes himself as neoconservative , said that the forward s tradition demanded freewheeling editorial independence , with none of the kidglove treatment other jewish newspapers gave to wealthy jewish organizations an early frontpage article listed the salaries of presidents of leading jewish groups mr lipsky also wrote editorials that chided readers for their liberal assumptions about such matters as america s involvement in vietnam he raised eyebrows by praising ronald reagan as a rare politician with the guts to describe vietnam as a noble cause in a piece three years ago in commentary that aggressively defended his editorial values , mr lipsky accused his critics of having a selective memory and of ignoring what the daily forward really stood for when it was the conscience of american judaism every time i have dipped into the files of the forward , i have found editorials on zionism and israel rippling with verve and strength and hewing to what , in the contemporary context , can only be called a hard line , he wrote while saying that mr lipsky had a right to his views , many prominent jewish figures , including some who had been skewered in the paper , argued that he had no right to publish those views in the forward executives at the paper said the dispute had very little to do with money , although the weekly , with a circulation of 26 , 000 , loses about 2 million a year but half the money that keeps the weekly newspaper afloat comes from the forward association , which , members say , made its money by serving the interests of the jewish labor movement this money accumulated because of yiddishreading jews in the heyday of the daily forward and they were social democrats , said rabbi arthur hertzberg , a longtime critic of mr lipsky , past president of the american jewish congress and the bronfman visiting professor of the humanities at new york university we are staunchly for the welfare state , rabbi hertzberg added lipsky is not staunchly for the welfare state , and he should be if he wants to edit this newspaper under the partnership contract that dictates how the forward is managed , half the paper s money comes from lipskysteinhardt llc , a group whose major investor is michael steinhardt , a former hedgefund manager and philanthropist who has invested 5 million in the weekly mr steinhardt wanted mr lipsky to stay as editor and offered to take over the forward , said editors at the paper but the ownership contract prohibits new investment without the consent of both partners , these editors said the forward association gave mr steinhardt the choice of either closing the paper or accepting a new editor this has outraged the weekly s 25member staff , which last month sent a letter to the directors of the newspaper urging them not to dismiss mr lipsky we plead with you not to destroy what you have helped create , the letter said we believe that it would be a serious error to force him out we think that doing so would harm the forward s quality and its reputation for independence another letter to the company s directors from eight former writers and editors at the paper said , if seth were to be forced out , the forward as we know it will cease to exist the signatories , all of whom are listed on the paper s masthead as contributing editors , wrote that if mr lipsky is ousted , they would demand that their names be removed this is a sickening development , said jeffrey goldberg , a former reporter at the forward who signed the letter and who is now a contributing writer at the new york times magazine we believe that this is basically destroying the only independent news organization in america covering the jewish community while the forward is read by a relative handful of people , its supporters and its critics maintain that they include the most influential jews in the united states the old joke was we have three readers , said mr goldberg , but they are the right readers photos seth lipsky is being forced out as editor of the forward by owners who regard him as too conservative , editors and executives said
who was the greatest actor in the englishspeaking world \? the question arises with the death this year of two of the primary candidates for that title , john gielgud and alec guinness along with laurence olivier and ralph richardson , they were the great knights of the english theater for many , gielgud and olivier were opposites , gielgud with his eloquent voice , an instrument for the ages \( of man and of shakespeare \) , olivier with his impassioned sense of the dramatic , physical as well as emotional the truth is somewhat reversible while olivier customarily approached a role from the outside , choosing a walk and a look specifically a false nose for his character , gielgud , the presumed intellectual , was more intuitive in contrast , it might be said that richardson and guinness had similarities , especially in their gift for playing eccentric , often comic characters but in his transformations richardson retained a glimmer of himself , so that one did not always know if he was acting or being guinness abandoned all sense of self and was totally immersed within a character and often unrecognizable from one role to another within the quartet there was mutual admiration and , at least between olivier and gielgud , an edge of rivalry guinness , as selfeffacing in print as he was in performance , wrote in his autobiography , blessings in disguise , that he was well aware that he was not in the same class as the greats he added that his pleasure is in putting little bits of things together , as if playing with a jigsaw puzzle of the four , guinness was the one who had the most substantial and successful film career all were marked by their daring and the surprise they could bring to a performance , qualities that separate the talented from the unforgettable , as was also true of edith evans and peggy ashcroft among living actors , michael gambon , anthony hopkins and ian mckellen all of them knighted have demonstrated their eligibility for that pantheon , as have judi dench , maggie smith and eileen atkins in the united states the contemporary candidates are fewer , partly as a result of the limited access that american actors have to classics michael meyer , the translator and biographer who died recently , was unequivocal in his choice , and it was none of the above in his memoir , words through a windowpane , he said that the greatest actor he had seen was frederick valk valk , he explained , was a german jew who was firmly established as an actor by the time hitler came to power in 1933 he moved to prague and became a leader of the german theater there in 1939 , with only days to spare , he escaped from the nazis and emigrated to england he had already played a diverse gallery of great classical roles with apparent ease he made the transition to the british stage in quick succession he triumphed in shakespeare and ibsen and also proved to be a master of comedy valk had only a minor career in movies , appearing in supporting roles and often playing prison camp commandants he died in 1956 at 61 , just before he was scheduled to make his broadway debut in peter ustinov s romanoff and juliet the closest he came to the united states was to play shylock for tyrone guthrie at the stratford shakespeare festival in ontario guthrie considered him a genial , gentle giant , whose voice matched his physique a warm and velvety baritone with an upper register of extraordinary brilliance and power he said that valk s career was somewhat limited by his accent meyer made it clear that he was not alone in his critical judgment and said that two of the most important british critics of the 20th century , james agate and kenneth tynan , shared his enthusiasm the excitement of watching valk seemed to provoke critics to soar into the linguistic stratosphere when valk played othello to donald wolfit s iago , agate wrote , if valk is not a great othello , and if the duel with wolfit is not magnificent throughout , then let me retire after seeing the same production , tynan , then an undergraduate at oxford , wrote , i have lived through three hours on the red brink of a volcano , and the crust of lava still crumbles at my feet later , as a professional critic , tynan continued to extol valk and to have the color red on his mind when describing him reviewing the master builder , he said that his solness has made his star blaze red across all this continent , and other lights are tapers he switched metaphors in midtheme he seemed an alp , and when he fell from his crazy tower , the very fall of the house of usher seemed like crackling match wood mr valk rules our stages he was , he said , the best actor in england in his autobiography guinness recalled valk in guinness s adaptation of the brothers karamazov as a bull of a man , simple and endearing meyer was most impressed by valk s explosive power in shakespeare he added , no one , i think , was quite prepared for the equal mastery which he then showed in three ibsen roles solness in 'the master builder , ' pastor manders in 'ghosts' and john gabriel borkman all three are deeply inhibited men whose passion can find no satisfactory outlet in 1981 meyer was having lunch with richardson , several years after he had given exceptional performances in borkman and the wild duck richardson suddenly asked meyer to name the greatest actor he had seen meyer hesitated , out of deference to the other man at the table after a pause , richardson said , valk \? and both men agreed photos frederick valk in the title role of

he asked his foray into real estate development , he said in an interview , was just another manifestation of his desire to do some good on the island , like his recent purchase of the floundering islanders hockey team but while few doubt mr wang s sense of civic responsibility , many wonder how wise it is to have so much of the town owned by one man since january 1999 , mr wang said , island properties , which he set up with sanjay kumar , the president of computer associates and a resident of neighboring upper brookville , has acquired about 50 businesses and homes in the 12squaremile hamlet and plans to buy maybe 10 more properties residents have long complained that oyster bay does not feel like a waterfront community because an industrial area stands between the downtown and the bay but one of island properties' major acquisitions , the commander oil company , could change that commander oil sits on the water s edge and has huge oil tanks that now block a stunning harbor view mr wang said that he had not decided what he would do with the property , but that clearing the land for waterfront development was a definite possibility mr wang would not say how much he has spent , but sources involved in the purchases put the figure near 50 million most of the properties are in the heart of the fourblock business district and farther along south street , which leads to the water the properties account for nearly a third of the businesses in downtown , and include a dozen single and twofamily homes , the oil company , a lumber yard , a beer distributor , a boat yard , a gas station and a former german restaurant many town officials and civic leaders bristle at the fact that representatives of island properties have been less than forthcoming about the group s plans during their periodic meetings he could turn out to be santa claus and really do wonderful things for the town , said bob reilly , president of the florence park civic association , which was formed two months ago largely in reaction to island properties' activities but right now people are frightened because we have no clue about this billionaire who s buying the bay mr wang said he has not presented a master plan because he does not have one but he does have a vision for a revitalized downtown where historic storefronts have been restored to their victorian splendor and where he and his family might be able to spend a lazy saturday afternoon doing some leisurely shopping after a pleasant lunch , maybe even at a restaurant right on the water we want to maintain the charm of it and make it so it s an attractive place to live and raise a family , he said , so you can watch your children run down the street ahead of you and not worry about a thing he said he had no intention of turning what was an outpost for president theodore roosevelt when he summered at sagamore hill , three miles up the road , into a tourist town like colonial williamsburg i want it to be a destination place , but mainly for people who live here , he said i do n't want to live in disneyland either town leaders say that s all well and good , but until they see detailed plans , they will be wary the supervisor , john venditto , said that while there s clear evidence that he s someone who loves this town , two wellintentioned people could have very different perceptions of what s right , and that s why the anxiety that s out there is very real mr wang said , though , that he has no intention of imposing his vision he said that as island properties completes the acquisition phase and begins the planning process , it would seek local input we 're not going to dictate anything , he said we 're going to evaluate everything carefully and come up with what all the groups in the community collectively think is the best for the town but given the reticence to date , many are dubious

denver at a time when few regional ballets can take the financial and critical risk of visiting new york even once , colorado ballet is back for the third time in less than a decade the denverbased company , which made onenight stands at brooklyn college s whitman hall in 1993 and 1998 , returns tuesday night for a week at the joyce theater , marking its manhattan debut with three works sir frederick ashton s facade and the new york premieres of peter pucci s picture of sedalia and stanton welch s of blessed memory since coming to denver in 1987 , martin fredmann , who was the artistic director of the tampa ballet in florida and had been one of the first americans to study at the kirov ballet in leningrad , has forged a disparately trained conglomerate into a stylistically cohesive ensemble of their 1993 brooklyn performance , the times s dance critic anna kisselgoff wrote that the company s strong suit lies in the surprising maturity , presence and solid technique of its performers today , colorado ballet has 30 dancers , ages 18 to 47 , from the united states , asia , australia and the former soviet union twentythree of them will make the trip to manhattan it s a company on the cusp of being among the nation s finest , approaching the level of the miami and pacific northwest companies , said clive barnes , the theater and dance critic for the new york post and chairman of the dance magazine panel that last year honored mr fredmann for his achievement fredmann has gone to great pains to build up an interesting repertory the company s repertory ranges from petipa and bournonville to fokine , nijinsky , ailey and choosan goh , with eight balanchine works and a strong rotation of classic story ballets its 1998 staging of martha graham s appalachian spring coincided with the establishment of the graham trust , a formal mechanism for licensing the moderndance pioneer s works to other companies no american ballet troupe had ever performed a graham work colorado ballet s classically trained dancers went through a painful crash course in graham technique to deliver remarkably authentic and widely acclaimed performances of the landmark 1944 dance with eugene loring s billy the kid and agnes de mille s rodeo , produced in 1994 and 1999 respectively , colorado ballet is now the only company performing all three ballets with scores by aaron copland balanchine s western symphony , staged in 1997 , rounds out a set of works concerned with the american frontier , an ideal match for a company with headquarters at the foot of the rockies the company s joyce theater program highlights this pattern of progressive singularity none of the three works are currently in the repertory of any other troupe , and facade has not been seen in manhattan for roughly 20 years picture of sedalia , the program s opening number , is mr pucci s second creation for the company set to violin renditions of music written by scott joplin , who played ragtime for several years at the maple leaf club in sedalia , mo , it offers snapshots of american life at the end of the 19th century the choreographer , a nineyear veteran of pilobolus dance theater and , like mr fredmann , a native of baltimore , had his first commission from colorado ballet in 1996 when he created size nine spirit , a suite of swinginfused dances to benny goodman s music mr pucci s gritty work is juxtaposed with the evening s neoclassical centerpiece , stanton welch s first major ballet , of blessed memory , an abstract , intensely romantic exploration of youth , motherhood and the transition families endure when children grow up and leave home mr welch , who is 30 , has already created more than a dozen works for troupes around the world he is the resident choreographer with the australian ballet and the son of marilyn jones and garth welch , who were prominent dancers with that company ms jones directed it when mr fredmann taught there in 1981 set to selections from songs of auvergne , the bestknown of josef canteloube s classical arrangements of french regional folk songs , of blessed memory is a tribute to ms jones , who starred in the work s 1991 australian premiere and traveled to denver to stage it for colorado ballet welch s ballet is a beautiful showcase for my company s classical range , with bravura work for the men and stunning sensuality for the women , said mr fredmann speed , technique and musicality are not enough to make boys and girls look like men and women our diversity gives us depth , dramatic nuance , and a worldly , sophisticated , mature look concluding the joyce program , facade , a lighthearted , sophisticated homage to british popular culture that is one of ashton s earliest and most popular works , shows off the colorado ballet dancers' comic skills i go back to the original source as much as possible , said mr fredmann , who had facade coached by alexander grant , the famed royal ballet character dancer who created many starring roles for ashton starting in the mid1940 s i want my dancers to learn not just the steps but the history of the steps , what made them happen at the moment of creation otherwise , the end result can be naive and colorless

princeton the country was in an uproar a closely contested election had left the nation uncertain about who was to be the new president of the united states the year was 1948 , and fred i greenstein , a college intern at the chicago suntimes , laughed with the rest of the newsroom when its rival , the chicago daily tribune , reported in the boldest of headlines that thomas e dewey had beaten harry s truman it s a vivid memory , said mr greenstein , who today is a professor of politics at princeton university and one of the nation s preeminent historians as you can imagine , that memory has come to mind often in the last few days for scholars of the american presidency , these have been heady times amid the deluge of news since election day about butterfly ballots , recounts and legal challenges , the job of placing it all in context has fallen to popular scholarly authors like michael beschloss and doris kearns goodwin mr greenstein has been called upon for the occasional instant analysis , too but for the most part he has preferred to remain circumspect there are lots of people around who have done good academic work in the past and can be relied upon to pepper their comments with historical references on the spot , he said but what they say on the talk shows ca n't be construed as serious analysis it will be a while before anyone can sort out what these events mean to the office of the president , and whether the strain on the political system will have a longterm effect as for his own longterm plans , the 70yearold mr greenstein will retire next spring after more than 40 years of teaching during much of that time , mr greenstein made a specialty of deconstructing the american presidency the most recent of the seven books that he has written , the presidential difference leadership style from fdr to clinton , \( simon schuster inc , 25 \) evaluates the commanderinchiefs' performance based on six qualities public communication , organizational capacity , political skill , vision , cognitive style and emotional intelligence reviewers have given him a bit of trouble over that last category some regard the concept of emotional intelligence as pop psychology , but mr greenstein does n't seem to mind to me , it is the most important quality of all , he said you want a president with insight into his own psyche and an ability to handle his feelings , which is what emotional intelligence is all about you do n't want a president acting out of unconscious motives in a rash way in general , the reviewers have been kind to mr greenstein with the exception of allan j lichtman , a historian at american university , who wrote in the washington monthly that the book fails to realize its promise , offering only analysis according to arbitrarily selected categories , frozen in time but mr greenstein scoffed at the criticism , saying , here s a historian who believes that any systematic attempt to evaluate presidential performance along consistent lines is inherently wrong differences of opinion among colleagues are common in academia , but they generally do not erupt into acrimony for example , mr greenstein has had a longstanding disagreement albeit an amicable one with the pulitzer prizewinning historian arthur m schlesinger jr over president dwight d eisenhower s accomplishments mr greenstein achieved renown in 1982 with the publication of the hiddenhand presidency eisenhower as leader , published by basic books , which made the case that eisenhower was more involved in running his administration than he let on based on white house records , the book sought to reverse the widely held view that eisenhower was little more than a figurehead in a recent interview , mr schlesinger called mr greenstein an interesting writer , very concise , but said his assessment of eisenhower s achievements abdicates the role of the presidency and is not the final word this sort of giveandtake is nothing new to mr greenstein his earliest political memory is of a spat over a president in 1936 , when at age 6 he got into a fistfight with a schoolmate who was wearing an alf landon button mr greenstein chuckled at the recollection and said , i do n't know how , but even back then , i had bonded with roosevelt born in the bronx and raised in westchester , long island and yonkers , mr greenstein recalled little discussion of political events at home when he was growing up his father , a buyer for a department store , did not express much interest in politics his mother showed practically none but mr greenstein had an aunt , whom he described as very politicized the sorts of things that preoccupied her it was the 1930 s , and there was lots of concern about the rise of fascism and poverty these were emotionally engaging subjects , he said and that s what prompted my curiosity about politics when mr greenstein was in high school , his father s work took the family to chicago as a student at antioch college , he interned at the suntimes and later wrote for union newspapers all during this period , he considered making journalism his life s work
tumen , china each spring , when the food runs out , the parks leave their 11yearold son with neighbors in north hamgyong province in north korea , say they are going to the hospital , and then trudge eight hours along the railroad tracks to china in search of food and cash it is a dangerous and emotional journey , but after three trips the parks have a routine last month , they went to a border station where they knew the north korean soldiers could be bribed , and paid 500 won , about three months' pay for a north korean worker , so they could cross illegally into china and , one week later , cross back they removed their little red pins of north korea s founder , kim il sung , when they reached the lightly patrolled chinese side of the tumen river , which forms the border and they caught a bus to the home of a chinese lay preacher of korean descent , who had helped them before , in the nearby city of yanji i came to china again because i have no other choice , mr park , gaunt and exhausted , said just hours after his arrival it s risky , but i was starving so i did n't care in the last month , north korea s reclusive leader , kim jong il , has made historic overtures to the outside world , visiting china for his first trip abroad in 17 years and inviting the south korean president , kim dae jung , to north korea for a summit meeting next week but his new international openness springs in part from continuing domestic tragedy his government has been unable or unwilling to solve by itself korea s longstanding food crisis five years into food shortages that experts say have killed up to two million people , death rates in korea are dropping but that is largely because of western food aid , and because north koreans like the parks who are not further identified because of the possibility of retaliation have themselves developed survival strategies to blunt the lethal impact of what united nations experts have called a slowmotion famine some grow food in small private gardens some sell goods on quasilegal gray markets and in the northern provinces , thought to be most severely affected , many cross the border into china the flow of people and aid over the border has become far more organized since its start three years ago when the parks first came in 1998 , for instance , they sneaked across the tumen river under cover of night and skulked through the woods to yanji now , the aid system has become so entrenched that private relief groups working on the border get requests for food and medical help from towns , schools and even labor camps deep inside north korea and the channels for migration are so well established that north koreans who live in china illegally and have enough money can send for their relatives to join them relief groups estimate that there are now 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 koreans living illegally in china the people who have survived this far have done so because they are physiologically hearty and also because they have developed coping mechanisms , said a western scholar who studies north korea although north korea will not provide numbers , interviews with korean migrants suggest that famine deaths peaked at about 50 per 1 , 000 population in 1996 and 1997 and are about half that now , according to a study by researchers at the johns hopkins school of public health that is soon to be published by the national academy of sciences part of the reduced toll is explained by the natural cycle of famines , researchers say the weakest generally babies and the elderly tend to die off quickly , leaving a healthier population behind also , they say , people adapt by finding new , but often precarious , sources of food the statistics can look great , but that does n't necessarily mean that there is more to eat , the western scholar said at a recent news conference in geneva , david morton , the world food program s representative in north korea , noted a slight improvement in food supplies and harvests over all , but said north korea was still very much in crisis , with certain groups and areas still very , very short of food he also suggested that the hard work of north koreans to feed themselves was often wasted because their government had made little headway in solving basic economic and structural problems , like finding a reliable source of fuel we see very little result from all that effort that they put in , whether it s planting food or trees or working in the towns and the cities , he said north korea s food problems began in the early 90 s with the collapse of the soviet union , previously its main trading partner , and accelerated after a series of floods and droughts in the mid90 s mr park , a 39yearold miner with the haggard look of a man who has been tossed about by forces larger than himself , stares vacantly at the floor as he explains that food shortages in his village are just as dire as in 1996 , when his 61yearold mother died of hunger like most north koreans illegally in china , he speaks nervously and refused to be fully identified , fearing arrest by the chinese police and deportation to a north korean jail he said his family had seen none of the millions of tons of western food aid that have poured into north korea since 1998 , which is mostly earmarked for young children
the collapse of the camp david talks is a wrenching setback for israel , the palestinians and the cause of mideast peace israel s prime minister , ehud barak , and the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , came remarkably close to agreement on some of the most difficult issues of the 52yearold conflict but they stumbled at the most sensitive point , sovereignty over east jerusalem on that subject mr barak found mr arafat unprepared to make the kind of hard compromises needed to seal an agreement there is now only a remote chance that a comprehensive peace settlement can be reached before the sept 13 deadline the two leaders have set it will be difficult enough just to keep the middle east conflict from flaring into renewed tensions and violence mr barak and mr arafat deserve credit for coming to camp david and , for the first time , seriously discussing issues like borders , refugees and jerusalem so does president clinton , who committed much time and energy to the talks and made extraordinary efforts to keep the two sides engaged arranging the marathon meeting was a risk , but it was a chance that had to be taken on virtually every issue , previously unthinkable compromises were discussed but under the ground rules , none of these advances will be binding absent an overall accord realistically , neither leader has much chance of winning public support for painful compromises unless they are part of a deal that delivers a final peace nevertheless , the new understandings reached need not evaporate they may be revived if discussions on a comprehensive agreement resume for that to happen , both sides will have to look more creatively , and courageously , at jerusalem the larger burden lies with mr arafat when the talks began two weeks ago , israel was insisting on retaining full sovereignty over east and west jerusalem while the palestinians demanded a full return of the east , including the old city and its religious sites mr barak moved far from his initial position , agreeing to consider expanded palestinian sovereignty over parts of east jerusalem mr arafat , encouraged by egypt and saudi arabia to be unyielding , showed little interest in american compromise proposals washington should make clear its disappointment with cairo and riyadh it is not clear what happens next mr barak spoke yesterday of considering all options , even a termination of the peace effort that began with the oslo agreement in 1993 his political situation at home is tenuous , with his cabinet reduced to a parliamentary minority conservative politicians argue that he has already shown too much willingness to compromise but public opinion supports him , and he must persevere in his efforts to enhance israeli security through a fair and defensible peace mr arafat must also consider his next moves he should begin by resisting pressure to declare palestinian independence , without an agreement with israel , on sept 13 such a declaration would invite new violence israel would probably respond by annexing areas of the west bank that it has until now envisioned as part of an eventual palestinian homeland in the statement ending the camp david talks , mr barak and mr arafat recognized the importance of avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations proclaiming palestinian independence would be just such a step if there is ever to be a durable peace , mr arafat must reconsider his unyielding approach to jerusalem
nashville i would n't know a gibson from a stratocaster my favorite guitarists are django reinhardt , eddie lang and andres segovia , and none of them , as far as i know , ever played a single note at the grand ole opry that could cast a rather long shadow , i suppose , over my qualifications as a guide to music city , usa , except that there is a lot more than picking and fiddling , a lot more than ballads of love and loss , in nashville s past , present and future especially its future which is no bad thing for the city , since country music , which rang up sales of tapes and records of almost 2 billion two years ago , is suffering through a bit of a slump at the moment the convention and visitors bureau here has set aside 4 million to play down the city s hillbilly image and emphasize its developing cosmopolitanism it should not prove too hard a sell like charlotte , nc jacksonville , fla and a number of other secondtier southern cities , this one is rapidly acquiring bigtime accouterments , including a national football league team called the titans with a brandnew 292 million stadium , a bruiser of a running back named eddie george and a fearsome , longlimbed defensive end named jevon \( the freak \) kearse , the titans went to the super bowl last year and made the city swagger a little already in business or on the way are a zoo , a new country music hall of fame , an enormous shopping complex on the scale of the mall of america near minneapolis , a new library designed by robert a m stern , an arena to house the nashville predators of the national hockey league and the ambitious new frist center for the visual arts , about which a few more words later what interests me most about nashville , however , is its past , notably its often neglected role as an agent of political and intellectual change it was from nashville or rather from the hermitage , his home just east of town that rugged old andrew jackson set off for washington in 1829 , having ousted the aristocratic john quincy adams in the pivotal election of 1828 a frontiersman , a general , the first president from west of the alleghenies , the first selfmade man to take up residence in the white house , jackson shaped modern american democracy in the image of his own egalitarianism he fostered government by the unwashed masses instead of the propertied classes the muddy boots of jackson s followers spoiled the carpets at the postinaugural party and his opponents derided him as some kind of border savage , in the words of arthur m schlesinger jr but he proved them wrong , taking a new , more aggressive style of leadership to washington and blazing a path for a fresh tramontane dynasty that included james k polk and abraham lincoln , a kentuckian before he moved to illinois a century later , in the early 1920 s , a group of writers at vanderbilt university , just west of downtown nashville , coalesced around a journal they called the fugitive they railed against both the industrialization of the south and what they called the moonlight and magnolia distortion of traditional agrarian values allen tate and john crowe ransom , two of the most important modern american critics , were members of the group , but its star was robert penn warren his biographer , joseph blotner , called him this country s greatest 20thcentury man of letters , which seems reasonable enough given his achievements as a poet , critic , novelist , playwright , essayist and biographer warren wrote what for me is the greatest of political novels , all the king s men , whose protagonist , willie stark , was a ringer for huey p long , and he was the only person to win pulitzer prizes for both poetry and fiction after a few years , the fugitives became the agrarians , and most members drifted away from vanderbilt , but not before they had helped to ignite the southern literary renaissance eventually , those fevered nights in nashville helped to mold publications like the kenyon review and the sewanee review and writers like randall jarrell , james dickey and cleanth brooks academic achievements vanderbilt may well be entering a bright new era founded in 1872 and endowed by cornelius vanderbilt , it has evolved from methodist and regional origins into an institution of national repute with 10 , 000 students already among the 20 wealthiest colleges and

many other things , ingram is the largest book wholesaler in the country in 1998 mrs ingram gave vanderbilt 300 million in ingram stock the secondlargest donation ever made to any american university

manville , nj , march 28 once again mooring a traditionally democratic issue to the agenda of his republican presidential campaign , gov george w bush of texas today proposed a fiveyear , 5 billion program to address what he termed a national literacy crisis among children mr bush said the program would provide grants to states to test reading in kindergarten and first grade , to make tutoring available to poor readers and to train teachers he soberly contrasted the nation s economic success with its educational failings , and declared that he would bring the same improvements in reading on the national level that he said he had achieved in texas he said every child should know how to read by third grade , and vowed that states that failed to improve student performance would lose federal aid there is nothing more fundamental than teaching our children how to read , mr bush said in a speech this afternoon in reston , va , the first in a series of events this week intended to spotlight his commitment to improving education america must confront a national emergency , he said too many of our children cannot read in the highestpoverty schools i want you to hear this statistic in the highestpoverty schools in america , 68 percent of fourth graders could not read at a basic level in 1998 aides to mr bush said his plan would help roughly 900 , 000 children with poor reading skills , at a cost of 1 , 000 per child per year for tutoring and other assistance besides that 900 million , an additional 100 million a year would go to testing and teacher training the bush plan was quickly dismissed by aides to the apparent democratic presidential nominee , vice president al gore they sought to shift attention to mr bush s taxcut proposal , saying it would leave no money for new education initiatives since the fall , mr bush has introduced a variety of education proposals , but none of the others would entail spending anywhere close to the 5 billion he spoke of today that sum in turn is dwarfed by the 115 billion that mr gore would spend for new education initiatives over 10 years , and the disparity in the size of the two candidates' approaches highlights the challenge facing mr bush convincing voters that he can lead the nation to new educational excellence without spending huge new sums , which would clash with his broader fiscal policies mr bush introduced his plan as his party continued to close ranks around him tonight steve forbes , who had attacked the governor as insufficiently conservative before withdrawing from his own race for the republican nomination , endorsed the governor here at a meeting of the somerset county republican party as the american people are learning , and will learn , mr forbes said at the meeting , in his home state , he is a good man he has been tested i tried to test him and he emerged the stronger for it mr bush s chief rival during the primary season , senator john mccain of arizona , has resisted endorsing him , but mr bush called mr mccain today in an apparent effort to salve some of the lingering wounds mr bush said he hoped that the two would meet soon , and described the conversation as amiable john and i both understand that the past is the past and it s time to move forward , mr bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane mr bush s speech in virginia offered striking evidence of a return to his original campaign strategy positioning himself as a softedged , centrist republican after he veered to the right in the primaries to fend off mr mccain in that talk today , to a coalition of asianamerican groups at the headquarters of the student loan marketing association , the federally sponsored provider of student loans , he proclaimed that the federal government had to redouble its efforts to confront the educational plight of poor people we will not tolerate illiteracy amongst the disadvantaged students in the great country called america , he said i know this is something a little new others have proposed throwing money at the problem but they have proposed resources without reform that approach has no history of results , and really no prospect of success under my plan , new resources will be an instrument of reform , not another investment in failure in echo of language once used by the kerner commission to describe the country s racial chasm , mr bush said more and more we are divided into two nations one that reads and one that ca n't , and therefore one that dreams and one that does n't reading is the basis for all learning , and it must be the foundation for all other education reforms still , mr bush is not abandoning his belief that the federal government should not meddle in what , he says , is rightly a state and local issue this evening , at a fundraiser in parsippany , nj , with gov christine todd whitman , he declared , as he often did during the primaries , that he did not want to be the federal superintendent of schools you are looking at the wrong man if you want me to be the national principal , he said i believe in local control of schools the best education policy is that which bubbles up from the bottom indeed , mr bush has shaped his education proposals as a whole around the notion that the states should have more leeway in spending federal dollars , as well as the idea that schools must be held more accountable for their performance he would encourage the creation of charter schools and has also proposed a voucher program for students of poorly performing public schools he has urged too that head start , the earlychildhood development program , be primarily a literacy program in his speech in virginia , mr bush s tone was largely conciliatory he barely mentioned mr gore but the gore campaign showed no such reticence douglas hattaway , a campaign spokesman , said that the governor s plan would be ineffective and that given his tax cut , he wo n't have the money to pay for a new initiative like this without dipping into the social security surplus or going back to deficit spending photo george w bush addressed the somerset county republican party in manville , nj , last night after winning the endorsement of steve forbes , right , and cheers from mr forbes s wife , sabina \( ruth fremson the new york times \) \( pg a20 \) side by side comparing two plans for education since the fall , gov george w bush of texas and vice president al gore have made several proposals on education mr bush would nprovide students in lowperforming schools that fail to improve after three years 1 , 500 a year for use at a parochial or other private school or for tutoring money would be drawn from the title i program , for schools in poor districts nrequire students in grades 3 through 8 to be

the shareholders of both america online and time warner voted yesterday to approve the merger of the companies into the world s largest media conglomerate the companies do not expect to complete the deal until late fall because it must still gain the approval of a number of regulatory bodies , including the federal trade commission , the federal communications commission , the european union and the authorities in many cities where time warner owns cable television systems both regulators and analysts say they see little chance that the deal will be rejected , but officials are in no hurry to approve what would be the largest merger in corporate history , valued at 165 billion indeed , the fcc is expected to hold a hearing in late july there is simply a process of checking off a series of boxes between now and the fall , said henry blodget , an analyst with merrill lynch the shareholder vote was the biggest hurdle the biggest regulatory issue relates to whether the combined company will allow more than one highspeed internet service to use its cable television systems until the merger , time warner had planned to offer only its road runner service but the companies now pledge to allow competing services , like the excite home service the regulators may nonetheless impose some sort of requirement for open internet access in the meantime , time warner is negotiating with providers of highspeed internet access to offer their services on its cable systems it hopes to have a few such deals completed in the next month or two to show the regulators that it is acting in good faith in a letter last week , the fcc asked aol and time warner about america online s instant messaging service and that company s stake in hughes communications , the provider of the directv satellite service , which competes with time warner cable systems in another letter released yesterday , the agency asked for documents related to business alliances by both companies , including time warner s stake in road runner and aol s investment in the tivo television recording system regulators and analysts said , though , that none of those issues was likely to be much of a sticking point for the deal the european union has said it will take four months to look at the deal , but it is expected to defer to regulators in the united states the europeans may , however , take a tougher look at warner s unrelated proposal to combine its music operation with that of the emi group in the shareholder votes , about 99 percent of time warner holders , meeting in manhattan , and 97 percent of aol holders , in tysons corner , va , approved the deal america online , whose stock had soared in the weeks before the merger plan was announced on jan 10 , agreed to exchange 15 of its shares for each share of time warner for time warner holders , that would mean receiving stock in america online worth 11063 , which is 71 percent more than its trading price the day before the deal was announced since then , with internet stocks of all sorts collapsing , america online shares have fallen 27 percent below their price before the deal , while time warner shares are still above their price before the merger agreement , although the premium has fallen to 20 percent yesterday , time warner shares fell 40625 , to 775625 , and america online shares dropped 2875 , to 53375 , amid a general selloff of internet shares stephen m case , chairman of america online , was asked about the decline of the company s stock in a hotel ballroom packed with more than 500 shareholders what s happening really has less to do with aol and less to do with the merger and more to do with what s happening in the sector , he said almost every company that we compete with , ranging from yahoo to amazon to microsoft to att , are down substantially more than we are in that period as the deal works its way through washington and brussels , managers of both aol and time warner are preparing organizational and operating plans so they can move quickly as soon as the deal is completed the companies have promised wall street that they will cut 1 billion a year in costs and increase revenue by 30 percent a year , an aggressive target for many of time warner s more mature businesses top executives from time warner , including its chairman , gerald m levin , and vice chairman , ted turner , regularly attend the weekly management meeting held by mr case and the company has planned a threeday management retreat in july timed to coincide with the baseball allstar game in atlanta the business issues discussed most heavily revolve around increasing advertising sales at the combined company and finding ways to sell subscriptions to time warner magazines , like time and fortune , to america online users and ways to sell the aol service to time warner magazine subscribers there is continuing discussion , as at all record labels , about how to make sense of the rise of free music on the internet using technologies like mp3 and napster
johnston , iowa , jan 15 in a determined drive to slow the frontrunner only nine days before the caucuses here , gov george w bush s rivals today questioned his credentials as a tax cutter and ridiculed his centerpiece plan to pare taxes by 483 billion over five years the assaults were led by senator john mccain , who warned that mr bush s prescription favors wealthy americans at the expense of lower and middleincome tax payers and would threaten the future of social security governor bush s plan has not one penny for social security , not one penny for medicare and not one penny for paying down the national debt , mr mccain said and when you run ads saying you 're going to take care of social security , my friend , that s all hat and no cattle mr bush shot back , that s cute , but you know , mr mccain interjected , they 're always cutest when they 're true then mr bush completed his sentence it s not true and he defended his proposal , saying , i 've got two trillion set aside to social security mr bush provoked the quarrel when , posing a question to mr mccain , he accused the arizona senator of backing a loophole that would amount to a 40 billion tax increase on working americans through workerrelated benefits mr mccain repeatedly tried to turn the attention back to mr bush s plan , at one point tossing off another quip suggesting that the governor was dancing a texas twostep by struggling to justify a plan that mr mccain said would threaten social security the wrangling between mr bush and mr mccain made for the most stirring moments of a 90minute forum the seventh debate with all six candidates at the iowa public television studios the event otherwise was striking for the lack of hardedged exchanges this close to the first actual voting while this event was billed by its sponsor , the des moines register , as a debate , the candidates did not take much of an opportunity to challenge each other instead , they mostly restated their stands on matters including health care , family farms and foreign policy in contrast to an iowa debate four years ago , when the combatants ganged up on steve forbes and ridiculed his flattax plan , this time the candidates were relatively cautious the contenders were also far more serious than they have been at other debates this year , perhaps because the format of questions from one moderator and ordinary citizens did not lend itself to freewheeling exchanges polls in iowa show that mr bush is well ahead of the pack , with mr forbes a distant second mr mccain , who is neck and neck with mr bush in polls in new hampshire , is not actively campaigning in this state despite the subdued tone of the event , mr bush did find himself the target when the issue of taxes surfaced mr forbes , for one , questioned his record on taxes as governor of texas most texans have never seen those tax cuts , he said george , 6 out of 10 districts in texas never saw the tax cuts in 1999 senator orrin g hatch of utah presented himself as the only contender who could steer a sweeping tax cut through congress we 're going to have to have somebody who knows how to get a tax plan through congress , mr hatch said aiming his fire at mr mccain as well , he said , i think we could have gotten president clinton to give us a bigger tax cut than john mccain s toward the close of the afternoon event , mr bush bristled at the onslaught over his credentials as a taxcutter responding to criticism from mr forbes , he declared , well , you know something , steve , nearly 69 percent of texans said overwhelmingly in 1998 , 'you 're the man we appreciate your tax cuts' beyond taxes , the contenders differed chiefly on ethanol subsidies and china policy and took turns denouncing the ethics of the clinton administration i'm worried about the country , i'm worried about whether we are going to have a continuation of the current leadership , mr hatch said i want to see the clintongore team go the central disagreement in foreign policy came when gary l bauer , long a critic of the clinton administration s china policy , declared that he would revoke china s trading status with the united states at a moment when the administration is trying to make china s normal trade status permanent that policy has failed , mr bauer said , adding that china is in a mass buildup of its military forces we need a reagan policy , said mr bauer , who worked in the reagan administration in fact , china has been granted what was previously known as most favored nation status every year since 1980 , including every year of mr reagan s presidency , on mr reagan s initiative and with the approval of congress but none of the republican candidates who agree with the clinton administration and favor the extension of normal trade relations with china made that point mr hatch , apparently trying to impress on the audience that he has had some foreign policy experience , said the chinese rolled out the red carpet for me a phrase that triggered hearty laughter in the audience he said he slammed deng xiaoping so hard that he gave me an hour and a half when we were only scheduled for half an hour
americans should be relieved that dick cheney , the republican vicepresidential nominee , has apparently suffered no serious effects from what is now acknowledged to have been a mild heart attack wednesday morning and was fit enough to leave the hospital yesterday but they also have reason to be concerned by the failure of mr cheney s aides and doctors to inform the public fully and promptly about his true condition although everyone is entitled to a right to privacy on matters of personal health , the american public has long asserted a competing interest in knowing the fitness of those who aspire to and hold the country s highest offices recent history , from woodrow wilson s stroke to paul tsongas s ultimately fatal cancer , is replete with instances in which senior officials or their doctors or both have conspired to hide important medical information wednesday s bumbling performance may not fall into the category of deliberate misinformation , but it did not cover anyone with glory reporting chest pains , mr cheney checked into george washington university hospital before dawn on wednesday preliminary tests apparently revealed no heart attack , and early in the morning he felt well enough to speak to mr bush at a news conference in texas five hours later , mr bush said that his running mate had sounded strong and vigorous , and asserted flatly that tests had shown there had been no heart attack aides later said that mr bush did not know that by the time he gave his cheery diagnosis , mr cheney s doctors had become sufficiently concerned by a second electrocardiogram to perform a catheterization and then angioplasty to open up a clogged artery karen hughes , mr bush s press secretary , later said she had learned about the catheterization , but had not so informed mr bush whatever the reason , mr bush seemed embarrassingly in the dark mr cheney had in fact suffered a mild heart attack but it took two further news conferences for the world to learn that at an early afternoon news conference , dr alan wasserman , george washington s chairman of medicine , said that blood tests taken that morning and evaluated around noon showed minimally elevated cardiac enzymes dr wasserman said later that he assumed that people would clearly understand from this that mr cheney had suffered a heart attack mr bush s aides said that they had asked the doctors to be more direct , and at a later news conference dr wasserman finally used the words heart attack episodes like this can only increase public skepticism , but wednesday s confusion can ultimately serve a useful purpose if it prompts fuller disclosure none of the four candidates were particularly forthcoming during the campaign , and the public deserves a fuller medical accounting from each one
east rutherford , nj , may 10 it has been five years since the devils vanquished the philadelphia flyers in a stirring eastern conference final series on the way to winning their only stanley cup championship on sunday , the teams will meet in the postseason for the first time since 1995 in game 1 of the fourofsevengame series to determine eastern conference champion the devils won four of the five regularseason meetings between the teams this season , and the flyers , who overtook the devils late in the season for the best overall record in the conference , are likely to be without their two most physically imposing centers , eric lindros and keith primeau , because of concussions primeau was knocked cold from a vicious but clean openice hit by bob boughner 48 seconds into philadelphia s 21 seriesclinching victory over the pittsburgh penguins on tuesday night lindros , meanwhile , has been out since march 13 because of recurrent concussions lindros suffered a setback last week his third concussion of the season and fifth in two years when he collided with a teammate during practice but the flyers issued a statement today saying that lindros could resume practicing may 23 if a game 6 is necessary , it would be played may 24 , and game 7 would be may 26 the devils , too , are not the same team that defeated the flyers in 1995 , a series that saw the visiting team win the first five games before new jersey finally prevailed at home in the deciding game 6 five years later , claude lemieux , the recipient of the conn smythe trophy in those 1995 playoffs as the tournament s most valuable player , has just one goal over the first two rounds of this postseason s tournament bobby holik and randy mckay , twothirds of the devils' crash line in 1995 , are playing as if the crashers have been reborn holik , with 23 goals , and mckay , with 16 , combined for 39 goals during the regular season over the first two rounds of this postseason , holik and mckay have none together , lemieux , holik and mckay have one goal combined during the tournament in past postseasons , that would have spelled doom for the devils no longer we have a lot of depth , defenseman scott niedermayer said i think that s been our strength this season a lot of people said maybe that s been our weakness the last couple of years what niedermayer meant was that over the last four seasons , the devils could be derailed by shutting down their top scorer they did not qualify for the playoffs in 1996 , lost in the second round in 1997 , and lost in the first round in 1998 and 1999 for example , holik was second on the team in goals with 27 last season two seasons ago , he led the devils with 29 goals but holik was held without a goal in each of the last two postseasons holik has not scored a postseason goal since 1997 and yet here the devils are , in the third round everybody has a different job to do , said coach larry robinson , whom the devils have rallied around since he took over for the fired robbie ftorek with eight games remaining in the regular season it s unfair to say bobby holik did n't score a goal or that the other guys are n't playing well i think they are they 've been getting chances mckay , who did not practice today because of an illness in his family , and holik were especially valuable in the devils' secondround triumph over toronto although they were held scoreless , they held the maple leafs' top line , centered by mats sundin , to one goal over the sixgame series bobby may not have scored a goal , ken daneyko said , but he had a tremendous series against toronto robinson said we 've asked bobby to go against other teams' top players , to think defense first i would worry if he and claude and randy were n't getting any chances but they are and even if holik , lemieux and mckay are n't burying them , their other teammates are this team has a lot of depth , holik said it s a team that relies on 20 players , not 5 , not 7 , not 2 that has been the devils' philosophy , but holik added , we did n't necessarily have the 20 guys playing the way we can that might explain all those early exits since 1995 , the last time the devils and the flyers met when it mattered most
in its pregame notes package , st john s proclaimed itself the no 26ranked team in the nation , ignoring the fact that the polls name only the top 25 hours later , after getting to dribble out the clock on a 7964 victory over no 22ranked connecticut last night at madison square garden , the red storm looked ready to be assigned a meaningful number in a recognized poll a sellout crowd of 19 ,

ranked no 9 let s use extra special our players were magnificent from the first play to the last the garden belonged to st john s st john s completed a sweep of the big east standardbearer for the first time since 199192 for its sixth consecutive victory the loss was the fourth in sixth games for the huskies , who have lost more games this season than they did in the last two combined last

rattled the huskies into two technical fouls one by center jake voskuhl that pretty much conceded the game while jarvis opened the game with a technical foul and calhoun picked one up in the early

oakland , calif , oct 2 the yankees' distinct tradition is strangely blurred as they prepare for the first two games of the american league division series , where they will reveal themselves as fading champions caught in a horrible and irreversible slump , or as a team with extraordinary mental toughness the yankees were beaten in their last seven games of the regular season , the longest losing streak for any team entering the playoffs , and they will either break out or be broken in a threeoffivegame series with the dynamic , talented and inexperienced oakland athletics you 've got to wipe it away , chuck knoblauch said , referring to the lateseason collapse , before adding , this is not something you can just flip on knoblauch will start at designated hitter , rather than at second base , in game 1 tuesday , and the yankees' roger clemens will pitch against oakland s gil heredia , with the first pitch scheduled for 8 08 pm eastern time the yankees lost 15 of their last 18 regularseason games , and they are the first team in major league history to enter the postseason with fewer than 5 victories in their last 15 games of the regular season but their roster is stacked with veterans who have coped with and conquered adversity the righthanded pitcher david cone , who went 414 with a 691 earned run average during a miserable regular season , walked into the yankees' clubhouse after sunday s finale in baltimore and said aloud , i do n't have a 6 era anymore the message in cone s words was apparent to all who heard i hope everybody heard it , knoblauch said that was perfect the postseason gives all of them a chance to start anew paul o'neill might have struggled for hits in late september after hurting his hip , but all of that will be forgotten if he contributes to victories in the days ahead cone can find some redemption if he helps in middle relief if clemens and andy pettitte the latter will start game 2 on wednesday throw well and the yankees win , all the bad feelings built up in the late season will go away but the yankees are not under the illusion that this will automatically happen , just because they have won three championships in four years the losing streak shook them as nothing else has in joe torre s tenure as the manager with the experience of postseason , guys will know what it takes to win and that will help , knoblauch said but you ca n't just turn it on , like a switch i do n't think so , at least not for me that scares me a bit if we could 've , we would 've done it in the middle of last week luis sojo will start at second base and bat eighth , and knoblauch will be the designated hitter torre had hoped that one of his offensiveminded players jose canseco , glenallen hill or luis polonia would get hot and seize the designated hitter s job going into the playoffs but that did n't happen , and given knoblauch s throwing jitters , the secondbest option for torre was to insert sojo , a contact hitter who always puts the ball in play , to avoid some of the strikeouts and doubleplay grounders that occur when canseco starts the other part of torre s decision , he acknowledged , was knoblauch s defensive problems the second baseman s throwing jitters appear to have had an effect on almost everything he does , from fielding grounders up the middle to turning double plays this afternoon , torre told knoblauch of his decision it s not a shock or anything , knoblauch said torre said , i'm thinking in terms of contact , making things happen offensively , and hopefully we can do that sojo gets the start , but with a deep bench that includes the sluggers and at least two other utilitymen , torre could make many changes in that one spot in the lineup during the game suppose sojo were due to hit with the bases loaded in the third inning , and torre felt he had a chance to break the game open he might want to use hill as a pinchhitter , and replace sojo with jose vizcaino the yankees and athletics share the same business , and beyond that , they are completely different the yankees are big market , big money , big star , big success , a world championship flag flapping over their park the athletics are small market , too little money , their stars mostly known locally , and an award from a baseball magazine is prominently displayed on their rightfield wall organization of the year 1998 1999 the yankees are the giant studio that wins oscars the athletics are the independent company with an understated excellence and the athletics , unlike the yankees , go into the playoffs full of good thoughts they won 8 of their last 10 games of the regular season , overtook the seattle mariners and won the american league west for the first time since 1992 after beating texas to clinch the division sunday , the athletics enjoyed a raucous celebration that lasted well into the evening certainly longer than the 15 minutes of handshakes and sips of champagne shared by the yankees after they clinched the al east in the middle of their losing streak the athletics' adrenaline could work for them , or their adrenaline could work against them jason isringhausen , the oakland closer , could be overpowering , or overwhelmed by his nerves the 24yearold shortstop miguel tejada , who bats behind the slugger jason giambi in the oakland lineup , will probably have many chances to hit with runners in scoring position in this series will he be calm and swing steadily at pitches in the strike zone , or will the yankees' veteran starters entice him to hack wildly at bad pitches the way they were able to do with the rangers' juan gonzalez and ivan rodriguez the last two years \? there s no way to tell , no way to know how tejada or the athletics' other youngsters will react to pressure , just as the yankees did not know , in 1996 , how pettitte or derek jeter or mariano rivera would respond if experience was a big factor , oakland manager art howe said , then we would n't be here the yankees' players have 46 world series championship rings among them , the athletics none but oakland goes into the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in baseball , and the yankees , in

mozdok , russia , jan 20 a senior russian general today became an unfortunate symbol of the difficulties russian troops have endured in their campaign to take the chechen capital , grozny , when he was reported missing there maj gen mikhail malofeyev , one of the commanders of the grozby operation , vanished on tuesday , the first day of a renewed russian ground onslaught on the city in the breakaway southern russian republic russian commanders said the general had probably been ambushed and killed in a fierce clash , but the chechen rebels on the other side of the fighting insisted that he had been captured alive and was being interrogated at a rebel hideout in the chechen highlands the fate of general malofeyev , deputy commander of the northern group of russian forces in chechnya , was the lead item on russian television news tonight the news broadcasts showed a video of the 44yearold officer as he stood in a trench near grozny in early january and gave orders to his subordinates his disappearance came among reports that russian troops were encountering determined rebel resistance russian officers are no longer boasting that they will seize the city in four days instead , they emphasized that there was no deadline for what could be a long operation grozny is a sprawling city , one of the largest in the north caucasus russian officials said as many as several thousand rebels occupy it and are fighting from cellars and fortified positions along the russian routes of advance thousands of civilians still inhabit the city , complicating the russian attack russian troops have sought to penetrate the city from the north , east and west but in contrast to its practice in the earlier war in chechnya , from 1994 to 1996 , the russian military is not rushing vulnerable armored columns into the city that war ended badly for the russian military , with de facto independence for the chechens russian armored personnel carriers and tanks found it difficult to maneuver through grozny s streets during that conflict chechen rebels would typically attack the first and last armored vehicle in a column , trapping the rest of the formation then they would destroy the vehicles with grenades so this time the military is using different tactics tanks and armored personnel carriers are largely used on the city s outskirts , where there are none of the multistory houses that are hiding places for the rebels instead , russian artillery and warplanes have carried out a withering barrage on suspected rebel positions then interior ministry troops and soldiers have moved into the city , checking each building for rebels and arms the new approach , however , has not produced a speedy breakthrough the military did not allow russian television crews and western reporters to observe the fighting in grozny today , and accounts of the russian offensive there are fragmentary after several days of fighting , however , there was still no confirmation that russian forces had established control of minutka square , close to the center of grozny fighting was reported at a bridge over the sunzha river , which bisects the city the russian authorities said they had seized the bridge , which the militants used for supply and communications , two days ago grozny is a ruin , with wrecked apartment houses covered by a pall of black smoke , observers and officials said here in mozdok the russian authorities insist their casualties are minimal four killed and four wounded for the last 24 hours but many soldiers believe that the official statistics grievously understate actual losses the rebels reported on their web site that they lost 45 fighters in three days that , too , is probably an understatement , but it is considerably higher than previously acknowledged rebel losses , reflecting the intensity of the recent fighting general malofeyev was born in nakhodka in the russian far east he graduated from frunze , one of russia s premier military academies , and then served in the leningrad military district the general took part in the first chechen war and in october 1999 , he was transferred to the northern caucasus as russia stepped up its campaign against the rebels officials here provided conflicting accounts of what might have happened to general malofeyev according to one account , he was with the 245th motorized infantry regiment in a neighborhood in the western outskirts of the capital he was hiding in a building with some officers and soldiers when the unit was attacked by rebels , and the general later failed to return another account holds that general malofeyev was shot when he found himself trapped in a rebel crossfire as he sought to rally his troops , who were lying on the ground because of the fierce fire either way , the general s disappearance was an embarrassing setback for the russian military and illustrated the grave dangers for the troops in chechnya it was not the only example nikolai p koshman , the russian deputy minister who administers the russiancontrolled areas of chechnya , recently moved his headquarters from the military base here , several miles northwest of chechnya , to gudermes , chechnya s secondlargest city a russian official said tonight that one of the convoys of trucks that moved mr koshman s headquarters was shot at along the way photo maj gen mikhail malofeyev may have been killed or captured \( agence francepresse \)

when susan foose s heroinaddicted son bryan finally said he was ready to receive help , she knew she had to act quickly the marlton mother began working the phones , calling several clinics and rehabilitation programs to find a place that would take her son bryan slipped out for one last score the next morning his mother would find him dead in his bedroom of a drug overdose parents faced with a child addicted to drugs will usually do anything to solve the problem but most drug treatment professionals say it is up to the addict to decide to seek help and until that point , treatment will be less than successful capturing that window of opportunity and getting a child into an appropriate program in time is not always so easy , particularly in southern new jersey , where a shortage of drug treatment centers for young addicts has led to a revolt by parents and a new pilot program by the state while most drugtreatment experts agree that young addicts' best chance for recovery is a longterm residential program , none currently exist for adolescents and young adults treatment for them often involves family participation , but families in south jersey are faced with sending their children to programs in north jersey or out of state , the best of which might have a sixmonth waiting list i was fighting for my son s life , said ms foose , who started a parent support and advocacy group , parenttoparent coalition , for families affected by drugs , after her 22yearold son died in 1997 why , at such a critical time , do we need to claw and scratch and fight for someone s life \? this is n't just wrong , it s cruel and inhumane two years ago , ms foose s group brought the shortage of treatment centers in south jersey to the attention of governor whitman at a town meeting since then , the state s division of addiction services has been seeking a site for a 70bed longterm residential complex for young south jersey addicts the state s deputy commissioner of health , george diferdinando , said in an interview that selecting a treatment site was a top priority while faced with a fair amount of not in my backyard sentiment from some municipalities , dr diferdiando said that negotiations continue with multiple sites and that he expected to have a solution by early 2001 in addition , in july the state freed up 2 million for a pilot program known as the south jersey inititative , which , until a permanent facility is available , is being used to finance several outpatient drug treatment programs as well as purchasing 30 beds for south jersey youths at existing residential programs the south jersey initiative is being coordinated by an outpatient treatment center in woodbury , where the clinical director , george koren , has seen a recent increase in patients using heroin , a drug he says is particularly difficult to kick in cases of serious heroin addiction , mr koren immediately refers the patient to a residential program daytop new jersey in morris county is one such program under contract with the south jersey inititative daytop s executive director , joe hennen , said the initiative had reserved five beds for south jersey patients , though his 70bed center is now serving 18 youths from south jersey when the program started in 1992 , mr hennen said , we never saw a kid using heroin today , close to 65 percent of the patients are there for heroin addiction , and several of those are young women , so many in fact that daytop is renovating its complex so half the beds can serve young women it s an extremely serious problem , said mr hennen and it s not kids from the innercity we 're seeing 14 , 15 yearold kids addicted to heroin , blondhaired , blueeyed , suburban , affluent kids
columbia , sc , april 13 it took all of a day for margaret gamble and mickey whatley to learn what life would be like as democrats in the republicancontrolled south carolina house of representatives a few hours after the two representatives startled the southern political world this month as the first republicans in the state to become democrats since reconstruction , they were stripped of their positions on two prestigious committees and moved to the military , medical , municipal and public affairs committee , which has so few responsibilities that not a single republican serves on it the house speaker , david wilkins , said he was sending them there to achieve party balance on their former committees , not as punishment but the treatment of the two defectors , and the angry ridicule heaped on them by republican leaders , made it clear what a painful and possibly pivotal moment this was for the state party those two have been voting with the enemy for years , said henry mcmaster , the chairman of the south carolina republicans we 've got a big tent , but some folks had been wondering whether they were in or out of it in fact , the two have been members of an increasingly isolated species in the south these days moderate republicans , who often feel at odds with their party s hard line as the democrats regain their footing in statehouses from south carolina to mississippi , the republican party in many states has found itself dominated by religious conservatives desperate to retake control suburban republicans like ms gamble and mr whatley are often caught between popular programs proposed by democratic governors and the demands of republican leaders my family s been republican since strom thurmond switched in the 60 s , said ms gamble , an administrator at the university of south carolina this was a very emotional and very difficult decision for me but i 've been very disappointed in the house republicans they just seem to have lost touch with people on the important things like education and senior citizens state republicans say the two legislators switched parties only to escape tough primary fights , and point out that there has not exactly been a stampede to the democratic side so far this year , two minnesota officials have switched , along with a maryland state senator , and last year , united states representative michael p forbes of new york changed sides but the long exodus of white southern democrats to the republican party that began in the 1960 s appears to have halted , and many democrats say they now have the momentum while 15 democratic state legislators in south carolina became republicans in the early 1990 s , none have switched in the last three years the same is true in alabama , which had 50 major defections to the republicans from 1994 through 1997 , but only three since then the democrats now control 24 of 30 legislative chambers in the south , and with the most recent defections are just four seats away from controlling the south carolina house five years ago , no one was talking about switching to the democratic party , but now we 're starting to see it pick up , said kevin mack , executive director of the democratic legislative campaign committee , the arm of the national party that works at the statehouse level as we see more of a schism between moderate and conservative republicans , more are coming our way more neutral observers are also starting to see the same thing the second generation of republicans now coming of age just is n't bound to the party the same way , said bill moore , a political science professor at the college of charleston who closely follows state politics the first generation was more hardcore , but there s a change in attitude going on in a lot of suburban districts that they just have n't recognized yet republicans scoff at this notion , of course mr wilkins said the two legislators were not even moderates , noting that ms gamble voted last week against creating a holiday to honor the rev dr martin luther king jr , and that both have opposed moving the confederate battle flag off the capitol dome but ms gamble and mr whatley pointed to two significant policy differences that persuaded them to break ranks with the republicans one was over gov jim hodges s request for an extra 10 million for his first steps preschool program , which republicans blocked ms gamble said the republicans believed mothers should be taking care of preschoolers , although party leaders said the request was simply too expensive the other was a democratic request for more money for programs for the elderly , particularly prescription drugs and homestead tax exemptions , which republicans also cut they ordered me not to vote for these programs because it would make the governor look good , said mr whatley , a longtime lawenforcement officer who was the police chief of north charleston but these are programs that young people and elderly people in my district wanted the republicans have forgotten about people like that mr whatley represents a coastal district that has become increasingly democratic , fueled by newcomers from the north and the growing participation of black voters , who represent more than a third of the district although he said he was not motivated by practical considerations , other legislators say he will have an easier time winning as a democrat ms gamble s suburban columbia district is still primarily republican , but with a large number of the swing voters who made senator john mccain such a strong candidate in the february presidential primary this is the kind of district where you 're seeing a reaction to the party being taken over by christian conservatives , said neal thigpen , a political science professor at francis marion university in florence and a republican they 're conservative on tax and spending issues , but they just ca n't abide the hardcore right wing i think it tells you something that she is not frightened to death to run as a democrat ms gamble acknowledged the possibility that she could be defeated in november because of her switch , but said she felt more loyal to her district than to her old party when i told my family and friends what i was doing , they said , 'you did what \? ' she said but when i explain it to them , they understand it s the party that changed , not me
subway service in parts of new york city stopped briefly yesterday and then was delayed for about two hours after a disruption in a con edison line in yonkers at noon caused a dip in electric power throughout the city and westchester county the incident , coming two weeks after a smallscale power disruption on the upper east side , led to more criticism of the utility by mayor rudolph w giuliani it continues to distress me that con edison is not able to continuously offer us the kind of assurance that we are going to have the power that we need , mr giuliani said , adding that he noticed the lights dim two or three times yesterday about noon as he was eating lunch at city hall con ed officials said late yesterday that as far as they knew , none of their three million customers in new york city and westchester county had lost power voltage dipped about noon , after a tree branch apparently went too close to a 345 , 000volt transmission line in the dunwoodie section of yonkers , causing the line to send the electricity into the tree , said michael clendenin , a con ed spokesman electricity was quickly rerouted through other lines in the system but the resulting brief voltage dip caused a number of subway signals on the upper west side to malfunction , said melissa farley , a new york city transit spokeswoman subway service on the 1 , 2 and 3 lines in upper manhattan and the 2 and 5 lines in parts of the bronx stopped for about two minutes delays then continued for about two hours as crews worked to ensure that all of the signals were working properly , she said the power disruption was very brief , but it was enough to impact the signal system in that part of the subway , said bob slovak , a transit spokesman new york university medical center used its backup generator after the dip in power , mr clendenin said , adding that no other significant impact had been reported in the region con ed notified the city of the trouble , addressing previous criticism by mr giuliani that the utility had been slow to inform officials of power problems but the mayor said yesterday that he did not understand why lights have to blink off and on in new york city , because of a power problem in westchester
hastingsonhudson one hundred and sixtyfive boys and girls , wards of the state , live perched above the hudson here at the graham school , where there was once a big , vacant room the boys and girls , ranging in age from 6 to 19 , are all victims of drugaddicted parents , failed foster homes and other circumstances as varied as they are haunting they have been sent by the courts to live at the graham school , which was built in 1902 for years , the big , vacant room , measuring 3 , 600 square feet , was nothing more than a maze of closets , spider webs and wooden walls , used occasionally for storage two years ago , the school decided to transform the barren space into something central to the school a student union these students have led lives of limited options and the school wanted a place where they would have many the chance to eat with friends , to watch television , to work on computers since the graham school believes in students working for pay on campus , it also wanted the students to build as much of their student union as possible this goal , of course , clashed with the seemingly significant fact that none of the students had carpentry experience and what was this student union going to look like \? the school received a few pieces of snappylooking furniture at the right price \( free \) , so it was going to be built in the style of a 1950 sera diner considering all the circumstances , the concept had the feel of a tilt at a windmill enter pete perpich , brought in by the graham school to run the effort because of his unusual double background he has spent his career in both children s mental health and home construction mr perpich had one other important qualification he thought it could be done mr perpich did n't make people believers right away , but he did get a lot of students who wanted to help that s because , as a first step , he handed out sledgehammers and let the students demolish the room swing by swing that was their favorite part , mr perpich said , laughing then came the design phase the general design of the room was predetermined , but the students put their own stamp on it by making cosmetic choices next came the construction , the slowest stage when building houses , mr perpich said , you figure out the fastest , most efficient way to do things , but here our purpose was n't to do that we wanted to maximize what the kids could learn since the group had no experience , mr perpich began by painting a yardstick on the wall so he could demonstrate the skill of exact measuring en masse it was slow going , but before too long even the younger students were taking on simpler tasks , like putting small tables together they were supervised by older ones , like reni chlapek , 17 i learned patience , he said the administration was not concerned with delays the voyage was more important than the destination , said gerald leventhal , the director of the school but once the framing was done and the room started to take shape , the project , energized by the spunk and spit of a core group of eight studentcarpenters , really hit stride then came a nasty patch faced with the difficult task of installing wallboard , mr perpich put the students in the hot seat i said , should we subcontract out \? at the beginning of construction , the students would have said , yes , mr perpich said now , they told him , no way they learned on the fly and did it themselves the fourth stage was the icing sanding , scraping , caulking and painting fourteen months after demolition started , thanks to the work of 70 students , the tiger s den opened the students working there today are learning how to cook and manage a restaurant ironically , a number of students who did a lot of the work in building the tiger s den graduated from the school before it opened they came back , though mr perpich watched as darnell brown stepped inside for the first time he looked around at the chrometrimmed red and white tables , the black and white tiled floor , the fluorescent jukebox and as darnell silently watched the many students enjoying it all , he wore a smile that seemed to exceed the boundaries of his face when another carpenterstudent stepped in for the first time , he did n't look around for a second instead , he sprinted straight to the far end of the room remember , mr p \? he shouted , this is my wall ! drawing \( nancy doniger \)

london , dec 26 when people think of peckham , they think of a place that is run down , violent , dangerous , said dennis tolo , of the london neighborhood where a 10yearold boy was attacked on nov 27 but that is not the real picture britons have been thinking about peckham a lot in recent days , and not in flattering terms it was here , in a dirty abandoned stairway in the north peckham housing complex , where the boy , damilola taylor , bled to death after being assaulted by a group of youths and it is here that the country s attention has been focused since while the police struggle to solve the crime a dozen or so youths have been arrested and questioned , but none have been charged the conservative opposition has used the case to attack the government s approach to law enforcement the government s antiracism policies have so demoralized the police force , said william hague , the conservative leader , that officers cannot properly do their jobs in places with high minority populations , like peckham damilola s family , which came from nigeria four months ago to seek medical treatment for his sister s epilepsy , has denounced mr hague s remarks as inappropriate and unwelcome people in this neighborhood in the south of london are in shock , both from the boy s death and from the onslaught by the news media that followed it s not something you can forget easily , said mr tolo , a 34yearold computer consultant from kenya who has lived here for 18 months , as he dropped off his 4yearold daughter at nursery school the other day when a 10yearold kid cannot safely leave school , attend the library and go home , then something is very wrong but what is wrong is not , as the stereotype would have it , that peckham is a place of terrible deprivation or of rampant gang violence between groups of blacks from the caribbean and from west africa the problem is less explosive , and more subtle in fact , many residents contend , it is the government s ambitious housing rejuvenation program , in which 385 million is being poured into the neighborhood over seven years , that is mostly to blame damilola s murder cannot be separated from the insecurity and destruction wrought by the biggest single regeneration budget in the country , said pascale vassie , a book editor and parttime community development worker here there is no question that peckham has suffered its share of deprivation , along with any number of similar neighborhoods in britain s inner cities it has a high minority and immigrant population half the residents are on some form of welfare , and 62 percent of the children live in families that receive welfare a quarter of the adults are unemployed or considered too disabled to seek work at oliver goldsmith , where damilola went to school and where he complained of being bullied by other children , 12 percent of the students are refugees or asylumseekers , and nearly 40 percent speak english as a second language half participate in a government freelunch program to eradicate the neighborhood s physical blight here , the government has embarked on a program that aims to alter the very texture of the area to that end , hundreds of apartments in crumbling , soulless buildings have been torn down and replaced , in many cases with attractive singlefamily houses with gardens and front parking areas housing values in the area have increased by as much as 50 percent , as some of the new houses have gone on the market others have been sold to public housing tenants , who live in half the building , and then rent out the other housing unit to pay the cost but such a project has brought huge disruptions , with hundreds of people being moved from old houses to temporary accommodations and then to new homes this has torn into the fiber of the community , leaving a pervading sense of dislocation and disorientation , many residents feel ms vassie and her two children , for instance , have had to move twice in the last few years , each time knowing that their apartment was slated for demolition elderly people who depended on their neighbors for help have been relocated to lonely temporary apartments , with only shortterm tenants nearby it s not like going to the hairdresser , where you walk in and come out with a new look , ms vassie said the regeneration of a community takes seven , eight years , and for a child that s their entire childhood my 8yearold s whole life has been lived in a place where the walk to school has been constantly surrounded by piles of rubble , dugup roads , places that have been deserted damilola died in such a place the north peckham housing project is full of buildings that are scheduled to come down , with abandoned apartments where squatters and drug dealers have moved in , as well as spaces where some buildings have already been torn down the reconstruction pace has left a hodgepodge of buildingsinprogress , huge clearedout lots and construction sites where local youths gather at night as he came home from the library that night , damilola took a shortcut through two sections of mostly empty apartments it is unclear exactly how or where he was stabbed or even with what , though the weapon was thought to be a broken bottle or a knife when he was found , he was slumped near an elevator in a forbidding brick , metal and concrete openair stairwell , in a building that was to be demolished early next year
white plains they all profess the importance of westchester , naturally , but to date none of the four principal presidential candidates have aggressively courted voters here george w bush and al gore are both counting on the support of the leaders of their parties as they head toward the new york primary on march 7 , called super tuesday because of the number of state primaries that day , which will likely yield each party s candidate for the november election as they have in other places , senator john mccain and bill bradley are playing up their roles as outsiders none of the candidates have opened a field office here , and visits to the county have been rare on feb 17 , mr bradley came to manhattanville college in purchase to attend a surprise birthday party for the college president , a friend , and for a rally mr gore was to be in dobbs ferry last thursday to meet with evironmental leaders mr bush and mr mccain have not visited , though their campaign offices have not ruled out trips early this month , well before their rivals , mr bradley and mr mccain identified point people in westchester mr bush and mr gore did not follow suit until later in the month , in anticipation of turning their attention to new york after the primaries in new hampshire , south carolina and michigan but experts say that westchester and other new york city suburbs , known as swing areas for their shifting political allegiances , do not normally play a major role in primaries , which bar independents or voters crossing party lines , which made new hampshire and south carolina so intriguing the general election , open to everyone , is where the suburbs exert their influence the most , said lee m miringoff , of the marist institute of public opinion in poughkeepsie in a primary , westchester is important , but i do n't think it attracts quite the attention only because so many of the voters come out of new york city , probably more than half , so the suburbs do n't have as much real estate , mr miringoff said in the general election , the suburbs account for as much as 25 percent of the vote , with new york city about 30 percent and 45 percent for the rest of the state , mr miringoff said that makes it important for candidates to garner support here you ignore westchester at your peril , he said it is on the map it s not make or break , but it clearly is on the map and is important indeed , a reading of recent presidential election results suggests that westchester is a reliable barometer vice president george bush beat michael s dukakis here in 1988 by 10 percentage points , and president clinton won by 7 percentage points \( over mr bush \) in 1992 and 20 percentage points \( over bob dole \) in 1996 democrats have long held a lead in voter registration currently 216 , 276 democrats to 162 , 214 republicans but republicans have dominated elective office in 1997 andrew j spano became only the second democrat to hold the county executive post since 1939 , when the position was created and so , with another week before the primary , here is a look at the westchester campaigning george w bush the gop establishment quickly lined up behind mr bush , who in the early stage of the campaign seemed a surefire nominee so far , there are no cracks in the guard mr bush enjoys the support of the republican chairman here , james e cavanaugh , the town supervisor of eastchester , and perhaps more important that of state senator nicholas a spano , the former gop chairman and political kingmaker mr bush s state organization , which got off the ground feb 13 here with the naming of ellen difrancisco as statewide coordinator , is counting on the establishment to deliver , though there is no bush organization to speak of neither ms difrancisco , the former executive director of the suffolk county republican committee , nor westchester party leaders were sure mr bush would visit he is relying on the party faithful to make calls and issue mailings talking up the candidate , ms difrancisco said mr cavanaugh said mr bush s emphasis on improving public education would strike a chord with westchester residents , who tend to be passionate about their children s schooling governor bush has a very strong education platform , mr cavanaugh said he wants to cut taxes and reform welfare i think those are three very important things for westchester john mccain angelo r martinelli , the former mayor of yonkers and something of a maverick among westchester county republicans , is one of mr mccain s coordinators in westchester early in the month , mr martinelli was trying to figure out where he would come up with the required 100 signatures to get mr mccain on the ballot in one of two westchester congressional districts \( he is on the ballot now that the state gop , which is aligned with mr bush , dropped its challenge to his being listed \) mr martinelli said he was first approached about backing mr mccain by guy v molinari , the staten island borough president they called me up and asked me if i would be their westchester coordinator , mr martinelli said i said i would do whatever they wanted me to do mr martinelli is actually coordinating in the 18th congressional district , the largest of four districts that include parts of westchester

los angeles in his youneverhaditsogood stemwinder the other night , bill clinton twice deftly stepped on applause lines for joe lieberman concentered all in self , the reluctantly departing president failed to impart a single behindthescenes anecdote to dramatize the leadership qualities of his loyal sidekick , al gore thus it falls to a scandalmonger who has relentlessly castigated the vice president for his fundraising excesses to provide a behindthescenes glimpse of al and tipper gore under pressure the year was 1993 air force two was taking the vice president , his wife and a handful of reporters around the newly freed states of the former soviet union a halfhour before , the pilot had made two aborted passes at the short airstrip in befogged almaty , kazakhstan because the plane was running low on fuel , he landed at nearby bishkek , kyrgyzstan , where the americans were not expected to arrive until the next day during refueling , the pilot offered to try again to get into almaty , where a grand state dinner was laid on a critical gonogo was about to be decided would the vice president demonstrate that the us was unafraid of fog , even at the risk of life \? i slipped up toward the front cabin , eager to witness gore make this command decision through a slit in the curtain , i could see and hear arguments presented oilrich kazakhstan , which could be wooed further away from russia , might be put off by american queasiness about landing diplomats fretted the gutsy pilot thought he could make it on another try gore glanced toward tipper arms folded , she almost imperceptibly shook her head i thought sensible woman we 're calling an audible , the vice president said , his voice like thin ice breaking , his metaphor that of a quarterback making a lastsecond adjustment let s flop the schedule stay here tonight and switch everything around he got on the telephone to the two presidents , delaying one dinner and stunning the bishkek boss with you know that formal state dinner planned for tomorrow night \? how about you round everybody up and we 'll have it an hour from now \? it worked false machismo was rejected , the hosts understood the concern for safety , and we members of the press did n't know the difference between kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan anyway that struck me as leadership in action gore s creative audiblecalling demonstrated a wise willingness in a tight spot to listen to the cautious counsel of his wife what a pity that clinton could not come up with a similarly dramatic instance of leadership perhaps even one dealing with substantive policy that required a profile in courage but that might have detracted from clinton s selfimage of being in total charge at all times on the rest of that tour of russia and its adjacent new republics , i had several opportunities to talk privately with the person the background rules require i must still refer to only as a high official with a wooden expression traveling on the vice president s plane it turned out he had been egregiously misinformed by state and the cia about the upcoming russian election the sudden rise of the nutty vladimir zhirinovsky came as a complete surprise to us intelligence and his judgment about certain russian leaders was , in retrospect , too optimistic but he knew his stuff the unnameable official had not only done his briefingbook homework , but had a hardwired strategic outlook that takes years to develop i disagreed with some of his policy conclusions but had to respect his knowledge of the weaknesses and foibles of his foreign interlocutors and his grasp of the intricacies of highlevel wheeling and dealing none of that will be on display in tonight s acceptance speech because foreign policy has no place in either party s convention with peace a given , the democratic nominee s message will be do n't let them take prosperity away that does not seduce me but as al ingratiates himself with selfdeprecating humor and lays out to the assembled teacherdelegates and treehuggers his vision of a debtfree treasury , i will not be so quick to join the personalitydriven chorus of derision because i remember the audible in bishkek
washington , feb 3 as the schmooze express rolled down the new jersey rails toward the nation s capital today , the biggest attention getters were not the halfdozen candidates for the united states senate aboard , or even the three men who would be governor , but the most creative giveaways there was the foamrubber locomotive that went choochoo when you squeezed it , and the jim mcgreevey energy pack , handed out by the perpetually campaigning mayor of woodbridge \( main ingredients hard work and determination \) they were all part of the mix of bigtime politics and serious kitsch that brings out more than 1 , 500 of new jersey s most powerful politicians and bestconnected business people each year to kick off the political season this was the 63rd annual schmooze express , as some have called it , though more critical observers prefer the gravy train or the money train , finding the convergence of moneyed interests and public servants a bit unseemly but it is best known as the walk to washington , since the whole idea is to walk the length of an amtrak train , shaking hands , renewing acquaintances , making a good impression and , at least for the candidates , picking up a vote or a contribution or two it is no easy feat , especially this year , as most seats were occupied by platters of cold cuts or cookies so those who had to endure five hours of jostling for a square foot in the aisle could be forgiven for ignoring the pols and focusing on the trinkets they could bring home to the kids the new jersey chamber of commerce sponsors the excursion it begins at the newark train station , picks up steam as the train heads south , climaxes with a dinner in washington to salute the state s congressional delegation tonight s was a tribute to the retiring senator frank r lautenberg and then spills over into a pub crawl of sorts from one hotel room to another late into the night there were two trains today the overheated 18car sardine can , and an addendumlike train just two cars long , which had about a 20minute head start the mayor of trenton , douglas palmer , was said to be on the extra train , as was murray sabrin , a republican running for senate mr sabrin , who already complains that he is ignored by the news media , apparently cannot get a break two of the other republicans in the senate race ensured that no one aboard the main train would go hungry state senator william l gormley handed out hoagies from a delicatessen in atlantic city , and the essex county executive , james w treffinger , provided abundantly stuffed box lunches jon s corzine , the multimillionaire former investment banker who is seeking the democratic nomination for senate , did his handlers proud , making a full lap on his own before baltimore mr corzine is a newcomer to electoral politics , and his detractors have questioned how he will hold up on the hustings but he seemed none the worse for wear gladhanding and eyecontacting was nothing new to him , mr corzine confided i 've been doing this stuff in business for years , he said i 've just never done it on a moving train by contrast , former gov jim florio , his chief rival , chose to stay near the rear of the train , talking to those who happened by it was easy to tell the candidates from the noncandidates , and even from the candidatesinwaiting assembly speaker jack collins , who has announced his interest in running for governor next year , sat comfortably in his seat and let people come to him , although his aides handed out tiny basketballs he was a star college player imprinted with his name and 2001 some of the handouts were less clever , but more pointed representative robert franks , whose fundraising prowess has been questioned , handed out photocopies of a 5 , 000 check he had just received from trent lott , the senate majority leader was this an endorsement , he was asked i 'll let the 5 , 000 check speak for itself , he said , beaming mr franks seemed to be making the most of the trip but he seemed taken aback when asked if he was having a good time do i like this \? he said , deftly repeating but not answering the question this is retail politics , he said , at its extreme photo jon s corzine , left , who is seeking the democratic nomination for the united states senate , and jim mcgreevey , mayor of woodbridge , nj , were among the 1 , 500 aboard the chamber of commerce train \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
stephen s hall s article \( june 4 \) reveals that the students at midwood high participating in the science talent search absorb not only the brilliant ideas of topflight scientists but also some of their more maladaptive behaviors i was particularly troubled by a teacher s comment that he liked to see his students burning the candle at both ends i am a medical student involved with research , and none of the scientists whom i wish to emulate possess such an attitude all of them have responsibilities to family , colleagues and their own health , which they take great care to balance against the loftiest of career aspirations submitting to the often potent urge to sacrifice this balance to fixate on a research goal should never be encouraged in budding scientists , particularly those at the high school level stuart p weisberg new york
miami , april 16 the true believers say they cannot sleep while evil waits just outside the strobe lights to steal their miracle child away so in the hours between midnight and dawn , they sip rich , black cuban coffee to stay alert , and occasionally scream elian ! and libertad ! just to remind the united states government that it better not try to break into the house in little havana and take elian gonzalez on their watch we do n't get paid to be here , said orlando maldonado , 42 , who was born here but has lived his life immersed in hatred for fidel castro s government it is 3 am today , palm sunday , and he is still angry at attorney general janet reno , at the president of the united states , at the reporters who ask why he is here everyone here sees elian as their son , their grandson , their nephew , mr maldonado said , referring to a crowd of some 200 to 300 at 4 am , only a few demonstrators have gone away lazaro gonzalez , elian s greatuncle , stands in the yard , an everpresent marlboro smoldering between his fingers people in the crowd shout to him and praise him , and he responds in spanish , reassuring them that the boy is still inside , safe the demonstrators are often told the child is sleeping , but that does not stop people from chanting , singing or screaming his name between midnight and dawn a few will hold candles , but the effect is lost in the television lights people watch the sky for helicopters some think that , when the time comes , federal officials or perhaps even the united states marines will drop from the sky almost everyone is convinced that it will happen at dawn , or just before it is , people here say knowingly , how fidel would do it , and the united states officials are just puppets of fidel lazaro gonzalez , a bodyandfender car mechanic who was not particularly political before this confrontation , has flatly refused to hand over the boy , creating a bunker here , not of concrete but of human bodies and resolve the federal government has revoked his legal custody of a child , but people here laugh at that together , they keep watch around the clock the daytime crowd of demonstrators , which ranges between 50 and a few hundred , depending on the rain , heat and rumors of the day , is partly protest and partly party , with the aroma of grilling pork and the tinkling music from ice cream trucks mixing in the air with cries of janet reno es comunista the late night is often filled with younger people on their way back from south beach or the clubs on calle ocho , one more stop on their lists of things to do they may or may not die for elian , but they are dressed to kill but in the predawn , when the comfortable demonstrators have slipped away , the hatred for fidel castro almost glows on northwest second street it is not that the people there are the ones who suffered in political prisons or lost their businesses or relatives when they went into exile the revolution was 40 long years ago , and many of those cubanamericans are old or have died the older demonstrators tend to go home early , anyway these are their sons and daughters , and the new arrivals who have a fresh reason to hate mr castro , people like miguel lopez mr lopez , 23 , kept watch in the night he arrived in the united states from cuba two years ago , not on a raft but as a winner in a visa lottery we were like slaves in the fields , said mr lopez , who worked the sugar cane fields i made good grades in school , but i could n't go to college because i missed one day of work in the fields he was headed for a life of manual labor and knew he could not say a word about it because his life would only worsen maybe he would even be sent to prison we had to choose every word carefully , he said i was nobody , he said i was worthless in the predawn , it is almost as if the emotion has been boiled down to its most dense concentration the united states , once a haven from persecution , is now an enemy , pure and simple , many here said cubanamericans are , at 3 am , cuban i was born here because of fidel castro , said alberto gonzalez , 27 , a college student his parents came to the united states in 1962 , just three years after mr castro seized power there are bodies on the bottom of the ocean floor , he said , passionately there is a history of death and no one seems to care vivian trigo , 41 , is a social worker in miami she was born here , but this morning that does not matter at all in cuba you cannot be what you want to be and do what you want to do , ms trigo said i know it like i lived there this child may be on a raft again in a few years and we 'll be in the same boat this is a freedom issue , not a custody issue every american should be down here defending cubans if they believe in their country no one really answers the question , what would you do if you were elian s father , juan miguel gonzalez \? a few said they would rather have their child live free in the united states than in a communist cuba elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of fort lauderdale on nov 25 his mother and 10 others died when their boat capsized crossing the straits from cuba this is a city with monuments to cuban rafters , though none as famous as this one , elian storefronts on calle ocho , or eighth street , in little havana and on coral way , a scenic connecting road between downtown and the city of coral gables , have murals of elian on his inner tube , tossed by the waves just a few blocks from the house where people keep their vigil , milagros cruz , blind since she was 10 years old , holds a tiny protest of her own in a tent just off flagler street ms cruz , 32 , arrived here from cuba in october , believing that she could send for her daughter after she got here but the castro government has refused to let her daughter join her , she said she is tired and faint from a hunger strike since march 21 to call attention to her own situation , and she wonders why all the attention is focused on elian ms cruz used to play her guitar and speak out against the castro government , and was put in prison and insane asylums in cuba , she said she said the cuban police would pick up the change that people had tossed down into her cup , shake it in her face so she could hear it jingle , then walk away the castro government told her she could leave earlier this year , she said , but when she sent for her daughter she was refused though she dreams that someone , anyone , will come to her aid the way thousands have come to elian s , i'm not angry about the attention he s getting , she said she would be with them if she did not have her own quiet little fight his father is an unscrupulous man , she said of juan miguel gonzalez i ca n't understand how a man can sell his child , and that s what he s doing with fidel they 're letting communism win photo alina senabre , 10 , spends weekend nights with her mother outside the house in which elian gonzalez sleeps \( laura kleinhenz saba , for the new york times \) \( pg a14 \)
britain s declaration that gen augusto pinochet is medically unfit to stand trial should not be the final word on this matter more information is needed , and it can be provided under a reasonable plan proposed yesterday by the spanish judge who is seeking to prosecute the former chilean dictator for human rights abuses under the plan , outlined by judge baltasar garzon , two doctors appointed by his madrid court would take part in a new examination of mr pinochet , who has suffered a series of minor strokes the result of that exam , and an earlier one performed solely by british physicians , would be made available to judge garzon he would then determine whether mr pinochet should be spared a trial because of mental impairment and an inability to understand the charges this case is too important to set aside without a second medical opinion , and without giving the spanish court access to the doctors' reports the british government has not shared the results of the first examination with the spanish court if mr pinochet is found by the spanish court to be unfit , even some of the most fervent advocates for prosecution would have to agree that justice would not be served by proceeding against an enfeebled man the case has already made a profound contribution to international law it established that even former heads of state do not enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity , and may be tried outside the country where the crimes were committed it has also had a liberating effect on chile when general pinochet was arrested in london in october 1998 , many feared that the charges would destabilize chile s transition to democracy as chileans prepare to vote for a new president this weekend , it appears the opposite has occurred between 1973 and 1990 general pinochet presided over the murder or disappearance of more than 3 , 000 chileans and the torture of thousands more his intimidation was so complete that he and his associates escaped prosecution for a decade after he stepped down but since his arrest , emboldened chilean courts have issued rulings that have shaken the military s immunity more than two dozen of his former officers have been arrested for murder and kidnapping former political prisoners are preparing to file the first criminal complaint accusing general pinochet and some of his former officers of torture none of this has disturbed chile s fledgling democracy on the contrary , chileans have experienced the first presidential campaign since his coup in 1973 that was not distorted by the polarizing legacies of general pinochet the candidates ricardo lagos , a socialist , and joaquin lavin , a former official in general pinochet s government have stressed everyday problems like health care , crime and unemployment it suggests that those who feared the destabilizing power of justice underestimated its healing effect
east rutherford , nj , june 1 brett hull scored the goal that won the stanley cup for the dallas stars last season , and he leads the tournament this season with 11 a veteran who has proven he is more than just a star shooter , hull retains the finishing touch to break open a game , and to close one , too he scored on the stars' first shot tonight in the first period against the devils and he scored on their last shot , with 4 minutes 16 seconds remaining the goals were enough to give the stars a 21 victory and allow them to tie the fourofsevengame stanley cup finals at one game apiece they helped make up for a 73 devils victory on tuesday night in which the stars were embarrassed everyone watched the tape , and you have half the guys saying 'just melt it throw it out , ' hull said , referring to the review of game 1 i said 'well , i think you have to watch it you have to learn from your mistakes' and the stars did the devils might not have the same negative reaction to tonight s visual record , but they will see things they do not like they will see martin brodeur , the goalie , missing hull s first shot on the glove side , the kind of puck he usually grabs on the second goal , they will see mike modano putting the puck by defenseman brian rafalski , then working it to jere lehtinen , who shot it toward the goalie as hull went to the net , defenseman scott stevens tried to cover him but hull got his stick free and redirected the puck into the goal larry robinson , the coach of the devils , called hull the best pure shooter in the league he does n't need a lot of chances , robinson added the devils' goal was scored by alexander mogilny in the first period games 3 and 4 of the series will be played on saturday and monday nights in dallas , where reunion arena s ice surface can be slushy and mushy , especially in the warmer months modano was already using it as a psychological ploy the weather has been nice and hot in dallas , modano said so i think that is something that we have gotten used to over the years and i think some teams may have trouble with that robinson said he had trouble with what he called his team s worst game since midway through the previous series against the philadelphia flyers although robinson did not dwell on the subject , that was also when brodeur was giving up soft goals and big rebounds and making poor clearing passes robinson instead dwelled on other aspects of the team s performance our decisions tonight with the puck were very poor , he said , adding that he thought dallas was offside on one of hull s goals i spoke to one of the linesmen about the play and he missed it , robinson said the shot that won the game was the 17th , and last , of the game for the stars brodeur said lehtinen kind of got a backhand and i kind of missed it and he kind of missed it i went to grab it with my glove and hull just came along and batted it out of the air , brodeur added reflecting on the momentum of the series , brodeur said tonight s defeat was not the end of the world they did score at the right time , he said of the stars they scored big goals they played a better , more sound game they gave us less opportunities in game 1 everything went in for us , and it was the other way around tonight ed belfour , the stars' goalie , stopped 27 of 28 new jersey shots he has won nine consecutive games after a stars defeat on tuesday he complained of cold symptoms and the distracting effects of medication he said he felt better tonight mogilny beat belfour on the glove side with a wrist shot after scott gomez set him up gomez carried the puck through the neutral zone and drew three stars toward him as they converged , gomez kicked the puck ahead with his skate to his stick and then found his linemate cutting free into the dallas zone most of the game saw tight checking by both teams patrik elias and petr sykora , the hot wings of the devils , occasionally forced themselves free for oddman rushes but even those were quickly stifled by either belfour or the dallas backcheckers players for both sides were rigorous about their positioning and careful about any gambles so that every mistake and there were not many seemed to stand out derian hatcher , the big dallas captain and defenseman , said it was almost like a chess match it s been a long time since we 've played a game that strategic on both sides the devils got good scoring chances from claude lemieux , who had five shots on goal , one soft head butt against jon sim and one helmet removal against hull also coming close was randy mckay , the right wing on the checking line , who put four shots on goal and played his second consecutive strong game the devils were encouraged by their 72 road record in these playoffs , but they would much rather be going to texas with a twogamestonone lead it s so frustrating , mckay said we could have won that game it was up for grabs photos the wing patrik elias of the devils , whose line was held scoreless in game 2 , was airborne after being checked by the stars' sylvain cote in the second period last night \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) devils' martin

the mound was vacant as the yankees' position players ran onto the field for the eighth inning last night , their lead over detroit secure there was some doubt as to whether the starting pitcher would come out for another inning , but when the burly man wearing no 22 trotted out of the dugout , the fans cheered for roger clemens , they cheered and hollered , little more than a month after they booed him off the mound on the night the mets destroyed him much has changed since then clemens has changed he s roger clemens again now he s pumping fastballs for strikes early in the count , finishing off hitters with splitters and sliders now he s brushing back hitters now clemens wins about every game he pitches for the first time since joining the yankees , clemens has won four consecutive starts , after whiffing 11 and walking none in eight innings of a 91 thrashing of the tigers last night at yankee stadium he s throwing a lot like he did when he faced us , said derek jeter , the yankees' shortstop i feel strong , clemens said clemens was activated off the disabled list july 2 , after a couple of weeks in tampa , fla , and after hearing another in a series of free motivational speeches from george steinbrenner , the yankees' owner clemens has won all of his starts since then , compiling a 184 earned run average , striking out 24 and walking 6 in 29 1 3 innings manager joe torre was quick to credit steinbrenner last night for playing a role in clemens s turnaround , but then , it would be impolitic not to what seems more plausible is that clemens has reinvested in his fastball jeter and jorge posada and others on the yankees have noticed how much more aggressive he is with it clemens often threw his slider and splitter early in the count last year , fell behind in the count , and then was pounded when opponents were able to anticipate a particular pitch he is throwing fastballs , with impunity detroit s dean palmer got pushed back in the second inning last night and attacking batters clemens \( 86 \) threw strikes on the first pitch to 11 of the first 14 batters he faced the climate was right for aggressiveness the first pitch he threw in the game was a fastball , to luis polonia , a few inches off the edge of the plate , and posada caught it , framed it for brian o'nora , the home plate umpire strike one , said o'nora clemens spun a slider to the same spot strike two , o'nora called clemens and posada ascertained immediately that they were working with favorable conditions it did n't cost us the ballgame , said phil garner , the detroit manager , but he had a wide zone said brad ausmus , the tigers catcher clemens is tough enough to face with a regular strike zone as a hitter , you get upset to his credit , he s an intelligent pitcher , he s going to take advantage of it hideo nomo could not the detroit righthander could not throw strikes the yankees drew walks , or waited for pitches to hammer jeter who has two firstinning walks in his last five games , after going 55 games without one walked in the first inning and went home when paul o'neill bashed a tworun homer jeter lined a threerun triple in the second inning , nomo was knocked out in the third , david justice slammed a tworun homer in the fourth , and clemens could pitch stress free it was the 96th game of his career with 10 or more strikeouts , one fewer than sandy koufax , who ranks third in that category it was the 255th victory of clemens s career , 35th best in history clemens trotted off after the eighth inning , to more cheering , and he and posada chatted easily in the dugout clemens complimented posada for being able to frame the fastballs he threw to the outside corner , rather than letting the impact of the pitch turn his glove no windshield wipers , clemens said he is throwing harder than he did in may , ausmus thought , 93 to 95 miles an hour he is roger clemens , again inside pitch orlando hernandez , placed on the disabled list tuesday , will undergo tests on his elbow today hernandez has had trouble with his back and arm this year , and admitted he s gained weight if the yankees could do everything madetoorder , they would pick up a hardhitting righthanded left fielder with enough defensive ability to play center field but everything is not madetoorder , and they are considering even the imperfect options the yankees may wait beyond the july 31 trade deadline to make a deal , according to one club official , and by the end of august , more players could be available , as teams fall out of the pennant races until then , their best lineup is arguably with chuck knoblauch as the designated hitter and jose vizcaino playing second base a lineup manager joe torre used for the seventh time in last night s game against detroit it does n't bother me , knoblauch said i think it s about what the best thing is for the team , and if that s what it takes , i'm all for it torre would prefer another solution you 'd like a little more power potential , torre said i 'd like to get another guy in there who s more of a threat photos paul o'neill , right , accepting congratulations from bernie williams after

oh , what an audience mr morley has been telling his sam ting joke , and other similarly painful stories , since sam ting may have actually come through ellis island and each tuesday and wednesday afternoon this summer , he is telling them again and again , filling the copa room with his fans senior citizens , that s who comes now some of them come every week to hear the same jokes , said mr morley , putting on his tux in his miniscule dressing room backstage at the sands mr morley said he did n't need much a little room for his banjo , clarinet and ocarina , and someplace to put in my teeth mr morley has been a south jersey shore institution since the old comic mickey shaughnessey saw him performing his quasimusical comic act in philadelphia in 1949 mr shaughnessey s buddy , ed suez , needed a nightly opening act for his north wildwood club mr morley , then 23 , figured it would be a good summer gig on his way up the entertainment ladder the gig , with a few twists and turns , has lasted a halfcentury so far i love italian food but the italians , they 're tough went to this italian restaurant and ordered chicken in a basket every leg was broken mr morley grew up in the irish neighborhood around third and mckean streets in south philadelphia , a skinny boy who picked up music by borrowing instruments from the mummers string bands whose clubhouses were nearby he learned jokes on the street , and since the streets nearby also had jewish , polish , italian and africanamerican people living on them , most of the jokes had an ethnic tinge i suppose none of my jokes are politically correct now , but when i learned them , that was what was politically correct , to make fun of yourself and everyone else just to make everyone laugh , mr morley said that was n't the point , is n't now somehow it got changed around he said he was at once both shy and pushy he wanted to get in bands , but had to put on an aggressive persona to overcome his shyness every band i was in , i got on their nerves and they fired me , he said finally , he decided to go it alone , tell jokes and do silly songs one south philadelphia club owner thought he was the younger brother of another entertainer named cozy dolan they called me little cozy , said mr morley , whose given name is thomas i kept telling them i was n't a dolan but it did n't matter and for the last 60 years or so , mr morley s crowd has been quite cozy with his act my wife is polish but sometimes well there were these three polish guys at a bar they were laughing and drinking away one guy said , me and my brothers here put together this jigsaw puzzle in three weeks i said , so , what s the big deal \? well , the guy said , the box said 2 to 4 years mr suez finally wanted to sell his north wildwood club in 1958 he offered it first to mr morley i told him i only had 10 , 000 , mr morley said , and he said he would take 5 , 000 down and it was mine the place was named club avalon , but even mr morley called it the toilet mr suez had n't put a dime into the place in years and mr morley spent maybe three times that much , nailing in a few loose floorboards and shoring up the plywood tables still , fairly big names came to play the club avalon and its 1 , 100 seats during its glory days julius la rosa , johnny ray , the four lads , carmel quinn no matter who was there , mr morley still did his act , which varied little from night to night i do n't know , but people seemed to like it , said mr morley , who never charged more than 2 for a drink at the club they 'd come week after week , year after year boy , did i love that place though he played all over the philadelphia and south jersey area in the winter , mr morley could n't wait to open club avalon every memorial day he 'd play his banjo , tell old jokes , play his clarinet , tell more old jokes , play a trumpet or trombone and tell even more old jokes but finally , he could n't tell them any more at the club avalon in 1989 , the town condemned it and mr morley was forced to tear it down he said he fully intended to rebuild it , but he said the town told him he had lost all his grandfather clauses and would only be allowed to have 165 seats in the new club so he sold the land , no doubt for a huge profit , said friends , who said mr morley is a millionaire many times over from real estate investments in new jersey , pennsylvania and florida he admits to having homes in florida and wildwood , in addition to his primary residence along the cooper river in haddon township in camden county , where he lives with his wife , bobbie yet still , at age 75 , he performs as much as he can , even if the performances rarely vary one casino or another has given him a venue through the 1990 s and the sands has invited him back after his summer run for another week at christmas sometimes i tell the jokes out of order , he said but maybe that s a senior moment i did n't ask to be irish and white we just pop out by the way , i do n't buy that jesus was jewish i think he was irish look , he was 33 years old and still living with his mother he was unmarried he had 12 drinking buddies and , look , if he was jewish , he would n't be going to the last supper he 'd go to the early bird special the centerpiece of every show is his signature paean to the south jersey shore , the song , on the way to cape may it was something the writers buddy nugent and joe ginhart gave him to sing in 1947 the story was that buddy had seven kids and as they drove to wildwood , they made up a poem about the towns along the way , mr morley said so he brings out his banjo or plays clarinet with his threepiece orchestra and he and his audiences do a halfdozen choruses of the ditty every show on the way to cape may , i fell in love with you on the way to cape may , you made my dreams come true i was captured by your smile , as we passed by sea isle my heart was gone , when we reached avalon , they sing on the way to cape may , stone harbor skies were blue we were naming the day , when wildwood came into view and now , mr morley said , he is trying to interest governor whitman in a song he has written about the state , it s new jersey gee , but it s great to live in a state like new jersey , mr morley sang in a tapdance beat in the dressing room salt water taffy and sun gee , but it s fun to live in new jersey but even if mrs whitman is n't interested , mr morley will go on with what has been good for him i know it s getting near the end , said mr morley , fixing his black tie for perhaps only the 300 , 000th time in his career but i 'll continue on because everyone s been so good to me i owe them that photos cozy morley , an entertainer who has been a south jersey shore institution since 1949 and is still drawing in the 60 to 90plus crowd , prepares in his dressing room before going onstage at the sands in atlantic city \( photographs by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 12 \) cozy morley preparing for a performance in atlantic city \( laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 15 \)
there is more than a little merriment in two oneact plays about the deaths of parents , combined under the title she keeps time , and none of it is gallows humor allison eve zell s come to leave and pickling by suzanlori parks were written independently and with different intentions , but bringing them together in a staging by scenic route productions and the queen s company , with both plays directed by ms zell , creates resonances that make you notice details in both that might be missed in separate performances come to leave , the more allusive and abstract of the two , actually takes the most direct approach to escaping from grief a young woman , whose father died after driving her to vassar to begin her freshman year , finds as she approaches graduation that her real education was her internal search for a way to let go of her memory of her father without losing her connection to him at the beginning lethia nall , as the woman , slowly emerges from a closed steamer trunk in a black academic gown , whispering , i have n't spoken a word in years , and you find that easy to believe because through the rest of the 30minute play she relies on movement and expression much more than on words to let you know what is happening to her she says little about her father and speaks only one line directly to him our arguments gave me the strength of moses if the audience gets any sense of him , it is entirely through the emotions of the woman the play is about her , not about death even with ms zell directing her own work , this takes some extraordinary acting from ms nall after the woman steps out of the trunk , she keeps taking things from her past out of it , and we can see ms nall make the character grow in poise and introspection with each hint of story an object evokes and the story itself her story begins to seem funnier by the moment to her as she realizes that while she paid attention to grief for four years , all the time she was becoming a smart and thoughtful woman at one point the woman begins a kind of word association on the little bo peep nursery rhyme , and by the time she ends it , gazing at the audience and asking pointedly , what does it mean to lose your sheep \? she has everyone laughing , even though ms nall s face and movements have told us that what the character is really doing is throwing off obsession the entire set piece becomes a meditation on theater s role in snapping bonds , and that so many levels of thought can be conveyed in so few words testifies to great skill in both the actress and the director ms zells s direction cannot quite overcome one problem posed by herself as the writer we see the woman entirely in terms of a single experience unfolding through several years , leaving the uncomfortable suspicion that the story might be as much a personal diary as a creation that can make the audience quite uneasy there is no question about the robust independence of the middleaged black woman speaking to us in pickling she calls herself only miss miss , but she can fill the whole theater and summon up a couple of other characters as fullbodied as herself at the outset miss miss realized with deep subtlety and faultless comic timing by jaye austinwilliams seems even more confined than the woman in the trunk she s in some kind of pantry , apparently wedged into a cylindrical space surrounded by towering stacks of her dead mother s canning jars , in which through a long life she had pickled whole orchards and farms the action of the play is simply a dismantling of the pyramid of containers , but what a wild flight of hopes and memories is freed from them along the way some of what s in them reminds miss miss of a death she cannot ignore , though she labors mightily to orestes the mother killer or a wriggly knot of worms or a snatch of old voodoo ceremony are as likely to pop out of a jar as pickled beets or saved scraps of meat but miss miss has other things in those jars , as shining as dreams , especially tokens saved from her one fleeting romance , which took place during moments when her mother s eyes were closed , with a lifeguard who lived next door she has not the vocabulary to describe him , except as so strong , but in a few moments you know him she has his laugh saved up and pops open a jar to let you hear it \( a moment that leaves you breathless with laughter \) , and his breath , and the imprint of his lips and much more during this opening up of the heart of miss miss , ms austinwilliams lets you see an entirely different person inside this woman you glimpse both at once , as if she were a transparent russian doll of course , the mother s photograph is also pickled , and though the lid is never lifted on that jar , she slowly swells into a vast presence , so large that it was never possible , for many years , for miss miss to get around her through the door to the outside but the mother died in the doorway , and as miss miss opens and discards jars she realizes there s nowhere else to go but out strengthening her resolve with variations on a chant of now , begin , she opens a hole in the wall of the past before she leaves , she takes the lid off a jar of sand her lifeguard had walked in and , rubbing it on her arms , feels for the first time since youth the warmth of the sun in the memory of his step then she grabs a hat from the debris she is walking out of and strolls toward a bright , bare yellow wall , looking , in elizabeth barrett browning s fine phrase , a little sunburnt by the glare of life as she lifts her face to the sky , she leaves you with the feeling that she s looking right at you it is a blinding moment of elation so unexpected it makes you want to yell , and most people in the theater do she keeps time two oneact plays directed by allison eve zell costumes by lauren cordes lighting design and stage manager , hidehiro usui sound and visual consultant , greg king presented by scenic route productions and the queen s company at the mint space , 311 west 43rd street , clinton come to leave , by allison eve zell with lethia nall pickling , by suzanlori parks with jaye austinwilliams photos jaye austinwilliams in pickling , by suzanlori parks lethia nall in come to leave , a oneact play by allison e zell in which ms nall plays a vassar student contemplating her father s death as she is about to graduate \( photographs by fran collin for the new york times \)
it is a measure of bill bradley s distance from the real world of power politics in this country that he seems somehow to have convinced himself that he can revive his presidential campaign by winning the nonbinding democratic primary in the state of washington so he s gone off to the great northwest , which is probably a more congenial place for the cerebral former senator than some of the bigger , noisier primary states like new york and california mr bradley goes his own way , meandering , leaving the rough and tumble to others it is fair to wonder if his heart is really in this race mr bradley sounded some nice themes as he geared up his campaign last year he said the united states had a moral obligation to lift as many of its children out of poverty as possible he said it was time to vanquish racial discord from our hearts and spirit and he came up with a plan that was supposed to make health insurance available to nearly all americans the health insurance plan was crucial to mr bradley s candidacy , and it became a liability al gore jumped on it like a dog tearing into red meat mr bradley was offended by the ferocity and in his view unscrupulousness of the attacks all politics is personal when mr bradley saw a win in new hampshire slipping away from him , he retaliated against mr gore bitterly , personally and relentlessly he all but called the vice president a liar and suggested he was n't fit to be president those attacks continue the irony is that mr gore was more right than wrong about the bradley plan it is impractical and could cause more harm than good it would require a massive restructuring of the nation s health care delivery and finance systems , and would probably erode the availability and quality of health care that the poor currently receive from medicaid all of which is moot , because the plan is not about to see the light of day democrats in congress have not yet recovered from the trauma of the clinton health care debacle a proposal as sweeping as mr bradley s would have no chance none , zero of passing congress in the foreseeable future a congressional aide who is an expert on health care legislation put it this way the clinton plan in large part fell of its own weight , and i think an awful lot of members have taken away from that experience the belief that the best and possibly the only way to reform the health care system which all democrats believe needs reforming in a number of ways is to do it in very targeted , incremental steps mr gore s major health care initiative is an effort to get universal coverage for children by the year 2005 dr jack lewin , the chief executive officer of the california medical association , said this week mr bradley has raised an issue which i think will have great relevance in the future and we 're all indebted to him for being a visionary mr gore is looking at the practical reality of the world and saying , 'let s take a step that is viable' the practical reality of the world is just the thing that mr bradley seems so adept at skirting how do you lift as many children out of poverty as possible \? how do you vanquish racial discord \? how do you overcome the recalcitrance in congress and really bring health coverage to all americans \? it is one thing to talk movingly about these matters , which mr bradley does it is another thing to rally the support that is necessary to make some of these things happen there are times when mr bradley reminds me of the line that the sundance kid tosses at butch cassidy you just keep thinking , butch that s what you 're good at butch s own assessment is , i have vision , and the rest of the world wears bifocals the practical reality of running for the democratic nomination for president would seem to require that bill bradley do all he can over the next 12 days to generate the kind of excitement in new york and california that could lead to upset wins in those two vast and crucial states without them , he s finished but mr bradley is in the pacific northwest , where it s quiet and cool and peaceful , and you can think those big and exciting thoughts
the two big moments in the first episode of the new fugitive are physically spectacular the first comes near the beginning when dr richard kimble , once again running from a justice system that has convicted him of killing his wife , escapes from his nemesis , lieutenant gerard , by jumping from an overpass onto a moving truck he avoids being decapitated by executing a leapandgrab maneuver that would have earned him gymnastic gold at the sydney olympics the second big moment comes about 40 minutes into the hour , when kimble is cornered by gerard on a high ledge of a building under construction in a nod to the 1993 harrison ford movie \( produced by the same team responsible for this series \) , kimble jumps off the ledge , falls into a net which then begins to rip apart beneath him and staves off certain death by grabbing what is left of the net and using it in tarzanfashion to swing himself back onto the ledge of a lower floor whew ! the likelihood of either of these highlights gracing an episode of the old \( 19631967 \) fugitive is very small the original fugitive s big moments would have found him crouching behind a door in a small , windowless room , or refusing one of the easy outs offered by the many men and women eager both to protect him and to hold on to him , or waiting passively while some troubled person often a child decides whether to betray him or to remain silent and allow him to begin running again these were the big moments in the original fugitive because they got to the heart of what that show was about the formation of character in situations of intense and private moral choice , a choice that few will see made but one that will alter for better or worse the person who makes it this new fugitive \( friday nights at 8 on cbs \) has no interest in character at all and stakes everything on the double plot that comes along with the concept gerard chasing kimble and kimble chasing the onearmed man who really killed his wife the twin pressures of that plot were certainly utilized in the original , but only as bookends ushering kimble into the scene of character formation and ushering him out when his work the work of a combination pediatrician , therapist and policeman was done in between is where everything happened , as kimble \( played by the consummate television actor david janssen \) quickly developed relationships of dependence , complicity , brotherhood and parenthood with a small number of people closely linked to one another by ambitions , jealousies , aspirations and more forms of loneliness than one would have thought imaginable by the end of an episode , none of those with whom kimble interacted would be what they were when he first entered their lives each would have learned a lesson or failed to learn it , with future consequences that were clear to viewers even if they were not spelled out by contrast , the characters who populate the new fugitive barely deserve the name hastily sketchedin stereotypes \( the crooked construction foreman , the attractive woman with a winsome little girl , the venal clerk in a seedy hotel \) , they are utterly dispensable and serve only to ferry kimble from one moment of physical danger to the next in the original , by the time of the fadeout we felt that we knew this town and its inhabitants better than we knew kimble , who worked very hard at withholding himself from everyone , including us when the new show returns kimble to the road , we know and care about nothing , because everything we have been shown is onedimensional and forgettable this is true of kimble himself as played by tim daly \( brother of tyne , and son of james , who appeared in two episodes of the original series \) it s not simply that mr daly is just another pretty face janssen was even prettier \( especially in the early years , before the legendary hard living that led to his death at the age of 48 \) but when lois nettleton \( one of the great character actresses who made repeat appearances during the original show s run \) said to him , you sure have a face , she meant not only that he was physically attractive despite alarmingly big ears but that in his face she saw a complex mixture of fear , anxiety , outward turmoil and inner peace when in the first episode of the new series , broadcast oct 6 , the obligatory lonelywomanwhofallsforkimble tells him that he is different and much more than he seems to be \( a lowly daylaborer \) , the only thing she could possibly mean is that he s the star , for nothing at all separates him from all the other darkhaired wiry younger men who populate the generic dramas of the present television landscape as kimble is about to escape for the third time in a single hour , gerard declares , i will never stop , and the fugitive replies , neither will i but where similar exchanges in the original are energized by complicated patterns of interdependence and obsessiveness that bind the two together , here the urgency of their statements is energized only by the hope that the series will last for its season s run and that next year they will still have jobs
the democratic and republican challengers are not just attracting attention in their own parties we 've gotten a bunch of calls from people saying , 'would n't john mccain and bill bradley be something as our ticket , ' said jack gargan , the reform party chairman , who has no idea who might emerge as his party s nominee for now , a dozen people have declared their intention to carry the reform banner , but only patrick j buchanan , the former republican and conservative commentator , has any kind of name recognition ross perot , the billionaire texan who founded the party and was its nominee in 1992 and 1996 , is said to be mulling over another run donald j trump , the new york real estate developer , is also considering it but none of them would infuse the reform party with the kind of mainstream cache and credibility that senator mccain of arizona and former senator bradley of new jersey could provide , judging by the trouble they are creating for the republican and democratic presumptive frontrunners , gov george w bush of texas and vice president al gore the notion of either mr mccain s or mr bradley s joining the reform effort , let alone as a ticket , has mr gargan salivating , despite his professed neutrality as party chairman , he insisted , he can neither show favoritism nor recruit presidential candidates the only way for any candidate to seek the party s nomination is to express an interest to party officials or notify the reform presidential nominating committee i ca n't call them , and as far as i know they have n't contacted us , mr gargan said but i will say this any national figure with such a proreform background as john mccain would certainly be welcome as our party s candidate and if he wants to bring along mr bradley , so much the better
paris , july 10 there is a miniature by the 18thcentury italian painter giandomenico cignaroli , there are a couple of sketched portraits by the movie director pier paolo pasolini and there are furs and haute couture dresses as well as shoes and gloves galore yet when these and other even more personal items come up for auction here in december , the point of interest will not be their intrinsic value but their provenance all belonged to maria callas , arguably the 20th century s most famous operatic diva when she died at 53 in paris on sept 16 , 1977 , her unlikely heirs were her estranged husband , giovanni battista meneghini , whom she left for the greek shipping magnate aristotle onassis in 1959 , and her mother , evangelia , with whom she had not spoken in 25 years they sold the furniture and paintings in her apartment on the avenue georges mandel and then divided up the personal objects , with meneghini s half going to italy and evangelia s share sent to greece now , after passing into other hands , these collections of callas memorabilia are coming together again for a preauction exhibition that will open in monaco on july 28 and travel to tokyo and new york before returning to paris for display prior to the auction at drouotmontaigne on dec 2 and 3 after that , they will be dispersed , bringing to a close sporadic efforts to create a callas museum in both greece and italy the logic of the auction is the continuation of the dispersal of callas s belongings since the time of her death , explained frederic chambre , a partner in the french auction house calmels chambre cohen many things have been sold or were lost , but these are the two largest extant collections he added this is an auction in the spirit of the marilyn monroe auction it s an intimate , private affair but it is also one that mr chambre and his colleagues are eager to have noticed , in the conviction that legions of callas devotees dream of possessing something that brings them closer to the legendary divina , anything that she once owned , touched , wore many of the items on sale will be on view in new york from nov 7 to 13 at the showroom of leftbidcom at 1016 madison avenue , near 78th street the auction itself will also be open to internet bidders using the site www leftbid com among the 400 or so lots on sale , a number stand out for their close association with callas cignaroli s holy family , for instance , was given to her by meneghini , who was then courting her , when she sang the title role in ponchielli s gioconda in her first performance in verona in 1947 the painting , kept in a red velvet case , traveled with her everywhere and can be seen in many photographs taken in her dressing rooms around the world the auction also includes callas s chinchilla coat , made for her in the 1950 s by her couturiere friend biki milan , who was puccini s granddaughter among the many photographs of the fiery soprano in this coat is one in which both meneghini and onassis can be seen holding onto her , as if wrestling for possession in the 1960 s the coat was covered by emerald green silk , with the chinchilla becoming its lining , and that is how it now looks the other fur to be sold is a white mink bolero jacket with the word maria woven into its lining the two pasolini portraits as well as a heavy amethystcolored glass necklace date from 1969 , when callas played medea in a nonoperatic film of euripides' play the film was not a commercial success but established a close friendship with pasolini that lasted until the italian director s own death in 1975 callas herself was a collector , not of valuable paintings or furniture \( although she owned copies of a cycladic statue and of a greek tomb , also to be sold \) but of anything linked to her life and career thus the auction will be offering three of her personal photo albums \( which not only show her before and after her famous crash diet in 1954 but also as a blonde and as a brunette \) , envelopes full of newspaper cuttings , letters from friends and admirers , and many of her contracts , including those for her first and last performances at la scala in milan , in 1951 and 1958 the tape recorder that callas used to practice her roles will also be for sale , along with a collection of largespool tapes of recordings of her favorite music these include one of her recordings of tosca and a surprising amount of nonvocal classical music , like symphonies by saintsaens and sibelius , chopin waltzes and vivaldi s four seasons among the many scores that she kept are those for richard strauss songs and a piano version of verdi s don carlo but most of the auction lots are decidedly more personal there is an array of colorful party dresses , handbags , shoes , hats and wigs , but also slips , stockings , a black girdle , two brassieres and an embroidered blue corset of the kind known in french as a guepiere callas , renowned for her long slim hands , owned drawers full of elbowlength kid gloves in many colors 14 pairs of gloves are in the auction nothing , though , could be more personal than three plaits of the diva s hair , all in slightly different tones of brunette

the most brilliant manager in the history of the new york yankees at least in this century sat behind his desk in his yankee stadium office yesterday afternoon , a day after guiding his team to its fourth world series championship in five years this one was the toughest , said joe torre , and perhaps the most improbable this fivegame series victory over the mets was , in its cockeyed way , as remarkable as any of the other 25 won by the bronx bombers , dating back to their first , in 1923 , when the mighty babe was discovering that a ballpark sometimes seemed no bigger than a birdhouse no team had ever gone into postseason play as bedraggled , as woebegone , as akin to a car puttering along with four flat tires , as the 2000 yankees , losers of 15 of their last 18 games at regular season s end but now here sat torre , his deepset eyes serene after having not gone to bed until 5 am , as aglow within , one might guess , as the diamondstudded world series ring on his finger this one , he said , holding up the ring , is from last year s championship i 'll change to the new one just as soon as i get it one can hardly fault him for wishing to stay au courant after all , there is that weighty pinstriped legacy looking over his shoulder , literally on the wall behind him was a framed drawing of five of the most prominent yankee managers of the previous century miller huggins , who led the team to six pennants and three world championships in the 1920 s joe mccarthy , whose 19311946 yankees won eight pennants and seven world series casey stengel , manager of 10 pennant winners and 7 world series winners , from 1949 to 1960 \( and a record five titles in a row \) , and billy martin , who netted two pennants , one world series championship and five separate and wacko terms as manager torre was asked where he saw himself in the history of great yankee managers he did n't he said he could hardly believe his luck i was in the game for 30 years before coming here , he said , remarking on his years as a player for 16 years with the braves , the cardinals and the mets , and as a manager for 14 years with the braves , the cardinals and the mets torre had never been in a world series game before joining the yankees in 1996 , and was only in the playoffs once , as manager of the braves it was like there was always one step up to reach the top of the hill , but we i kept slippin' , he said now it seemed i had someone holding my arm and helping me to reach the top as one of his predecessors , casey stengel , had said , i want to thank all the players for giving me the opportunity of being what i was torre has expressed equal , if somewhat less convoluted , appreciation for his troops not only did torre come to the yankees with a sub500 career managing record , so did huggins and stengel mccarthy had won one pennant in five previous seasons with the cubs \( and none with boston after he left the yankees \) and none of those managers had to contend with division and league playoffs , making entry into the world series more grueling than ever did torre believe he was a better manager now than in previous jobs \? i do n't , he said for one thing , i have an owner who i can talk with directly , who will spend the money to get the players i think i need i do n't think i had that before and your players know that , and often respond accordingly the yankees have often seemed to do that so where lies the art of the manager \? look to the losing streak he was so patient , billy connors , the pitching coach , said yesterday it was amazing he never screamed , he never hollered he did crack the occasional joke i had to laugh , otherwise i 'd cry , torre said we were n't playing well because our pitching was poor i believed it would come around i had to show patience as for torre s strategy in winning i know i get a lot of credit for that , he said he recalled the last game against the mets on thursday night i started vizcaino at second base ahead of sojo because he hits al leiter better jose vizcaino was lifted for a pinchhitter late in the game luis sojo went to second for defensive purposes and then , torre said , luis comes up in the ninth and gets the big hit off leiter to win the game i guess that shows you how smart i am as smart or smarter than any manager in the 21st century , and he s making a good case for himself for all the other centuries , too as casey also said you could look it up
hamilton township approaching rat s for the first time , you might think you 'd wandered into one of those senseless , antic dreams from which you wake up giggling the road from interstate 295 , which seems headed for nothing more enticing than a wasteland of industrial parks on the bedraggled outskirts of trenton , turns out to be lined with largerthanlife contemporary sculptures , including a superrealistic molar as big as a bungalow just when you think you 've gotten hopelessly lost amid the corporate clutter , you find yourself on an island of greenery dotted with still more sculpture , much of it lifted from french impressionist paintings and a sign that says , welcome to rat s where on earth are you \? this is grounds for sculpture , a 22acre oasis carved out of the old new jersey state fairgrounds by the astonishingly eccentric sculptor and pharmaceutical heir j seward johnson jr before we get to the restaurant , a short course in mr johnson s art serious critics have dismissed it as kitsch , and it s hard to argue with them what else do you call a weirdly lifelike recreation of manet s dejeuner sur l'herbe , lovingly rendered in handpainted bronze \? that molar is his , too , and so is the buxom , nightgownclad lady of the house who greets restaurantgoers from a lighted secondstory window , prompting double takes and guffaws but here s where mr johnson , who turned 70 last month , gets the last laugh it works it would be hard to overstate the audaciousness of this place from the incongruity of the setting to the spirited silliness of much of the artwork to the opulence of the landscaping \( manmade ponds , monetinspired bridges \) to the name of the restaurant itself on paper , it s a recipe for a theme park , a rich man s ego trip johnson world but mr johnson s vision is so big , so original , so playful and carried off with so much attention to detail that it succeeds dazzlingly and the restaurant , which is an intrinsic part of the vision , is not far behind the name , of course , was mr johnson s idea , taken from the loyal and charming host in kenneth grahame s wind in the willows \( 'there s a banquet for you ! ' observed the rat , as he arranged the table 'i know some animals who would give their ears to be sitting down to supper with us tonight ! ' \) from the time he opened grounds for sculpture , in 1992 , mr johnson spoke of including a worldclass restaurant where art lovers could enjoy a fine meal in a village inspired by monet s giverny the idea must have sounded just as improbable as everything else about the grounds , but he stuck with it , hired architects , builders , consultants and a chef , and opened his restaurant last january rat s is as gorgeous as its setting housed in a sprawling recreation of a givernylike inn , it has five dining rooms with 110 seats on two levels , several of them with fireplaces that perfume it with wood smoke on chilly evenings \( in warmer weather , rat s will begin serving on a patio overlooking one of mr johnson s ponds \) the floors and beams are weathered wood salvaged from old barns and factories , and the rugs and furniture and tableware might have been salvaged from the 18thcentury bed and breakfast of your dreams tables are so comfortably spaced that i barely noticed a wheelchair gliding by the restaurant is not yet hitting on all cylinders in three recent visits , i had two superb meals and one that was disappointingly ordinary all the more disappointing because prices are among the highest in the state , averaging 80 for a dinner with wine , tax and tip \( lunch prices are considerably lower \) still , there s so much to like about rat s that i 'd send anyone there for a special occasion others clearly have the same idea it can take six weeks to get a reservation on a saturday night the chef is eric martin , a 32yearold graduate of the culinary institute of america who has worked with prominent chefs like daniel boulud , christian delouvrier and joel robuchon in france and the united states \( his previous restaurant was the wellregarded stage left , in new brunswick \) his cooking is seldom spectacular but beautifully balanced , firmly anchored in his french and american training but contemporary in its love for other cultures and fresh ingredients consider the darne of salmon , a fresh and tender piece of fish seared with asian spices , sitting on a bed of jasmine rice in a moat of intense ponzu vinaigrette with shiitake and treeear mushrooms the flavors are elemental but unexpected , surprisingly well balanced another main course , very different but working on the tastebuds in a similar way , is a meaty grilled portobello mushroom on a slab of polenta , with roasted onions and peppers and a splendid culinary flourish deepfried zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese long before the entrees comes a giveaway appetizer , not only different each night but often different from diner to diner i like to have fun , said mr martin , and he does one night he might offer ham and eggs little slices of mild ham topped with a fried quail egg and another a minihamburger , complete with a tiny pickle and a dollsized sesame bun \( pull up a chair , mr mole \)
atlanta bp amoco introduced a new model of gas station yesterday , and the least important item for sale is the gas the prototype of what will be a nationwide line of new stations , called bp connect , was outfitted with solar panels , and spiffed up with the new green , yellow and white bp sunburstshaped symbol customers will be able to check the forecast for an impending thunderstorm on a small screen at the pump , buy a bottle of wine and some freshbaked croissants at a neonfree supermarket inside , or log in to the latest news at an ecommerce kiosk the decidedly upscale new digs are a launching pad for the company s new 7 million rebranding campaign that aims to reposition bp amoco , an oldeconomy gas station giant , into a progressive , environmentally friendly retailer that goes , in the company s own words , beyond petroleum the decision to introduce a new brand image and spruce up its service stations comes at a time when , as gas prices increase , competition for customer loyalty is especially fierce not only must bp amoco deal with the consumers' growing sentiment of hostility toward gas companies , it also has to figure out how to best use its four major brands bp , amoco , arco , and castrol the rebranding campaign was seen by brand analysts as a way of increasing operating margins the retail petroleum business is a dull , boring and uninteresting business in which the drivers of preference are location and price , and brands have not played a very significant role in gas stations , said john k grace , executive director of interbrand corporation , a brand consulting company because branding has been weak , consumers have a difficult time differentiating among top quality players these petroleum manufacturers are missing the boat in terms of what role brand can play while the price at the pump may be on the minds of most drivers this summer , there is a growing and large percentage of people who do n't go to gas stations for gas , said peter dixon , senior partner at lippincott margulies , a corporate identity consulting company owned by marsh mclennan indeed , bp amoco is looking to pull drivers into the stations' stores , where they can buy items that are more profitable to sell than gasoline while filling their tanks , customers can order a cafe latte that will be waiting for them once they 've finished pumping their gas if they really want to rush , bp is working on wireless technology that will enable them to send in their payments ahead of time the goal is to have half of the stations' revenue coming from gas sales and the other half coming from the convenience store , doug ford , bp amoco s chief executive for refining and marketing , told reporters yesterday at a georgia test site for the new station currently , 80 percent of revenue comes from gasoline sales and the rest from retail sales to me this is a real estate business , mr ford said we 're managing a particular site bp amoco , which analysts say has always been particularly sensitive to brand identity , began discussing branding as soon as its 482 billion acquisition of amoco was complete in january 1999 both brands needed a face lift amoco s stations had kept the same design for the last 20 years and bp for the last 12 the company hired landor associates , a division of young rubicam , to research consumer attitudes toward the stations landor found that customers liked amoco products but thought the red , white and blue stations were too dark at the same time , they found the green and yellow bp colors appealing sir john browne , bp amoco s chief executive , decided that if bp amoco was going to be recognized as a global brand , it needed to have one strong identity , a company official said the advertising to promote the new brand image was created by ogilvy mather worldwide , part of the wpp group , which was named by bp amoco as its global agency in november the ads , which focus on bp s role as a green company , will start running in print and on television today one commercial asks is it possible to drive a car and still have a clean environment \? can business go further and be a force for good \? bp says it plans to spend 25 million a fiscal quarter on its branding campaign the first bp connect stations will open in indianapolis , cleveland , and london this year the second round of station openings will include chicago , atlanta , and sydney , australia the prototype was tested in an old warehouse outside of atlanta because of its proximity to the suppliers in charge of making the new pump with its lcd screen the largest bp connect sites will be 4 , 200 square feet they are airy and open none of the centeraisle shelves are much taller than waist level the stores are divided into five sections a food service section , a beverage section , an impulsebuying section with snacks , a conveniencestore section and an internet section the lighting changes with each section the food service section has a warm , golden glow while the milkandeggs portion of the convenience section has a flourescent tinge inside the store , the offerings are localized customers using the paris station , for example , will be able to find foie gras it sounds to me like what bp has done is that they woke up one morning and said you know something , we 're not in the gasoline business , we 're in the retail business , said clive chajet of chajet consultancy , a brand consulting firm bp has recognized that their product is a commodity and they are incapable on the product level to differentiate their brand from competitors' but some critics , like charles t maxwell , senior petroleum analyst at weeden company , are not convinced that customers will benefit from some of the extra addons maybe this is one stop shopping but i always like to go to a grocery store to buy my groceries , mr maxwell said the grease and parts and shout and clatter and spilled gasoline do n't go in my mind with matters of food photo the new bp connect gas stations will be equipped for ecommerce and outfitted with solar panels the first stations will open in london , cleveland and indianapolis later this year \( bp amoco \)
in an odd way , michael j fox said the other day , he feels liberated by his decision to reveal his nearly decadelong battle with parkinson s disease for me personally , it s been a gift , and i do n't mean , 'hey , rah , i have this thing , ' he said quietly on the eve of his departure from the abc show spin city , which is broadcasting his final episode of the season tonight in terms of my own evolution , against the context of my life , it s somehow easier to deal with it s led to me to deeper thought , a greater sense of compassion , a greater sense of acceptance of things , of realizing what is my fight and what is n't my fight his life now has a focus , he said as he sat in his production office at chelsea piers contributing to the search for a cure for parkinson s , the degenerative illness that causes tremors and muscle rigidity the deck has really been cleared for me to help , said the actor , who is 38 the fact is i do n't have financial burdens i'm not worried about feeding my family a lot of people ca n't tell anybody i can they ca n't risk losing their insurance they ca n't risk opening themselves i can sitting at a conference table , mr fox gripped his left hand and arms tightly he spoke somberly and candidly at times he rocked forward in his chair and sipped diet soda his recent final episode of spin city was painful and tearful for the cast that mr fox helped recruit the tributes from heather locklear , the campaign finance manager and love interest barry bostwick , the slightly goofy mayor and the other actors afterward had plainly touched mr fox i 'll miss them , he said , blinking hard mr fox said he was resolved to stay upbeat he said that the impact of the illness , coupled with the suspension of his acting career , had left him without the depression that often strikes people with parkinson s in fact the actor , who is wiry and a bit nervous , said he had never been engulfed by despondency there s unquestionably loss , there s unquestionably compromise , there s unquestionably , if one wanted to look forward , a reason to be worried , he said but i do n't get depressed i do n't think that way maybe it s chemical i mean , i think that s why i got on a bus at 18 and went to la everybody thought i was crazy you know , none of us are entitled to anything i mean , i have clarity and i still laugh a lot that s saying something about my life ten years ago , while making the film doc hollywood in florida , mr fox had a persistent tremor on the pinky of his left hand he saw a local neurologist who told him the problem was a sports injury caused by years of playing ice hockey while growing up in canada the next year his shoulder became rigid and his hand periodically shook jogging one afternoon in martha s vineyard , mr fox was stopped by his wife , the actress tracy pollan , who had become alarmed mr fox recalled her saying get in the car you do n't know what you look like your left side is not moving only the right side is moving it does n't look good within days mr fox was seeing a neurologist in manhattan , where the couple live with their three children the diagnosis was immediate parkinson s , which may affect as many as a million americans , is often treated with the drug levodopa , or ldopa , and other medications to limit the symptoms the diagnosis stunned the actor for one thing , the disease most often strikes people over 40 i had no clue he could have spoken to me in latvian , mr fox related it took awhile for me to process it i went for second opinions he shook his head it s belligerent it s a bear but if i start whining , please , somebody , hit me with a hammer my life has been frontloaded with blessings mr fox , who became a television star in the 1980 s sitcom family ties , has been the anchor of spin city on abc for four years , playing a harddriving new york city deputy mayor although he will continue as a producer and may appear on one or two episodes next year , spin city will now be made in los angeles , and charlie sheen will take his role mr fox said that the physical strain of the disease and his weariness at hiding it from the public led to his decision this big idea that the show must go on after a while it just did n't seem as compelling an idea , he said it just seemed like the right time he said he had made his decision to leave and focus on fighting the disease , both personally and with fundraising and public awareness , when the show reached its 100th episode i never envisioned myself as the poster boy for anything , he said i hope i'm not doing that now i hope it s more thoughtful than that would i rather be on magazine covers now for a big opening weekend or something like that as opposed to having a degenerative brain disease \? yeah but it s part of my life , part of my family s life generally , parkinson s is far more common among people over 55 , affecting slightly more men than women it is caused by the death of nerve cells and the depletion of a neurotransmitter in the brain according to the harvard medical school family health guide , there is no cure for parkinson disease , but medicine and surgery can be beneficial the problem is that after five years or so , drug combinations often lose their effectiveness , leading to greater tremors mr fox said he had decided late in 1998 during a vacation with his family on st john s to disclose the illness and end his acting involvement on spin city
austin , tex , july 7 earlier this year , the texas supreme court stunned social conservatives throughout the state by issuing a 6to3 ruling that allowed a 17yearold high school senior to have an abortion without telling her parents it was shocking , said joe kral , the legislative director for the texas right to life committee it was , after all , appointees of gov george w bush who took the lead on the issue and it was the governor himself who had pushed into law the texas parental notification act , which required minors to inform their parents before seeking an abortion in recent weeks , particularly after the united states supreme court s 5to4 ruling that rejected a nebraska law prohibiting doctors from performing a procedure that opponents call partialbirth abortion , the issue of judicial appointments has percolated into the presidential race vice president al gore , the presumptive democratic nominee , seized on the close vote to warn that mr bush , if elected , would appoint conservative supreme court justices hostile to abortion rights but a look at mr bush s record in texas shows that he has appointed justices who have had a moderating influence on the texas supreme court , often regarded as among the most conservative and probusiness in the country he has appointed four of the court s nine justices and has been a political patron for a fifth , harriet o'neill , who wrote the majority opinion in the parental notification case even those who do not support mr bush say that while his appointees are regarded as conservative and businessoriented , they are not fiercely ideological what insight , if any , mr bush s appointments in texas offer into what he might do in washington is debatable the scrutiny and pressure surrounding a nomination to the united states supreme court far exceed those accompanying an appointment to the texas court mr bush , who opposes abortion , has offered only vague descriptions of his model justices , though , tellingly , he has cited two of the leading conservatives on the supreme court , antonin scalia and clarence thomas , for praise on the campaign trail , mr bush has said he wants justices who strictly interpret the constitution he also has promised not to apply any ideological litmus tests , including one on abortion , even though many of the social conservatives who support him are eager to overturn roe v wade clay johnson , a top aide to mr bush , said he believed the selection process for justices would undoubtedly be different in a bush presidential administration than it has been in texas but i think he would be looking as he did at the state level for people who are interpreters of the law as opposed to makers of the law , mr johnson said in texas , supreme court justices are elected statewide to sixyear terms , but early retirements allowed mr bush to reshape the court and if anything , the bush appointees seem in keeping with his campaign theme of big tent republicanism i think the people he picked were sort of moderate conservatives , said anthony champagne , a political science scientist professor at the university of texas at dallas who follows the court like he is mr bush s first appointee , james a baker , was a state appellate judge and a longtime political ally of the bush family \( he is no relation to the former united states secretary of state \) his second , greg abbott , was a highly regarded state judge in houston who has been paralyzed since an accident 16 years ago his third , deborah g hankinson , was a teacherturneddefense lawyer and his fourth , alberto r gonzales , is one of mr bush s most visible hispanic allies , having served as the governor s general counsel and as texas secretary of state the governor appointed justice o'neill to a lower court in 1995 and in 1998 she won a seat on the high court with his blessing all of mr bush s appointees are republicans and all have since been elected except mr gonzales , who is expected to be elected easily in november they have uniformly been chosen for quality , said bill powers , dean of the law school at the university of texas there has not been a litmus test they are sort of middle of the road on the court in separate interviews this week , justice hankinson , justice gonzales and justice abbott all described a similar interview process with mr bush , who is not a lawyer , and a few aides none were asked about specific issues like abortion \( in fact , until the parental notification opinion , the court had never had to directly address abortion \) instead , they said , the governor asked openended questions about judicial philosophy to determine how they might view their roles as justices before the interview , justice abbott barely knew the governor , having met him at a few republican party functions justice hankinson had never met him she said he seemed interested in her experience as a special education elementary school teacher and her subsequent career change to law i told him i thought it was very , very critical that judges not bring an agenda to the bench , said justice hankinson , whom mr bush appointed as an appellate judge in 1996 , then to the state supreme court a year later
for all the importance of tonight s jetsraiders game in oakland , it s just that a game if any blood is spilled , it wo n't be bad blood the franchises' dominant personalities , bill parcells and al davis , confide in one another because of pro football s rotating schedule , the coaches and players go against each other too seldom to hold a grudge but when the jets and the raiders were young and restless in the old american football league , they often played each other twice a season their rivalry was real and sometimes vicious vicious enough that , just as a hunter puts a stuffed moose head on the wall , davis once put the photo on the wall of the stairwell leading up to his office at the raiders' headquarters an enlarged oakland tribune photo of jets quarterback joe namath , his helmet flying , sprawling to the ground after being mugged by defensive end ben davidson namath s cheekbone was broken in that 1967 game when hit by defensive end ike lassiter on an earlier play , but the photo indicted davidson ike was always mad about that , davis said the other day from the raiders' offices in nearby alameda , calif , because ben got the credit credit by the raiders , blame by the jets but when namath was asked after the game how his cheekbone had been broken , he said , i had a tough steak at the pregame meal not that it deterred him from his appointed rounds that evening , at the edgewater inn s checkout desk , he was sighted wearing a swollen purplish cheek and a tuxedo where are you going in that tux \? he was asked to vegas , he said we 're off till tuesday the following sunday in san diego , wearing a special protector for his cheekbone , namath completed 18 of 26 passes for 343 yards and 4 touchdowns , 3 to don maynard with a total of 4 , 007 yards in 1967 , he was the first pro quarterback to throw for more than 4 , 000 yards in a season when the jets went to oakland in 1968 , that photo on the raiders' wall symbolized the rivalry as well as coach weeb ewbank s distrust of davis whenever a helicopter flew anywhere near a jets practice the week before a game against the raiders , ewbank would look up and shake his fist he just knew davis had somebody spying on the jets on a trip to oakland , he once suspected a spy as the jets practiced near a junior college s highrise dorm weeb thought he saw the shape of a person s head looking down at our practice from one of the windows high in the dorm , recalled frank ramos , then as now the jets' publicrelations director weeb sent somebody up there to check , and it turned out that what he thought was a person was really a lamp davis , then as now the raiders' majordomo , distrusted ewbank , too he once had game officials check jets placekicker jim turner s shoe for an illegal metal plate none was found another time davis was in the edgewater inn s lobby when the jets arrived there he told namath how some of the raiders' linemen wanted to wreck him , but added , i do n't think they should do that in an offseason conversation , davis once asked namath what defensive tips he looked for as he called signals al said 'do you watch the middle linebacker \? do you watch the safety \? ' namath recalled i started to tell him , then i realized , al davis uhuh in those years , on davis s orders , new york reporters were never allowed to watch the raiders practice but when oakland reporters wanted to watch the jets practice , ewbank agreed i do n't have to be like the other guy , ewbank said ewbank always suspected the other guy of watering the oakland coliseum field to slow maynard s sprints downfield and when davis was asked if he had ever actually watered the field , he laughed john did all those things , davis said davis meant john madden , a raiders assistant coach in 1967 and 1968 before being named head coach in 1969 and later emerging as a television folk hero among his other raider duties , madden was responsible for the gamefilm exchange with the next opponent somehow the raider films always got to the jets a day or two late if you sent the films through chicago , madden once acknowledged , it always took longer and if they were late , everybody blamed al anyway in the 1968 classic remembered now as the heidi game , the jets were leading the raiders , 3229 , with 65 seconds remaining when nbc switched from the game to the scheduled children s film when the raiders , scoring two quick touchdowns , rallied to win , 4332 , viewers were incensed so were the jets' assistant coach , walt michaels , and the team orthopedist , dr jim nicholas the jets were fined 2 , 000 , then a significant sum , because michaels and nicholas kicked at the door of the officials' room and michaels later showed films of controversial calls to new york reporters six weeks later , at the 1968 afl championship game at shea stadium , the jets had their revenge davis had a plastic leanto built to shield the raiders' bench from the cold and wind , but the afl president , milt woodard , ordered it removed it was blocking the view of fans with fieldlevel seats the jets won , 2723 , and two weeks later won super bowl iii after the 1970 merger , the rivalry dwindled too few games , and then the raiders moved to los angeles and back to oakland but did the raiders still display that photo of joe namath with his helmet flying \? we still have it , davis said when we decide where we 're going , it 'll be on display in the raider hall of fame i think it might be in al locasale s office now , he added , alluding to his longtime executive assistant ask him locasale said it s not in my office it s in storage so is the jetsraiders rivalry that shaped each franchise photo al davis of the raiders once displayed this photo of ben davidson hammering the jets' joe namath in 1967 \( russ reed the oakland tribune \)
a 12yearold boy was shot in the chest and critically injured in brooklyn yesterday as he and two friends played with a gun that they told the police they found in a vacant lot , the authorities said it was not clear who fired the gun , said detective joseph pentangelo , a police spokesman the victim , matthew marino , was in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery at lutheran medical center last night , hospital officials said according to the police , the three boys , all 12 or 13 years old , were building a skateboard ramp yesterday in a vast , rubblestrewn lot on 11th street near second avenue in the gowanus section around 5 20 pm , one boy found a lorcin 9millimeter semiautomatic gun , the boys told the police minutes later , the police said , matthew lay in the weeds and rocks , bleeding whether it s selfinflicted , accidental or someone else shot him , none of that is worked out yet , detective pentangelo said matthew s friends ran out to second avenue , a bleak industrial strip shadowed by the elevated subway tracks and the gowanus expressway , and flagged down a pedestrian , who called 911 , the detective said matthew lives on 11th street a few hundred feet from the vacant lot , on a closeknit block of modest row houses neighbors said he and the other boys spent most afternoons skating , usually in ennis park , near matthew s house they were skating here just this afternoon around 5 , lourdes rivera , 25 , said as she stood in ennis park they 're regulars sanitation workers based in a depot near the lot said they saw the boys slip through the chainedoff gate that leads to the lot around 4 30 pm , dragging a wooden plank to build the ramp
salt lake city with the voices inside her head ordering her to kill , lisa duy walked into doug s shoot'n sports here to buy a smith wesson 9millimeter semiautomatic pistol for doug s , the biggest gun store in utah , the transaction was routine the manager , dave larsen , called the utah bureau of criminal identification to run a background check on ms duy , and the agency quickly approved the sale , having found no record of felony convictions or mental illness in the basement shooting range , mr larsen showed ms duy , 24 and unemployed , how to hold and fire the heavy stainlesssteel gun the only thing unusual , he thought , was that as she left the store , headed for the bus stop outside , she was wearing the shootingrange ear protectors he had lent her less than two hours after leaving doug s , on jan 14 , 1999 , ms duy , ear protectors still in place , walked into the studios of television station ksl a few blocks from the mormon temple and began firing her new weapon she shot more than four dozen times in all , killing a young mother and wounding the building manager what the background check had been unable to detect was that ms duy \( pronounced dwee \) had a long history of psychiatric problems , had in fact been found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and , only a year before the check , had been committed to a mental hospital by a judge after threatening to kill an fbi agent , an encounter that sprang from her delusions that the station was broadcasting information about her sex life of the 100 episodes of rampage killings examined for this series by the new york times , none better illustrates than the case of lisa duy just how difficult it can be to enforce a key provision of the nation s fundamental gun control law that provision prohibits people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions from buying a handgun but laws in most states guard the privacy of the mentally ill , and to protect them from stigma these statutes generally bar lawenforcement agencies from access to mental health records as a result , gun background checks of people with psychiatric problems typically fail to turn up their mental health history , a loophole that has contributed to the wave of school and workplace shootings of the last decade in the 100 cases reviewed by the times , the vast majority of them from the last 10 years , half the killers were people with a history of serious mental health problems , and at least eight had been involuntarily committed now , fueled by those shootings , there is a growing debate pitting publicsafety concerns against the rights of the mentally ill this march , in the wake of the duy shooting and another like it in april 1999 , utah became one of the few states that give lawenforcement agencies mental health information for background checks on prospective gun buyers connecticut acted similarly last fall , after a state lottery employee with a history of depression and psychiatric hospitalization killed four of his bosses and committed suicide in 1998 the loophole lisa duy lied , and no one knew the provision that bars handgun purchases by people who have ever been involuntarily committed is more than 30 years old , dating from adoption of the sweeping federal gun control act of 1968 these are frequently the most disturbed people , those forced into hospitals because courts have determined that they may harm themselves or others but the provision is usually meaningless over the years , the national rifle association , mental health advocates and civil liberties groups have found themselves on the same side of this issue , fighting independently to keep agencies that conduct background checks from gaining access to information about who has been committed at the time of her rampage , it was against the law in utah for the court that had committed ms duy to tell a lawenforcement agency even the federal bureau of investigation , which conducts background checks for the majority of states , has mental health records only on people treated in veterans affairs hospitals , plus an assortment of 41 other individuals , among its data on some 40 million people that the bureau now keeps for its system of national instant criminal background checks so when ms duy , completing a mandatory federal handgun application , answered no to a question asking whether she had ever been committed , the utah bureau of criminal identification had no mental health records in its database to catch her lie i do n't understand how lisa could buy a gun , said her mother , khanh duy , who immigrated with the family from vietnam by way of their ancestral china in 1980 , when lisa was a little girl lisa is a good girl , mrs duy said but she heard voices , and she had been in the hospital another case in which a person who had been involuntarily hospitalized was able to buy a gun despite the federal law , and went on to kill with it , was that of gracie verduzco , a 35yearold paranoid schizophrenic who believed she had a transmitter in her left ear that received messages from a satellite ms verduzco had been committed to mental hospitals three times , by judges in both arizona and , after she had threatened president clinton , the district of columbia yet she was able to buy a 38caliber revolver at a pawnshop in tucson , and she used it to kill one person and wound four others at a post office and on a highway there on may 21 , 1998

london , aug 6 when hugo dixon resigned from the financial times last december to start his own web site , heads turned both inside and outside the newsroom after all , mr dixon had become the newspaper s franchise columnist the lead writer and editor of the muchheralded lex column each day , he provided smart commentary on the merger of the day or a company s recent earnings report even without a byline , the columnist was so well known in the world of london finance that his departure from the financial times was chronicled in most of the big national newspapers gossipy items about his exit peppered the papers with almost the same attention showered on the spice girls but that attention turned to real rubbernecking in may , when mr dixon announced that he had effectively defected to the financial times s rival , the wall street journal mr dixon , 36 , signed a deal to begin publishing a daily column in september that mimics the lex based on content from his new web site , breakingviewscom in the wall street journal s european edition in addition , dow jones , the journal s parent company , took a 7 percent stake in breakingviewscom , which offers quick financial commentary online about breakingnews subjects mr dixon s move came as the wall street journal and the financial times , a unit of pearson plc , are in an intensifying brawl aimed at increasing readership on each other s home turf and the focus on mr dixon has recently become more intense because of an accusation being privately levied by some of his former colleagues mr dixon may have a conflict of interest because his company is being partly financed by people and companies that he and his team of journalists are supposed to be writing commentary about in a city that is not known for objective journalism , and at a time when media companies increasingly are financially intertwined with the people and companies they write about , it is not clear if the accusation is fair mr dixon acknowledges that the company s investors include morgan stanley dean witter along with his longtime friend , roland rudd , who owns finsbury , one of the leading financial public relations firms in london representing leading european companies , among others yet mr dixon rebuts the criticism as simply noise i myself think it s an issue that s been blown up to be an issue , but i do n't believe it s an issue , he said i do n't know who has a 3 percent stake in new york times or dow jones or in pearson or whatever , but i would n't be surprised if there was an investment bank that did everyone owns stakes he also said that the stakes are passive and that neither financial backer has a seat on his board nonetheless , mr dixon , has been in the limelight since he left the financial times just before christmas , taking his colleague from the lex column and partner , jonathan ford , with him to help him start breakingviewscom mr dixon says he conceived the idea for a financialcommentary web site more than four years ago , just after interviewing william h gates , microsoft s chairman , during a dinner with michael kinsley , who had just started slate , a political and culture web magazine owned by microsoft it was n't clear to me whether it made sense to put a political magazine online , he recalls thinking but in the financial arena , where investors are trading stocks on a day of news developments , he said , speed is essential so it seemed to me that financial journalism was naturally suited to the internet at the time , though , in 1996 , the internet had yet to emerge in europe with the same force as in the united states it was not until last year , with sites like thestreetcom going public and money so available for ideas like this , he said , that he began to consider the idea seriously having raised about 1 million in a first round of financing by december , mr dixon and mr ford turned in their resignations at the financial times to leave an established organization is quite a wrench , he said they would try to give me all these goodies , and i was saying no with increasingly strange excuses about why i was turning down these jobs the bombshell came when he told his exemployer that he planned to start a web site that would effectively be an online version of lex , the paper s franchise column in what may have seemed like a further affront to the financial times , he went on to be named the british business journalist of the year for his work at the newspaper , and he audaciously promoted breakingviewscom at the ceremony then , early in may , he announced that he had raised 67 million and made his syndication deal with the wall street journal europe the timing could not have been more important in the bruising battle between the two business broadsheets the wall street journal redesigned its european edition in february to better suit readers and has been aggressively marketing the paper across the continent at the same time , the financial times has tried to make inroads in the united states with a 35 million advertising campaign starring dan aykroyd plugging its web site , ftcom financial times reporters and editors have been privately griping about mr dixon s defection and his investment partners , though none agreed to do so publicly top executives at the paper were terse richard lambert , the editor in chief , said simply , i do n't have an opinion about it as for the wall street journal , richard j tofel , the dow jones vice president for corporate communications , said the company is committed to breakingviewscom in terms of financial firms having stakes in publishers , that s nothing new , he said he pointed out that dow jones has a business relationship with general electric through cnbc and also has business interests or alliances with reuters and hearst whether things are adequately disclosed is what s important , he said according to mr dixon , the web site and the column in the wall street journal europe will include a disclaimer if he or his staff ever write directly about any of his investors he said there was no reason to put a disclaimer on articles , for example , about clients of morgan stanley because they advise on zillions of deals the new york times operates a joint newsroom with and has an investment stake in thestreetcom , an online financial news and commentary site that may compete with breakingviewscom the streetcom is partly owned by james j cramer , the hedge fund manager and columnist it has policies to deal with the appearance of conflicts , and mr cramer s columns carry disclaimers when he writes about stocks he owns despite the controversy , the reporting in breakingviewscom does not so far seem to have been colored by its investors' interests the site carried a critical column about carlton communications , one of finsbury s largest clients , which was noted in an item in the observer last sunday and when mr dixon wrote a column this week about pearson s acquisition of national computer systems , it included a disclaimer noting that mr dixon had worked for the financial times and that he also owned shares in pearson still , though mr dixon is used to being in public view , his financial arrangements may expose him to a new level of scrutiny he does not shy away from the attention we have a lot of people from the ft coming to our site , mr dixon said , grinning photo a focus of controversy among old press colleagues , hugo dixon , of breakingviewscom , took a breather one day last week on the street in london outside his offices \( jonathan player for the new york times \)
hamburg , germany , jan 20 a leading finance official of germany s embattled christian democratic party committed suicide today after leaving a note indicating he had become aware of acts of embezzlement , the police said wolfgang hullen , the head of the christian democratic union parliamentary delegation s finance and budget department over the last 18 years , hanged himself in his berlin apartment as a parliamentary investigation was getting under way into a web of illicit payments to the party in the 1990 s a berlin prosecutor told the daily bild that a criminal inquiry into embezzlement had been opened based on a passage in mr hullen s suicide note the friday issue of the berliner zeitung said mr hullen had said in the note that he was afraid of an audit of the party s finances and that he had transferred money from the parliamentary group s account no further information on the nature of the embezzlement was immediately available the death of mr hullen , 49 , the father of two children , is the latest development in a widening scandal that has prompted repeated comparisons to the web of corruption whose revelation brought down italy s christian democrats after the end of the cold war in italy , several prominent public figures , including the former head of the stateowned oil company , killed themselves german christian democracy is not italian christian democracy it is better organized , it has not held a monopoly on postwar power , and it represents a respectable german right in a way that may be irreplaceable still , the headlines of deutschland alla romana have resonated , not least for the sheer operatic intensity of the drama joachim horster , a chief whip of the christian democrats in parliament , announced the suicide to the lower house of parliament and said first indications were that it was of a personal nature parliamentary proceedings were briefly suspended he declined to elaborate on the term personal nature , and police accounts of the suicide note later suggested strongly that the background to mr hullen s death was in fact political for several weeks , pressure has been mounting on the christian democrats to explain several million dollars in undeclared , and so illegal , payments to the party the search for answers centered today on the reichstag building , focus of many german troubles over the last century and now home to the parliament the committee investigating illegal payments under former chancellor helmut kohl began its proceedings by hearing his successor as party leader , wolfgang schauble , apologize for his acts mr schauble , who last week admitted taking 100 , 000 marks \( 52 , 000 \) in cash from an arms dealer named karlheinz schreiber , said a few weeks ago in this chamber i did n't react as i should have to calls made from the coalition benches i regret that and i apologize for that in effect , although he did not say it clearly , mr schauble was apologizing for having lied on dec 2 , 1999 , under questioning about mr schreiber from hanschristian strobele , a green member of parliament , the christian democratic leader said he may have run into mr schreiber on one occasion with or without a suitcase \? mr strobele shot back without a suitcase , mr schauble replied that means i may have had a briefcase with me i do n't know for sure in fact , as he has now conceded , mr schauble met mr schreiber not once but twice and , on the second occasion , accepted a bag containing a pile of cash that he says he passed on to the party treasurer it is this sort of behavior that has led many people to conclude that mr schauble cannot now restore his party s shattered credibility the parliamentary committee , headed by a social democratic politician , volker neumann , has summoned 26 people to testify , including mr kohl and several of his former ministers one central figure who will have to testify is horst weyrauch , who was long in charge of party finances under mr kohl mr neumann , who has said that during mr kohl s 16year term as chancellor the government was for sale , has indicated the inquiry could go on for as long as two years it seems evident that the social democratic party of chancellor gerhard schroder is eager to draw out the positive impact of the scandal on its own fortunes but it is true that there is much to investigate , including payments to the party by mr schreiber totaling over 550 , 000 , the source of more than 1 million that mr kohl says he took between 1993 and 1998 , and how millions of dollars from the party branch in hesse reached bank accounts in switzerland and liechtenstein the committee will also examine the suspicious sale of the former east german refinery leuna to elf aquitaine of france in 1992 mr kohl was highly enthusiastic about this transaction , a demonstration , he said , of renewed frenchgerman friendship after france s long hesitation over german unification but tens of millions of dollars from the sale have not been properly accounted for , prompting investigations by prosecutors in switzerland and france into possible payments of bribes documents relating to the sale disappeared mysteriously from mr kohl s chancellery mr kohl has admitted taking more than 1 million in secret payments , but insisted that none were bribes he has said his honor prevents him from identifying the donors because he gave his word he would not is the truth so terrible that helmut kohl places his word of honor above the german constitution \? asked gabi bauer , the anchorwoman on germany s main television program the question clearly echoed the thoughts of millions of people in a country where the law says any contribution over 10 , 500 must be declared in the face of mr kohl s defiance , and in the absence of any donors coming forward to identify themselves , suspicions have been growing that some or all of the money that the former chancellor says he received may in fact have come from overseas bank accounts maintained to manage illegal payments and kickbacks to the party for unless the source of the money was illegal , it is increasingly hard for many germans to understand how mr kohl can continue to place his honor above the oath of office he took and above the wellbeing of his party honor is a resonant word in the history of german political scandals it was repeatedly used by uwe bar schel , the former christian democratic premier of schleswigholstein , who gave his word of honor that he had not used dirty tactics against his social democratic challenger in an election in 1987 but soon after the election he was forced from office when his denials were disproved a month later mr barschel was found dead in a geneva hotel , in what was first ruled a suicide and later investigated as murder photos police officers in berlin entering the home of wolfgang hullen , a christian democratic finance offical who committed suicide yesterday wolfgang schauble , left , with peter struck , chairman of the social democratic faction in parliament \( photographs by associated press \) \( pg a12 \)
i like being killed stories by tibor fischer 261 pp new york metropolitan books henry holt company 24 with this , tibor fischer s first collection of stories after three decreasingly worthwhile novels , a career that began just eight years ago with a good deal of promise and even greater praise appears to have hit bottom so devoid are these pieces of any literary merit , it s a tribute to fischer s lingering reputation that they got published at all at the same time , the sheer dreariness that pervades them , as well as the demoralized quality of their execution , gives the volume a morbid psychological interest the toughguy persona that fischer projects in his novels , an image that has established him as one of the voguish young rogues of british fiction , collapses here like a leaky balloon after three volumes of frenetic hilarity and brittle swagger , we seem to see the real man for the first time it s not a pretty sight fischer s career began with a fairly impressive act of historical imagination under the frog tells the story of a young hungarian basketball player in the years leading up to the 1956 revolution the choice is less audacious than it seems gyuri fischer , the protagonist , is modeled on the author s father but to conclude that tibor initiated his literary career by recycling his old man s stories would be an exaggeration both gyuri s lonely , horny , sardonic consciousness and his stultifying and murderous stalinist milieu are rendered with the richness of a fully imagined world still , fischer s use of nonautobiographical material , which must have seemed admirably mature , looks in retrospect like a sign of problems to come as it has turned out , he ca n't bring himself to confront his own experience under the frog won instant acclaim the novel was shortlisted for the booker prize in 1993 , the same year fischer was anointed as one of granta magazine s best young british novelists those are relative honors , and perhaps deserved , but as good as the novel sometimes is , it has much to be forgiven its black humor , designed to come off as stoic and heavy with mitteleuropean irony , is flippant and sophomoric as only a secondhand account could be other than gyuri , the characters are flat and belong to recognizable types the allknowing teacher , the almost magically invulnerable friend , the doomed , heroic lover the narrative lacks an overarching structure , consisting of a dozen vignettes spread out over as many years , and the ending is sentimental and too neat then there s fischer s sense of literary style , his cutesy , lazy habit of enlivening his prose by the use or archly deliberate misuse of needlessly fancy locutions bailed out of the womb , a tough predicament to mendacity out at the time , all these must have seemed like problems fischer would grow out of instead , he embraced them from borrowed experience fischer turned to outright fantasy the thought gang follows the exploits of eddie coffin , an aging cambridge philosophy don on the lam in france after embezzling his foundation grant coffin hooks up with hubert , a petty thief with several missing body parts , and the thought gang , as they call themselves , embark on a series of absurdly easy bank robberies and other violent pranks they 're soon joined by a sexy teller from their first job , who , despite our hero s baldness , beer gut and utter lack of charm , ca n't stop throwing herself at him coffin is meant to be endearingly loutish , spending his time between heists sifting through the history of philosophical speculation in search of the meaning of life , or at least of his own failed version of it but coffin s act , equal parts glibness and selfpity , gets old fast he does n't engage philosophical ideas so much as fold them up into little slogans one british reviewer saw the novel as really a sexual interpretation of the history of western thought i see it as lowcalorie slapstick spraycoated with a glaze of intellectual pretense it s the kind of thing that flatters readers into a cheap feeling of sophistication , as if merely to read names like thales and epictetus were equivalent to understanding what those thinkers wrote if under the frog is nave , in other words , the thought gang is cynical the novel , for instance , makes a great show of experimentalism the text presents itself as a series of entries in coffin s notebook , each sporting a clever title larger sections are marked off with little reefs of question marks the verbal style is under the frog on coke nervejangling mannerisms , compulsive punning and a baroque vocabulary that s long on initial z s zacaton , zaibatsu , zalambdodont fischer wields his thesaurus here like a blunt instrument but none of this gimmickry really means anything the technical display derives not from paris in the 1920 s but from madison avenue in the 90 s it s the literary equivalent of the kind of packaging and marketing designed to make you think that a big mac is really a hamburger
that time , johnson threw a slant , john madden said during sunday s giantsredskins game on fox , and the receiver ran an out that s not good , pat summerall replied on paper , the exchange seems innocuous but to longtime summerallmadden listeners , it offers a nugget of the easy rapport that seemed absent last season , when summerall was distracted by constant pain from his left knee , which he had replaced this past march no matter how much advil i took , it was n't working , he said yesterday by telephone it was tough to go up and down stairs , or stand in the booth as john and i like to do , and i could n't sleep at night he said that no one on the fox crew told him that he was n't as strong as before but this season , he sounds rejuvenated and excited , more on top of the plays , quicker to name players involved in the action , and far less likely to make errors i'm enjoying the work a heck of a lot more , i'm in a better frame of mind at our meetings and i'm well rested , he said last year , i did all the preparation i was supposed to do , but it s like being in college you study for an exam , but you may not be very interested now i feel it s an honor to be calling the game , and it s a challenge i want to know more about why something s happening before the season , summerall surprised fox sports by disagreeing with the substance of a news release that said he would retire after the 2002 super bowl why should i quit when i'm looking forward to the weekends again \?

we agreed before the season that we were overdoing it with owners shots last year and to stay focused on the field unless there was an overriding story involving the owner , said lou d'ermilio , a spokesman for fox sports karl swanson , a spokesman for snyder , said he had asked cameramen inside the network broadcast booth at fedex field not to shoot directly into the owner s adjacent box because of guests who may not want to be shown on television but there are other cameras in the stadium that can take shots of him , swanson said if he were alone , he would n't care swanson added that he had never complained to the league about too many shots of the passionate snyder airwaves hbo s real sports \( tonight at 10 \) performs a public service by examining the ethics of athletes like bernie williams and wayne chrebet endorsing immensely popular laser eye surgery in another segment , about the fratboy appeal of fox nfl sunday , the network s football pregame show , we hear more than we needed to know from the program s temptress weatherwoman , jillian barberie , who tells hbo s bernard goldberg , the fact that i 've done weather for 10 years seems to be overshadowed by the fact that i have breasts \( when you dress like pamela anderson , as barberie does , and not like irv gikofsky , those startling credentials are unfortunately lost \) one of the delights of espn classic s expanded sportscentury series is learning about a largely forgotten athlete such is the case with the recently replayed program about nile kinnick , the inspiring university of iowa football star and 1939 heisman trophy winner who died in world war ii

washington , april 19 state and federal officials trying to prepare remedy proposals in the microsoft antitrust case have not settled on a common approach , officials say , and the states are having trouble agreeing even among themselves on one critical point , officials say , the 19 states involved now seem in accord none is advocating a fundamental breakup of the company everybody s in that mode , said one official with knowledge of the negotiations and there are indications that the justice department concurs but beyond that , the state attorneys general remain at odds on the approach to take it s like trying to herd a bunch of cats , said one official familiar with the states' deliberations another , who has been involved in several recent multistate lawsuits , said , there has never been a case where as many people have had as many different opinions as this one at this point , the government officials involved in the case federal and state are not even at the same table , even though they face a deadline of next week for their recommendations justice department officials are locked in private deliberations over the federal government s remedy proposal , and there have been no formal meetings between state and federal officials to formulate a common proposal but several state officials have spoken with federal officials in recent days , and as one official put it there s a great deal of overlap in our approaches this suggests that the justice department , like the states , is focusing on remedies short of a breakup after judge thomas penfield jackson found microsoft in wide violation of state and federal antitrust laws on april 3 , he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to complete the penalty , or remedy , phase of the case within 60 days as a result , the federal and state officials promised to submit their remedy proposals sometime between tuesday and friday of next week the judge , who will make the final decision on remedies , made it clear he would prefer just one proposal from the plaintiffs all of the plaintiffs said they believed their position would be a great deal stronger if they could agree on just one proposal otherwise , microsoft will be able to say , see , not even all of the plaintiffs agree on this , ' one official noted even if the two groups do submit separate proposals , they are likely to be quite similar with only a few points of divergence , another official said judge jackson said he would be willing to accept two proposals , one from the states and another from the federal government , if the two groups cannot agree and to address the divergent opinions among the state officials , the judge also said he wanted a proposal representing a majority view of the states that could lock out any attorneys general who insist on a different idea despite that , some states , caught in difficult and sometimes contentious negotiations , are threatening to submit their own , separate proposals if their ideas are not accepted by the others but other officials said they believed that was simply a hardball negotiating tactic , not a real threat the judge does n't want that , so i do n't think it will happen , one official said another said , this is phenomenally difficult and phenomenally complicated , so it s no wonder they 're having a hard time while breaking up the company appears to be off the table , several ideas that go beyond simply trying to modify microsoft s behavior are under serious discussion among them , a few attorneys general want to fence in microsoft s cash reserve , 178 billion , to prevent the company from using it to buy other software companies and fold their products into the windows operating system others are interested in forcing microsoft to spin off internet explorer , the web browser that was at the center of the suit the idea would be to create a new company and recreate competition in the web browser business microsoft folded internet explorer into the windows operating system , which means that it is installed automatically on nearly 90 percent of all computers sold another idea under discussion is to force microsoft to make office , its suite of application programs , available for other operating systems , including linux office , including the word , excel and powerpoint programs , is by far the most widely used program suite its market share exceeds 90 percent the idea behind this proposal , one official said , would be to make other operating systems competitive \( microsoft already makes office available for apple computer s operating system \) representatives of most of the states met last thursday in chicago to begin trying to forge a consensus position while the state and federal officials have been formulating their proposals separately thus far , one official said the two sides will try to schedule a meeting within the next few days with the goal of submitting one joint proposal a handful of core states are doing most of the work they are the attorneys general or aides from california , connecticut , florida , iowa , new york and wisconsin we have people preparing draft orders for consideration by the other states , one official said , adding that there s a highlevel agreement among the core states we 've reached out to a lot of the others but some attorneys general are more concerned about different aspects than others , he said one senior state official said he thought it more likely than not that the states would eventually agree among themselves , adding that there could be convergence with the justice department , but that is not at all certain

first came the tax returns in just one afternoon in a week that he will not soon forget , larry b seabrook saw his race for congress rocked by a tabloid revelation that he had filed joint tax returns even after he and his wife were divorced there was the added tidbit that both mr seabrook , a state senator from the bronx , and his former wife maintained that they were unaware of their divorce until years after it became official the day was n't over yet , and neither was his opponent , who accused the senator of breaking the law and called for a criminal investigation it was in that same tumultuous week that mr seabrook went on to accuse his opponent , united states representative eliot l engel , of being so conniving and desperate to win reelection that he had illegally obtained the information from sealed divorce records and leaked it to the news media and it was during that week that mr seabrook said he would go to court himself to seek criminal charges against mr engel for illegally obtaining his most private information mr seabrook then took his complaints to the doorstep of mr engel s office , holding a news conference to accuse his opponent of a list of misdeeds but mr seabrook was ultimately upstaged by a woman who brought the news conference to a screeching halt by falling to the ground and screaming incoherently about being mr seabrook s wife that sent a frightened mr seabrook dashing from the scene , fearful , he said , that the woman might have been carrying a weapon as that single week in its life would indicate , this primary battle in the 17th congressional district , which includes parts of the bronx and some of westchester county , is not your typical political contest with a seemingly endless stream of vitriol , the campaign has provided voters with a boxseat view of everything from charges of racism on one hand to antisemitism on the other there have been accusations of sabotage from one side , of malfeasance from the other complaints about political betrayal from one camp and of demagoguery from the other and added to that mix have been enough revelations about mr seabrook s marital woes to provide a season s worth of scripts for a soap opera the race features mr engel , a 53yearold white incumbent , who is working feverishly some say desperately to get reelected in a district whose demographics have shifted dramatically , from the mostly white electorate that first sent him to congress 12 years ago to its current overwhelmingly black and brown majority and it is also the story of mr seabrook , 49 , a black state senator , who has invoked the theme of black political empowerment in a campaign that has been marred by a string of embarrassing revelations that have portrayed him as acting injudiciously at best and illegally at worst it is not a pretty thing to watch , said j philip thompson , a professor of political science at columbia university the effect of all this activity has been to push issues completely out of the campaign this is a district that has a crime problem and a drug problem , mr thompson said there are important issues regarding job opportunities , and how to provide them but none of that is really being addressed in this campaign it s more like some strange circus and for most voters , it s disheartening and discouraging it has also been highly political for years , mr engel , who was first elected in 1988 , has been preparing for the possibility of a challenge by mr seabrook in previous election years , mr seabrook , whose state senate district covers about half of the congressional district , talked about running for the seat , only to change his mind before the nominating petitions were due but this year was different mr seabrook said he had long watched the changing demographics of the district and concluded that a black candidate could win the seat , based on the minority population the 17th congressional district was about 60 percent white when mr engel first ran but it is now only about 22 percent white , with the balance being mostly black and hispanic for years , mr seabrook has criticized mr engel as an inattentive incumbent who spends far more time at his home in maryland than in the district and he has routinely ridiculed mr engel , saying that the congressman s major accomplishment had been to get to the house of representatives chamber early enough each january to get an aisle seat during the state of the union message so that he could be seen on national television shaking the president s hand having raised more than 100 , 000 , mr seabrook entered the race this year with his slogan of history in the making , his campaign s expressed proposition of electing the first black congressman to represent the bronx but as mr seabrook was busy putting together his campaign for congress , mr engel s aides were also busy , collecting information on mr seabrook they chronicled , for example , mr seabrook s attendance record in the state senate and his high rate of absenteeism they gathered records indicating that mr seabrook sought reimbursement for travel expenses to albany for more days than the senate was in session and mr engel and not a few of his supporters suggested that , in appealing to black pride , mr seabrook had injected race into the campaign in a bold and racist appeal to black voters
ron low said yesterday that he is a firm believer in not looking at the past and yet , many of the themes that ran through low s introductory news conference as the 30th head coach in rangers history hark back to the disaster of last season low stressed the need for an attitude change on a team that has failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three springs it s imperative that there is an adjustment , said low , who will be welcoming back mark messier to the club today at a morning news conference the team announced last night that it had reached agreement with the freeagent center , who reportedly got a twoyear deal worth 8 million i do n't expect it to be easy , low said of his task ahead but i also think the people that are here can get it done he was referring to his two new assistants , ted green and walt kyle he was also referring to glen sather , the rangers' president and general manager , who hired him all four men worked together at edmonton yesterday all four stressed the same themes familiarity , loyalty , the ability to communicate , being on the same page that were absent on the rangers last season singling out the rangers' work ethic , low said obviously , it was n't good last year it could n't have been good there were too many underachievers said sather even the cabdrivers have told me that i 've stayed in a couple of different hotels and the bellmen have told me that sather , who was not able to hire either kevin lowe or craig mactavish for the top job turned to another person with oiler roots the thinking was that we would n't have to go through a honeymoon together , sather said , explaining his selection of low , who was sather s head coach in edmonton for fourplus seasons we know each other that said , sather laid down his first mandate since becoming team president and general manager on june 1 it is not acceptable for this team not to make the playoffs , sather said low was asked if that put pressure on him i'm sure it does , he said this game comes with a lot of pressure low was asked if he felt added pressure by having the reigning stanley cup champion devils across the hudson river absolutely none , low said , before referring to the islanders the team the other way is vastly improved , too low said he would like the rangers to play the uptempo style that became synonymous with edmonton he also made a distinction between the oilers and this rangers team the former was built on youth and speed the latter is laden with older , skilled players that s not the same type of team , said low , who was coach and general manager of the houston aeros of the international hockey league last season i understand that totally can you play the same way \? i think you can but if you ca n't , i'm very comfortable with backing up i trapped last year in houston we will look at the situation here and judge ourselves accordingly low also promised not to judge the rangers on last season s fiasco i do n't think all those guys they signed last year are over the hill or finished , low said there had to be problems last year we have to find out what they were and solve them the rangers are obviously hoping that messier , the former captain who led the team to a stanley cup in 1994 , will be one of the solutions the team has not been in the playoffs since his departure in 1997 what mark brings to the table is incredible leadership , low said before the messier agreement was announced people rally around him he 'd be a great guy to coach many around the league believe that messier could be a strong influence on pavel brendl , jamie lundmark and manny malhotra sather was asked yesterday if there would be spots for the team s young players absolutely , he said i'm trying to make some changes in the organization with the setup of this hockey team , some of those changes are going to take time but the plan is to make some changes we 're not going to forcefeed somebody on the team who s not ready they 're going to have to make the hockey club , just like all the veterans low , who said he wanted to look at everyone , mentioned mike york , the rangers' top rookie last season , as someone he wants to see firsthand i know brendl is an unbelievable goal scorer , low said it would be nice if he s ready , but i definitely would n't put any pressure on him lundmark definitely excites you , also malhotra , i do n't know enough about but i know one thing about him he can skate , which likely puts him in my plans i do n't know exactly where he fits but i like people who can skate low is being reunited with sather one year after leaving edmonton in a contract dispute it might have been a little silly pride , low said the fact that i thought i deserved a raise after getting the team into the playoffs and then knocking off heavily favored opponents twice in a row i did n't want to be the lowestpaid coach in the league anymore so i left and i put my family into a tenuous position there for a while but now , i'm not regretting the decision at all he signed a deal believed to be for three years at about 700 , 000 a season obviously , i'm not coming in with a blindfold on , low said i may leave with a blindfold on just give me a smoke slap shots the rangers' president and general manager , glen sather , admitted having an interest in signing claude lemieux , who will be 35 when the season starts will i give him a fouryear deal \? sather asked no ron low on theo fleury , the rangers' biggest disappointment last season he definitely was n't the player i 'd seen out west the last eight or nine years whatever the problems were , we have to solve them don maloney was promoted to vice president for player development to go with his title of assistant general manager photo ron low , a former goalie , will try to direct the rangers back into the stanley cup playoffs \( barton silverman the new york times \)
politicians and parades go together like fife and drum and the st patrick s day season what else to call it when the celebrations start almost two weeks before the actual holiday \? proves it like none other in new york , where elected officials pick their parades with the care one might take walking across hot coals in the last few days , there have been no fewer than three st patrick s day parades , including two yesterday they were nothing near the scope of the famed one down fifth avenue in manhattan , but were big enough or politically important enough to draw out mayor rudolph w giuliani and hillary rodham clinton they are both running for the united states senate , to fill the seat daniel patrick moynihan is vacating and with the irish vote seen as an influential bloc , it is not surprising they and many others holding elective office , or wishing to , set out to prove green is one of their favorite colors yesterday the mayor , wearing the requisite green in the form of a sweater , walked alongside staten island borough president guy v molinari in the parade in port richmond it was a delicate arrangement , given that mr molinari spent the time passing out stickers and brochures for senator john mccain mr giuliani is a bush man mr giuliani , marching behind the new york city police department color guard , kept himself busy shaking hands and waving to spectators who cheered and chanted his name as he passed mrs clinton opted for the parade in sunnyside , queens , which put on its first parade yesterday , with the expressed desire to be diverse and to include gay organizations that are not allowed to march under their banners in the manhattan parade the ancient order of hibernians , which organizes the fifth avenue parade , refuses to allow gay groups mrs clinton , with a green scarf tucked into her black coat and flanked by members of congress and state elected officials , promised to be in the parade down fifth avenue next week , too , despite the position of many democrats who boycott it to protest the exclusion of gay groups yesterday , when reporters shouted questions on whether she would march in manhattan , she first replied i intend to i hope it s inclusive and then she quickly added more emphatically , i'm marching mr giuliani is a regular marcher in the manhattan parade the people lining the parade routes do not always pay attention to this political calculus bob keilbach , a 57yearold engineer from flushing , queens , stood on skillman avenue in sunnyside , watching a buddhist group pass , followed by the irish lesbian and gay organization \( the group that perennially files unsuccessful lawsuits seeking to be allowed in the fifth avenue parade \) , followed by the red cross , followed by an rv blaring the song louie , louie and belonging to abe hirschfeld , the eccentric real estate developer who sported signs saying he is running for senate politicians \? that s not what i'm here for , mr keilbach said this is just wonderful , all these groups i do n't always get to the city to see the st patrick s day parade there , so it s great that they brought one to queens photos hillary rodham clinton , center , chose a parade in sunnyside , queens , yesterday to court irish voters she also promised to be in the manhattan parade \( steve berman the new york times \) mayor rudolph w giuliani , center , donned a green sweater and marched on staten island yesterday with guy v molinari , left , the borough president \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)
new york city s police seem to be making a conscientious effort to find and punish those officers who did such a poor job of protecting the women who were attacked by marauding bands of young men in central park last month this is a healthy development in a department that tends to blame others when it gets into trouble the department announced this week that it would discipline nine police officers , including six supervisors although none are likely to be fired , police commissioner howard safir seems serious about punishing officers who failed to aid citizens in trouble but there are clearly more systemic problems that need addressing among other things , mr safir must reach into the police academy itself and strengthen that part of the training regimen that deals with sexual harassment and violence toward women several women charged that police officers whom they approached to report the assaults did nothing at a time when direct action might have prevented further attacks of the nine officers cited for misconduct , two were accused of failing to respond properly when the women told them about sexual assaults one of these is accused of refusing to write a report when a victim walked into an east side station house to say that she had been assaulted in addition , four commanding officers who were at the scene will receive letters of censure , which become a permanent part of their personnel files three civilian employees will be disciplined for failing to properly classify 911 calls received regarding the melee mr safir s procedural recommendations dealt mainly with tactical issues , urging commanding officers to use helicopters and different ways of managing crowds new techniques are fine , and better preparation for possible disturbances after the big puerto rican national day parade would have been useful but what happened also suggests that the police may not have been as sensitive to issues of gender relations , as well as to the special dangers like sexual harassment that women face , as they are to other issues some have also wondered whether the officers' indifference was reinforced by the fact that most of the young women were black and hispanic these attitudes need to be more effectively dealt with in the police academy , where new and more intensive training is clearly needed on issues of gender relations and genderrelated violence
except for the shouting , it is becoming clear that the debate over employee privacy is over the american management association conducts an annual survey on electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace , and the latest results , released a few weeks ago , show that widespread , routine snooping on employees is no longer a threat but a fact nearly threequarters of the large american companies that responded to the survey said they actively record and review at least one of the following employees' phone calls , email , internet connections and computer files that is twice the rate of snooping as in 1997 and one company in four has fired an employee over what the surveillance turned up so the ethical quandary over whether to monitor will soon be moot factors like fear of sexual harassment litigation , lost employee productivity and theft of proprietary data and software have swamped any hesitations about privacy it is almost a cinch that your employer will be having a peek at what you 're up to if not today , then tomorrow if monitoring is a given , a new challenge for employers takes center stage setting up a monitoring system that is ethical and fair to all employees , and not merely defensible in court a key issue , of course , is who will do the monitoring \? and that is where things get sticky two approaches are possible monitoring could become a fulltime job for a person or department , or could be made a sidelight among other responsibilities each presents problems when policing coworkers is someone s main job , human nature creates a real danger the designated monitor will have every incentive to find problems to justify his or her job , said n ben fairweather , a research fellow at the center for computing and social responsibility in leicester , england once the egregious offenders are weeded out , an effective monitoring program can easily devolve into a wild , selfperpetuating array of witch hunts and speed traps an ethically unjustifiable state of affairs , however one may feel about monitoring in the abstract more often , monitoring is assigned to people or departments that mainly do something else typically , the job goes to informationtechnology people , for no better reason than that they are usually the only ones who have the necessary access to hardware and software and know how it all works , on the snoop s side as well as the user s but think again of human nature making snooping a sideline is likely to lead to wild inconsistency , occasional incompetence or outright capriciousness in the way monitoring is applied and policies are enforced i do n't meant to suggest that technical people are reckless or capricious only a fool would make such an observation and expect his office internet connection to ever work smoothly again it s just that the doitinyoursparetime approach is doomed from the outset people will naturally devote most of their time and attention to their principal responsibilities the ones that figure in whether they get promotions and raises and turn to monitoring only when they have the time and inclination inevitably , that means inconsistent enforcement , which can be worse than none at all generally , in all areas of corporate management , the idea of having a policy is a good one , but it s not enough , said jeffrey d neuburger , a lawyer specializing in technologyrelated issues at brown raysman millstein felder steiner , a manhattan firm if you do n't enforce it , you 're almost better off not having a policy , because you get charged with this standard that you 're telling the world that you 're going to live under mr neuberger s point is one both of fairness and of vulnerability in court a company sued by an employee over a claim of sexual harassment can find itself in trouble , for example , if it can be demonstrated that the company adopted a policy against viewing internet pornography on office computers but did not consistently enforce the policy it wo n't do much for the company s defense to have some harried systems analyst testify that checking the logs for naughty downloads was item no 137 on her weekly todo list a survey earlier this year by elron software , a publisher of monitoring software , shows that internet policy enforcement is far from airtight onetenth of workers responding to the survey said they had seen coworkers viewing adult web sites on the job more than half of that 10 percent said their companies had explicit policies forbidding it if fulltime snoops are prone to overzealousness and parttimers to inconsistency , what is the right way to manage routine monitoring \? there is n't one the ethical approach is to use snooping the way the police are supposed to use searches and telephone taps only when warranted there might be a need for monitoring , but only after the organization has good grounds for suspecting that there is abuse , dr fairweather said in other words , he snoops fairest who snoops least , and then only with cause drawing \( christophe vorlet \)
to the editor re if a swing state cares , it s an issue , by michael lind \( oped , oct 2 \) reform of the electoral college may be a good idea , but a more meaningful change would be the addition of none of the above to a line on the ballot with the provision that if none of the above received more votes than any candidate , the parties would be required to nominate new candidates and another election held in four to six weeks to avoid this rejection and embarrassment , such a change might inspire the parties to nominate people of quality , ending what many believe is too often the choice between bad and worse or not voting at all rich greener roswell , ga , oct 2 , 2000
there was a certain topsyturvy logic to the frantic rulings of florida courts this week that allowed the vote recounts , declared that the secretary of state had the discretion to exclude those recounts and then ordered her not to certify the election until the state supreme court ruled on the election issues the logic , such as it was , came partly from the fact that none of the rulings were final court determinations , legal experts said inconsistencies can be harmonized by the florida supreme court you do n't call the end of the game after the first inning or the second inning , the democrats' lawyer , david boies , said yesterday , making it plain that the 2000 campaign is now in a litigation phase that may not end soon the state supreme court gave the democrats a major victory yesterday in its order to the secretary of state , katherine harris , not to certify the election results until the court reviewed a county judge s decision that said ms harris had the discretion to bar the recounts a court always has the authority to issue orders that maintain the status quo , said e joshua rosenkranz , president of the brennan center for justice at new york university law school in addition to the interim nature of the rulings , legal experts said there were two other explanations for the apparent contradictions one explanation was that they might not actually be contradictory some experts say florida law gives the county election boards the power to determine when recounts are necessary , while giving the secretary of state the power to decide what results to accept that reading of the law would mean that the flurry of rulings this week amounted to a coherent statement of the law the county boards were authorized to continue recounting even though ms harris told them she would not recognize those counts the secretary of state has the administrative authority over when to certify a winner , said samuel issacharoff , an electionlaw specialist at columbia law school she has no authority over how the counties decide to evaluate the ballots the decisions of the secretary and the boards are subject to court review a second explanation of the seemingly contradictory rulings was the realpolitik that is often between the lines of court battles several legal experts said the overwhelmingly democratic state supreme court could not have missed the enormous practical consequences of its decisions to clear the way for recounts and to prevent ms harris from declaring gov george w bush of texas the winner the supreme court s curt ruling on thursday simply said there is no legal impediment to the recounts the brief order yesterday said it was to maintain the status quo whether their motives were legal or political , the supreme court s justices would have understood the implications of public announcements of new vote tallies , some legal experts said describing the inevitable news coverage accompanying the recounts , richard l hasen , a professor of election law at loyola law school in los angeles , said , they were trying to get the information out there whatever the explanation for the seemingly contradictory rulings , the two lines of legal analysis gave both sides support for new legal battles before the supreme court acted yesterday , mr boies promised that a new suit in state court would challenge any certification of the election that the democrats see as premature such a suit could still be filed if the democrats do not win the current appeal in the state supreme court in such a suit , the democrats would again assert that ms harris had abused her discretion she would clearly continue to argue that she made reasonable decisions any new state suit by the democrats would move through the courts at the same time as all of the existing suits some legal experts said the democrats could also claim a violation of the federal constitution one possible federal constitutional claim , some lawyers said , could be that the ballot in palm beach county was so confusing that voters there were treated differently mr rosenkranz , of the brennan center , said a separate federal constitutional claim of denial of the right to vote would arise if ms harris was alleged to be refusing to credit legitimate votes tallied in recounts a claim of a constitutional violation by the democrats would be very similar to the claim the republicans made in the federal suit seeking an injunction to stop the recounts that was rejected by the federal appeals court in atlanta yesterday because the democrats have argued so fervently against federal court intervention in the republicans' suit , several lawyers said it was unlikely that the democrats would file a federal suit of their own but the democrats could include any federal constitutional claims in state suits they would need to do so if they hope to try to take the case beyond the florida supreme court to the united states supreme court some lawyers say the democrats would prefer to continue maneuvering the legal battle toward the predominantly democratic florida supreme court as the final tribunal in the election battle by filing a federal suit , these lawyers say , the republicans have already shown that they might prefer the last litigation stop to be the united states supreme court
can a red bullet shoot down a flying horse \? or , more to the point , can the speed horse red bullet ambush fusaichi pegasus and destroy his chances of sweeping the triple crown \? he tried it once , in the wood memorial last month at aqueduct , but the flying horse surged past red bullet to win by four and onequarter lengths then , while red bullet stayed behind in new york , fusaichi pegasus flew past the field to win the kentucky derby by a length and a half at churchill downs never once did i feel i could have won the derby , the trainer joe orseno said before putting red bullet aboard a van and shipping him to pimlico for next saturday s preakness we felt he was n't a horse on schedule for the derby but orseno and red bullet s owner , frank stronach , apparently feel that the extra five weeks has given their colt the time he needs to take another shot at fusaichi pegasus their hopes were strengthened when red bullet zipped five furlongs in 58 4 5 seconds in a workout at pimlico this morning and they have hired jerry bailey , the country s premier jockey , to ride him when he takes the next step the next step the 125th preakness at a mile and threesixteenths , which is a sixteenth of a mile shorter than the derby on a narrower track with sharper turns only five horses may challenge fusaichi pegasus this time , including only two of the colts he outran in the derby high yield , the d wayne lukas star , who finished 15th , and hal s hope , 16th after leading for most of a mile three others are committed to the preakness hugh hefner , second in the snow chief in his last start snuck in , second in the arkansas derby and red bullet , second in the wood four other colts who were soundly beaten in the derby may give it another whirl in the preakness impeachment \( third \) , more than ready \( fourth \) , wheelaway \( fifth \) and captain steve \( eighth \) but the fresh horse , the dangerous horse , figures to be red bullet he is a chestnut son of unbridled , winner of the 1990 kentucky derby , and he reeled off three victories in a row this year , his first at the races on jan 8 , he won by seven lengths at aqueduct on feb 5 , he won by two and onehalf at gulfstream park on march 19 , he returned to new york and won the gotham stakes by half a length over aptitude , who then ran second to fusaichi pegasus in the derby and on april 15 , red bullet again outran aptitude in the wood , but both finished well behind the flying horse orseno said he believed that the wood was decided when red bullet pressed the pace , only to save nothing for the critical stretch drive orseno stopped short of finding fault with alex solis , who rode red bullet in the wood but when solis picked up aptitude for the derby , the die was cast orseno promptly signed up bailey , and said , i do n't want to have to scramble for a rider if we go on to the belmont but standing in the path of all challengers is fusaichi pegasus , a son of mr prospector and a grandson of danzig , bought for 4 million as a yearling by the japanese venture capitalist fusao sekiguchi he did not race until last december , when he lost by a neck at hollywood park after a troubled trip but since then , he has won five in a row fusaichi pegasus became the derby favorite when he won the wood with a powerful drive through the homestretch that left red bullet and aptitude in his trail three weeks later , he became the first derby favorite to win the race in 21 years , since spectacular bid , and he did it with style and strength he is a large animal with regal breeding and a smashing resume , and he has become the favorite to go on and become the 12th horse to sweep the triple crown the last three horses who won the kentucky derby silver charm , real quiet and charismatic also won the preakness but fell short of winning the belmont stakes in the final strides but none of them was the favorite in the derby then along came fusaichi pegasus , a brilliant new star in the new century you will hear no argument from lukas , who has entered 38 horses in the kentucky derby over the last 20 years and won the race 4 times fusaichi pegasus is a deserving favorite , lukas said , but let s face it , he s not a windup toy you 're probably crazy to pick against him so , we 'll try to upset him the oddsmakers agreed they expected to make fusaichi pegasus the heavy early favorite at perhaps 35 to win the preakness bob baffert , who won the derby twice in the last four years , put it into perspective for his horse , captain steve , as well as the no 1 challenger , red bullet fusaichi pegasus deserves to be the heavy favorite , baffert said he s got a lot going for him with his breeding , his record and the way he won the derby

bridgeport , conn , june 8 issuing the first verdict in a case that outraged the public and prompted a swift strengthening of connecticut s witness protection laws , a jury today convicted a drug dealer of ordering the murder of an 8yearold boy last year to prevent the child from testifying against him as the state s key witness in another murder trial the jury in state supreme court here convicted the dealer , russell peeler jr , of also ordering the slaying of the boy s mother , karen clarke she and the boy , leroy brown jr , were shot to death in their bridgeport apartment on jan 7 , 1999 mr peeler , 28 , a convicted drug dealer who is already serving a 105year prison sentence for killing ms clarke s longtime boyfriend , may now get the death penalty the penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to start on tuesday and prosecutors will try to persuade the jury of five men and seven women that mr peeler should be sentenced to death the boy , known as b j , was going to be the main prosecution witness in the killing of ms clarke s fiance , rudolph snead jr , whom b j called dad in 1997 , at age 7 , b j was an eyewitness when mr peeler first tried to kill mr snead mr peeler , charged with attempted murder , was out on bail when he did shoot mr snead to death in a barbershop nine months later mr peeler was also free on bail when b j and his mother were killed , but an electronic ankle bracelet that he was wearing by court order to track his movements made clear that he could not have been the gunman that role , prosecutors have charged , was played by mr peeler s younger brother , adrian , 23 , who is being tried separately for the killings the brazen murders of b j and his mother prompted a tremendous outcry from the public and officials , who said that the state had clearly failed to protect its young witness in response , state legislators and law enforcement officials drafted a bill that created one of the most comprehensive state witness protection programs in the country the law was signed by gov john g rowland in july 1999 and took effect in october it gave the chief state s attorney direct responsibility for protecting witnesses through a new witness protection unit , made it a felony to intimidate a witness , and gave judges broad authority to issue witness protection orders the law also directed the office of the state s attorney to give special consideration to a witness who is a child , elderly or handicapped or otherwise more at risk of being intimidated , and it gave prosecutors the authority to take custody of a child witness if parents did not provide adequate protection in a trial that lasted more than a month , the jury in state supreme court heard from more than 50 prosecution witnesses , including russell peeler s girlfriend , angelina keene , the mother of his three children , who testified that a month before the killings mr peeler had told her that he was going to start killing witnesses another witness , kybarris taylor , testified that mr peeler had offered him 10 , 000 to kill two nobodies among the most provocative evidence was testimony from josephine lee , who lived across the street from b j and his mother ms lee , who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge , said she had helped the peeler brothers carry out the killings by getting ms clarke to open her door defense lawyers showed the jurors several letters they had obtained in which ms lee contradicted her testimony about the peelers' involvement in the killings shortly after noon today , the jury announced that it had reached a verdict judge g sarsfield ford warned spectators not to react vocally to the verdict and none did one of mr peeler s lawyers , john t walkley , said the conviction would be appealed on numerous grounds i thought that the evidence was not there to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , mr walkley said photos oswald clarke spoke yesterday after the man who ordered the killings of his sister , karen , and her son , leroy brown jr , was found guilty \( associated press \) leroy brown jr , 8 , was killed to prevent his testimony in court
harold o levy was an unusual choice as new york city s interim schools chancellor , and not only because he was a banking executive with little educational experience unlike all but one of the previous seven chancellors , who were black or hispanic , mr levy is white minority status has long been seen as practically a prerequisite for running the city s 1 , 100 schools , whose students are overwhelmingly black and hispanic but mr levy s selection has raised the possibility that ethnicity will be less of an issue perhaps even none at all in the search for a permanent chancellor the pressure to hire a minority chancellor has eased , board of education officials say , while the pressure to rehabilitate the school system is more intense than ever so other questions will dominate the search this time , the officials say , like whether the new chancellor should be a veteran of the school system or an outsider , an educator or a business leader we are at a point where we have seen multiple latino and africanamerican chancellors , william c thompson jr , the board president , said in a recent interview at this point , color and gender are very secondary to the issue of who is the best person for the job the city s political climate is far different now than in 1983 , when the last fulltime chancellor who was white , frank j macchiarola , stepped down mayor edward i koch s relationship with minorities was considered abysmal , and black and hispanic leaders were striving for a more prominent role in city government mr koch wanted deputy mayor robert f wagner jr to succeed mr macchiarola , but minority lawmakers angrily mobilized around black and hispanic candidates the board of education favored mr wagner , but he lacked the proper credentials and the state education commissioner rejected his candidacy the board then chose anthony j alvarado , a hispanic district superintendent whom many minority politicians supported the only white chancellors since then have been mr levy and bernard mecklowitz , who served temporarily after chancellor richard r green died in 1989 while many have contended that minority chancellors have a better chance than whites have to forge strong ties with minority parents , michael d casserly , executive director of the council of great city schools , said that experience had often proved otherwise the symbol is often important , said mr casserly , whose organization represents the nation s 50 largest school districts but over 20 years or so , people have realized that a school system s salvation does n't necessarily rest in the hands of one race or another instead , mr casserly said , the success of a school system often depends more on the nature of the leadership for example , reaching out to parents and community groups was a top priority for ramon c cortines , a hispanic from san francisco who was chancellor from 1993 to 1995 he got to work early each morning to take calls from the public , a habit that endeared him to parents and to community groups but rudy crew , who served from 1995 until last month , never cultivated those relationships being black did not give dr crew , who came to new york from tacoma , wash , an automatic bond with parents there were expectations that he would be able to relate to the overwhelming population of parents who were black and latino , said c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president , who is black but he did not reach out on the basis of that alone , i believe the ability to relate does not depend on a person s race on the other hand , dr crew has said that his race factored heavily into his vehement opposition to mayor rudolph w giuliani s plan to experiment with school vouchers last year dr crew said in an interview last month that as a black man , he had seen the mayor s plan as a betrayal of public education , and particularly the mission of educating black and hispanic children ms fields and several other people interviewed said that considering the challenges the next chancellor would face , the top priority should perhaps be finding someone who could deftly navigate the political and ethnic divisions that can make policy making in new york city tortuously difficult joseph a fernandez , a hispanic from miami who was chancellor from 1990 to 1993 , tried to push through a multicultural curriculum without realizing the power of conservative communities in queens and staten island in the uproar that followed , the board of education rejected mr fernandez s curriculum , then fired him native new yorkers may also be more invested in the job than outsiders for whom the city is just another career pit stop many believe that mr alvarado , a native new yorker who had been a district superintendent in harlem before ascending to the chancellor s post , was one of the city s most effective schools chiefs \( he resigned , however , because of a personal financial scandal after only a year on the job \) dr crew often said he was homesick for washington , and his decision to explore job options at the university of washington last summer was a factor in his ouster deputy mayor ninfa segarra , one of mr giuliani s representatives on the board of education , has said emphatically that the board should give priority to new yorkers this time mr thompson , the board president , said that he agreed in principle but that the board would be foolish to limit its search to new york we have a responsibility to choose the best person , and if that person is from new york we 'll jump at the chance , mr thompson said just to understand what the neighborhoods are and who the players are , it s definitely helpful to have someone from new york city the unusual set of political circumstances in new york city this year could also factor heavily into the chancellor search mr giuliani is waging a highprofile senate campaign against hillary rodham clinton , and the city school system will be under a microscope not knowing who will be mayor next year , many candidates may be reluctant to apply for the job but mr casserly , of the council of great city schools , said that no matter what issues dominated the chancellor search which is to begin this month and end by late spring the applicant pool would almost certainly be more diverse than ever more than half the school systems that belong to his organization have black or hispanic superintendents , including 4 of the nation s 10 largest school systems michael meyers , executive director of the new york civil rights coalition , said the board of education had an obligation to seek not only a racially diverse applicant pool , but one that included women mr meyers criticized the board last month when it chose four white men as finalists for interim chancellor i'm not saying race and gender should be a deciding factor , he said but in new york city , you have to have women and minorities in the finalist pool as long as you have a perception of fair play and equal opportunity , people will unite around the result
moscow when norwegian divers opened the emergency escape hatch on the sunken russian submarine on sunday , they had done in a day what russian rescue workers had not managed in a week the tragic story of the kursk is only the latest evidence that russia can no longer afford to maintain the technology created in the soviet union the kursk was a quintessential soviet creation , huge as the superpower s ambition , equipped to destroy entire groups of vessels many times its own size and , of course , topsecret but we now know that for years the sub has been going to sea without even the required emergency food and water supplies on board the help of norwegian deepsea divers was needed because russia has none of its own some say this is because the country has not developed the sophisticated equipment necessary for deepsea diving , while others claim that ships on which divers would normally be based have been written off for lack of maintenance in other words , the kursk and nine other huge nuclear submarines could function only as long as they could avoid accidents but the kursk tragedy has two main protagonists the submarine itself and vladimir putin , who is facing the first emergency of his presidency like the submarine , mr putin is a quintessential product of the soviet era the communist state s ultimate ambition was to create a new type of man , and the robotlike qualities of mr putin may be the predictable result in the rare interviews when he has discussed his own background , he has gone to great lengths to define himself as a man average in every way , taken along by the system and a remarkable fate that landed him in the country s highest office there seemed to be a great discrepancy between his background and his high position and now it seems that , like the kursk and its fleet , mr putin lacked the resources to cope with an emergency mr putin s statements about the kursk have been meager at first he said nothing and refused even to cut short his vacation in a black sea resort then he made a brief statement that seemed to indicate that he considered salvaging the equipment on board the kursk more important than rescuing the crew last friday , on the seventh day since the sinking , when criticism had reached a deafening pitch , mr putin finally decided to fly back to moscow cornered in yalta , he defended his decision not to fly immediately to the area near the disaster i think i did the right thing , mr putin said , because the arrival of nonspecialists from any field , the presence of highplaced officials in the disaster area would not help and more often would hamper work everyone should keep to his place the phrasing was telling the words for highly placed officials literally mean toplevel bureaucrats mr putin could have said executives or leaders , but instead chose words suggesting that he sees himself as a bureaucrat who should keep to his place , not a leader who should go where the trouble is it was leadership that the people trying to save the kursk crew needed most they needed a leader who , placing human life above all , would seek foreign assistance from the start , instead of refusing offers of help until after signs of life stopped coming from the sub they needed a leader who would order the names of sailors on the sub made public immediately , instead of letting relatives remain in suspense until day six , when some journalists succeeded in buying the information from the navy they needed a leader who would order that relatives of crew members be granted free vouchers to fly to the rescue site instead of forcing relatives to take up a collection to buy the cheapest available train tickets and undertake a twoday journey they needed a leader who would break through the military s natural urge to err on the side of caution , which compelled the border control to delay foreign rescue ships for an additional six hours after they arrived in the area mr putin has indicated that he knew from the start that most of the crew were dead and this was why he failed to shift into an emergency mode if more people had been alive immediately after the accident , he seemed to imply , more would have been done sooner this kind of mathematics betrays a perfectly soviet disregard for the individual it is no surprise , ultimately , that at a time of crisis mr putin demonstrated the coginthewheel mentality on which he was reared but the kursk disaster shows that russia can no more afford a sovietera toplevel bureaucrat in charge than it can afford to maintain its sovietera nuclear submarines
wall street s role in the financing of abusive lenders was the theme of a public hearing that federal regulators held yesterday in the financial district , but none of the invited business speakers showed up i think it was that nobody wants to defend it , said andrew m cuomo , the federal secretary of housing and urban development , who presided at the session and commented later organizers said they had asked several financial institutions to send representatives nearly 30 other witnesses did appear , however , and testified for several hours about the problems of what critics call predatory lenders , who single out minority borrowers with limited credit and offer loans with relatively high interest rates the speakers included several borrowers , community group advocates , public officials , academics and representatives of the lending industry we 're in one of wall street s houses , but wall street s not here , said one witness , john taylor of the national community reinvestment coalition , an advocacy group the hearing was in the new york mercantile exchange at the world financial center the flourishing subprime homeequity market pushes loans to people with limited credit ratings , charging higher than average interest predatory lenders are a subset focusing on minority neighborhoods , and especially elderly homeowners , using deceptive tactics to pressure them into loans with exorbitant fees and interest that they cannot afford to repay borrowers often end up in bankruptcy or foreclosure secretary cuomo called the predatory lenders bottom feeders , con men and scam artists , but he gave the financial industry the benefit of the doubt i do n't think that wall street investors are aware of the problem , he said i believe they would be as surprised by these revelations as anyone else , and once they are aware they will quickly distance themselves from it critics call that view naive and say that wall street is well aware of the issue in april , moody s investors service issued a report on the rising number of complaints about predatory lending but was generally reassuring to investors predatory lending allegations , no matter how unseemly , will not affect most subprime mortgage securitizations , moody s said wall street companies have come under increasing scrutiny because they underwrite subprime lenders , including the predatory ones , and resell their bundled loans , making fresh money available for them to issue more loans as an example , a speaker from the association of community organizations for reform now , an advocacy group , asserted yesterday that merrill lynch which has offices in the world financial center near the hearing site was the nation s thirdlargest underwriter of subprime lenders the critics also said that the company itself made 800 home loans in the new york area in 1998 , of which only five were for black or hispanic borrowers a company representative did not return phone calls left last night requesting comment a few dozen protesters from acorn planned to march to merrill lynch , seeking to meet with company officials acorn s leaders said that state park police officers and city police officers had threatened to arrest demonstrators and tried to bar them from the hearing and from merrill lynch a confrontation was averted , however , when a merrill lynch representative approached the protesters and talked about arranging a meeting the department of housing and urban development is also holding hearings in atlanta , baltimore , chicago and los angeles in an effort to press for changes speakers yesterday called for more statistical reports to track the problem , selfpolicing in the industry , public education , more enforcement of existing rules and the adoption of new regulations they have an ally in senator charles e schumer of new york mr schumer , who was at the meeting , called the victims' testimony heartbreaking gail floyd of philadelphia described how her request for a 1 , 500 loan to convert her oil furnace to gas snowballed into a refinancing of two old mortgages totaling 25 , 000 at 95 and 11 percent , plus 7 , 000 in fees and points , for a new 33 , 000 loan at 12 percent anther woman , marie morency of brooklyn , said she was about to lose her home in foreclosure
london , may 21 mystery and magic are the magnets that draw fans to harry potter , the fictional british schoolboycumliteraryphenomenon who has made millions of pounds and dollars for its author and publishers and now the book series' publicists are trying a little sorcery themselves , casting a spell of secrecy they hope will conjure the bookselling event of the year , if not the decade the fourth volume in the harry potter series is set to be published on july 8 in both britain and the united states unlike the last three , in which the american releases came several months after the british debuts and this time , a substantial degree of effort is going into ensuring that as little as possible is known about the book s contents in advance there will be , for instance , none of the advance copies that usually land on reviewers' desks a few months before publication no one is promoting prepublication interviews with the author , j k rowling indeed , according to the american and british publishers , ms rowling will be giving no interviews at all until publication day the plot is a secret so is the cover design even the title is supposed to remain closely guarded all that the british publisher , bloomsbury , is prepared to acknowledge is that this fourth and latest in a planned sevenbook series will be a whopping 600 pages twice the length of previous harry potters \( the united states publisher , the arthur a levine books imprint of scholastic books , says its version will be closer to 700 pages because of a different layout and illustrations \) this book is really under wraps , said judy corman , a spokeswoman for scholastic according to bloomsbury in london , the reason for the secrecy is the author s wish that children s enjoyment of the book not be spoiled by advance word about the plot the author was very concerned about this , said rosamund de la hey , head of children s books sales and marketing at bloomsbury both publishers said that only a handful of people at either house had been given a peek of the text itself but one result of the secrecy , of course , is to stoke the fevered imaginations of countless children and not a few adults , too about a book that is already in such demand that advance internet orders kept it near the top of amazoncom s bestseller list last week \( it had earlier been no 1 , but was bumped to second place by advance orders of a thriller to be released on tuesday by tyndale house , the indwelling the beast takes possession , by tim f lahaye and jerry b jenkins \) this is quite a classic marketing ruse , rita clifton , chief executive of interbrand , newell sorrell , a brand consultancy , said of the harry potter campaign it s like launching a new car there is quite obsessive secrecy all the news is kept under strict control and you create a sense of expectation and anticipation any leaks would dilute the excitement not only that , but bloomsbury s soaring stock price may benefit , too having a lot of harry potter razzmatazz all helps , said louise barton , a media analyst with the brokerage firm of investec henderson crosthwaite , even though the harry potter books are an important but not dominant part of bloomsbury s attraction to investors from a oneyear low of 255 \( 379 \) before the harry potter phenomenon zoomed into the stratosphere last year , bloomsbury s stock has risen to a close of 735 on friday the british and american publishers are clearly calculating that when the floodgates of pentup demand burst on july 8 the supply will be there to meet the expected clamor for a book whose predecessors have sold a combined 208 million copies in the united states and an additional 7 million in britain and the rest of the englishspeaking world bloomsbury s first print order is for a million copies , retailing at 1499 \( 2250 \) scholastic s is for 38 million , selling at 2595 each last year , the third book in the series harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban had firstprint runs of 900 , 000 in the united states and 275 , 000 in britain and the rest of the englishspeaking world , which includes markets like canada , south africa and australia and when the moment of publication arrives , the secrecy is to give way to what the publishers plan as an explosion of stunts to provide what ms clifton called the dry ice , the puffs of smoke to heighten the drama nigel newton , bloomsbury s chief executive , said that a train with a steam locomotive would be waiting at a mockup of the fictional platform platform 9 3 4 at kings cross station in london where , in all four books , harry potter slips between the real and the magical worlds to travel to the hogwarts boarding school then , for four days or so , the train will tour several british cities oxford , birmingham , manchester , york , newcastle and perth that was supposed to be a secret , mr newton said in an interview at bloomsbury s offices in soho square the train itself the oldest in britain , mr newton said , with cars dating to 1891 and 1912 will figure into a marketing maneuver that some young readers might recognize from roald dahl s charlie and the chocolate factory , in which children compete furiously for scarce golden candy wrappers that gain access to willie wonka s magical chocolate factory

liquica , east timor in his heart , says joaquin da luz , no matter how many people he hurt , no matter how many homes he burned , he was always one of the good guys we were forced to join the militia , said mr da luz , a tough man of 43 with a black stubble of beard if we 'd had a choice , who would have wanted to be in the militia \? but if i 'd refused they would have killed me his words could just as well have been printed on a little card all around newly independent east timor , this is what former members of the violent antiindependence militias are saying it is an extraordinary moment here hundreds of the men who brutalized their country last september are trickling back from their refuge in indonesian west timor to beg forgiveness from the survivors they may be astonished to see how successful they were in their work directed by elements of the indonesian military in a campaign of revenge against a vote for independence last august , the ragtag militias ravaged the homes and lives of virtually all of the 800 , 000 people who lived here house after house after house was looted and burned in the most amazing logistical exercise the tni has ever accomplished , or maybe any other military for that matter , a united nations official said , using the initials for the indonesian military the men who return find that there is not even a jailhouse left standing to hold more than a few dozen of them most of the rest end up on a sort of parole among their former neighbors and victims , hoping for the best about 40 are living here in liquica , a 45minute drive from the capital , dili another 100 or so are in the neighboring town of maubara , a local official said indeed , no matter what crimes they committed , most of the returnees so far are underlings who have a realistic hope of forgiveness some of their leaders are still active in small groups along the border , terrorizing other evacuees and threatening further harm with no formal court system in place , the returnees face a slapdash form of justice that varies from place to place , from moment to moment none can be sure if they will be met with a tearful embrace of reconciliation or like one man here in liquica recently be beaten to death a crude processing procedure has taken form in east timor in which returnees are first placed under the protection of unarmed united nations police officers or the local vigilantes who have become the de facto gendarmes of many towns residents then offer their evidence or opinions on what the returnees have done and whether they can now be accepted back into the community perhaps after a good beating only a saint would n't be angry , said amadio dias albino dos santos , 45 , a local leader who is a longtime friend and ideological opponent of mr da luz people come up to them , he said , and say 'hey , you destroyed my house you said you would kill my husband and rape me well , go ahead ! rape me now you used to think you were so powerful you could do whatever you wanted to us and now you ca n't do anything' as for the militia members , they never apologize , he said they just say 'we had no choice we were just following orders' under the guidance of east timor s independence leaders , a remarkable mood of reconciliation has softened the welcome for many members of the militia like mr da luz at first it was rough , he said people were angry and said a lot of things but now they do n't pay attention to me any more he is glad of that , he said , but distressed that his neighbors misunderstand him we were just doing what we were told , he insisted , sitting in the sparely furnished little house he has been given to live in if they told us , do this bad thing , we had no choice , we had to do it but no matter what they made us do , in our hearts we were proindependence a former government clerk , he has lost his job along with almost everybody else in this devastated country and he now works as a fisherman somebody has spray painted cnrt on the wall of his home the initials of the victorious proindependence movement mr dos santos , who is the leader of the movement in liquica , once worked with mr da luz in the local government office and when mr do santos was not in prison for his underground activities they debated the future of their country both men had strong proindependence credentials they fled into the hills when indonesia invaded the former portuguese colony in 1975 and for about four years fought as guerrillas but somewhere along the way , mr da luz lost his commitment to the cause the problem was a thing called money , mr dos santos said there was a lot of money coming in from indonesia and it was up to each person to decide do you want to keep the money and prosper or suffer and fight for what you believe \? it goes back to your humanity some people hold on to their principles and some are happy if you just give them some money mr da luz had a lot to do with money , his friend said he was the local paymaster for the militia at this point , no one is accusing him of taking part in the worst of the atrocities here in liquica , a massacre of more than 50 people in april 1999 at the local church that is when mr dos santos fled into the hills along with other proindependence activists another local official , grigorio madeira , 42 , recounted what was known of mr da luz during the worst days of destruction last september , when the sky turned dark across east timor from the smoke of burning buildings he was with the red and white iron militia group and he was always heading off to dili and other places with the other members , mr madeira said those were bad times nobody knows what he was up to since he survived the dangerous moment of his return without being beaten to death , mr da luz may never face trial or punishment but the united nations is in the process of setting up east timor s first court in dili , and the first trials of militia members are expected in june young prosecutors and defenders are gathering evidence in the cases of a few of the toughest returnees , even as they receive training in the workings of a court system with extraordinary faith in this new process , many people in east timor say they are waiting for the courts to produce the closure they crave we must trust the courts to bring us justice , mr dos santos said these people must stand up in court and tell the truth about what they have done , and we must believe them and what if once the process is complete members of the militia are acquitted and freed \? that , he said , is something we cannot accept photo former members of the militia , which waged a violent campaign in east timor , have come home to try to rebuild their lives luis , a former civil servant who would give only his first name , is now a fisherman \( anastasia vrachnos for the new york times \) map of east timor highlighting liquica one man who returned to liquica recently was beaten to death
a few days ago in barstow , calif , a new museum opened the mother road museum , it s called , and it s all about route 66 , the famous artery that carried millions of people from the midwest to los angeles that s right a museum dedicated to a highway what a moronic idea , says the morningcommute warrior in us , the one who equates highway with hell why commemorate a thing that brings us misery \? it s like having a museum dedicated to gout then again , maybe not put a bit more thought into the matter and it is evident that perhaps there s nothing more deserving of historical recognition than a highway not only do we spend a huge amount of time , pleasantly or unpleasantly , on one road or another , but a road is also what ties communities and generations together across space and time that notion has been taking hold among history types of late , including some in new jersey , where getting from here to there has always been central to our selfdefinition five communities in central jersey are even trying to get a 10mile stretch of the king s highway \( routes 206 and 27 \) on the state and federal registers of historic sites , a designation usually reserved for buildings and battlefields roads are the fleshedout paragraphs of our history , said frank curcio of annandale , who is active in the lincoln highway association , which is dedicated to that legendary new yorktosan francisco route in contrast , battlefields and buildings and settlements are punctuation marks it s a relatively new wrinkle , this idea that a road can be a historic artifact , but it s catching on there have been national conferences on preserving the historic road in america , including one in new jersey this past april the general concept is that roads with a significant history should not be rerouted , overburdened , turned into de facto interstates , etc , without careful deliberation it is , of course , an idea that runs smack up against our statewide sprawl and the constant clamor for better , wider roads to get us out of our perpetual traffic jam and it generates the usual suspicions is the concern really for history , or is it for keeping tractortrailers out of the neighborhood \? all of this is being played out in lawrence , princeton township and borough , south brunswick and franklin , where the proposal to list the king s highway in the historic registers is going through a series of public meetings the route , which began centuries ago as an indian trail and has been traveled by revolutionary armies and stagecoaches , runs through some of the most historyladen real estate in new jersey in a 10mile stretch you have eight very important historic districts that either straddle the road , cross the road or abut the road , said robert craig of the state historic preservation office those districts have been commemorated individually , but the road that links them has not been singled out for recognition or the protection that comes with it if a road seems a bit mundane to be on the highbrow federal register , think of it this way without the road , none of the historic villages and battle sites along it would have come into being this may all seem like bureaucratic busywork , but from the historian s view , at least , there s a practical side by memorializing a historic right of way , establishing it as a fixed route that ca n't be changed cavalierly , you pin down all the history that has grown up around it when roads are altered , history tends to drift , as has become evident in another part of the state , the monmouth battlefield daniel sivilich , who has been helping to map the battlefield and surrounding sites , said researchers regularly find examples of places that have been lost over time because roads are not where they once were for instance , he said , remnants of a settlement called squirreltown were found recently in a woods in freehold the settlement , which was apparently home to poor irish and black residents , used to be on what is now route 522 , but when that road was moved years ago to make way for a railroad , squirreltown vanished into the trees anyway , all of this is offered as food for thought next time you 're waiting 40 minutes to pay a 35cent parkway toll in the 24th century , what will tell people more about the irritating , absurd way we live , a wellpreserved picture of governor whitman or a wellpreserved tollbooth with attached traffic jam \? back in 1818 , one frustrated traveler summed up his muddelayed trip up the king s highway thusly the best horses and driver , and the worst roads i ever set my eyes on we 're all his descendants to paraphrase bonnie raitt , the road has always been our middle name drawing \( nancy doniger \)
austin , tex , april 20 after months of questions and criticisms about how fully gov george w bush would integrate nationally seasoned veterans into his presidential bid , the bush campaign has tapped six prominent republican strategists in washington to help mr bush s associates here chart their course , republican officials close to the campaign said today the group includes figures from past presidential races , the lobbying corridor of k street and capitol hill a republican official closely involved with the bush campaign said that while their participation would not nudge the campaign s epicenter from austin or diminish the authority of mr bush s closest associates here , it would connect the campaign more firmly to prominent republicans inside the beltway with experience in presidential politics the six are haley barbour , a former chairman of the republican national committee mary matalin , who was the deputy manager for the 1992 presidential campaign of mr bush s father charles r black , a senior adviser to the 1996 presidential campaign of bob dole vin weber , a former minnesota congressman who advised senator john mccain s bid for the republican presidential nomination this year bill paxon , a former new york congressman and former chairman of the national republican congressional committee and ed gillespie , a former senior aide to dick armey , the house majority leader we 're just trying to tap all of the talent that s out there and to do it in an organized way , said the official involved with the bush campaign each of the six washington point people is responsible for a dimension of the presidential race , holding meetings with small groups of political veterans and funneling the advice to the bush campaign many republicans in washington had long questioned why mr bush s core campaign team in austin karl rove , the chief strategist joe allbaugh , the campaign manager , and karen p hughes , the communications director had not done more to reach eastward for counsel some people close to former president george bush complained about their limited involvement in the campaign and , during the primaries , when mr bush made mistakes that some republican officials deemed avoidable , political analysts wondered aloud if mr rove , mr allbaugh and ms hughes were up to the task all three have worked with mr bush at least since his first campaign for governor in 1994 , but none has held a senior role in an effort this big as recently as saturday night , former house speaker newt gingrich said at a fundraising dinner in richmond , va , that mr bush s team was too austincentric and not quite up to speed yet the campaign s latest move seems an effort to address some of those concerns so does the campaign s serious consideration of richard b cheney , defense secretary under president bush , for a major role , possibly head of the committee that studies vicepresidential prospects but the campaign also seems to be motivated by simple diplomacy the six point people in washington do not have formal titles , republican officials said , nor is the austin team compelled to follow their advice one republican official said the bush campaign was merely making existing relationships with these six strategists more formal and trying to bring order to the barrage of solicited and unsolicited republican advice that comes to mr rove , mr allbaugh and ms hughes it s also an effort to expand the group and include people who were involved with senator mccain , one official said , adding that other former advisers to mr mccain were also helping the strategists republican officials said mr barbour would solicit and organize advice about mr bush s image and its management ms matalin s task is to study the weaknesses of mr bush s opponent , vice president al gore mr weber is expected to analyze the dynamics and possible actions of the gore campaign , and mr gillespie will help devise the best rebuttals and responses from the bush campaign mr black , officials said , is supposed to gather thoughts on how best to use the republican national committee , while mr paxon is supposed to develop goals for the convention and a blueprint for attaining them

melbourne , australia , sept 20 china is gone there will be no replay of the 1996 summer games final , no replay of the 1999 world cup final and the new american coach , april heinrichs , will not exactly wax sentimental at not presiding over a rematch you 've got to be kidding , heinrichs said i am standing on the shore giving a wave thank god they 're gone heinrichs s farewell salute should not be taken as an insult to china heinrichs knows she escaped two rugged opponents at the very same time tonight the american women advanced to the semifinals of the second summer games soccer tournament for women by surviving nigeria , by a score of 31 and with no apparent broken limbs at the very same time , china was being knocked off by norway , 21 , which means that the united states and norway , the two most bitter foes in women s soccer , have advanced to opposite semifinals the yanks meet brazil on sunday in canberra norway meets germany on sunday in sydney china is always the future in population , in production , in geopolitics , and maybe even in soccer in the very short run , however , china will not be standing in the way of the americans in the finals , as it did in the manic university of georgia stadium in 1996 , and as it did in the rocking rose bowl in california in 1999 there is a new script the americans keep coming back they do not appear to be as fearsome as in 1996 and 1999 when they had two major advantages screaming national crowds and the greatest female player who has ever lived , michelle akers , now retired from international play because of too much stress on her weary body i do n't know if she is retired , but i was happy when i did n't see her , said ismaila mabo , the nigerian coach only a year ago , akers scored two goals as the americans routed nigeria , 71 , in chicago , but more to the point , akers showed the way by separating opponent from ball by whatever means were necessary now there is no more akers stalking her prey carla overbeck , the captain , recovering from graves' disease , resides on the bench , shouting instructions that can be heard in the gigantic but relatively empty melbourne cricket ground the united states is not the team it was on the other hand , there are the teams of the future all i know is that in 1999 we lost , 71 , and today it was 31 , mabo said perhaps the next time we play , it will be a win from what i saw tonight , we played better than the usa he had the right to say that because nigeria forced the action with aggression and speed after 30 minutes , it looked like we had all that time and space , heinrichs said about the view from the bench but none of us were in the position of having our legs ripped off nigerian women come in hard and fast , with cleats flying they sent tiffeny milbrett sprawling with a sore wrist and they dumped brandi chastain , and heinrichs pulled christine lilly and mia hamm before they got hurt and , nigeria showed growing sophistication for attack with very little funding from their federation , they are one of the six best teams in the world , heinrichs said they 're kind of a wild team , said julie foudy it s always a little unsettling to play them you have a lot of space they tackle hard , but sometimes they make mistakes nigeria took the play to the united states early , but the yanks went ahead on a corner kick in the 26th minute hamm fired past the goal mouth , foudy headed the ball on goal , and chastain volleyed the goal with her foot six minutes later , lilly fired a shot that seemed destined to clear the goal mouth but was deflected by perpetua nkwocha it could have been scored an own goal , but lilly got credit for it three minutes into the second half , nigeria s most celebrated player , mercy akide , turned kate sobrero , split two other defenders , and flicked the ball past siri mullinix afterward , ifeanyichukwu chiejene performed a series of back flips that could have earned her a gymnastics medal in faroff sydney the united states scored again in the 56th minute on shannon macmillan s screeching linedrive free kick over the wall and over the hands of the goalkeeper and although nigeria scattered bodies and kept the pressure on , it could not score now the yanks are in the semifinals , and they still have n't played in the olympic city itself we 're having a great time in canberra , foudy said we were in sydney for the opening ceremony , and it s a lot of chaos we 're happy the way it is we 'll get there the final is in sydney the yanks have no guarantee they will be there , but nigeria is beaten back and china is gone not a bad night s work photo a dejected pu wei leaving the field after norway won , 21 , and sent china home from the tournament \( agence francepresse \)
alice in bed is susan sontag s riff on alice james , the brilliant , depressed sister of the novelist henry james and the psychologist william james now in previews at new york theater workshop in the east village , the play opens next sunday it is directed by ivo van hove , the resident director of the het zuidelijk toneel , a prominent repertory company in the netherlands in june , the company and new york theater workshop presented alice in bed at the holland festival , which mr van hove also directs in this production , the play s new york premiere , joan macintosh portrays alice and jorre vandenbussche the young man cast members who appear in the video segments include elizabeth marvel and paul rudd written in 1992 , alice in bed is ms sontag s only fulllength published play yet in her fiction and nonfiction she has expressed an abiding interest in the theater , as witnessed by her recent novel , in america , about a great 19thcentury polish actress who makes an even greater career for herself on the american stage alice james , who was bedridden most of her adult life , died in 1892 at the age of 43 but far from depressing , alice in bed animates alice james s teeming inner world , one that includes a version of the mad tea party from alice in wonderland included on ms sontag s guest list are the early feminist journalist margaret fuller and the poet emily dickinson earlier this month at the workshop , ms sontag and mr van hove talked with the stage director richard schechner , a professor of performance studies at the tisch school of the arts at new york university here are excerpts from their taperecorded conversation richard schechner why alice james \? why the 19th century \? susan sontag i did n't write the play to conform to historical reality but to take certain elements in the life of this extraordinary woman and career invalid and run with them the woman who is trapped does n't have to be alice james it s an extra layer that she bears the name of a real person and that the audience can bring some knowledge to the story but the play has to stand on its own , on what ivo and joan have done joan s power and poignancy , and the incredible stuff that ivo has surrounded her with ivo van hove this woman , who is super intelligent , is very conscious of herself she can see herself lying there and she says , well , get up ! but she ca n't get up i do n't want to use the word schizophrenic because that s not what i mean but it s somebody who knows exactly what state she is in she knows what s wrong with her and she is sensitive to all that is happening sontag i'm constantly astonished by what people make of the play sometimes i am asked to explain it needless to say , i believe the text speaks for itself schechner you give the director a lot of freedom when you were asked about how alice in bed was done in 1996 at the american repertory theater in cambridge , mass , you said , the play belongs to the director and the fact that i'm a living , not a dead author should n't change that sontag i gladly gave the play to ivo because there are few directors in the world i admire as much as i do him i was curious to see what he would do and the result is , indeed , very surprising to me schechner ivo , you staged it by surrounding alice with video clips , blowups of the face of her domineering father , voices , a wild montage of sights and sounds but , susan , when i read the text , you did n't call for multimedia it was n't necessary , to use your word sontag not at all schechner so how did it come about \? sontag one of the things i see in ivo s work is that each play stimulates him to invent a form and an approach that s very specific and different van hove from the moment i first read a play , i know if i am in love with it or not like in real life i was immediately in love with this woman , this alice , with how she feels about life or death , about surviving i feel the heart of this person who wants to be in this room alone , who hates it and who loves it it was my first idea that it should be totally centered on alice , that the encounters with the others are in her mind and so , for me , the whole play became like an opium dream alice has these dreams of her father , of her brother henry , of all these women from 19thcentury literature visiting her and then there is the scene where she meets the young man schechner that s very different the young man is real , a concrete physical presence on the stage van hove but in order to make that work , this scene should be the only one that happens onstage in real time you must feel that for the first time in her life , alice encounters somebody real she actually lives for a few minutes in order for that to work , i had to make everything before into fantasies thus the multimedia to show the life in her head , her virtual world schechner that virtuality is implicit in the play itself even without the multimedia , the other figures are imaginary , even if they are played by live actors was that your intention \? sontag no they are independent creatures schechner including margaret fuller and emily dickinson \?
st louis , sept 3 it has been a dream come true , jim edmonds said , to play for the st louis cardinals the fans pack the park , wear the colors and adore the players the team wins , edmonds produces and everybody is happy it s unbelievable coming to work here every day and being a part of something like this , edmonds said for the third day in a row , the cardinals beat the mets on the game s final pitch two of the gamewinners were home runs by edmonds , who smashed a high fastball from rick white into the rightfield bullpen today to give st louis a 43 victory in 11 innings the mets remained a halfgame behind the braves , who lost to the astros , 93 the cardinals bounced in unison as they swarmed around edmonds at home plate the mets , who managed only five hits , were frustrated for edmonds to hit them both is even worse , white said he s more of an 'i'mthehero' guy instead of just , 'we won' he likes to appease himself more than his team edmonds was dogged by that reputation before joining the cardinals in a trade from anaheim this spring he has said the label is unfair , a creation of the media , and he did not take white s criticism seriously that s pretty unfortunate that a guy who does n't have any idea who i am or anything about me would say something that silly , edmonds said white had not gotten over the home run after the game , and said he will think about it until he meets up with his family on monday in cincinnati , where the mets play the reds another reunion should lift the mets' spirits john franco , out with a sore left pectoral muscle , could be available on monday after an encouraging bullpen session today the mets need franco , who probably would have been pitching in the ninth inning friday , when pat mahomes gave up the gamewinner to edmonds the mets could have used franco today in the eighth inning , when turk wendell and dennis cook failed to protect a 10 lead the mets scratched one run off rick ankiel today and got seven shutout innings from glendon rusch , who tired in the 98degree heat but wendell allowed a leadoff walk and a single in the eighth , and cook came in to face a pinchhitter , placido polanco franco has not allowed an earned run since june 21 , but cook has been erratic his third pitch to polanco was a hanging slider , and polanco ripped it into the leftfield bullpen for a threerun homer that gave the cardinals a 31 lead my slider s definitely a feel pitch , cook said i had a real good one the other day today , i threw some good ones the one he hit was n't real good at all the ineffectiveness of wendell and cook wasted what might have been rusch s best effort of the year rusch kept the cardinals off balance with his changeup , allowing only four singles over seven innings no cardinal got past first base as rusch struck out seven and walked none as usual , rusch was given meager run support , but scoring has been especially difficult for the mets recently they have batted 198 , scoring 18 runs in eight games , since pounding randy johnson and the arizona diamondbacks on aug 25 we 've been through it before , said mike piazza everybody wants to be the one guy that gets us over the hump bubba had a great day today unfortunately , no one else could help him out piazza was referring to right fielder bubba trammell , making his first start since aug 15 , who knocked in all three mets runs with a 2for4 performance with two outs in the ninth , trammell belted a tworun , gametying homer off dave veres , a righthander manager bobby valentine had lefthanded options on the bench , but he stuck with trammell , a righthanded power hitter , and watched him deliver if there s one time that you think about hitting a home run , that 'd be it , trammell said i was trying to drive the ball trammell s other hit today was the mets' first off ankiel , a rookie lefthander they had never faced ankiel overpowered the mets with a mid90 s fastball and a curveball that tumbled in 20 miles an hour slower he worked three perfect innings to start the game , striking out six at that point , ankiel and darryl kile had pitched the equivalent of a perfect game over two days kile retired the last 18 mets to bat on saturday , and ankiel the first nine today but after walking two batters in the fourth , ankiel walked jay payton with two outs in the fifth he had payton picked off first , but payton slid safely into second , eluding the tag of second baseman fernando vina payton scored when trammell looped a curveball into center for the game s first run mike bordick also had two hits and edgardo alfonzo had one , but the rest of the mets' bats were dormant for another day the bad news is we have n't hit for the last week or 10 days , valentine said the good news is , we 're going to hit a lot first baseman todd zeile discounted the way the mets had been defeated in the three games here , saying that a loss is a loss , and walking off the field at the end because of a gamewinning hit makes no difference but it may make a difference to the cardinals these two teams could meet next month in the postseason , and this series has emboldened st louis it gives us a little hope that if we ever run into them in the playoffs , edmonds said , we 'll have a chance inside pitch todd zeile left the game with a muscle cramp in his right calf , but said he expected to play on monday mike piazza was lifted after grounding into a double play in the 10th inning manager bobby valentine did not want to wear him down the mets will promote three or four more players from class aaa norfolk on tuesday infielder outfielder joe mcewing , infielder jorge velandia and at least one pitcher bobby m jones or grant roberts , or possibly both photos jim edmonds being congratulated by his teammates

al leiter and dennis cook are poised for their second world series wildcard experience , but their former florida teammate edgar renteria can be more objective about what the mets face the mets are playing good ball right now , said renteria , whose 11thinning runscoring single delivered the 1997 world series championship to the marlins , the first and , until now , only wildcard team to reach the world series when you go to the playoffs , it does not matter if you 're the wild card or win the division they 're playing good now nobody s better now they beat us in the playoffs they played great ball the wild card will mean nothing only when they play on the field , that s all that matters renteria was left to assess the mets' chances in the world series after they finished off the team he plays for , the st louis cardinals , in five national league championship series games as he walked through the bowels of shea stadium toward the team bus early yesterday morning , renteria was asked to think back three years and recall what the key element for the marlins was in winning that world series like these guys are doing now , he said when you see this team , you see everybody together they got confidence when we won the world series in '97 , we felt the same thing they 're playing very good they got a chance to win the world series the mets have certainly played as if they could beat anybody in the world series they dispatched the cardinals as easily as they sent the san francisco giants home unexpectedly what makes the mets' conquest of the cardinals all the more impressive was that it occurred immediately after the cardinals vanquished the atlanta braves in three quick and easy steps the mets did n't show much gratitude for the favor the cardinals did them , knocking out the braves so the mets would n't have to play them , but no such camaraderie exists in baseball pitching and defense seemed to be the primary reasons for the difference in the outcome of the cardinals' two series the cardinals were able to hit the braves' best starters freely but were shut down for the most part by the mets' best starters the mets' best starters are lefthanded , which helped explain the cardinals' problems during the season , the cardinals batted 276 against righthanded pitchers and 255 against lefthanders they also had a better rate of home runs and runs batted in against righthanders none of that explains why the cardinals battered the braves lefthander tom glavine for seven runs , knocking him out of game 2 in the third inning they ganged up on glavine two days after bringing an early end to a start by the righthander greg maddux , scoring seven runs \( five earned \) against him in four innings but the cardinals could n't do a thing with the mets lefthander mike hampton , failing to score a run against him in 16 innings over two games they scored three runs in seven innings against leiter , also lefthanded , but they lost that game , too defensively , the braves committed five errors , spreading them over all three games their firstgame errors were especially harmful the mets made three errors in their first game , too , but they won the game and then made only one more error in the last four games the cardinals , meanwhile , committed only one error against the braves but made seven against the mets some st louis apologists lamented the pitching problems the cardinals encountered in the series with the mets , but tony la russa , their manager , dismissed that idea as irrelevant we had the exact same circumstances against the braves , la russa said garrett stephenson was n't able to pitch against the mets , the manager pointed out , because he had been hurt early in the game he pitched against the braves rick ankiel was wild against the braves , and he was wild against the mets the mets had no pitching problems , other than giving up some runs at inopportune times in the aftermath of the mets' victory over the cardinals , some scouts speculated on the effect hampton and leiter could have on the yankees , who , like the cardinals , supposedly do n't fare as well against lefthanders as against righthanders leiter and hampton are going to give any club trouble , one national league scout said the thing the yankees will have to worry about is these two lefthanders they really come at you , two nights in a row , and they can beat anybody as accurate as the lefthanded theory might have been some teams used to bring up young lefthanded pitchers from the minor leagues to pitch against the yankees it has n't been a sound strategy this season this season the yankees have actually fared better statistically against lefthanders than righthanders their batting average was 19 points better \( 291 to 272 \) against lefthanders david justice , tino martinez and paul o'neill , the lineup s lefthanded hitters , have hit better against lefthanders than righthanders this season that s not to say that leiter and hampton would not be able to beat the yankees , but it would probably not be as easy as it was to beat the cardinals photo mike hampton , without hat , talking to al leiter during a playoff game

hard rock got turned inside out in the 1990 s its insularity broke down as hiphop and hardcore elements moved in its blues roots receded further it dismantled melody to keep its distance from the power ballads on mtv it also moved toward extremes of speed or sloth its tone changed , too , so that hard rock was no longer a guaranteed blast of power or a foretaste of apocalypse with the ascent of grunge and nine inch nails , hard rock made room for selfdoubt and private turmoil alongside the old rage the deftones , who played to a packed and moshing roseland ballroom on wednesday night , encompass the whole contradictory spectrum of new hard rock they can be brutal or sullen , repellent or disgusted , uncertain or furious chino moreno sings about dark impulses , festering decadence and shattered hopes in a world of random violence and constant tension he s victim , perpetrator , protector or accuser in songs where vulnerability can suddenly switch to lashing out the music whipsaws from hauntedhouse ambient sounds to pummeling hard core to grinding , dissonant chords song structures are fractured and arbitrary , held together by stubborn force of will and sheer muscle often mr moreno sustains a melody above stephen carpenter s gnashing guitars and abe cunningham s walloping drums it s a style traceable to tool , whose leader , maynard james keenan , collaborated with the deftones on a song for the group s new album , white pony \( maverick warner brothers \) but the crooning can switch at any moment to ranting or howling , and even when he s singing a tune , mr moreno sounds like someone at the breaking point it s not inviting music noise and cryptic lyrics keep outsiders at a distance but with three albums and constant touring over the last five years , the deftones have built a following large enough to send white pony into the top 10 plenty of fans can identify with the deftones' view of the world as an endless purgatory keep it all inside until we feel we ca n't unleash , mr moreno rapped in seven words at roseland , mr moreno wandered the stage like a man beset by private demons with stark white spotlights stretching his shadow , he turned his back to the crowd he climbed on top of amplifiers and crouched there , swaying back and forth he came to the edge of the stage and grabbed every upraised hand he leaped into the crowd , which caught him and held him upright but there was none of the standard selfcongratulation of bygone hardrock front men mr moreno was neither hero nor romantic antihero , just human flotsam the set began with be quiet and drive with mr moreno shrieking , drive me far away i do n't care where , just far and made its way through panoramas of desolation there were tales of abduction , murder , bloody marital strife and thwarted hopes in new songs like change and digital bath , the deftones have allowed themselves a little more melody than in the past , opening their cult following a little wider but onstage , the band assaulted the songs with rending feedback and blasts of distortion the last thing the deftones want is to provide the template for the 21stcentury power ballad photo fans reached out to chino moreno , lead singer of the deftones , who clasped many hands at the roseland ballroom on wednesday night \( rahav segev for the new york times \)
washington , dec 8 confusion , said macduff when he discovered the body of the murdered king duncan , now hath made his masterpiece the florida supreme court has made another with its order today that thousands of ballots in miamidade county be manually recounted , along with thousands in other counties where no manual recount has taken place it is by no means clear that these counts can be completed by tuesday electors chosen after that , federal law provides , are open to challenge further contests in the courts appear inevitable , starting with the bush campaign s emergency petition tonight to a federal appeals court to halt any recounts but the suspicion was rapidly spreading in the capital that the ultimate decisions would be made not by judges but by politicians , first in tallahassee and ultimately on capitol hill as ever , the politicians' views will be shaped in part by the public s views , which may prove highly volatile in the weeks ahead narrowly divided , 4 to 3 , the florida supreme court breathed life into the presidential campaign of vice president al gore it placed new obstacles before gov george w bush , who had seemed on the cusp of victory it certainly prolonged and may have changed the dynamic of the monthold struggle between the two for florida s 25 electoral votes , whose result will determine who becomes the 43rd president it also significantly increased the prospect that whoever takes the oath of office outside the capitol on jan 20 will do so with a sizable proportion of the electorate wondering whether he actually won the election in his dissent today , chief justice charles t wells said the majority ignores the magnitude of its decision he quoted with approval a 1936 decision by the same florida court that asserted that relief should not be granted , whatever the rights and wrongs of a case , when doing so would result in confusion and disorder and will produce an injury to the public which outweighs the individual right of the complainant james a baker iii , mr bush s point man in florida , called attention to justice wells s dissent , particularly his statement that the majority s decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the united states constitution but the justice failed to persuade his colleagues , none of whom joined in his dissent , although two dissented on different grounds the majority gave greater weight to the necessity to count every ballot where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter the problem , of course , is that one person s clear indication is another s muddle in earlier manual recounts , each county set its own standards in broward county , almost all ballots with any mark next to a presidential candidate s name were counted as votes in palm beach county , the standard was tighter , and that resulted in the exclusion of a larger number of votes among many questions left unanswered about the count tonight were these who will do the counting \? if different standards are used in different counties , is that constitutionally sound , given the fact that all the voters in all the counties are voting for the same electors \? if some counties fail to meet the dec 12 deadline , can partial counts be included in statewide totals \? more generally , there is a question whether any number of counts can ever produce an entirely authoritative result when the difference between the candidates is so microscopically thin when it is probably smaller than the margin of error of the machines and the humans who do the counting but those questions pale beside ones that would be raised by what politicians on both sides call the doomsday scenario the republican leadership in the florida legislature has pledged to select electors on its own , under what appears to be a constitutional grant of plenary power to legislatures the universal assumption here is that they will name bush electors but will they do so even if the recounts show mr gore winning \? or might that seem too much of a grab for power to florida voters , and if so , might not public pressure prompt the legislature to stay its hand \? if two rival slates of electors do arrive in washington , congress will be called upon to decide between them presumably , the republicans , who control the house of representatives , would chose the bush slate the democrats will control the senate from jan 3 to jan 20 , as long as mr gore casts the deciding vote would that case go to the united states supreme court \? and if the two houses should deadlock , would the supreme court be called upon to break the impasse \? washington is alive with theories as to who and what law take precedence perhaps a real sense of crisis would produce something other than a partyline reaction but tonight s explosive reaction to the latest florida decision by tom delay of texas , the house republican whip , offered little hope of an atmosphere free of the toxins of hyperpartisanship the decision , said mr delay , perhaps the most polarizing figure in either house of congress , had distorted the court into nothing more than a mechanism for delivering a victory to mr gore that he could not have won without the justices' aid in 1876 , congress punted the decision between rival slates of electors to a 15member commission the ultimate winner , rutherford b hayes , who finally took office in march 1877 , was known forever after as rutherfraud b hayes but even that outcome was not nearly as messy as that of the oncefamous georgia debacle of 1947 in that case , the legislature elected herman talmadge to serve the governor s term of his father , who had died before he could be inaugurated he seized the governor s mansion by force , over the protests of ellis g arnall , the outgoing governor , and lt govelect melvin e thompson , both of whom claimed to be the rightful governor the state supreme court removed mr talmadge after 67 days , installing mr thompson , but mr talmadge won a special election in 1948 no one imagines anything like that happening in washington , but no one expects an early resolution , either , as so many did 24 hours earlier today was a great day for mr gore had the florida supreme court sustained the lower court s ruling , his presidential hopes would have been snuffed out , or very nearly so but neither his staff nor his supporters on capitol hill deluded themselves that he was home free , or anything close to that two strikes , two outs , bottom of the ninth , and gore gets a hit , said senator richard j durbin , democrat of illinois significantly , mr durbin did not claim that mr gore had hit a grand slam , or even a solo home run
istanbul , jan 17 now that the condemned kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan has been assured that he will not be hanged , at least for the moment , he wants to take part in the incipient national dialogue about how turkey should deal with its kurdish minority but prime minister bulent ecevit has declared that mr ocalan can have no role in that dialogue , and he has urged mr ocalan to hold his tongue ocalan and his supporters are trying to dictate to the turkish government , and they are making statements with this aim , mr ecevit told a news conference this is unacceptable it would be to his advantage to keep quiet last week , mr ecevit announced that his government had decided not to carry out the death sentence given to mr ocalan after he was convicted of treason in june mr ecevit said turkey would wait until the european court of human rights had ruled on mr ocalan s appeal , which is most likely to take at least a year some politicians and relatives of soldiers killed while fighting mr ocalan s guerrillas protested the decision but most turks seemed to agree , albeit reluctantly , that it was in the national interest turkey is a candidate for membership in the european union , and european leaders strongly oppose the death penalty they have made clear that turkey s prospects for membership will be set back if mr ocalan is executed after the decision to postpone the execution had been announced , mr ocalan \( pronounced ohjalan \) issued a statement through his lawyers he called on the government to offer an amnesty to members of his kurdistan workers party it is said that if they execute me the eu candidacy , the economy and prospects for peace would all suffer , he said it is true that all of these depend on my staying alive i am a synthesis of values , not just a person i represent democracy although mr ocalan led what was originally a separatist uprising , in his statement he said i am not a separatist i have distanced myself from historical mistakes committed in the past now i am settling on the idea of unity based on freedom that is what i am fighting for we are loyal and respectful toward the unity of the state and nation , but on the basis of democracy if we are to reach peace , there is an urgent need for reform we should not be selfish , blind and unjust we have to learn to be constructive we have to trust and value each other the healing must be done together , and we must see our differences as the strength of democracy but after a 15year insurgency , few turks are ready to accept the idea that mr ocalan could become a political figure many consider him a terrorist and find it outrageous that he would presume to portray himself as a democrat government leaders are acutely aware that the public consensus that favors postponing execution is very fragile they want to avoid anything that might upset it , and evidently fear that his statements might do so since his arrest nearly a year ago , mr ocalan has been calling for reconciliation and asking his guerrillas to lay down their weapons fighting has died down considerably , and several prominent politicians have urged the government to take a new approach to kurdish issues but none has been so bold as to suggest that mr ocalan could play a role in shaping turkey s political future that idea remains an absolute taboo we cannot allow ocalan to use imrali as a political pulpit , mr ecevit said , referring to the island prison where he is being held imrali is not a podium for speeches ocalan has taken to issuing statements from there through his lawyers i want to stress that the turkish government cannot tolerate this
shocking but true we paid a guy 8250 to figure out how to plug in our dvd player i think his name was tony i'm not sure because i mostly hid in the bedroom while tony showed me up in the living room thanks largely to my technical knowhow , the dvd sat , unusable , for months it took tony about 15 seconds to determine which of the 44 or so holes marked aux and input in the back of our new 32inch flatscreen television were dvd compatible the job was so elementary , he said , he did n't want to take our money but we were adamant so for no additional fee , he showed us how the television remote could be programmed to do the work of the 16 other remotes that now took up much of the available table space in our apartment we gathered excitedly around him as he demonstrated functions we would never in a million years have thought to take advantage of ahhhhhh , my wife and i said in unison , as if we had been lost on the outskirts of tehran and just received highway directions in farsi moments after he departed , neither of us retained a word of what tony had said but what the hay this was new york , the city that never sleeps and always delivers we could always drop another 8250 on some other expert because , well , the city is teeming with them yes , friends can be pleasant in a pinch but it is strangers with skills who are the really desirable guests having no discernible household skills or talents of our own , my wife and i welcome into our domicile a wide circle of people we do n't know and since our apartment is about the size of a modest hotel suite , we like to think of these home visits not only as our contribution to the local economy , but also as something akin to room service yes , i know , other new yorkers are confirmed doityourselfers we stood by in awe as a friend virtually sacked and pillaged the local home depot for fixtures and tools with which she could renovate a bathroom \( we were also treated to a growing repertory of war stories as the project dragged on and the complications mounted \) she deserved a pat on the back when the water finally flowed flush with victory , she was yet we were not swayed i'm calling someone remained our family motto the concentration of people who know things in this city is a marvel when , for instance , my daughter s maltese , lucky , displayed incipient antisocial tendencies he urinated on everything we screamed he yawned our despair was shortlived because my wife called someone reached by cell phone , a dog trainer who made house calls was at our door within hours linda the trainer was none too impressed with our abilities to tame our sixpound indoor sprinkler a few minutes of diagnostics , and linda had his number moments later , lucky was fetching slippers , laying out the tea service and dusting down the coffee table i stood there , feeling a little stupid hey , who s the alpha male here , anyway \? i thought to myself but along with the humiliation came relief now , in the future , lucky would know exactly who was boss it was linda not all our encounters with service providers end quite so satisfactorily last fall , we decided that someone should paint and wallpaper our daughter s room my wife went the smartconsumer route and took bids the low bidder was a paintandpaper vet from canarsie , a garrulous sort who reminded me vaguely of an annoying relative my wife was filled with the joy of economizing i was filled with dread sure enough , on the appointed morning , he walked in the door and the first thing he said to me was i 'll have some coffee i rushed to the kitchen to make some cream \? i called out al i 've blocked on his name , so i will call him al had wandered into lizzie s room he was already deep into the task of determining how not to paint the room and drive me out of my mind in one easy payment of 700 uhoh , al said mildew you have mildew on the walls he pointed to a nearly invisible black dot i ca n't paint the walls in this condition a friend of mine worked on a wall with mildew , and he lost his voice for three months al promised to return some day , after the walls had been scoured with an industrialstrength cleanser that was out of stock in most hardware stores near you he did actually return several weeks later to our sterilized apartment to tell me he did n't feel well enough to work we parted as close friends oh well probably served me right by the way , does anyone out there know why my pc claims there is no cd in the cdrom drive , when in fact there is one \? never mind i'm calling someone drawing \( mark matcho \)
the fever has broken manhattan s overthetop real estate market , on a fast roll for more than four years , has lost its frenzied upward momentum and seems to be cooling down apartment hunters , who this spring seemed caught up in a grab it now before it s gone panic , no longer have that desperate urge to buy , a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry recriminations within the last two months , following a rise in interest rates and a plunge in the nasdaq , bidding wars have declined , apartments have stayed on the market longer before being sold , and hundreds have even been marked down manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off one of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the market is flat , said deborah b beck , executive vice president of the real estate board of new york in another sign of a cooling off , the real estate board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ended june 30 , compared with the same period last year a significant slowdown , ms beck said at the corcoran group , sealed bids , an indicator of unusual levels of competition , were down 33 percent in july compared with july 1999 clearly , the experts say , this is not a case of the seasonal summer blahs the market s softening is most evident with cookiecutter , ordinary apartments notably fixeruppers that had been selling for extraordinary prices over the last two years , said pamela liebman , chief executive at the corcoran group brokers cite myriad examples , including a fiveroom coop at 240 east 76th street reduced in june to 535 , 000 from 615 , 000 a onebedroom at 225 central park west near 83rd street dropped to 305 , 000 from 335 , 000 and a studio at 82 irving place fell to 175 , 000 from 190 , 000 last thursday , a twobedroom at 599 west end avenue at 89th street dropped to 349 , 000 from 369 , 000 even whiteglove gold coast prewars may become a harder sell a fiveroom penthouse at 834 fifth avenue , at 64th street , one of the city s toptier coop buildings , went on the market in april priced at 79 million in late june , it was reduced to 649 million , and on july 31 , the price dropped to 58 million the edge is off the market , said jonathan miller , president of miller samuel , the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for douglas elliman , the city s biggest brokerage firm especially during the last month , mr miller said , we 're seeing much more modest appreciation , more of a return to normalcy the experts link the slowdown to the nasdaq plunge that began on april 14 , and to the federal reserve s halfpoint interest rate increase in may , the one that really had the impact , said marilyn harra kaye , president of prudential mlbkaye realty buyers wonder if they 'll get a better deal if they wait , she said if they buy now , they worry that the higher cost of mortgages will drive prices down and lower their investment the changing statistics mirror a national trend , but there is nothing to indicate the start of a slump like the one in the late 1980 s and early 90 s real estate experts noted that prices remain high the average apartment price for the period april through june was a record 854 , 704 in manhattan south of 116th street on the west side and south of 96th street on the east but that figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before in the whitehot months of february , march and april based on contracts signed in july , mr miller projected a price rise of only 1 percent , to 864 , 000 \( the average price recorded in 1995 was 414 , 187 \) while none of the experts were willing to predict where the manhattan market would be by the end of the year , no one labeled the cooling temporary one thing seems certain one of the biggest sellers' markets in new york history has fractionally tilted more toward the buyer and the buyers are noticing for the first time in his two years of looking , tom pappas , a midtown lawyer , has spotted the same properties showing up week after week on his internet searches but he is not biting until their prices go down then , he vowed , i 'll be there buck morillas , who sold his house in east hampton , ny , and is prowling for a great 800 , 000 loft in the flatiron district , says he thinks he is getting close six months ago , the agents were saying , 'this place is going to fly tonight , so you better make an offer , ' he said now the agents are whispering , 'this place is very negotiable' for their part , brokers insist that no one is grasping at lowball offers , but they concede that now , more sellers are accepting modest reductions off the asking price in interviews , agents said that today s buyers were more cautious and that they spent more time looking , but that many did , in the end , buy and at a good price they reject comparisons to the late 1980 s , after the october 1987 stock market debacle , when the real estate market dipped albeit very slowly into the real estate recession of the early 1990 s for one thing , they say , that was the time of a glut of new , sometimes poorly built condominiums this time , developers built stronger , more lavishly detailed family apartments and lofts , which are still bringing record prices and those types of luxury apartments , brokers add , are still in short supply
arthur william dake , a chess grandmaster and one of the last of a talented crop of american players who won major competitions before world war ii , died on april 28 in reno he was 90 and lived in portland , ore mr dake had a brilliant although abbreviated career as a chess player he learned the game at 17 , very late for someone who would later become a top player by the time he was 28 , his career was essentially over as family responsibilities compelled him to look for a more stable and betterpaying job in that short time , however , mr dake had established himself as one of the country s best players , and he helped the american chess team win three world team championships mr dake was born on april 8 , 1910 , in portland when he was 16 , he went to work as a merchant seaman , sailing to japan , china and the philippines he returned to oregon in 1927 to go back to high school he learned to play chess from a russian immigrant living in a local ymca a year later , mr dake again left home to work on a ship , this time returning to new york city in 1929 the city was a hive of chess activity , and mr dake quickly immersed himself in it he joined a leading checkers player , kenneth grover , in setting up a chess and checkers stand in coney island , where they took on all comers for 25 cents a game , but their customer base dried up with the market crash in his book the bobby fischer i knew and other stories , arnold denker , another grandmaster and a lifelong friend , recalled that mr dake s diet soon narrowed down to water , coffee and green grapesbut in 1931 mr dake won the championship of the prestigious marshall chess club as a result , he was asked to play on the united states team in the 1931 world team championships in prague as the no 3 player on the team , mr dake scored five wins , two losses and seven draws , helping to lead the united states to victory mr dake would also play on united states teams that won world championships in folkestone , england , in 1933 and in warsaw in 1935 at the 1935 championships , mr dake won 13 games , drew 5 and and lost none , the best result among all the players in the event mr dake also had some notable individual successes he finished third in an international tournament in pasadena in 1932 , behind alexander alekhine , the world champion , and isaac kashdan , the best american player of the period mr dake defeated alekhine during the tournament , becoming the first american to beat the champion and inflicting one of only four tournament losses that alekhine suffered from 1927 through 1936 mr dake played in the united states championships in 1936 and 1938 , finishing tied for sixth both times , but then he quit chess to support his family , first by selling insurance and telephone directories and later by working in the department of motor vehicles in portland occasionally , he emerged from retirement to play in 1946 he participated in the second united statesussr match , drawing two games with andrei a lilienthal and in 1953 and 1955 he played in the united states open , finishing tied for 13th and 11th , respectively it was only after he retired in 1973 that mr dake again began to compete regularly , although he was no longer as formidable as in his youth in 1986 the international chess federation \( the ruling body of chess , known as fide , for federation internationale des echecs \) awarded him the title of grandmaster for his performances in the 1930 s and , in 1991 , the united states chess federation inducted him into its hall of fame mr dake met his wife , helen , on an oceanliner coming home from the united states team victory in warsaw in 1935 he wrote years later , she simply turned around and smiled at me that s all six weeks later they were married mr dake is survived by their daughter , marjorie metzger a sister , lillian and a grandson in his day , mr dake was the best american player at rapid transit chess , in which games are typically played at the rate of five minutes for each player for each game in a speed chess tournament among the best players in the country in september 1935 , mr dake won with a score of 12 wins , no losses and no draws photo the chess champion arthur dake competing against chess club members at an elementary school in portland , ore , in 1997 \( bob ellis the oregonian \)
for the first time in more than a century , the winner of a presidential election remained unknown a full day after the polls closed , as gov george w bush of texas and vice president al gore dispatched teams of lawyers to florida yesterday to wrangle over the handful of votes upon which their white house dreams now rest the fate of the two rivals appeared to ride on the verdict in florida , where an incomplete vote count had mr bush leading mr gore by 1 , 784 votes , an extraordinarily narrow margin in a nationwide race in which more than 96 million people voted his lead in florida was three onehundredths of 1 percent of the votes cast the florida secretary of state said she would probably declare a winner by the close of business today after a recount of nearly six million votes and the tallying of absentee ballots but it was far from certain that the matter would be resolved swiftly even if florida s 25 electoral votes are delivered to mr bush , democrats suggested that they would pursue complaints about voting irregularities some democrats in palm beach called for a new election in the county , saying the punchcard ballot was so perplexing that people mistakenly voted for patrick j buchanan , the reform party candidate , instead of mr gore in addition , election officials in other states with close outcomes , like iowa and wisconsin , said they were bracing for challenges with mr gore clinging to the slimmest popular vote margin in modern times , and mr bush grasping for a bare majority of electoral votes to pull him over the top , both candidates were no doubt wondering if , had they done things a bit differently , they might now be mulling over choices for their cabinet , not mulling over their job prospects still dazed by the events since tuesday , an official at the gore headquarters in nashville proclaimed breathlessly last night , we have just reached the twilight zone of american politics officials in both campaigns described the extraordinary series of events since the election as nothing short of surreal it thrust the american political system into a limbo of sorts , with mr bush and mr gore not knowing whether they should disband their campaigns , prepare to govern or retreat behind closed doors mr bush and his running mate , dick cheney , stepped out of the governor s mansion in austin , tex , yesterday afternoon to reassure their supporters , and the nation in brief remarks , mr bush said he expected the recount in florida to confirm his victory there he announced that he had called upon james a baker iii , the secretary of state in his father s administration , to travel to tallahassee , fla , to look after his interests in what had the ring of a truncated version of an acceptance speech , mr bush thanked mr gore s supporters and said , secretary cheney and i will do everything in our power to unite the nation , to call upon the best , to bring people together after one of the most exciting elections in our nation s history he said he hoped the matter was finalized as quickly as possible and in a calm and thoughtful manner later in the afternoon , mr gore and his running mate , senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut , appeared before a backdrop of american flags in nashville , where the vice president said the outcome should not be hastily determined because of what is at stake , mr gore said , this matter must be resolved expeditiously , but deliberately and without any rush to judgment he added , no matter what the outcome , america will make the transition to a new administration with dignity , with full respect for the freely expressed will of the people , and with pride in the democracy we are privileged to share while mr bush sent mr baker , mr gore said he had asked another former secretary of state , warren christopher , to join the team of lawyers representing him in florida yet for all the words about cooperation , prominent democrats made clear in private conservations that they had no intention of standing by if mr bush claimed the white house on the slimmest of margins noting that mr gore can be a scrappy street fighter , an official who is close to the campaign said , the sense is we 're going to play hardball the situation ensured that the election of 2000 would be one for the history books the popular vote margin was the closest since john f kennedy defeated richard m nixon in 1960 by about 100 , 000 votes and the electoral vote margin appeared to be the tightest since 1876 , when rutherford b hayes beat samuel j tilden by a single electoral vote the tally set off rounds of second guessing in each campaign for instance , if mr gore had won his home state , tennessee , which slipped from his grasp by only a small margin , he would have enough electoral votes to be president if a confident mr bush had not taken last sunday off , while mr gore was barnstorming the nation , the outcome might have been more decisive for him many gore advisers said they were furious at ralph nader , the green party candidate , arguing that he drained enough votes from the vice president to potentially cost him florida as president clinton celebrated his wife s victory in the new york senate race on tuesday night , he was overheard angrily denouncing mr nader , who did not capture the 5 percent of the vote needed for him to claim federal matching funds in the next election
washington , dec 18 as presidentelect george w bush visited washington today , he captured a majority of the votes that really count , those of the electoral college electors pledged to mr bush gathered in the capitals of the states he carried , while democratic electors made a more somber trip to the capitals of states carried by vice president al gore by early evening , when the counting was done , mr bush had the 271 votes he had expected mr gore had 266 , one less than he had expected , because a district of columbia elector left her ballot blank to protest washington s lack of a voting representative in congress \( the electoral votes will be officially counted in a joint session of congress on jan 5 \) after five weeks of seesawing uncertainty that did not end until last tuesday , florida cast its pivotal 25 votes for mr bush it was like , finally , we did it , mel martinez , a florida elector , said in tallahassee in the states carried by mr gore , there were fewer smiles among the electors i go down there with a heavy heart , joyce savocchio , the mayor of erie , pa , said of her trip to harrisburg the voting today took place in legislative chambers , libraries and offices in some states , it was businesslike in others , it was accompanied by music and ceremony everywhere , it was accompanied by history in previous years , the electoral college voting was usually reported with little fanfare , because once election day had come and gone there was no doubt who would move into the white house this year s election , of course , was different today s voting began with possibilities that were admittedly remote but intriguing nevertheless if mr bush lost one elector , he would still have the majority he needed but if two bush electors bolted and went to mr gore , both candidates would have 269 votes assuming mr gore held his supporters and the election would be decided in the house if three deserted mr bush and voted for mr gore , the vice president would become the first presidential nominee ever to have conceded twice before claiming victory but it was mr gore who suffered an erosion today barbara lett simmons , a gore elector from the district of columbia , left her ballot blank to protest what she called the capital s colonial status its lack of a voting representative in congress mrs simmons , a longtime democratic committeewoman , said that her heart was with mr gore and that she would have voted for him had she thought he had a chance to win she said her blank ballot did not make her a faithless elector , as electoral college nonconformists are known i would call it civil disobedience of a higher order , she said there have been faithless electors before , but none when it really mattered both parties , after all , choose candidates for elector on the basis of party service and loyalty , and no one had really expected an act of political selfimmolation today \( about half the states , and the district of columbia , nominally bind their electors to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged but election experts say such laws have never been enforced and in fact are probably unenforceable \) over the years , there have been hundreds of proposals to do away with the electoral college , which has now made mr bush president despite mr gore s capture of the popular vote but none of those proposals have gained much traction , and a change would require a constitutional amendment one expert on the electoral college , l kinvin wroth , declined today to offer a prediction on its future the safest prediction , said mr wroth , dean of the vermont law school , is that for the next couple of years there will be a lot of ink and air expended on the subject photo barbara lett simmons , the gore elector from washington , dc , who left her ballot blank in protest \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
shawn core and retina masseycore , newlyweds from athens , tex , were shopping for their first car a valentine s day gift for each other when they found a used lincoln town car at a local ford lincoln mercury dealer in 1995 with no established credit history , they were grateful when the dealer declared that they had been approved for a car loan by the ford motor credit company ford agreed to finance the cores' car at 14 percent but that is not the rate they were told they got without their knowledge , ford permitted the local dealer to add on two and a half percentage points this increased the cores' total finance charges by 466 , which ford immediately paid to the dealer this industrywide but obscure practice is called the dealer markup in today s increasingly transparent world of consumer credit , it is an anomaly , almost a throwback to an earlier era over several decades , laws and federal actions have pried open the credit process under fair housing laws , for example , all points and commissions must be specifically disclosed more recently , banks and other major lenders have spend millions of dollars on credit systems that screen out subjective bias but there is no legal requirement that car dealers or lenders must tell consumers about the role dealers play in setting the interest rate on dealerarranged car loans at the dealership , the ultimate decision about a loan s cost is left to the discretion of an employee who profits immediately by charging the highest possible rate , even though the dealer has no money at risk now this markup practice is coming under legal attack in at least five states , a joint investigation by the new york times and abc news 20 20 has found the cores are plaintiffs in one of two classaction lawsuits in texas state court seeking to have the markup declared a fraudulent and deceptive business practice if they 're going to make money off the loan , then they need to tell people , said mrs core in a recent interview a similar classaction case has been filed in california , said jack e mcgehee of houston , one of the lawyers working on the cases in new jersey , lawyers are seeking permission to expand an earlier individual case against chase manhattan into a class action litigation is also being prepared in pennsylvania , he said we 're saying that this is a huge lie , mr mcgehee said the dealers and lenders named as defendants in those cases , which include the bank of america and the ford motor credit company , described dealer markup as a legitimate business practice that in no way misleads or defrauds consumers texas courts have affirmed this position in the past , they noted dealer markups are also under attack in classaction cases pending in nashville against the general motors acceptance corporation and the nissan motor acceptance corporation , two of the nation s most prominent auto finance companies those lawsuits , filed under seal two years ago and recently made public , accuse the lenders of participating in arrangements that have resulted in black car buyers being charged higher dealer markups than whites , on average , regardless of creditworthiness there s two problems from a consumer perspective with dealer markup , said gary klein , a lawyer with the national consumer law center in boston , which is helping plaintiffs in the nashville cases the first is that it s secret the second is that there s discrimination blacks are typically charged more than whites in markup general motors acceptance , nissan motor acceptance and the local auto dealers involved in the cases deny any discriminatory practices and say the plaintiffs' claims rest on flawed statistical analysis car financing is an enormous business in 1998 , the most recent year for which the federal reserve has figures , there were more than 450 billion in car loans outstanding in america this year , according to industry surveys , about half of the 177 million new vehicles expected to be sold will be financed more than 75 percent of those loans will be arranged through car dealerships industry experts say that the money dealers make on markups part of what dealers call finance and insurance income can make the difference between profit and loss for many dealerships the national automobile dealers association and the american financial services association , which represents lenders , say that markups compensate dealers for the expense involved in offering consumers the convenience of dealerarranged financing besides providing onestop shopping for credit , dealerarranged loans also give consumers access to more sources of credit than they would have on their own , especially if they have a poor credit history , these industry groups say and they assert that the competition among lenders for each dealer s loan business keeps rates low even after dealers have added their retail markup lenders and dealers say that consumers who know their creditworthiness and the rates available from other sources can negotiate an excellent dealerarranged car loan but consumer advocates dispute that , noting it is almost impossible , short of litigation , for consumers to find out the rates at which lenders approved them for dealerarranged credit

washington , nov 2 if the race for the white house is as close as the polls suggest , the candidate who gets the most votes on tuesday may not become president of the united states this possibility exists because of the electoral college , an institution created by the founding fathers to impose stability on an infant country and , it sometimes seems , to bewilder generations of students in junior high school civics classes simply put , the votes cast on nov 7 will not really be for vice president al gore or gov george w bush they will be votes for state electors pledged to vote for mr gore or mr bush in the balloting that really counts , held on the monday after the second wednesday in december the voting this tuesday will be for people like deborah burstiondonbraye of cleveland , a republican , and reynolds honold of milwaukee , a democrat both are firsttime electors it s one of the most fantastic things i 've ever done , mrs burstiondonbraye said mr honold said he was similarly thrilled , especially since we 're going to win wisconsin ! if mr bush carries ohio and mr gore carries wisconsin , then mrs burstiondonbraye will go to columbus and mr honold to madison on dec 18 to cast their electoral votes hundreds of other electors of both parties will be traveling to their state capitals each state has a number of electoral votes according to the size of its congressional delegation \( two senators plus a varying number of representatives \) the smallest states \( and the district of columbia \) have 3 electoral votes each california has 54 there are 538 altogether , and the constitution says that whoever gets a majority becomes president the magic number is 270 both mrs burstiondonbraye and mr honold laughed off the notion of having to stay home on dec 18 and neither would acknowledge the possibility that their candidate might win in their state but lose the election in fact , the what ifs are many and intriguing taken together , they add up to a chance that whoever gets the most votes on tuesday will come up short in the electoral college and be denied the white house it would be a travesty if the winner of the popular vote on nov 7 did not become president because of the electoral college , representative ray lahood , an illinois republican and former elector , said on wednesday he and senator richard j durbin , democrat of illinois , have called for abolition of the electoral college what mr lahood and mr durbin worry about is possible because in nearly every state the electoral votes are awarded on a winnertakeall basis so it will not matter if , say , mr gore wins the popular vote in california by a thousand votes or three million he will get all the state s 54 electoral votes regardless for the same reason , a narrow victory in texas will do mr bush just as much good as a landslide he will get texas s 32 electoral votes either way the leader in the november popular vote has lost the white house three times before , most recently in 1888 for the record , the bush and gore campaigns said this week that they expect to prevail both among the people and in the electoral college michael lind , a senior fellow at the new america foundation , said that there would be a legitimacy crisis if the popularvote winner lost in the electoral college , that the next president would be deprived of the honeymoon given the new tenant in the white house other authorities on politics said much the same thing all agreed that if the balloting on tuesday produces another grover cleveland \( who captured the popular vote in 1888 but lost the electoral college , and the white house \) , there will be cries for doing away with the college eliminating the college would require a constitutional amendment if there were no college , one theory goes , candidates might be tempted to shun the smaller states \( and the sparsely populated areas within big states \) altogether as they jetted from metropolis to metropolis the people in small towns and on farms and the issues dear to them might be neglected other analysts doubt that the college affects campaign strategy that much they say that politicians go where the people are in any event , and that it is not unusual , depending on circumstances , for a region to be written off by a candidate but there is no doubt the electoral college benefits small states , giving them more power in proportion to their populations than large states have the founders created the electoral college because they thought direct , nationwide elections impractical in a land of loosely knit former colonies whose people did not know or trust each other that much and could barely communicate with one another the electoral college has been crucial in three elections in 1824 , andrew jackson was the popularvote leader among four candidates , but none got an electoral majority so the election was decided in the house \( as provided for in the constitution \) , and john quincy adams was the winner in 1876 , gov samuel j tilden of new york appeared to edge out gov rutherford b hayes of ohio in the popular vote but hayes was declared the electoral winner , and thus president , by a single vote after a prolonged dispute over the legitimacy of hayes s electors and in 1888 , president grover cleveland led in the popular vote but lost in the college and so was ousted by former senator benjamin harrison of indiana four years later , cleveland got his revenge , beating harrison unambiguously to become the only president elected to nonconsecutive terms in 2000 , there is the possibility of a 269269 tie in the electoral college that would send the decision to the newly elected house of representatives , where each state would get one vote but several experts , perhaps unwilling to contemplate that possibility , said a tie was extremely unlikely but suppose it happens \? let the pentagon decide !

the logo of the eos orchestra , an innovative ensemble that plays about a halfdozen concerts a year on the upper west side of manhattan , consists of the word eos in a dark oval the o is represented by a whole note with a fermata over it , indicating a long duration it is an optimistic symbol , given that eos is in just its sixth year but the orchestra hit the ground running in 1995 , with concerts devoted to music of the american writer and composer paul bowles , and has continued to unearth attractive and littleknown music ever since in fact , its success has been such that it is now starting to imitate itself last april , eos gave a program of six 10minute operas by 20thcentury composers , which earned praise from the audience and from critics on thursday and friday , at the society for ethical culture , near lincoln center , the orchestra will try to make lightning strike twice with six 10minute operas ii , this time with composers from monteverdi to milhaud and the premiere of a new work , again , by jake heggie back to that logo the musical sign for a pause , or fermata , looks like a crescent arcing over a dot it could symbolize a sunrise , and the eos orchestra is indeed named for the ancient greek goddess of dawn but it could also suggest a famous image from the movies \( cue the theme from '2001' excuse me , strauss s also sprach zarathustra \) all such associations seem to fit eos , which is as likely to perform a film score by bernard herrmann or john corigliano as a concerto grosso by handel soloists with eos may have to wear anything from a tuxedo to feathers , as the occasion dictates eos s publicity materials and printed programs , with their hip , arty look , resemble a downtown gallery catalog more than the typical subscription brochure the guiding principle in programming seems to be , surprise me and if you 're having trouble figuring it all out , eos will sometimes publish a book of essays to accompany a concert it may be a kind of enterprise that could have been thought up only by a harvard alumnus with connections to the art scene , broadway and hollywood that description , at least , applies to jonathan sheffer , the 46yearold composer and conductor who founded eos after studying with leonard bernstein and leon kirchner , mr sheffer , who was born in new york , seemed headed for a career as a hollywood film composer and he has kept a hand in films and theater , having conducted the recording of elliot goldenthal s score for the recent film titus and written the music and libretto for the musical blood on the dining room floor , which runs through next sunday at the wpa theater in new york but while recording movie scores with the seattle symphony , he discovered his urge to conduct he made his podium debut with the san diego symphony in 1991 and assisted michael tilson thomas at the london symphony and the orchestre national de france still , the traditional conductorial career path of working up through junior positions at established orchestras was not for mr sheffer he was beginning to have a lot of ideas about finding and performing neglected music , adding visual appeal to concerts and presenting orchestral music in an intimate space that would , in his words , include the audience in the event so with seed money from a sixfigure check from the disney corporation for a film score of his that it did n't use , as well as inherited wealth , he took the road less traveled , and formed his own orchestra the bowles concerts in 1995 set the tone for the orchestra , mr sheffer said recently i spent a year as a sort of amanuensis to bowles , and i found that i greatly enjoyed discovering the music the concerts attracted attention because the composer , an american expatriate living in morocco , who has since died , was in attendance , visiting the united states for the first time in more than 40 years eos s reputation was made , as were mr sheffer s artistic interests there are as many reasons for conductors to travel the entrepreneurial road as there are maestros on it jens nygaard , a peppery selfdescribed maverick from stephens , ark , has conducted his jupiter symphony in new york since 1979 he has few kind words , or even printable ones , for most of the city s arts administrators and critics , seeing himself , he said recently , as a good man who was blocked out by the system and a missionary at heart he cited racially integrated concerts he conducted in south africa during the apartheid era and benefit concerts he organized for earthquake victims in kobe , japan , among his proudest moments mr nygaard has conducted marathon performances of beethoven s symphonies and mozart s piano concertos the kind of thing no board of directors would ever approve , he said and he has a yen for musical archaeology , having presented , for example , entire programs of music by the danish romantic composer niels gade he thus has something in common with mr sheffer , whose concerts he has attended i'm very much in sympathy with what the eos orchestra is doing , mr nygaard said it s very interesting work , and i support it completely

residents around lake pocotopaug , in east hampton , say they realized something was terribly wrong when tens of thousands of dying fish seemed to be desperately trying to escape the waters of the state s largest natural lake several days later , sea gulls descended on the 511acre lake , gorging themselves on the dead fish piled up on the shore the streams below the lake were choked with dead and dying fish , said blake kauffman , 38 , a lifelong lakeside resident who was one of the first people to notice the stressed fish late last month there was something so unbelievable , so disturbing about it the dieoff , which seemed to stop around jan 12 , included every species of fish in the lake white perch , yellow perch , catfish , carp , smallmouth bass , largemouth bass , pickerel and sunfish the lake s only crustaceans , crayfish , were not affected i 've never heard about anything like this ever having happened before , said another longtime resident , former governor william a o'neill scientists determined that the fish suffocated when their gills were quickly and catastrophically damaged and clogged with mucus but scientists say they do n't know what set off the problem the only thing we 're sure of is it s not the usual thing that causes a fish kill , said dr richard french , a university of connecticut animal pathologist fish kills can occur in winter when a body of fresh water that is home to many fish is completely sealed off by thick ice , dr french said the fish will eventually use up all the dissolved oxygen and food and die but nothing like this happened at lake pocotopaug the lake did n't become covered with ice until after the fish kill and the fish did not suffocate because of a lack of oxygen , he said freshwater fish kills happen in the summer when bacterial infections proliferate in warm water , said dr french none of the bacteria or pathogens associated with fish kills have been found in lake pocotopaug , and there is no known pathogen that would affect all species of fish in the lake there was an algal bloom in the summer , but toxins that could be produced by such a bloom have not been found in the lake , dr french says nor has any pollution or synthetic toxin been found , he said all the likely suspects have been looked at , said chuck phillips , a fishery biologist with the state department of environmental protect s inland fisheries division the lake has been examined to see whether the water is too acidic or too alkaline , whether there are toxic levels of heavy metals , whether there are pesticides or other poisons in the water nothing has been found that would account for the fish kill , he said there have been significant algal blooms in the lake for 10 years , with particularly heavy blooms in 1998 , said east hampton s town manager , alan bergren but the algal blooms have never hurt the fish , said mr bergren , 38 , who is also a lifelong lakeshore resident the fishing has gotten better over the last 10 years mr bergren also said there was no significant septic pollution of the lake , which is served by a municipal sewer system the only comfort i can find in all this is that the best scientists in the country are looking into it , mr bergren said one of the scientists , dr french , is the lead investigator of another dieoff that has decimated the lobster fishery in long island sound scientists from the us fish and wildlife service s fish pathology laboratory in leetown , w va , are also investigating the lake pocotopaug fish kill deputy environmental commissioner david leff said the only thing they lobster dieoff and the fish kill have in common is they pose huge challenges to the investigating scientists since they inevitably involve many complex , interrelated environmental and ecological factors , and many scientific disciplines these events by their very nature require investigators to push the envelope of science while the challenge may be exhilarating for scientists , the mystery is no comfort at all to the lake s residents you ca n't help but to be scared by all this , said mike fenton , who lives on the lake s shore with his wife , sandy , and daughters alexandra , 2 , and christina , 9 months you have to ask yourself whether you should let your kids swim in the lake in the summer we 're being told by the town to collect the dead fish and put them in the trash but is it a good idea to even touch the dead fish \? photos mike fenton , shown with his wife , sandy , said he wondered if it was even safe to swim in lake pocotopaug in east hampton , where dead fish had been washing ashore earlier this month , upper left below left , the state department of health has posted a warning about fishing in the lake scientists still do n't know what caused the fish to die \( photographs by carla m cataldi for the new york times \)

marcel proust by jeanyves tadie translated by euan cameron illustrated 986 pp new york viking 40 marcel proust a life by william c carter illustrated 946 pp new haven yale university press 35 about a third of the way through proust s sevenvolume novel , la recherche du temps perdu , the hero finally gets to kiss the girl having tried before and been angrily rebuffed , he gazes at albertine s rosepink cheeks and longs for a more intimate knowledge of their scent and savor but the maneuver proves problematic the target begins to break up as my lips made their short journey toward her cheek , i saw 10 different albertines it is too late to abort the mission , but the instruments are failing alas for , when it comes to kissing , our nostrils and our eyes are as poorly situated as our lips are poorly fashioned suddenly my eyes ceased to see , then my nose was crushed in the collision and lost its capacity to smell , and , while yet not one jot advanced in my desire to know the taste of this rosiness , i understood from these hateful signs that i was at last engaged in the act of kissing albertine s cheek the human being , he wistfully reflects , may be a less rudimentary creature than the sea urchin or even the whale , but we do lack a number of essential organs and notably possess none that will serve for kissing all we can do is substitute our lips and thereby arrive perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if we were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk a simple kiss becomes as complex as a lunar landing , thanks to proustian writing at its most characteristic simultaneously perceptive \( and here bringing to mind the cubism of picasso s demoiselles d'avignon \) , funny \( and performing the novel s timehonored role of ironizing romance \) and symbolic the desire to know sensually , emotionally , intellectually propels us on a journey fraught with vertiginous perspectives , and truth is an elusive destination earlier in the novel the narrator undergoes a similar experience during a carriage ride from a distance the two church steeples of martinvillelesec and the single steeple of vieuxvicq look like birds perching motionless on the horizon but as he draws near and subsequently departs , they realign themselves in a startling choreography and finally merge into a single dark shape before vanishing into the dusk as we move through time , the future offers prospects upon which habit , prejudice or the illusions of desire confer a deceptive fixity as we embrace reality in the present , those fond prospects fragment into a bewildering and promiscuous array , which in turn is transformed by retrospect into a stable but now quite different pattern this is proust s kaleidoscopic vision , so cleverly reproduced in raul ruiz s recent film of time regained , the final volume of la recherche du temps perdu as the performance of a sonata for piano and violin nears its end , the camera tracks and pans from right to left and left to right across the rows of the princesse de guermantes s seated guests and as it does so , some of these rows themselves move independently from left to right and right to left , only ceasing their movement after the camera itself has come to rest but simultaneously with the recital and so how shall a biographer embrace the reality of marcel proust \? the first task and both these fine biographers succeed admirably in this is to explode the terrible myths that cling like barnacles to the person of this highly intelligent and original writer the cliches of the neurotic hypochondriac insomniac snob , of the drama queen and mommy s boy who lived by night and slept by day , rarely venturing from the bed in his corklined room the second task is to be minded of proust s own convictions one , that the only way to escape from the prison of one s subjective vantage point is to see the world through the eyes of an artist who has the technical means successfully to express the artist s own way of perceiving the world \( in words , music , paint or whatever \) and two , that the best way to understand an artist s work is not to look at the life of the artist \( as the great 19thcentury critic saintebeuve had done \) but to analyze the themes , structures and images with which the artist s work articulates a unique vision of the world here we have a problem , which jeanyves tadie addresses squarely in his preface is biography therefore redundant \? and what happens if , as in the case of proust , the artist s masterpiece happens itself to be the story of a life , the quasiautobiographical account of a wouldbe writer who believes his time to have been wasted on parties and ephemeral amours only to discover that he does after all have a vocation and the talent to write a novel about time \? for more than 30 years the standard biography of proust has been that of george d painter \( two volumes , 1959 and 1965 \) , which itself supplanted andre maurois s quest for proust \( 1949 \) but proust scholarship has moved on since painter s day , notably with the publication of philip kolb s magisterial 21volume edition of the correspondence \( 197093 \) , comprising more than 5 , 000 letters , and of the fourvolume pleiade edition of la recherche du temps perdu , under the general editorship of tadie \( 198789 \) this exhaustive edition draws on the manuscript drafts for the published novel \( itself more than 3 , 000 pages long \) , which are contained in 75 school notebooks and run to more than 7 , 000 pages \( not to mention the typescripts and the multiple proofs \) there have also been memoirs and eyewitness accounts , most famously that of celeste albaret \( monsieur proust , 1973 \) , the housekeepercumsecretary who looked after the writer during the last eight years of his life the closer the scholar gets to proust , the more prousts there are !
in another sign of how extensively cocacola plans to overhaul the sales and marketing of its soft drinks , the company will disband the unconventional inhouse advertising agency that has led the way in creating campaigns for its flagship brand the decision to close edge creative , the upstart agency that has had cocacola as its sole client since 1991 , and to reassign its responsibilities to traditional madison avenue shops is indicative of the significant shifts the company is making in response to pressure from competitors and investors at a muchanticipated meeting with wall street analysts in new york today , cocacola intends to outline details of its makeover and make a slight revision downward of its estimates for soft drink growth , which have long been deemed overly optimistic in the face of challenges from other beverages like tea , water and juice drinks doug daft is basically out to recreate the company with changes that are broad based and widespread , said john d sicher , editor and publisher of beverage digest in bedford hills , ny , an industry newsletter that has closely followed the cocacola revamping under douglas n daft , the new chief executive the changes are as significant or more significant than any cocacola has gone through in decades , mr sicher said a year or two from now , it will be a very different company edge creative was a groundbreaking alliance of cocacola , the world s largest soft drink marketer , and michael ovitz , who had been chairman of the powerful hollywood talent agency , the creative artists agency the goal of the joint venture best known for producing the always cocacola campaign that ran from 1993 to 1999 and inventing the popular polar bear characters was to shake up the sales pitches for the bestselling cocacola brand , known as cocacola classic in north america and cocacola elsewhere around the world madison avenue was stunned in 1992 when edge creative won the creative oversight of the flagship brand from a mainstream ad agency , mccannerickson worldwide , a unit of the mighty interpublic group of companies that had handled that assignment for almost 40 years there was widespread speculation the shift would influence other giant marketers to look beyond the rosters of their traditional agencies in seeking different ways to peddle familiar consumer products while virtually no other big advertisers followed cocacola in redefining the usual agencyclient relationship , marketers in general are now far more willing to entertain concepts from other sources , ranging from consulting companies to web site developers to specialists in tasks like direct marketing and sales promotion the model of having fresh creative resources looking at a big brand like coke will continue , said ian rowden , who oversees advertising for the company from atlanta with the title of vice president for consumer communications in the cocacola marketing division i'm really pleased with what we did , making two or three hundred ads together , mr rowden said we had highs and lows along the way , as you always do with ads , but it enabled us to get a fresh perspective on the brand mr rowden and the three principals of edge creative , in separate telephone interviews , attributed the agency s closing , as of may 1 , to a decision by the principals to tackle what they described as new challenges i thought this would last a couple years and it s lasted eight , said shelly hochron , a principal at edge creative in santa monica , calif all in all , it was a good relationship , but it s time to move on this is not the group that ate madison avenue , she added i heard the criticisms , but coke had a need for a spark of change the substantive reorganization of cocacola under mr daft including a decentralization of the operational and marketing functions to give local managers more authority , the elimination of 6 , 000 jobs and the closing of the company s retail outlets seemed to inspire the edge creative executives to rethink their plans you see all these changes going on around you and it s a trigger , said jack harrower , the second principal , who is married to ms hochron you feel you need to branch out edge creative began as a division of creative artists when mr ovitz left the talent agency to join the walt disney company in 1995 , the coke account followed , as did ms hochron , mr harrower and the third partner , len fink the abrupt departure of mr ovitz from disney did not affect the cocacola ties with edge creative we were partners with cocacola in a way like none i 've ever seen , and it has been a fabulous ride , mr fink said it was much more successful than i ever imagined in the beginning it would be , but at this point we need to explore other things the three edge creative principals declined to discuss specifically what they might do next , but all have worked for madison avenue agencies in the past , and mr fink was an early advocate of high technology and computers
the mosquitoes are plotting their return they are laying their eggs in salt marshes , in birdbaths , in untended garden pots and in backyard puddles and in a matter of weeks , millions will hatch , take to the air and begin their hunt for blood none of this would be cause for alarm except for last year s outbreak of west nile encephalitis , a deadly virus spread by the bite of a mosquito so officials across the island have started to roll out their antimosquito measures \( including chickens used as a kind of early warning system in suffolk \) the efforts have been expanded significantly since last year , when widespread spraying of pesticides angered environmentalists and homeowners who were caught outdoors when insecticides rained down the virus killed seven people and caused brain infections in 62 others in the metropolitan region last year six nassau residents contracted the disease , and one died no humans fell ill suffolk , but nine horses died and dead birds were found with the disease across the county no one knows how widespread west nile might be this year , but the virus has already been found in dormant adult mosquitoes in queens and in a redtailed hawk that died in westchester in february officials in nassau and suffolk have said that pesticides would be sprayed only if absolutely necessary and stressed that they are combating mosquitoes in the larval stage to reduce spraying both counties have increased efforts to get homeowners to do their share by clearing their properties of stagnant water state officials have helped coordinate efforts and will analyze hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes to determine how widespread the west nile virus is suffolk county , which has long had an extensive mosquitocontrol program in its broad salt marshes , has expanded its staff for mosquito control and virus detection to 55 people , from 35 perhaps its most innovative program the first in the region involves using six dozen chickens as bait they will be set out in coops across the county so their blood can be drawn and checked every two weeks to test for the west nile virus it s a very good means of surveillance , said dr scott r campbell , the county entomologist and head of the county laboratory studying mosquitoborne diseases the chickens will be out there seven days a week , as opposed to deploying mosquito traps in the same locations , which can only be done one day at a time dr campbell said workers were still scouting sites for the coops , which will not be in place until early june he said the chickens , even if bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus , would not die from the disease workers in both counties will begin setting out more traditional mosquito traps in a week or two the traps , which use lights and carbon dioxide to attract the bugs , are usually set out before dusk and collected the next morning the mosquitoes , which are alive when sucked into a bag , are sorted by species , frozen and sent to albany for testing more than 40 species of mosquito can be found on the island , but so far only the common house mosquito has been found to carry the west nile virus mosquitoes feed on the blood of birds and mammals and usually home in on their prey by searching for carbon dioxide emitted when the bird or mammal exhales gregory f terrillion , mosquitocontrol supervisor for nassau , said the county would soon be sending samples from 40 traps every week to state officials for testing , up from 10 traps last year suffolk officials will send samples from 35 traps each week analysis of the mosquitoes will help officials determine whether pesticide is warranted , and how much also in the next week , nassau and suffolk will begin to seek mosquito larvae and start spreading larvicides , which generally are not opposed by environmentalists because they do not harm other life forms nassau county workers will monitor and apply larvicides to some 50 ponds , 200 miles of freshwater streams , 650 storm drains and 70 , 000 street basins suffolk officials plan to inspect 15 , 000 breeding sites and treat 25 , 000 acres with larvicides they also plan to make sure water flows smoothly through wetlands by cleaning 750 , 000 feet of ditches we ca n't assure people yet that there wo n't be any spraying this year , said dr clare b bradley , the suffolk county health commissioner hopefully , prevention will work and we wo n't need to , but we 'll have to take things one day at a time nassau officials started distributing 80 , 000 pamphlets last week telling homeowners how they can curb mosquitoes , including such commonsense measures as removing all stagnant water around the house , keeping pools chlorinated , changing water in birdbaths every few days and keeping window screens in good shape suffolk officials noted that mosquitosurveillance efforts that were started when eastern equine encephalitis arrived in the county in the early 1990 s helped to limit the amount of spraying last year in 1996 , when public parks were closed because of the threat of the encephalitis , pesticides were sprayed over 100 , 000 acres in the county but last year , when the west nile virus surfaced , mosquito trapping helped narrow the spraying area to less than 64 , 000 acres
henry blodget s words used to add rocket fuel to the new economy yesterday , mr blodget , merrill lynch s star internet analyst , reentered the atmosphere , downgrading 10 of the 29 companies he recommends we are resetting the investment ratings for our internet universe , mr blodget wrote in a report four months after the start of the april bloodbath that halted the internet s unfettered charge , one of the most reliable of internet bulls is finally showing signs of doubt mr blodget , 34 , is considered one of the internet sector s two premier analysts , along with mary meeker of morgan stanley dean witter last month , ms meeker showed a speck of caution when she raised her losspershare estimates for amazoncom , but she stopped short of a downgrade mr blodget has countered with a raft of downgrades , but yesterday they barely registered across the sector thestreetcom internet index gained 407 percent , and several names mr blodget downgraded surged forward why \? maybe because of how far they have already fallen the analyst , who once led the market up , now appears to be following it down this has not been a banner year for mr blodget , even by the recent anemic standards of internet investors of the 29 stocks he covers , 11 of the companies are new to the group this year the other 18 stocks , which he has covered all year , are down an average of 542 percent in 2000 thestreetcom internet index is down 338 percent over the same period since april , internet mutual funds have been entrenched as the worst performing among all domestic fund categories comparing an analyst s picks to a mutual fund has its flaws , but it can be useful for a rough picture mr blodget s average return ranks behind even the worstperforming domestic mutual fund , jacob internet , down 514 percent only one of his 18 picks , inktomi , has gained this year six have lost more than 70 percent of their value etoys has lost 843 percent the market is no longer giving some companies the benefit of the doubt , said mr blodget in an interview we 're acknowledging that the sector is so volatile that it s made some of the ratings meaningless figuring heavily into the resetting of mr blodget s downgraded names were ecommerce stocks perhaps the fact that thestreetcom ecommerce index had already fallen 655 percent for the year when the day began meant that there was not much more room for the group to tumble some did fall buycom dropped by 161 percent others soared doubleclick , the internet advertising firm , gained 98 percent after mr blodget s downgrade ivillage , the beleaguered portal aimed at women that mr blodget downgraded to accumulate from accumulate buy , gained 48 percent and barnesandnoblecom soared 384 percent after it struck a deal with microsoft to create an online store for digital books another factor could be that mr blodget s report was far from a stark reappraisal of the sector s prospects the purpose of the reset is not to make a new 'call' on the direction of the group , the report said , but to provide a more precise differentiation of our current opinions \( by using a wider range of ratings \) for those who actually followed his recommendations , it might come as cold comfort that mr blodget has decided to add a new word to his lexicon of ratings before yesterday , his ratings have all been combinations of one of two words , either buy or accumulate , which is more tepid than a buy recommendation now mr blodget has added the word neutral to his repertoire previously , none of the 29 internet stocks mr blodget covered merited a neutral rating neutral , according to merrill lynch , means that it is not clear when a company will be profitable and that significant uncertanties or reservations remain in plain english though analysts rarely admit as much it is roughly analagous to a thumbs down from roger ebert i think he s trying to say , 'look , there are a handful of companies that are going to be stellar those are the yahoos and aol s and maybe inktomi , ' said james houlton , manager of the strong internet fund so which companies picked up the neutral rating \? yesterday , etoys , the online toy seller , was downgraded from an accumulate buy rating to neutral barnesandnoblecom fared slightly better , downgraded from accumulate buy rating to neutral buy what is focused on now is profitability , said mr blodget i think we have been very vocal about the stage of the industry s development we suggested as far back as last july that this was going to a rough time in december of 1998 , when the internet was still something of a novelty item , mr blodget predicted amazoncom would climb to 400 a share his prediction made him the butt of jokes in some quarters , until amazon hit 400 a few weeks later soon after , mr blodget left his job at cibc oppenheimer for a blue chip post at merrill lynch his picks became a guide for some investors looking for a roadmap to the new economy this year , the road has become less travelled in an emerging sector like this , he said , you are going to make mistakes picking stocks chart mostly bad bets the change in price of stocks henry blodget of merrill lynch has recommended since the start of the year 24 7 media yeartodate change 821 amazoncom yeartodate change 556 america online yeartodate change 301 barnesandnoblecom yeartodate change 634 cmgi yeartodate change 717 doubleclick yeartodate change 695 etoys yeartodate change 843 excite home yeartodate change 650 homestore yeartodate change 555 infospace yeartodate change 433 inktomi yeartodate change 252 internet capital group yeartodate change 795 ivillage yeartodate change 667 priceline yeartodate change 420 quokka yeartodate change 538 real networks yeartodate change 286 yahoo ! yeartodate change 369 webvan yeartodate change 720 \( source bloomberg financial markets \) \( pg c10 \)
for those of us who remember a time before pimply dotcom billionaires and gatesian wealth , the recent passing of saul steinberg s longtime investment company , reliance group holdings , marks the end of an era weighted down by debt , mr steinberg sold reliance to a competitor , the leucadia national corporation , for pennies on the dollar sold as well was mr steinberg s palatial park avenue apartment , thought to be the largest in manhattan , as well as its contents , including many of the fine paintings and draperies that once hung on its walls and , let s not forget , a multimilliondollar commode made of rococogilded bronze the 80 s , an era when financial alchemy brought jawdropping wealth to a generation of wall streeters , can now be safely said to be over for the last 15 years or so , mr steinberg was an oversized symbol of a decade whose legacy will forever be debated by economists and historians in fact , mr steinberg s reputation was built largely through his groundbreaking but failed attempt to take over chemical bank in 1969 , a precursor to 80 sstyle corporate raids that run enshrined him in wall street lore , vividly illustrating to a generation of hungry young men what could be accomplished with a modest amount of cash and a large dose of moxie but in the 1980 s , aside from collecting 60 million in greenmail , which disney paid him to go away in 1984 , mr steinberg mostly stayed on the sidelines , watching as corporate raiders like carl icahn , t boone pickens and ron perelman engaged in a financial fox hunt that sent hundreds of american companies scurrying for the woods , baying investment bankers on their heels it was what mr steinberg did with his wealth that so aptly capsulized the era it was n't just the apartment , once owned by john d rockefeller , with its scarletandgold dining room and sevenfigure tchotchkes his third wife , gayfryd , was conspicuously young his parties were legend for his 50th birthday party in 1989 , models were dressed as figures in old masters paintings you get the picture his sad fate could be taken as yet another lesson on the hollow nature of 1980 s wealth , especially when compared to the wealth of the 1990 s this new era has brought a good deal of speculative excess , of course , as is the nature of wall street raw capitalism is not pretty but whatever one thinks of the current excesses in stock valuations , it s undeniable that the latest billionaires actually helped build something in this case the internet and all its attendant new technology the same ca n't be said for the 1980 s the billions of dollars made from corporate raids and leveraged buyouts \( in an lbo , a public company s shareholders are bought out using the company itself as collateral \) were about nothing more than paper shuffling when companies were cracked open like piggy banks , or split up like pizzas to reduce the debt , was anyone really surprised the parts were worth more than the whole \? in these exercises , no breakthrough products were created , no edisons were uncovered is there some geewhiz product out there that mr steinberg s insurance company engineered \? i doubt it from the very first such deals , there was a sense it was all a shell game , that there was something patently wrong about wealth created by tearing apart companies rather than building them up , by firing , or downsizing , workers rather than hiring them yet even the harshest critics of corporate raids would probably acknowledge that at the dawn of the 1980 s too many american companies were overstuffed , overperked and none too sympathetic to the desires of their shareholders put aside all the envy , all the sniping about goldplated cabinetry , and mr steinberg and his ilk were agents of change , pure and simple they were wolves clearing out the stragglers , forcing the other animals to get into fighting trim true , they inflicted a great deal of pain , but financial darwinism has never been for the squeamish for those who handle such unpleasant tasks , there is a classic american arc in 1982 , at the beginning of the raider era , the men who launched hostile takeover attempts were lauded as american folk heroes when they first took to the floors of annual meetings , gordon gekkostyle , to attack the bloated old boys' networks that ran too many large companies , people actually cheered while mr pickens and others stormed the ramparts , henry kravis and other buyout artists , were standing by in boardrooms , rescuing the raiders' frightened prey by taking them private with velvet gloves of course the raiders finally went too far in 1988 , the unseemly freeforall for control of rjr nabisco triggered a backlash that killed the golden goose afterward it got ugly , as these things usually do , with a barrage of insidertrading and securitiesfraud indictments and prison sentences for the untoward and the unlucky but many of the raiders , mr steinberg included , now had publicly owned companies tucked under their arms to manage , and it s been informative to see how many of them proved unable to follow through on the promises they made at those bygone annual meetings mr pickens was unceremoniously ousted from control of his company , the former mesa petroleum , in a shareholder uprising mr perelman s company , revlon , is a stockmarket laggard mr steinberg s reliance group flirted with bankruptcy for years before the last air finally eased from its balloon the intriguing question is to what degree the winnowing and strengthening of the 80 s set the stage for the explosive growth of the 90 s it s a matter best left to economists , but one suspects it is no accident that a slew of large noninternet companies , from walmart to gillette itself a target of hungry raiders during the 1980 s embarked on rapid growth and stockprice rises in the 1990 s would they have done so had raiders like mr steinberg not frightened them into shaping up \? it would be the richest irony to argue that saul steinberg begat bill gates i wo n't but one should also not reach the facile conclusion that mr steinberg s story is simply a fitting end for an era in which ruthless corporate raiders destroyed corporations and laid off tens of thousands of employees then again , it is very , very difficult to envision a day when mr gates would be forced to auction off his livingroom drapes drawing
seeking to prevent repeats of the erroneous projections that made election night such an embarrassment for the networks , officials of abc news said yesterday that they would no longer call a contest in any state until all of its polls had closed and would try to insulate their analysts from competitive pressures to project a winner prematurely on election night , abc news was the last of the major networks to call a winner in the presidential race in florida , and yesterday it became the first to announce some preliminary results of the investigation into what went wrong early on the evening of nov 7 , the networks declared vice president al gore the winner in florida four hours later , they reversed themselves and called the state for gov george w bush both calls , which some network executives later acknowledged were based on faulty data and misleading returns , had to be retracted the projections prompted a louisiana congressman to promise congressional hearings on the activities of the voter news service the service , which conducts surveys of voters leaving the polls and collects raw vote totals , is a joint operation of the networks and the associated press all the networks have announced internal reviews of their electionprojection systems and of vns , as it is widely known the networks were not alone in making erroneous calls after the election as the results of florida trickled in , the new york times printed more than 100 , 000 copies of its nov 8 issue declaring that mr bush had apparently won , and other newspapers made similar calls none of abc s preliminary findings dealt directly with how the erroneous numbers had come to be disseminated and though some in academia and government have raised questions about the desirability of the networks' sharing information from a single source , abc officials pointed out that the vns record for accuracy over the years had been strong paul friedman , executive vice president and managing editor of abc news , said , i think we should not lose sight of the fact that this is a system that has worked remarkably well , with remarkably few errors among the most significant positions enumerated by the network was the vow to withhold projections until all the polls in a given state had closed florida s panhandle , which stretches far west of the peninsula , is in the central , rather than eastern , time zone , and so the polls there remain open an hour later than the rest of the state on election night , many of the networks had called the state for mr gore beginning about 7 50 pm , 10 minutes before the polls closed in nearly a dozen panhandle counties bush campaign officials argue that the projection depressed their turnout in those counties in the closing minutes , and those votes might have been decisive abc news officials note that theirs was the only network that did not call florida until after the 8 pm closing in the panhandle , an alsoran status that would not normally have been a point of pride for the network still , mr friedman said , the issue of calling a state with a divided time zone has always been a bone of contention , and the decision should put the question to rest the network said it was also addressing the problem of how to deal with the pressure to call elections after competing decision desks had already projected winners mr friedman said , for instance , that abc would no longer allow televisions in the rooms in which its teams of electionnight analysts were making projections if for 10 to 20 minutes you see the other network guy up there making george bush the next president , it gets a little tough , he said , adding that efforts would also be made to curb excitable producers from contacting analysts and applying extra pressure abc s rivals are in various stages of their own examinations this week , for instance , cnn named three outside observers to assist in its internal review ben j wattenberg , senior fellow at the american enterprise institute joan konner , former dean of the columbia university s school of journalism , and james v risser , former director of the john s knight journalism fellowships at stanford university nbc , cbs and fox are also conducting reviews of their own
the russians are not , as the old movie would have it , coming they have gone some have just slammed the door on america the country where , as one of them put it , his russian friends have become slaves to the dollar and have gone back home , to moscow , to st petersburg , to kiev and by voicing just what they feel about this place , they have left in their wake a small but impassioned debate about how russians really view america it was a furor that journalists at the russian bazaar , a weekly newspaper based in bensonhurst , brooklyn , scarcely expected when they published an article last month titled why they are leaving in the story , valentin labunsky , a 49yearold journalist from kiev who has been in america four years , wrote at great length about the complaints of three departing immigrants a 24yearold female student , a 30yearold male journalist and a 50yearold former headmaster broadly speaking , the three , who had been in america from one to four years , bemoaned the obsession with materialism , the emptiness of conversation , the ugliness and what the student deemed the utter treelessness of their part of brooklyn , and the functionality and inelegance of what she branded the american uniform , jeans and sneakers above all , they lamented the lack of what russians call dukhovnost , the spiritual dimension of life the headmaster from st petersburg , his wife , a translator of german literature in russia but retrained here as a bank teller and their son , who became a computer programmer , depicted a fouryear struggle to establish themselves in new york city when , finally , they had a halfway decent apartment , good jobs , a car , had paid off their debts and even had some money to spare , he said , we suddenly found a terrible emptiness inside there , in st petersburg , we lived poorly , but to the full , continued the headmaster , ilya , who like other russians in the article would give only his first name \( mr labunsky said all three feared that giving their full names could lead to trouble with the immigration and naturalization service , in part because they have green cards entitling them to live in the united states \) suddenly deprived of their full spiritual life , we really realized that human beings do not live by bread alone , the headmaster added when we were struggling here to survive , we did n't think about this but when we had finally staggered to our feet , we started to look for america s dukhovnost and we just could n't find it i do n't want to heap dirt on america , a country that accepted us as its own but neither i , nor my family , could accept the values of this world , all their serials , their humor , their tv and not because it s worse than ours it just is n't ours none of the criticisms voiced in the twopage article were especially new but they were apparently striking for many of the one million russian speakers in new york , new jersey and connecticut and for others across the country nothing prepared mr labunsky or his boss , natasha nakhankova , for the avalanche of reaction from readers their paper , which prints just more than 10 , 000 copies a week and , they say , has a readership of some 40 , 000 , received a flood of phone calls and 237 long , handwritten letters in one week , some from as far away as california they printed pages of the most articulate letters , along with forceful rebuttals to the three departees in a series by mr labunsky titled why we are staying most of the letters , especially those written by emigres who went through the horrors of leaving the soviet union in the 1970 s and 1980 s , were passionate paeans to america as ms nakhankova , 44 , concluded in an editorial , the discussion has shown how dear america is to most of us , what patriots we have become today , we , who so recently thought that the very word patriotism was something dreamed up by communist propagandists the outpouring of gratitude for the assistance given to many emigres and the chance to build a good life was the stuff of a white house speechwriter s dreams scattered among the letters , however , was isolated support for those who decided to go back a woman who signed herself simply vita said the stories of the departing immigrants had made her weep because everything they say is the purest truth after six years in america , she indicated , she would not return to russia , but her estrangement even now from america was plain voicing sentiments that are common enough among arrivals from the former soviet union though not , generally , among their children , educated here she complained bitterly about the bad treatment caseworkers give exsoviets asking for welfare , about the loud music of her neighbors and the continual worries about making ends meet immigration , she concluded , is like moving a flower that should live in black earth to sandy soil it is still alive , but with each day it withers , and finally it stops blooming , and all that remains is a coarse stem
the verificationist by donald antrim 179 pp new york alfred a knopf 21 like cell phones and palm pilots and mp3 music players , donald antrim s novels are slim enough to stuff into your back pocket they 're also so nifty that , as with those gadgets , you ca n't spend much time with them without fighting a destructive urge you want to flip them over , crack open the back and expose the complicated microhydraulics inside if you could actually yank the control box from one of antrim s busily cerebral novels , god knows what you 'd find in there bats , maybe an audiocassette edition of the encyclopaedia britannica , recited by monty python and probably the shrunken heads of thomas pynchon , nicholson baker , edgar allan poe and donald barthelme , writers whose dna seems to have bled into antrim s own describing antrim s books can make them sound jangly and selfconscious or , worse , like examples of the kind of cheapo surrealism that barthelme himself once scorned antrim s first novel , elect mr robinson for a better world \( 1993 \) , was a slice of sulfurous whimsy about a suburban town in which neighbors dig moats around their houses and arm themselves with stinger missiles his second , the hundred brothers \( 1997 \) , was about , quite literally , 100 brothers who gather one night in their family s dilapidated library to eat , drink and viciously settle old scores what kept you reading these books was n't just antrim s manic wit or his cruelly cheerful inventiveness , though those things alone will take you a long way \( there s a moment in elect mr robinson that i 've never been able to shake , one in which a man is drawn and quartered by four neighbors , who lash his limbs to the bumpers of their cars and then drive off in different directions that i remember this as a comic scene says more about antrim , i hope , than it does about me \) more important , you 're drawn in because of the depth of human feeling that antrim smuggles into these stories , almost below radar level his characters long to make genuine emotional connections , but their attempts end badly thus antrim is left to sort through what he has called the sorry indignities that pass as currency between us in lieu of gentler tender , and he s as good at this as almost any writer we have antrim s third novel , the verificationist , is crammed with sorry indignities , and its premise is as high concept as anything he s written set in an openallnight pancake house bar , it s about a group of thinskinned psychoanalysts who gather to drink limitless coffee refills , eyeball one another sexually and , with any luck , toss around some new ideas about how to reconcile classical metapsychology to our particular branch of self other friction theory this being a donald antrim novel , the aptly named self other friction theory is everywhere on display even if no one talks about it much and this being a donald antrim novel , you should n't be surprised to learn that the narrator a frazzled analyst named tom views much of the book s action from the perspective of the pancake house s ceiling the psychoanalysts whom antrim piles into the room are n't exactly highminded refugees from an iris murdoch novel none of them have a medical degree they 're affiliated with a zeroprestige college in new england they give workshops with titles like young women of strength they 're about as classy as a gaggle of swinging mensa members at a ramada inn lounge , and they 're furious about it when one of the analysts brags that he does indeed have a phd in clinical psychology \( probably via mail order \) , our narrator ca n't help thinking to himself , food had not yet been served , and already richard was getting worked up over genital potency issues the characters flick sardonic compliments at one another like cyanidelaced sugar packets your paper on sibling murder fantasies among children of recovered alcoholics is extraordinary , manuel tom , the narrator , is a bundle of neuroses just waiting to explode , and it does n't take much to set him off when a pretty young waitress arrives to take his order , he panics blueberry pancakes or eggs benedict \? choices between banalities are some of our more intimidating ordeals in life , he confesses , while his colleagues stare and his skin crawls while tom dithers , antrim treats us to a long digression \( the first of many \) that s as freshly minted as any of the tangents in the mezzanine , nicholson baker s first novel back at home , tom has been arguing with his wife about what color to paint an upstairs bedroom , a conversation that s really about whether or not to have the baby whose room this would become tom s fears and reservations come spilling out the added financial strain the inevitable displacement of the man \( me again ! \) by another leading to diminished sexual relations , growing jealousy , fits of general desperation before he neatly circles back around to his point about the terrifying nature of small choices the simple question 'what color do you want to paint that upstairs room \?

al gore is determined to fight to the finish his strategy is to draw the finish line at a place where he takes the lead gore tried to avert a quick bush victory in florida by demanding a manual recount of the machine recount in selected counties in response , george w bush set aside the traditional republican preference for states' rights by going to federal court to deny the counties' recounts but the federal judge denied that bush request for intervention bush did gain an advantage when the florida secretary of state , republican katherine harris , reminded all counties that the law required results to be in by tuesday of this week a florida judge ruled this was the secretary s obligation , provided she did not arbitrarily turn down a counties' request for a supplemental , belated manual recount yesterday the florida supreme court , its members all appointed by democratic governors , encouraged manual recounts that s the confused state of play now let s peer through the pettifog and strategize at midnight friday , the overseas absentee ballots will be counted if gore picks up some 300 votes and thereby wins the florida machineplusabsentee total , bush should give up and make an immortal concession speech assume , however , that tomorrow s overseas vote favors bush gore will not concede he will insist that manual recounting in his strongholds continue and thereby move the finish line further ahead but florida secretary of state harris says she has duly considered the counties' requests for hand rerecounts , and following the court s guidelines has nonarbitrarily turned them down and she could then declare bush the winner after the overseas count then what \? the florida supreme court , in a ruling yesterday , tipped its hand about what side it would take its democrats would probably continue to allow the hand rerecounts to go forward , hoping that gore would come out ahead how could bush counter that count of selected democratic counties \? he has rejected gore s offer to throw open all counties to manual recounting because bush s finish line is midnight tomorrow , not a month from now the answer for bush would be to go to the us supreme court to argue that a manual recount would introduce more human error or possible mischief and stretch out the decision for weeks if the high court disagreed , all would not be lost for bush nobody knows what result a statewide manual recount would bring the supreme court \( whose unanimous ruling against nixon on the tapes led to his resignation \) would put its imprimatur on the best way to decide who shall occupy the presidency and the vast majority of americans would readily accept the decision neither the harris pat , in cole porter s phrase , nor the partisan state judges can legitimate our national election once the legal game began , the game had to be played out to the end but it need not be the bitter end publicspirited observers have urged one or the other players to resign for the good of the country , thereby becoming a hero in history others toy with the notion of an unprecedented coalition , with a president of one party and a vice president of the other , with a switch in midterm or an agreement to divvy up cabinet posts , as if ours were a parliamentary system none of that will happen not because the ideas are unconventional or the contestants unworthy , but because both sides have chosen to fight to the finish in court as the case progresses , bush should take up gore s invitation to lift up this discourse by arguing his case personally on television does the closeness of the campaign s finish ordain political paralysis \? not at all deals are there to be made , and not all splitting the difference leaning one way on taxation in return for the other way on school accountability , or a sharing of the pain in biting the bullet of social security reform gore s call last night for a summit is premature bush will take up his offer but probably only after the supremes have spoken though bush and gore are locked in a fight to the finish , it is only the finish of a campaign cheer up , nailnibblers it could inspire the beginning of surprisingly creative government
if you wanted a house fit for a children s picture book , you could do no better than mia farrow s home in connecticut snow white , happening upon it , would say it was perfect , especially for a large family down a hill on a dirt road you go , and there , behind a white picket fence and an overgrown english garden , is a pretty old farmhouse , with little rooms with low ceilings there s a goldfish pond in front , a small lake in the back , four dogs , chickens in a coop , a cat even the name is storybook perfect frog hollow we are talking an older and wiser and financially independent snow white here , by the way snow white at 54 in baggy jeans and an old gap tshirt , with 70 choice acres in litchfield county and more of a sense of humor than you might think a snow white who had relationships with famous men that were not always wonderful , who lost one of her 14 children to death earlier this year , who calls up her friend carly simon to congratulate her on her song about her mastectomy scars snow white in middle age , with a bemused and cautious attitude about the press duty is the reason she s talking now , doing the celebrity spokeswoman thing the cause is polio , a conference on the global polio eradication initiative , which the united nations children s fund has called for tomorrow at the united nations the goal is eradication of polio by 2005 it seems to be working in 1988 , there were an estimated 350 , 000 cases worldwide last year , an estimated 20 , 000 , but would you be paying attention if not for the chance to get a look at mia and find how she can afford to raise all those kids \? \( answer , offered dryly well , i work sometimes i just did a movie for showtime you probably have n't noticed \) ms farrow , who had polio when she was 9 , is speaking at the conference she will be accompanied by her adopted son thaddeus , 12 , who was abandoned at a calcutta train station as a young child he also had polio his legs are scarred from dragging himself on the ground he gets about today with braces or a wheelchair ms farrow suffered no serious physical damage but sitting on her back porch , she talks about being isolated in a polio ward for three weeks she was allowed no physical contact with her family orphaned , in a sense she heard adults scream , and she saw other children die she is not a believer in psychoanalysis if you want to theorize about the effects of having had a father \( the director and writer john farrow \) who was brilliant , alcoholic and a womanizer and a mother \( the actress maureen o sullivan \) who soothed and placated and kept the family together or to tie that to an actress who married or became involved with talented , difficult men \( frank sinatra , andre previn , woody allen \) , you 're on your own the effects of polio , ms farrow will discuss i believe it s why i wanted to be a mother to a child who had the disease i theorize those weeks in the hospital gave me perhaps a social conscience , the beginning of empathy , maybe a bit of selfapology , which sometimes flares up of course , i'm only theorizing , but it was such an eye opener i had not realized , growing up in beverly hills , that such things existed i'm sure that s why i have the children that i have , children with disabilities the number i do n't know that is one of the big questions why does mia farrow keep adopting all these children \? there are five now at home , ranging from 5 to 15 well , it s not continuing , ms farrow says i come from a large family , there were seven of us i raised seven children and began a second family of seven again a mild complaint it s always odd to me that i have to defend my sanity in those circumstances if i kept 100 racehorses would anyone think i was crazy \? not that i'm comparing children to racehorses there are other big questions , of course , which relate to ms farrow s 11year relationship with woody allen the ugly custody battle with allegations of child abuse regarding their adopted daughter dylan , then 6 , and mr allen s marriage to ms farrow s adopted daughter soonyi the subject hovers about like a rude guest who everyone wishes would leave and yet must be acknowledged are n't people sick of the subject \? ms farrow asks she s sick of it she does say a few things she tried to contact soonyi but was rebuffed none of her children have contact with mr allen , by their choice that includes the son mr allen and ms farrow had together , who is 12 and attends college a happier subject seems called for you were married , at 19 , to frank sinatra most people had to put on sinatra , you had sinatra he did n't sing to me , ms farrow says , her voice suggesting it s wearing to be a celebrity spokeswoman but he was pretty terrific warming up to the memory he would do scales , before he was going to sing some place jimmy van heusen would come over and he would vocalize , but i do n't think it s the same thing as singing to some one did anyone ever sing to you \?

visiting a little show called squonk during its brief run in the east village last summer was like walking into a neighbor s garage and discovering a homemade fun house staged in one of the upstairs rooms of performance space 122 , squonk was clearly a product of obsessive , original minds and limited means its performers , five fashionably nerdylooking musicians from pittsburgh , might have been plucked from the audience \( this was the east village in august \) and for 80 minutes of crude but persuasive spectacle , they managed to lure those watching them into an alternative reality it was a funky , friendly and somewhat precious experience , a chemicalfree new agestyle head trip if life were an mgm movie from the 1940 s , the plucky souls of squonk would be discovered by bigtime producers and whisked off to a glamorous theater on the great white way well , for once life has imitated a judy and mickey musical squonk opened last night at the helen hayes theater on broadway unfortunately the requisite mgmstyle happy ending has not been provided to put it simply , squonk has shrunk , almost to the point of invisibility placing this small , eccentric charmer in a broadway house is a brutally misguided transplant so much of the original appeal of squonk , the collaborative creation of which has been overseen by steve o'hearn and jackie dempsey and which is directed by tom diamond , had to do with its creators' control of the environment in which it was performed presented as a goof of a fever dream in a surreal restaurant , the show kept springing surprises that required the audience to be close at hand and , often , part of the action there were flashlights beamed directly into theatergoers' eyes , for example , and a giant tongue that reached past the front row there was also the sense that the performers might materialize anywhere at any moment the music , too , an enyaesque , narcotically repetitive blend of the ethereal and the sinister , seemed allpervasive , so insistent that it clouded the perceptions and there were assorted trompel'oeil tricks , involving items like eggs and electric blenders , that required close viewing to work seen from the far side of a proscenium , on a stage that looks to be the same size as the entire room at ps 122 , the illusions of squonk shrivel , and its shaping visual metaphors become incomprehensible there are some newly enlarged mechanical monsters and an eyecatching backdrop showing an endless landscape of restaurant tables , but everything now registers at a far , bewildering remove , even the music none of the talented ensemble members \( t weldon anderson , ms dempsey , kevin kornicki , jana losey and mr o'hearn \) have learned how to stylize and enlarge their presence and gestures in compensatory ways the freeform dancing and the staged battles of dueling musical instruments now come across as clunky the overall effect is of listening to someone recite last night s dream over the breakfast table if it s not your dream , you 're likely to feel bored or embarrassed the criminal shame in all of this is that had squonk been reincarnated in a smaller , appropriately configured theater , it might have thrived as the kind of quirky show event that tourists could wander into and feel they had come upon something quaint and bohemian \( eg , blue man group , de la guarda \) as it is , the production sadly echoes the real estate agent s credo location is everything squonk bigsmorgasbordwunderwerk created by steve o'hearn and jackie dempsey , in collaboration with the original new york squonk ensemble casi pacilio , kevin kornicki , jana losey and t weldon anderson directed by tom diamond music by ms dempsey with squonk image book , mr o'hearn lyrics by ms losey with ms dempsey sets , puppets and costumes by mr o'hearn lighting by tim saternow sound by bernard fox projections by mr o'hearn , with ms pacilio and nick foxgeig musical direction , mr dempsey choreography and movement by peter kope and michele de la reza assistant musical direction , mr kornicki technical consultant , gene o 'donovan technical supervisor , bob zimmerman production stage manager , ms pacilio general manager , william repicci associates associate producers , mastantuono palumbo and eric falkenstein presented by william repicci , michael minichiello , lauren doll , cookie centracco and chris groenewold , in association with rare gem productions and michael stoller at the helen hayes theater , 240 west 44th street , manhattan with jackie dempsey \( keyborad and accordion \) , kevin kornicki \( electronic and acoustic percussion , sound textures \) , steve o'hearn \( flutes , electronic winds , manybelled trumpet \) , t weldon anderson \( double bass \) and jana losey \( vocals \) photo jana losey is one of the creators and performers of squonk \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
could this be the face of 21st century shareholder activism \? a new smallcap mutual fund , allied owners action fund , introduced on march 10 , together with a companion web site , will soon be making their pitch to rally shareholders and other investors against what they believe to be corporate greed and ineptitude allied owners is your standard smallcap fund with a major twist it will invest in companies that it asserts will benefit from activist input the web site , eraidercom , will solicit discussion from investors , and perhaps drum up a target company or two though distinct entities , both are run by privateer asset management , a new york money management firm privateer s plan works like this the fund will seek out and invest in target companies , and the web site will alert independent investors and shareholders , so that they can invest in the same companies independently if all goes well , these allies will pressure corporate boards to improve their performance privateer plans to post its first list of target companies on eraider in the next eight weeks if the whole project seems rather swashbuckling , consider the cofounder martin stoller , 44 , a professor at northwestern university s kellogg school of management , who is credited by activists with igniting the first webbased shareholder revolt last year his target then was united companies financial , a subprime lender based in baton rouge , la professor stoller posted messages on a yahoo bulletin board demanding that stockholders interests be better represented in impending bankruptcy proceedings and forged an internet shareholder alliance against united companies' management the alliance he formed won unheard of clout in united companies' bankruptcy proceedings , and professor stoller has led the shareholder s equity committee , which is now formulating a reorganization plan for the company he said the experience gave him the idea of organizing small shareholders on a grander scale to target badlyrun companies and doing so early enough to avoid what happened at united companies what i was trying to do was figure out how to harness the special qualities of the internet to address the very special problems of shareholders , professor stoller said the fund and eraidercom will be run as separate companies allied owners has just 11 million in seed money most of it from professor stoller himself it plans to focus on companies with lax management and underperforming assets in particular , the fund will search out companies that tend to escape wall street attention those with no analyst coverage , little institutional ownership and market capitalizations under 500 million at least for now , the fund will take less than a 5 percent stake in target companies for investors who want to participate in this kind of risky activism , the minimum investment is 2 , 500 the fund expects an expense ratio of about 1 percent privateer will absorb any legal expenses from lawsuits filed by target companies we 're looking for companies that could use a little extra push , a little outside help , said aaron brown , 43 , a finance professor at yeshiva university in manhattan , the other cofounder of allied owners and president of privateer he is upfront in describing an investment in allied owners as a gamble , and said people who were not ready to risk their money should hold off several years before buying into the fund despite the flamboyant rhetoric about pirates and raids , both professors said the fund was not targeting companies for takeover rather , their aim will be to organize a large block of a company s shareholders 25 to 40 percent and to fill internet message boards with criticisms that supporters hope will eventually nudge management to do whatever is needed to increase shareholder value a proxy fight is always an option we will have a shadow board of directors on the internet , said professor brown , who manages 24 million in assets for private individuals , including professor stoller professor brown said he would be responsible for picking the companies the fund invests in his wife , deborah pastor , 42 , is the fund s trader the eraider web site , emblazoned with cannon and sabres , is something else there s none of the legalspeak of the securities industry and 36 paid bulletinboard moderators will soon be encouraging input from the public about the companies the fund is invested in at least initially privateer will count on word of mouth and the array of stock chatrooms on the web to recruit shareholders professor stoller made his fortune in a software and dating service business , plextel telecommunications , which was later sold to the cendant corporation for 60 million he says the fund and web site will both strive for transparency in their dealings with corporations , allowing individuals to directly monitor developments still , he revels in eraider s buccaneering , revolutionary image we are as close to the weathermen as you 're going to get in the financial world , he said , referring to the radical underground organization other activists are starting to use the internet nell minow , a veteran shareholder activist with lens asset management of washington , has moved her campaign online at thecorporatelibrarycom she called the start of the eraider venture a seismic development others are a bit more cautious there s no way to tell right now how many shareholder eyeballs they 're going to get , said stephen davis , president of davis global advisors , a money management firm but the more shareholders they get , the more influence they 'll be able to wield at companies photo martin stoller , a professor at northwestern university s business school , has cofounded a swashbuckling

united nations , june 2 the united states falls behind almost every country in europe as well as canada , australia and israel in what the world health organization calls healthy life expectancy , according to a report released today with the report , the organization joins a trend toward measuring life expectancy in a new way , for the first time factoring in the diseases and disabilities that are likely to rob people of a lifetime of good health by this adjusted measure , japan leads the world in healthy life expectancy , according to who , which is part of the united nations system a japanese citizen can expect to lead a life of 745 healthy years , it said at the very bottom of the scale is battered sierra leone , where a child born in 1999 can expect to live a healthy life of fewer than 26 years almost every country with a healthy life expectancy below 40 is in africa , where aids and warfare are lowering life spans significantly the group estimates that hivaids has cut 15 to 20 years off life expectancy in southern africa , and 5 to 10 years in other parts of the continent as in other measures of wellbeing , the study found , the united states loses ground against other industrial nations because it has its own third worlds within its population not surprisingly , the health agency says , years lost to disease , injury and other disabilities are substantially higher in poorer countries , and poorer communities in richer nations the new study lists poor health among american minorities , the effects of aids , tobaccorelated cancers , heart disease and violence as factors in reducing a healthy life expectancy in the united states at the population reference bureau , a private demographic research organization in washington , carl haub , who compiles annual statistics on world population , said the american ranking is not particularly surprising we have a 25 percent minority population that has lower life expectancies , he said , adding that even by traditional measures of mortality , the united states does not rank among the nations with the highest levels of longevity if you look at the us by ethnic group , you see a somewhat different result africanamericans in the us have a much lower life expectancy , particularly males using traditional methods , the united states had a life expectancy of 767 years in 1998 , mr haub said , with men at 739 years and women at 794 the world health organization table of healthy life expectancy lowers the level to 70 years for americans overall , with 675 years for men and 726 years for women nicholas eberstadt , who follows demographic surveys at the american enterprise institute in washington , said there has been a trend , beginning in europe , to add new dimensions to the study of longevity there has been an enormous amount of work done on healthy life expectancy , he said some of these efforts have been inventive , but none have been particularly compelling mr eberstadt said that a number of surveys have factored in perceptions about health and wellbeing among populations , which can vary dramatically from one country or region to another despite the statistical similarities the world health organization survey does not deal with perceptions , but does include projections based on what is known about major health factors like heart disease or lung cancer related to smoking in japan , for example , the new survey says that lung cancer rates for men are expected to jump in coming years as the longterm effects of the postworld war ii smoking popularity begin to hit china , the world s most populous nation , with onefifth of the world s people , was found to have a healthy life expectancy of 623 , well ahead of the secondlargest country , india , at 532 the chinese figure is considered particularly impressive , given the country s income level , who says china outranks not only india in a healthier life but also russia and many nations in central asia , the middle east and north africa
champaign , ill , dec 9 the young guys from the east ventured to the midwest to challenge some older fellows on their home court they were two of the toprated teams in the country the youngbloods , seton hall , were undefeated in five games and ranked seventh in the nation , playing illinois , with a 62 record and ranked ninth , in assembly hall as it sometimes happens with youth , the pirates starting three freshmen , one sophomore and one junior got off to a running start , ahead by as many as 21 points late in the first half the illini , starting three upperclassmen , took a little time before their engine began to purr and came away with an 8779 victory in overtime the illinois players did not lose their heads , while seton hall s may have misplaced theirs i think , said the seton hall star eddie griffin , we got a little laidback seton hall led at the half , 4225 , but that lead began to evaporate like a morning mist with 6 minutes 47 seconds left in regulation , cory bradford hit a 15foot jump shot to put illinois ahead , 5957 , for the first time since early on seton hall stumbled , bumbled , had a series of turnovers on charges and bad passes , but was able to regain the lead illinois went ahead , 6866 , with 40 seconds left , then greg morton made two free throws with 23 seconds left for a 6868 tie at the end of regulation but illinois , with bradford hitting two 3pointers and frank williams converting on two drives that might have made michael jordan envious , finished off seton hall it took a lot of heart to do what we did , bradford said bradford s first 3pointer moved him into a tie with former virginia tech player wally lancaster \( 198689 \) for most consecutive games with at least one 3pointer , with 73 we were flat in the first half we just had to play harder and we did illinois coach bill self said i told them at the half that they were n't playing like the team i was familiar with he may have used stronger terms , according to bradford tommy amaker , the seton hall coach , said for a young team like ours , i was impressed with our effort against one of the great teams in the country they were too tough for us to handle at this stage of the season i think we learned things that will help us down the road a looming question for seton hall before the game was the status of griffin , a freshman he strained a tendon in his right knee on monday in the team s victory against norfolk state he had gone up for an alleyoop dunk , but came down , more or less , with just oops could he play against illinois \? the mystery was cleared up quickly griffin started and played 41 of the game s 45 minutes , wearing an elastic brace as a precautionary measure he seemed to show no effects of any physical problem , although his shooting was off in the first half , he hit 3 of 15 shots , and none of his misses were forced griffin , the 6foot9 , 205pound forward from roman catholic high school in philadelphia , has made an indelible mark in his short time in college basketball griffin was averaging 222 points a game , and was leading the nation in rebounding , with a 136 average , and in blocked shots , with 62 he was 4 of 11 after that , finishing with 20 points and 10 rebounds i did n't think eddie was close to 100 percent , amaker said griffin , meanwhile , credited the illinois defense with containing him they doubleteamed me and wore me out , he said darius lane , the junior guard , led seton hall with 31 points , making 7 of 14 from 3point range the other griffin in the game marcus , illinois s 69 forward muscled his way to 24 points and 13 rebounds , both team highs illinois s only losses this season were to teams ranked no 1 when they met the illini lost to arizona by 7976 and to duke by 7877 before the game , amaker said if our guys stay healthy , if we stay together , we 're a team that will have to be reckoned with at the end of the day if seton hall is to be reckoned with and it has the talent it will have to take the lesson it learned today to heart a word , meanwhile , must be said about the orangeblueclad home crowd of 16 , 683 that filled assembly hall to capacity they energized us in the second half , self said they surely helped every time the decibel level seemed to reach its maximum , it got louder it was a performance almost as impressive as the basketball teams on the court photo sergio mcclain of illinois , right , bringing the ball downcourt under pressure from seton hall s marcus toneyel in the first half yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg 3 \)
one of the few things that vice president al gore and gov george w bush agree on is that elderly citizens should have governmentsubsidized prescription drug insurance the gore plan is much more generous and gives more details than the bush plan , but both proposals deviate from the ideal model of economic insurance the reasons reveal as much about politics as they do about economics in a remarkable 1963 paper , kenneth arrow of stanford university laid out what is now the conventional economic theory of insurance economists assume people do not like to take risks a guarantee that your prescription drug expenses next year will be 1 , 000 is preferred to a 1in10 chance they will be 10 , 000 , even though the average is the same fair gambles over small stakes are acceptable , but large ones are to be avoided insurance is desired to counterbalance the negative consequences of unexpected events , like illnesses or natural disasters the ideal insurance plan would pay nothing for small expenses that is , it would have a deductible because small risks are tolerable in addition , to give the insured an incentive to take adequate precautions and not overuse benefits , the plan would require a copayment most important , insurance would provide unlimited coverage after a certain level of costs is incurred so the insured avoids financial ruin in short , the best insurance plan from an economist s perspective offers catastrophic coverage with a deductible and copayment professor arrow s theory is prescriptive it describes how people should behave the problem is they do not behave that way a new study by howard kunreuther and mark pauly of the university of pennsylvania finds that people desire low deductibles and are ambivalent toward catastrophic coverage tend to be cavalier in taking risks when the stakes are framed as losses and overly cautious when they are framed as gains think of insurance as an investment rather than protection against catastrophic risk and underestimate small risks while exaggerating larger ones consequently , we buy too much of some insurance \( like flight insurance \) and too little of other insurance \( like flood insurance \) these problems are compounded in the drug insurance market by a phenomenon known as adverse selection those who are most inclined to use prescription drugs buy the most insurance the average medicare beneficiary covered by drug insurance spends 66 percent more on prescriptions than his or her uninsured counterpart , despite getting lower prices to stay afloat , insurers charge high premiums and cap benefits the private market for outpatient prescription drug insurance has failed miserably the most common medigap drug plan , for example , charges 100 a month and caps benefits at 1 , 250 a year this is not insurance it is prepaid medication no wonder almost a third of medicare beneficiaries lack drug insurance and many others have inadequate coverage mandating that the elderly join an insurance plan would prevent adverse selection this proved politically infeasible , however , when it was tried in the quickly repealed medicare comprehensive coverage act of 1988 because the welloff elderly were already satisfied with their coverage and others were insufficiently impressed by catastrophic insurance so the candidates have devised voluntary plans that offer subsidized premiums to entice people to buy coverage mr gore would subsidize half the premium and mr bush 25 percent many experts question whether mr bush s subsidy is sufficiently generous to attract enough people to avoid crippling adverse selection problems instead of a deductible , mr gore s plan would reimburse beneficiaries for 50 percent of their first 2 , 000 \( rising to 5 , 000 in 2008 \) of drug costs a year none of their next 3 , 000 \( 1 , 500 in 2008 \) and all of the rest no participant would ever have to pay more than 4 , 000 out of pocket why tilt benefits to the front end and put the deductible in the middle \? to attract enough older people who do not always act rationally when it comes to insurance and thereby skirt the problem of adverse selection almost everyone receives some reimbursement under the gore plan because more than 85 percent of older people take at least one prescription drug annually the politics are such that the principle of making sure the median participant would benefit mattered more than the principles of optimal insurance , said mark mcclellan , a professor of economics and medicine at stanford university who worked on the clintongore plan but frontloading benefits attracts participants at a high cost congressional budget office figures imply that the frontend coverage accounts for about twothirds of gross outlays in president clinton s proposal , a close cousin of mr gore s plan mr bush would initially hand off drug insurance for the poor elderly to the states a responsibility many governors do n't want \( for a candidate running against big government , this approach has the curious effect of creating 50 government bureaucracies \) most elderly people who lack insurance have incomes above 150 percent of the poverty line , so they would be unaffected by this part of the plan anyway mr bush said he would form a white house task force to devise a proposal that relies on private insurance plans , a government plan and hmo s to cover all the elderly the voluntary sorting of the elderly with high expenses into the most generous plans would probably cause this market to eventually unravel mr bush also said he would seek catastrophic coverage for all outofpocket medicare costs , including drugs , in excess of 6 , 000 a year , paid for by unspecified cuts elsewhere in medicare although the instinct to provide catastrophic coverage is a good one , it is doubtful enough could be cut from medicare to finance it an elderly person cannot possibly know what situation they would be in if bush won and got his current ideas passed into law , said uwe reinhardt , a health economist at princeton university bismarck , the father of social insurance , was fond of paraphrasing voltaire the best should not be the enemy of the good the gore plan is very expensive but it would provide protection against escalating prescription drug costs and solve adverseselection problems the bush plan is less expensive but probably unworkable in this case , the best would be for the elderly to recognize that the goal of insurance is to provide a cushion against unexpected catastrophes , not a regular check for anticipated expenses graph prescription spending expenditures for prescritption drugs have more than doubled in the last seven years graph plots expenditures from 19931999 \( est \) \( source health care financing administration national institute for health care management \)
hafez alassad , the air force officer who ruled syria for three decades , transforming a middle east backwater into an introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending arab hostility toward israel , died yesterday in damascus he was 69 mr assad , a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least one heart attack , died of a heart attack , according to medical officials quoted by agence francepresse among the arab autocrats who became stock players in the perpetual drama of negotiating middle east peace , none was more courted , nor more aloof , than the syrian leader no lasting peace could hold without him , but none could be negotiated with him either a treaty remained elusive largely due to his stubborn role in demanding back every inch of syrian territory at home , mr assad s longevity in office rested on a rigid intolerance of dissent , most starkly illustrated by the slaying of thousands of residents of hama in february 1982 to end a swelling islamic insurgency his was a suspicious police state , limiting access to modern instruments like the fax or the internet that might somehow become tools to help undermine his government mr assad rarely traveled , even within syria , and as he aged his public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major holidays but his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish trappings common to other arab rulers his home and office , where he often worked 18hour days , consisted of two modest villas that faced each other in a residential neighborhood in damascus the stream of american presidents , secretaries of state and other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years , hoping to keep the latest peace effort from foundering there , emerged with a grudging respect for mr assad he was at once courteous and calculating , professorial and persistent , unleashing flashes of selfdeprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions the length of the sessions were as legendary as they were nerveracking when henry a kissinger arrived in 1973 , becoming the first american secretary of state to visit syria in 20 years , their initial meeting lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes the waiting press , uninitiated in the ways of the syrian leader , wondered aloud if the american had been kidnapped his tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear , mr kissinger wrote in years of upheaval , the volume of his memoirs published in 1982 he might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable , fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them \( his negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the israelis , much as both of them would hate the comparison \) the lengthy exchanges got to the point that one task of the american ambassador was to brief visiting dignitaries before any meeting with president assad to pace themselves on the constant offerings of coffee , tea and lemonade lest they bruise protocol by interrupting the syrian leader to ask for a bathroom break we dubbed it bladder diplomacy , said edward p djerejian , the american ambassador from 1988 to 1991 mr assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners , even american presidents , about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the middle east in case anyone missed the point , his reception hall was dominated by a large painting depicting the arab armies under saladin defeating the crusaders during the battle of hittin in 1187 , a notsosubtle reminder that he considered present circumstances temporary even in his bitterness toward israel , he retained a certain wry humor about their conflicting views , and he seemed to derive great patience from his obvious sense of history , president jimmy carter wrote in the blood of abraham , a 1985 study of the region syria was a young nation adrift before mr assad s rule the government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups after independence from france in 1946 , resulting in little development and a population weary of chaos the bloodless power grab he staged in november 1970 brought stability and the first modern construction of roads , schools and hospitals mr assad followed the soviet model of a singleparty police state , constructing a network of 15 competing intelligence agencies that spied on his own people it was in regional politics , however , that mr assad most sought to create a legacy , remaking syria into a power among the arabs rather than a political football he was inspired by the arab nationalism preached by president gamal abdel nasser of egypt , and like many of his generation , he

if only she had more money , paula bennett said , she could get her message out for now , she talks to relatives , civic groups and social service workers i 've only raised a few hundred dollars , she said ms bennett , a political independent from lincoln , neb , is running for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than one might think as of last month , 226 people had filed papers with the federal election commission indicating their intention of seeking the white house the list includes major party candidates like vice president al gore and gov george w bush of texas but also candidates so far on the political fringe in some cases , even beyond that they make people like patrick j buchanan of the reform party , john hagelin of the natural law party and ralph nader of the green party seem like mainstream contenders take martin j mcnally , for example his filing says he represents the national christian party , but it is unlikely anyone might find him on the campaign trail he is serving a life sentence for aircraft piracy at a federal prison in terre haute , ind nor is julian starr of huntington , ny , likely to upset any favorites he is only 18 years old , a high school graduate headed for the state university of new york at stony brook this fall he said he filed this year in anticipation of running for president in 2016 , when he will turn 35 , the youngest age a president can be this should be a very good learning experience , he said presidential elections historically attract a wide variety of contenders over the years , voters have cast ballots for free soilers , know nothings , prohibitionists , greenbacks , bull moose progressives and states righters as well as for members of mainstream parties , like republicans , democrats , federalists and whigs in 1996 , besides casting ballots for the republican , democratic and reform tickets , voters also supported at least eight other parties this year , the party choices include socialist , corrective action , progressive , common sense , fly birds , veterans industrial , populistdemocratic viking , priorities , light , antihypocrisy , freedom , church and family values and it has been a slow year , perhaps reflecting a nation enjoying peace and economic stability the number who have filed the single form required by the election commission is the fewest since the commission was formed in 1974 , and a sizable drop from the record year of 1988 , when 330 people filed candidates who expect to raise at least 5 , 000 must file all others file voluntarily in either case , most of those running this year will slip through the campaign without so much as a nod of acknowledgment not only do they lack the money and staff to compete , they take no steps to comply with state regulations to get onto the ballot , leaving them to gain votes only as a writein it is the rare member of the fringe who has the resources to finance a campaign , although it happens heather harder , a democrat from crown point , ind , said she has addressed groups in 42 states , talking about her pet issue , structural change in government to bring it closer to average citizens in that regard , ms harder is typical of the outsiders who filed papers at best , many say , they hope to influence mr gore or mr bush on an issue or two but even betterknown alternative candidates , like ralph nader of the greens , harry browne of the libertarians or ross perot , who represented the reform party in 1992 and 1996 , do little more than draw new focus to old issues some of the fringe parties take up a cause they feel is important and not being addressed , said ross k baker , a professor of political science at rutgers university but as alan brinkley , a history professor at columbia university , noted it s very hard for a thirdparty candidate to do more than influence the behavior of the republicans or democrats it s slightly unusual to have two , perhaps three , alternatives who could claim to be taken seriously , but i do n't see any major new party emerging for many candidates , running for president is a quadrennial affair ms harder , an author and bookstore owner , engaged in a practice campaign four years ago and is running what she called a symbolic campaign to draw attention to government reform four years ago , she probably did not notice her competitor from newburyport , mass , michael t strauss , the standard bearer for mike s party , of which he is the only member in 1996 , mr strauss said , his campaign slogan was , vote for mike or do n't vote at all how successful was he \? more than half the people registered did n't vote that year , he said , referring to the 49 percent turnout in 1996 so i did quite well , actually for this year s campaign he bought 1 , 000 wooden nickels to pass out they say , reelect mike strauss it makes me sound more experienced , mr strauss said some candidates seem more serious bernard palicki of huntsville , ala , who ran for congress six years ago as a republican and now heads the corrective action party , has an internet site to rail against global trade and federal banking laws i'm using my candidacy as a vehicle to get ideas across , mr palicki said but i'm not accepting any money , and i'm not making speeches i'm strictly on the internet temperance lancecouncil , a local activist in los angeles , formed the antihypocrisy party last year as a protest against what she called the arrogance of public officials a candidate from mill valley , calif , named da vid \( who was born 56 years ago in manhattan as dolph ornstein \) , founded the light party to highlight the relationship between environment and health ernest lee easton of south bend , ind , head of the veterans industrial party , is a vietnam veteran who is concerned about veteran rights , campaign finance reform and issues related to job security but others leave the clear impression they do not really expect to dwell in the white house anytime soon daniel pearlman , an independent candidate from taos , nm , believes presidential ballots should contain no names so voters can select anyone they choose to enhance his political stature , mr pearlman has already declared himself president of new mexico freddy sitnick of owings mills , md , an independent , said he had written to all 50 states asking to be placed on the ballot so far , none have responded maybe that is because mr sitnick tells people he is the messiah and clay oliver hill of kissimmee , fla , another independent , said he was worried about the international terrorist rings that he believed had headquarters near his house i doubt i 'll be invited to the debates , mr hill said but among those who have filed with the election commission , maybe raymond kenneth petry , an independent from honolulu , chose the most realistic path to power he declared himself a candidate for vice president photo many unknown candidates are running for president julian starr , left , says it should be a good learning experience , even though at 18 he is not old enough to serve michael t strauss , above , is representing mike s party , while temperance lancecouncil is standardbearer for the antihypocrisy party \( evan richman for the new york times \) \( phil marino for the new york times \) \( marissa roth for the new york times \) chart the contenders alsorans in race number of people who filed with the federal election commission to run for president year number 1976 259 1980 281 1984 228 1988 330 1992 272 1996 282 2000 226 through june 1 \( source federal election commission \)
trenton while the longest economic expansion in history trickles down fitfully to city neighborhoods , a coalition of community groups working to rebuild them is recalling a problem that seemed to fade with the 1970 s the oldfashioned practice of redlining the accusations have arisen as a statewide consumer advocacy group , group new jersey citizen action , has challenged the proposed merger of two giants , hudson united bank and the dime savings bank of new york last week , the new jersey black ministers council joined citizen action in calling on the state banking authorities to intervene in the merger on the ground that hudson has written off minority neighborhoods and low and moderateincome homebuyers of more than 1 , 000 loans that hudson made in new jersey in 1998 , only 9 went to blacks , according to data that citizen action compiled from reports to federal regulators in essex , union and morris counties , two loans went to black applicants the group said the bank made no loans to blacks or to lowincome applicants in hudson county , the bank s home base the rev reginald t jackson , director of the ministers' council , said that the bank has not made a serious effort to lend to qualified minorities while mr jackson said there was no more blatant example than hudson of a lender refusing to work with community leaders , he said the challenge to hudson s merger will remind other banks that they have an obligation to be fair in lending the ministers' council and citizen action also accuse the bank of reneging on a 1997 agreement with citizen action in which it pledged to set aside 4 million for investment in newark , including home mortgages , housing development and loans to small businesses of that amount , it has lent 323 , 000 , citizen action said hudson officials have declined to respond to the complaints a spokesman , richard edmonds , referred to a brief statement in which the bank said it was cooperating to the fullest with the regulators in their review process the statement also said that in december the two banks pledged that the merged company , to be called dime united bancorp , would set aside 25 billion for low and moderateincome borrowers in its new fourstate market the statement said that in annual reviews of its compliance with a 23yearold antiredlining law , federal regulators had given hudson satisfactory ratings it is the 1977 law , called the community reinvestment act , that gives groups like citizen action and the black ministers council a role in policing banks the law provides that when a bank applies for a merger or expansion , community groups can register a challenge if they believe it has failed to meet local banking needs as a result , many banks have negotiated agreements with coalitions of community groups in new jersey , citizen action to invest in the urban areas where they have branches the law was supposed to have written an end to redlining while several national studies in the last decade have shown that minority applicants were still significantly more likely to be turned down for mortgages than whites with similar incomes , they also found that , particularly after a flurry of enforcement efforts by the clinton administration , mortgage lending to lowincome people had risen significantly but more recently , those efforts have flagged , said john taylor , president of the national community reinvestment coalition , an umbrella group of communitybased nonprofits this is the kind of stuff that impacts millions of people , but people do n't see it until branches close , and it becomes difficult getting small business loans , and they try to get a mortgage , he said mr taylor added if i were the mayor of a major city , or a state legislator , i would wake up what in the hell is in these banks but the assets of the people of new jersey \? it s not like the banks manufactured this money it s borrowed from the people of new jersey the dimehudson merger was announced in september the proposal was submitted to federal banking authorities in december and to the new jersey department of banking and insurance on jan 7 new jersey citizen action has filed challenges with the federal reserve and the state banking department , which has until march 7 to review the merger application in the meantime , the organization picketed hudson branches in several cities , including newark , woodbridge and union city phyllis salowekaye , the director of citizen action , said it had enlisted the formal support of some elected officials , including the hudson county board of freeholders and the woodbridge city council and its mayor , jim mcgreevey ms salowekaye said citizen action had agreements with 29 banks , including hudson all banks are not good , she said , but none are this bad since the merger was announced , she said , hudson has refused to discuss an agreement for the new bank , which will have more than 330 branches the attitude has been total arrogance , she said ms salowekaye said the 1997 agreement made no reference to race but only to income levels still , she said , it s so jarring to find that the bank made only two loans to africanamericans in the newark metropolitan area in 1998 the federal reports show that hudson made 133 home loans to whites in the metropolitan area among other lenders , first union mortgage corporation made 268 loans to blacks and 1 , 603 to whites summit bank made 159 loans to blacks and 2 , 780 to whites and fleet bank made 5 loans to blacks and 87 to whites hudson s detractors allow that the bank did not deny many applications from minority applicants the problem , they say , is that hudson has had only a handful of them despite its presence in areas with large black and latino populations other banks market their programs , said wayne smith , the council president in irvington , who works with citizen action in counseling minority homebuyers they 're out beating the drums for business some are working with local churches , some with nonprofit organizations , community development organizations they advertise they 'll advertise in church bulletins photo the planned merger of the hudson united bank and the dime savings bank led joanna kaplowitz , left , and her father , stewart , to picket newark s halsey street branch \( amanda brown the starledger \)
the recordsetting economic boom of the last decade has had an almost magical quality each time it has flirted with ending , a savior has stepped in in the mid1990 s , with growth slowing , american companies plowed billions of dollars into computers , improving productivity and , with it , the economy in 1998 , as asia s economies were collapsing , american consumers stepped up their spending on bigticket items like cars and appliances around the same time , as corporate spending on software was slowing , executives began investing heavily in the internet the dust behind this magic has been debt because of banks' willingness to take risks they once would not have taken , consumers and businesses alike have been able to spend money that they did not yet have thousands of people bought houses for the first time , and companies were able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes consumer debt now stands at 75 trillion , more than twice what it was in 1990 , while corporate debt has reached 106 trillion for the magic to continue that is , for the economy to avoid a nasty recession in the next few years the borrowers must remain prosperous enough to pay off their bonds , credit cards and mortgages with the economy now slowing sharply , that prospect looks less certain than it did just a month or so ago in fact , the unprecedented level of private debt could well be the biggest single threat to the soft landing that alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , has been seeking this could be the economy s achilles' heel , said mark zandi , the chief economist of economycom , a research firm in west chester , pa already this year , the number of personal bankruptcies has risen steadily , even as the unemployment rate has remained at its lowest level in 30 years four times as many companies have had their credit ratings downgraded as have had them improved , the worst such ratio since 1990 , according to moody s investor services the nation s secondlargest bank , bank of america , said this month that its fourthquarter profits would suffer because it had to write off 1 billion in bad loans some of this is normal debt usually rises during an expansion , because people see tantalizing opportunities to spend money in retrospect , anyone would have happily paid interest on borrowed money during the late 1990 s to have earned a 20 percent annual return in the stock market but what could set the recent boom apart from others is the sheer scale of the borrowing , fueled by optimism and banks' aggressive marketing during the good times of the 1960 s , the ratio of household debt , including mortgages , to disposable income rose less than 10 percent , according to economycom in the last decade , it has jumped almost 25 percent the average american family now owes more money than it makes , after tax , in one year we 've had such unusual prosperity , said david levy , vice chairman of the levy institute forecasting center in mount kisco , ny it s not surprising that people do n't worry about catastrophic problems with credit indeed , the debt presented little trouble initially because wages , hours worked and stock values have all risen smartly since the mid90 s now , however , some companies are starting to cut back on overtime and even regular hours many of the first to suffer are the same lowerincome people whose debt payments have surged in recent years if they can no longer make the payments , bankruptcy filings will rise even further , and consumer spending will slow banks , stung by loans they cannot recover , will pull back , making it more difficult for some consumers to obtain mortgages or credit cards spending will fall again corporate profits will suffer , hampering the stock market investors will rein in buying for themselves and their families , just as hourly wage earners are doing likewise at the same time , companies' credit ratings have fallen , because capital investments are not yielding enough of a return to pay off corporate debt , said john lonski , the chief economist at moody s with money now harder to get because of the lower credit ratings and overproduction hampering some key industries businesses , like consumers , may also reduce spending it s a very fragile period , and it s very easy to see a scenario where things get out of hand , mr zandi said none of this is preordained the federal government has reduced its debt in recent years and has more flexibility than in the past to jumpstart the economy with tax cuts or new programs the fed can also lower interest rates to lessen debt payments , thereby encouraging more spending and investment at some point , though , america may have to overcome its debt problems the oldfashioned way by spending no more than it makes chart shows ratio of household liabilities to disposable income since 1960 \( source economycom \)

dr laura schlessinger , the conservative radio host who has been the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups , has unleashed a counteroffensive aimed at retaining her advertisers the campaign by dr schlessinger , the second highest rated talk show host on radio after rush limbaugh , came as her syndicator disclosed just how many sponsors have left the program because of the protest kraig t kitchin , the president and chief operating officer of premiere radio networks , said the show has lost 12 brands , or nearly 10 percent , of its national advertisers pressure on the sponsors began to mount in april , after months of protests failed to persuade the paramount television group to back away from plans to produce a new syndicated tv show starring dr schlessinger , who has described homosexuality as deviant and derivative of biological error the show is to make its debut sept 11 in may , one of the first advertisers on the tv program , procter gamble , dropped its sponsorship radio sponsors began dropping immediately after that , though paramount executives said no other advertisers have abandoned the tv show underscoring the gravity of the situation , dr schlessinger last week began urging her listeners to start a letter and email campaign thanking those sponsors who have remained with her radio show , and urged them to buy the sponsors' products dr schlessinger , who had previously been relatively passive amid the attacks , also announced that she will begin making onair plugs for the sponsors who have stayed with her in a letter addressed to her listeners , which was posted on her web site drlauracom , dr schlessinger painted her fight as a heated battle over family values , saying , folks who do n't share our beliefs about what s right for children and the family are trying to disrupt our relationship on friday , in a brief telephone interview , she said , i think anybody who has traditional values has been put on notice that if they express their values , they 'll be put under attack dr schlessinger s offensive represents her first public attempt to dam the flow of ad dollars from her radio advice program , which draws an estimated 18 million listeners weekly those that have severed their ties with dr schlessinger include some of the largest corporations in the nation toys r us , united airlines , att , kraft , general foods and xerox two more advertisers ceased sponsorship of her radio show during the first two weeks of july one , skytel , the wireless company , said it was doing so amid an overall retreat from talk radio , though a spokeswoman could not name any show other than dr schlessinger s for which it was a sponsor another , the geico insurance company , said in a statement that its withdrawal from the program was in direct response to the controversy , adding , geico is an equal opportunity employer and does not condone discrimination of any type pricelinecom and natrol on whose board mr kitchin sits as well as a web site called supportkidscom , are among those that have stuck with the program the continued success of the protest campaign against dr schlessinger led by the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation and a group called stopdrlaura has been notable the actions have reflected the growing political and economic power of gays , who are now exercising the sort of influence on the entertainment industry that conservative groups have in the past dr schlessinger has said she believes she is being unfairly targeted , claiming that her statements about gays are being taken out of context and that she is simply espousing family values she has said that while she opposes homosexuality and a gay activist agenda , she does not oppose gays on friday , during the brief telephone interview , she said she began her countercampaign in response to calls and letters from listeners asking her how they could help dr schlessinger said that she does not believe that her views are any different from those of pope john paul ii , who recently stated that homosexuality goes against natural law i do n't see stopthepopecom , do you \? she said dr schlessinger complained that the campaign against her has spilled over into her personal life , citing personal threats to me and letters sent to neighbors with no return address telling them to accost me verbally i think it s a pretty disgusting , relentless attack on my life , on my career , on my work , she said but the groups were unapologetic about their campaign and said it would continue we are letting all advertisers for dr laura know about the rhetoric , said john aravosis , cofounder of stopdrlauracom , which keeps tabs on developments with her radio and television programs if they think that dr laura is bad for business , it s their choice it s a free country and a free market ultimately , he said , he would like to see paramount cease production of the dr laura show yet the television show is suffering much less than the radio program despite heavy pressure on the television stations that have agreed to show the program which is expected to reach 97 percent of the country so far none has tried to break its agreement and despite loud complaints even from within its own ranks , paramount said it is sticking with the program in fact , production started last week mr kitchin of premiere said he was confident that all of the sponsors would return to the radio show , which he said is still financially healthy but that is only if and when the controversy dies down there are some who have said , 'the heat s a little hot in this kitchen , give us a call when it cools off , ' he said photo dr laura schlessinger
sacramento , june 1 in a step he had never taken over the course of 131 executions in five years , gov george w bush agreed tonight to a 30day reprieve for a deathrow inmate in texas , citing concerns that adequate tests on dna evidence in the case had not been performed mr bush made his decision , which he had telegraphed well in advance , after both the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans , and the united states supreme court late today rejected finalhour pleas by lawyers for the inmate , ricky nolen mcginn , who had been scheduled for execution by lethal injection at 6 pm , central daylight time mr mcginn was convicted of raping and killing his 12yearold stepdaughter in 1993 , but mr bush acknowledged over recent days that new dna tests might be able to determine more definitively mr mcginn s guilt on the rape charge it was the rape , layered on top of the murder , that qualified mr mcginn for a death sentence mr bush , who had just arrived at the california capitol here for a conference of governors , announced the stay only about 15 minutes before the originally scheduled time for the execution he noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by state senator rodney ellis of texas , a houston democrat who was acting as governor while mr bush and the lieutenant governor were both out of the state i have recommended and senator ellis has accepted my recommendation to grant a 30day reprieve in the case of mr mcginn , mr bush told reporters in a corridor of the capitol any time dna evidence can be used in its context and be relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row , we need to use it , mr bush continued we 're doing so in the case of texas i expect for the courts and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape in the case of ricky mcginn because mr bush is now the presumptive republican nominee for president , his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty texas leads the nation in executions although his probable democratic opponent , vice president al gore , also supports capital punishment , some of mr gore s allies would like to use the issue to cast doubt on mr bush s efforts to portray himself as a compassionate conservative in addition , mr bush s unusual action in the case of mr mcginn underscored the way in which modern dna testing and technology have begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt on convictions once considered just in recent months , even some staunch conservatives have begun to acknowledge qualms about capital punishment , in light of a number of death sentences that have been overturned recently after dna testing exonerated the inmates mr bush s aides said that his action today was not even remotely influenced by politics and that he had made many tough and unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past as governor , mr bush s only independent authority is to grant a 30day reprieve of an execution he cannot pardon someone or commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the texas board of pardons and paroles under those circumstances , he has commuted only one death sentence in his five years in office , sparing the life of henry lee lucas , a confessed serial killer in that case , as in this one , the argument against the death penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one , and it cast seeds of doubt about the defendants' guilt in regard to the particular conviction for which he received his sentence but this was the first time that mr bush agreed to a reprieve for a deathrow inmate , and he did it against the wishes of the pardons board , which had voted , 11 to 7 , not to stay mr mcginn s execution for the moment , that action merely delays mr mcginn s execution , although his lawyers hope that they can now perform new dna tests that will shed new doubt on his guilt what mr bush did today , and the way in which he presaged it with a series of remarks on wednesday , suggested that he was at least somewhat sensitive to his image as a fervent advocate of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that allowed him to temper it in the past , mr bush had almost always waited for courts to complete their reviews of deathrow inmates' appeals before he signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter but mr bush broke from that pattern this time around , telling reporters on wednesday that he was likely to grant mr mcginn a 30day reprieve at the time , the fifth circuit had yet to rule on the appeal , and mr mcginn s lawyers had not turned to the supreme court several republican political strategists around the country said they doubted that mr bush was simply trying to soften his image by showing a capacity for clemency i do n't think that this is political , said mike murphy , who was one of the principal strategists for the presidential campaign of senator john mccain of arizona but mr murphy added , the truth is that the explosion in dna technology has really changed the death penalty dynamic , and perhaps he s taking that reality into account a little bit karen p hughes , a spokesman for mr bush , said this afternoon that mr mcginn s case was the first one mr bush had faced as governor in which the possibility of further dna testing was so central to the question of innocence or guilt the dna testing at the trial level was inconclusive and there s an opportunity to get more information now from that test , so he feels it s the right thing to do , ms hughes said the fate of mr mcginn from this point on remains unclear because his lawyers are in waters largely uncharted in texas they must obtain the evidence they want tested , including clothing from the victim that contained a semen stain and a pubic hair found on the victim s body , and then analyze the dna but they said today that they were not certain whether they have just 30 days to complete this or whether the case now returns to a state district judge to set a new execution date , which would give the defense team at least 60 days no matter how the tests turn out , however , prosecutors say they expect the murder conviction to stand because of other evidence that tied mr mcginn to the girl s death in texas , murder is punishable by death only if the killing occurred under certain specified circumstances , including the murder of a police officer or firefighter in the line of duty murdering for money or paying someone else to do so , and murdering a child under 6 years of age in this case , the death penalty threshold was achieved when the jury found mr mcginn guilty of also raping his stepdaughter

sales its auction of impressionist and modern art on nov 6 and its auction of contemporary art on nov 13 , both at the american craft museum on west 53rd street but that s as far as his affiliation

the presidential difference leadership style from fdr to clinton by fred i greenstein 282 pp new york martin kessler books the free press 25 the modern presidency , perhaps more than any other institution , magnifies the personal strengths and weaknesses of the office s occupant some human imperfections are more disabling than others , and in a president they can have major consequences consider bill clinton , whose recklessness plunged him into a scandal that depleted much of the white house s moral authority , or richard nixon , whose insecurities and emotional dark side helped bring down his presidency in the presidential difference leadership style from fdr to clinton , fred i greenstein , a professor of politics at princeton , offers new insights into the successes and failures of 11 american presidents his work provides a useful yardstick for considering this year s two presidential contenders , george w bush and al gore , an unsatisfying choice for many voters who are troubled by bush s lack of gravitas and gore s lack of candor there are some surprises in his assessments that are at odds with popular perceptions of the nation s chief executives , and even serious students of presidential history may find parts of greenstein s work illuminating greenstein rates modern presidents on six qualities that bear on their effectiveness as leaders communication , organization , political skill , vision , cognitive style and emotional intelligence no single president scores high on all of these attributes , but our most successful chief executives have possessed the right combination of the ones that matter most greenstein believes that the key presidential quality is emotional intelligence , which he defines as the president s ability to manage his emotions and turn them to constructive purposes , rather than being dominated by them and allowing them to diminish his leadership greenstein says that only three of the 11 presidents he studied stand out as fundamentally free of distracting emotional perturbations eisenhower , ford and bush , none of whom was considered a particularly strong president , although each had virtues that greenstein maintains are not fully recognized or appreciated four others roosevelt , truman , kennedy and reagan were marked by emotional undercurrents that did not significantly impair their leadership these four presidents except for truman , all great communicators would make most people s lists of the 20th century s dominant chief executives , even though kennedy s brief presidency was defined more by style than by lasting achievements it s no surprise that greenstein finds johnson , carter , nixon and clinton to have been the most emotionally handicapped presidents of the lot clinton s foibles made him an underachiever and national embarrassment , he writes carter s defective temperament contributed to making his time in office a period of lost opportunity johnson and nixon presided over major policy breakthroughs , but also over two of the most unhappy episodes of the 20th century , vietnam and watergate franklin delano roosevelt , according to greenstein , presents the most complex balance sheet of presidential strengths and weaknesses while fdr was a towering figure who defined the modern presidency , a superb communicator and an inspiring leader , greenstein contends that his chaotic organizational methods , his lack of vision and his intuitive approach to decision making were major defects fdr worshipers will find that assessment blasphemous whatever his flaws , he is revered for pulling the nation through the great depression and leading it to victory in world war ii mercifully , greenstein spares us most of the pyschobabble we have come to expect from authors probing the emotional makeup of our presidents instead , he provides us with a perceptive view of the leadership qualities and the events that shaped the triumphs and tragedies of the modern presidency at the very least , it makes for a challenging parlor quiz
the battle for god by karen armstrong 442 pp new york alfred a knopf 2750 dr james luther adams , my ethics professor in seminary , used to tell us that we would end our careers fighting an ascendant fundamentalist movement , or , as he liked to say , the christian fascists he was not a scholar to be disregarded , however implausible such a scenario seemed , and still seems but it is clear that as we enter the new millennium the traditional versions of the three monotheistic religions have failed to fill the huge spiritual void of modernity one jeanpaul sartre called a godshaped hole we lie on the cusp of a great religious experiment , one similar to the upheaval that led to the decline of paganism and the rise of reformers and prophets during the socalled axial age \( 800 bc200 bc \) , when the most important thoughts worth thinking were first thought regretfully , for the moment , all innovation , passion and energy lie with the adversaries of secular , democratic society whether or not you see fundamentalism as a threat , as karen armstrong does in the battle for god , hers is one of the most penetrating , readable and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in judaism , christianity and islam rather than make sweeping pronouncements , she wisely focuses on the fundamentalist strains in the united states , israel , iran and egypt she displays , as she should , sympathy for the plight of those who turned to fundamentalism after being shunted aside by forces and states that have little patience with the quest by the poor and the dispossessed to find meaning and purpose but what has evolved as a response to modernity is also tainted , armstrong points out , with the doctrines and mores of the 20th century , including the support for liberation movements , the requirement to fashion messages to suit the confines of the electronic media and the disturbing belief that the rational world can be applied to the mythos of religion as if it were a science protestant fundamentalists read the bible , she writes , in a literal , rational way that is quite different from the more mystical , allegorical approach of premodern spirituality ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was not , as she aptly reminds us , a throwback to the middle ages in fact much of his message and developing ideology was modern his opposition to western imperialism and his support of the palestinians were similar to other third world movements at this time so was his direct appeal to the people even the ultraorthodox jews , who try to turn their back on secular israeli society , have founded yeshivas that are recognizable , voluntarist institutions they adopted a novel stringency in their observance of the torah and learned to manipulate the political system in a way that brought them more power than any religious jew had enjoyed for nearly two millenniums , armstrong notes these movements are struggling to define , often in disturbing ways , an ethic in a world whose landscape has altered dramatically they are a product , although they do not recognize themselves as such , of the culture they hope to vanquish , and all have a symbiotic relationship with modernity like other uncompromising movements fascism , communism and nationalism fundamentalist sects fester the west has developed an entirely unprecedented and wholly different type of civilization , armstrong , the author of three previous books , including a history of god , writes , so the religious response to it has been unique she is unsure how to vanquish or tame these movements , pointing out that each attempt to crush them has resulted in more virulent strains the problem may be that such vindictive intolerance , racism and homophobia simply have no place in a civil society much of fundamentalism is an ideology of rage , a product of the worst elements of the society it condemns the gush emunim in israel , the forces grouped around the iranian clergy , the muslim brotherhood in egypt and the constituencies of jerry falwell and pat robertson have absorbed the pragmatic rationalism of modernity , and , under the guidance of their charismatic leaders , they refine these 'fundamentals' so as to create an ideology that provides the faithful with a plan of action , armstrong writes the fieriest and deadliest battle , however , is not between the sacred and the profane , but between the anointed and the apostates masquerading as believers the assassinations of anwar sadat and yitzhak rabin illustrate , armstrong says , the two wars being fought in the middle east , one between the arabs and the jews and the other between secularists and religious it was the internecine fighting between the powerful television evangelists , not the liberal establishment they set out to topple , that saw the collapse of the empires of jim bakker and jimmy swaggart the christian right consumed itself but as armstrong s narrative , which traces these movements back to their roots , makes plain , there has long been an ebb and flow in a pattern they share with all fundamentalist groups , including those who fought the shah of iran or the egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser , the sects , each time they are wounded , regroup , redefine their mission and return again to assault modern society protestant fundamentalists in the united states became more reactionary , intransigent and literalminded after their humiliation at the scopes trial , she writes the most extreme forms of sunni fundamentalism surfaced in nasser s concentration camps , and the shah s crackdowns helped to inspire the islamic revolution
boston , june 21 it would not have mattered in the seventh inning tonight if the yankees had juan gonzalez or sammy sosa or both it would not have mattered if they had fielded nine superstars and recruited five future hall of famers to cheer them from the bench nothing else matters when pitchers do not throw strikes jason grimsley and mike stanton are two of the reasons the yankees are still in first place despite their maddeningly inconsistent play , but tonight , grimsley and stanton were the reasons the yankees are not in a position to sweep the fourgame series from the red sox the relievers walked five batters in the seventh inning , including four in a row , and that helped propel the boston red sox to a 97 victory we made a gift , said joe torre , the yankees' manager you have to make teams beat you , and it did n't happen george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , watched from a box , occasionally drawing a cell phone to his ear , perhaps to hear the latest on the trade talks for gonzalez and sosa the yankees are 3630 , a halfgame ahead of the red sox \( 3631 \) the rookie jake westbrook , who did not survive the second inning in his first start , will make his second start thursday night , against boston s ramon martinez david cone has not won a decision since april , but he could have won tonight he probably should have summer arrived here , shoved by a wind that blew strongly over the leftfield wall at fenway park , across the charles river , and it was because of the wind that bernie williams misplayed a long fly ball in the first inning , costing the yankees a run the gusts probably aided the red sox in the sixth , when two batters hit balls into the tail wind and against the leftfield wall but cone , whose fastball reached 89 to 90 miles an hour consistently , threw effectively , and when the yankees scored three runs in the top of the seventh , he was in position to pick up his second victory of the year , the 182nd of his career cone threw 101 pitches in the first six innings , just about the limit the yankees' staff has held him to , and grimsley jogged out of the bullpen to pitch the bottom of the seventh , his record 31 , his earned run average 302 , solid all year nomar garciaparra opened the inning for the red sox with a single , and it was not necessarily a problem grimsley throws a hard sinking fastball and gets lots of ground balls and double plays preparing to pitch to carl everett , he glanced over his left shoulder at garciaparra torre would say later that grimsley became too concerned with holding the red sox runner at first , but grimsley did not think so he threw his first pitch to everett low , the next three high , walking him i just did n't find that inbetween spot , he said now the yankees' lead was in jeopardy both runners advanced on mike stanley s sharp grounder to third scott brosius made a diving play , rose and threw to first for the first out and garciaparra scored the tying run when scott hatteberg smashed a grounder to second grimsley then walked the pinchhitter brian daubach first and third and two out but grimsley walked manny alexander , the no 9 hitter , loading the bases , and torre was on the move , calling for stanton as he walked out of the dugout stanton said he felt good in the bullpen throwing his warmups there were no symptoms of the wildness that has overcome him from time to time in his career , those moments when he begins to rush and his front shoulder in his delivery his right shoulder flies to the right and drags his left arm through his motion , like a tin can dangling from a string off the back of a pickup truck stanton had just six walks in 32 2 3 innings this year but his first two pitches to jose offerman were out of the strike zone , and he seemed to be rushing jorge posada , the yankees' catcher , jogged to the mound look , you 're trying too hard , posada told him stanton kept trying and trying he threw ball 3 the fans at fenway roared , and even louder when he threw ball 4 , forcing home the goahead run then stanton walked jeff frye , jabbing at the air with his left arm the moment he threw the last ball the red sox led , 75 , and added two runs when trot nixon ripped a tworun double off stanton it would not matter that williams slugged a tworun shot in the yankee ninth both grimsley and stanton waited for reporters after the game , stanton with his arms folded across his chest , grimsley sitting in a chair with an empty look on his face between them , they had thrown 30 pitches in the innings , 10 strikes when you get to this level , you have to make adjustments , stanton said , and i simply did not make adjustments it s nobody s fault but myself we should 've won this game i got out there , threw a couple of pitches out of the zone and got frustrated , and i did not step back and make an adjustment said grimsley to not give yourself a chance by not throwing the ball over the plate , that s irritating and costly the yankees could have won the first three games of this series , built bigtime momentum , and kicked another dent in the red sox but now they could be out of first place by the time they leave here late thursday inside pitch orlando hernandez \( sprained elbow \) wo n't be able to resume throwing for three days , meaning that the yankees may have to call up a pitcher from class aaa columbus for friday s game in chicago ben ford , currently with columbus , could be called up to pitch , too if jason grimsley is not needed in relief thursday , he could make his fourth emergency start of the year photos boston s jose offerman beat david cone s tag in the first inning last night at fenway park to score on yankee catcher chris turner s passed ball \( associated

rafah , gaza strip , dec 6 more than anything , omar jaber dhuheir appears humiliated by what has happened to him for decades , he poured his sweat into cultivating his twoacre parcel of the family property he even nestled his home among the greenhouses so that he could tend his tomatoes and cucumbers around the clock now he , his wife and his nine children are left with a single tent in the sand a month ago , to build a new road for jewish settlers , the israeli army razed his fields , obliterating his greenhouses and tearing into his sevenroom house as his family ran out the back door mr dhuheir said he had left too quickly to rescue his life savings 88 , 000 worth of jordanian dinars from under his mattress today , his eyes pinched tight in embarrassment , mr dhuheir gripped the tent pole as tears streamed down his face his wife spoke for him , a flash of anger interrupting her melancholy enough with the intifada , donya dhuheir said i hope there will be a war now as this long period of violence produces a mounting toll of death , injury and property damage , the palestinian population grows steadily angrier and the voices of moderation get ever quieter many israelis believe their government has used restraint in confronting a violent uprising manipulated by the palestinian leadership but the palestinians do not see any restraint , and a fresh wave of rage is breaking on the shores of accumulated humiliation and resentment they are pushing everyone to be suicide bombers , said raji sourani , director of the palestinian center for human rights the israelis say palestinian officials are fostering extremism and inculcating a culture of martyrdom by devoting their official news media to diatribes against israeli offenses , by running extensive coverage of every funeral and by showing graphic images of the bloodshed palestinians say that the reality itself is graphic and that almost every family is affected by it the numbers , they say , paint a grim portrait about 275 palestinians had been killed in the conflict by dec 6 , according to the red crescent society thirtyfive israelis had been killed some 10 , 000 palestinians had been wounded of those , more than 900 sustained serious physical or neurological injuries and will require longterm care , according to the palestinian health ministry about 190 , 000 palestinians lost their jobs , affecting about 760 , 500 dependents , according to the united nations israeli bulldozers destroyed about 600 acres of agricultural land in the gaza strip alone , according to the palestinian center for human rights and then there is that which cannot be measured mr sourani , a cosmopolitan professional who speaks hebrew , said his 6yearold twins recently urged him to hang up on an israeli friend who called to see how his family was holding up , saying , you ca n't talk to a jew now ! the friend burst into tears , he said , and he himself felt instantly depressed the twins were born after the oslo agreement of 1993 into an era of peacemaking by gazan standards , they are pampered they have been unaffected materially by this conflict , safe from missiles and sheltered from the news and yet , even them , mr sourani said like every child here , they are haunted by the image of muhammad aldura , he continued , referring to the 12yearold boy shot dead as he crouched behind his father film that is repeatedly shown on palestinian and arab television stations i have never had a gun in my life but my children who are doing peepee in their beds want me to buy one , because obviously muhammad aldura s father could n't protect him well enough with his bare hands israeli officials lament the unraveling of routine life in the west bank and gaza , but they unequivocally blame the palestinians , saying , in effect , that their hardship is selfinflicted in this view , if the palestinians had not erupted into a violent uprising , which the israelis believe was fostered by the palestinian leadership , the israelis would not have been forced to quell their violence with more violence and to shut the borders the gaza strip , in which some 6 , 500 settlers live in heavily fortified enclaves among 11 million palestinians , is transformed by the conflict the usually busy border with israel is ghostly no israelis are allowed in not even israeli journalists and no palestinians are allowed out the center of palestinianruled gaza city still bustles during the day cars still jostle with donkey carts , although the streets are not clogged because gasoline is so scarce fresh produce , eggs and clucking chickens still appear to be plentiful in the markets but most business has ground to a standstill , and most people have little to do but focus on the hourly reports of death and destruction broadcast by the palestinian stations sorry for the hebrew , one taxi driver said , apologizing for the pop music station i just ca n't listen to the palestinian channels anymore they 're too depressing as israeli settlers and soldiers in gaza have come under attack , the israeli army has expanded its presence and enlarged the military zones around the settlements israeli tanks are posted at critical junctions , and israeli soldiers direct traffic from behind mounted guns their presence continues to be startling and scary to many gazans the israelis pulled out of most of gaza in 1994 , and now the gazans feel that they are reoccupying the strip
zadie smith s white teeth may have been sold for a considerable advance on the strength of 80 or so stunning pages it may have inspired normally reserved british reviewers to fall all over themselves with enthusiasm and it may have elicited a flattering telephone call \( and a blurb , too \) from none other than salman rushdie but that does n't mean smith has to think it is any good a lot of the book is an exercise in 'look at me , ' she says with faint distaste , speaking of her work as if were an embarrassing relic from her juvenile period , written decades ago \( in fact , it was written three years ago , when she was 21 \) i wanted to prove that i was a writer and then , it s like 100 other first novels i could pick up it s tempting to think that she s protesting too much but over lunch at a soho cafe that proves disappointing to the exacting smith because of the way the place has abandoned its humble roots and tried to put on airs , she seems as hard on herself as she is on the state of current british fiction in general that is , very hard indeed so much of it is tedious and suburban , she says of course , i absolutely include myself in that category zadie smith is spiky in manner , striking in appearance and very , very clever , though she gets strangely inarticulate when called upon to discuss white teeth , a big , generous stew of a book that describes the lifelong friendship between archie , a white , workingclass londoner , and samad , a muslim from bangladesh , with issues of race , religion , generational conflict and genetically modified mice thrown spicily in to the pot i'm so bad at this , she groans i'm reminded of nabokov , who said 'i think like a genius i write like a man of letters and i talk like a child' but as lunch soup and a salad , and cigarettes wears on , she warms up and proves anything but childish brought up in willesden green , northwest london , to a young jamaican mother and a far older english father , she was a bit of a stoner as a teenager , she says when she announced at high school that she wanted to go on to cambridge , the teacher literally threw a book at her in disbelief but go to cambridge she did , and thrived on its competitive culture after graduation , she applied for a number of jobs in journalism , did n't get even a single interview and found herself with a completed novel and a reputation for being the exciting new voice of youth and color in british fiction indeed , white teeth which is set in a neighborhood much like the one smith grew up in is as much a celebration of its mishmash of cultures and races as anything else it is an area that works very well and in which people have been able to live their lives with the ideals that they have in their own community , she explains i wanted to show that you can live a life where princess diana is n't your role model , and the fact that david beckham cut his hair does n't matter at all , she adds , referring to a british soccer star the book , she says , presents a utopian view of race relations it s what it might be , and what it should be and maybe what it will be smith s many fans will be happy to know that she is working on her second novel it is about a man from a jewish enclave in london who trades in autographs and whose adventures lead to an examination of the nature of fame and fortune , things the author has learned a great deal about in recent months , though they do n't sit particularly well with her it s the oddest thing in the world , having money , she says i do n't really know what you 're meant to do with it in the end , you kind of shuffle off the planet but now i 've made enough and i do n't need any more nor does she need the goods that companies seem eager to provide her with , now that she is very successful and modestly famous \( not to mention being young , black , tall and extremely stylish , in a white hat and fashionably cuffed jeans on this particular day \) people are always trying to give me stuff , she says i got an email the other day someone wanted me to carry around a photo zadie smith , who wrote white teeth three years ago , when she was 21 \( roderick field random house \)
rabat , morocco the photograph is wedged into a corner above the fireplace it is unlike the other framed items in hicham elguerrouj s room , the autographs of 16 other men who have held the world record in the mile , the magazine cover proclaiming him the mile s new king , the fistpumping joy at winning his second world championship in the metric mile these are all tokens of victory what elguerrouj keeps on equally prominent display is a reminder of forlorn defeat entering the final lap of the 1 , 500meter race at the 1996 atlanta olympics , he collided with the eventual winner and fell to the track he got to his feet and continued to run , but he finished 12th , dead last in a race that he believed he would have won he began to cry and a photographer caught his agony , producing the picture that elguerrouj keeps in his room at the moroccan track and field institute his left hand to his face , eyes closed , lower lip drooped in a disconsolate sob i thought it was the end of my career , said elguerrouj , who was 21 at the time this photo gives me the power to work very hard , to break the world record , to win the gold medal ten minutes after the race , king hassan ii of morocco reached him by cellular phone at the olympic stadium you are the best , said the king , who died in 1999 for us , you are the winner the moroccan news media treated elguerrouj s fall in the same understanding manner , and nike , his sponsor , even paid the 50 , 000 bonus it had promised for a gold medal , he said the king is responsible for all moroccans , and for him to say that i was still the best gave me a lot of confidence , he said at that moment of the phone call , he said , it was as if another elguerrouj was born a month later , elguerrouj defeated the olympic champion , noureddine morceli of algeria , and in the following years he took morceli s world records , running the 1 , 500 in 3 minutes 26 seconds and the slightly longer mile in 3 4313 he has lost only one race since atlanta , and he will be a clear favorite to win the metric mile at the 2000 summer games in sydney , australia he will turn 26 on sept 14 , a day before the olympics begin he looks younger , with his boyish haircut and long thin face god willing , he said , kissing his hands and putting them to his face , a gold medal would be a remarkable birthday present elguerrouj is the most accomplished athlete in this north african constitutional monarchy , which has long challenged kenya and ethiopia for distancerunning supremacy on the continent he is also a symbol of possibility for the young in a nation where 70 percent of the 30 million residents are under 30 , where half the population lives on less than 50 a month and the illiteracy rate is 50 percent he is considered the most visible ambassador of morocco , which is using sport including a revived national tennis program in hopes of increasing its international prominence and is seeking to be host to the 2006 world cup of soccer as a means of reviving its sluggish economy for decades , morocco has had trouble with its international profile in sports when nawal elmoutawakel became the first arab woman to win a gold medal by taking the 400meter hurdles at the 1984 los angeles olympics , and the great said aouita followed with a victory at 5 , 000 meters , many people confused morocco with monaco , said aziz daouda , the technical director for the moroccan track and field federation and the business manager for its top runners with the accomplishments of elguerrouj , he added , one kingdom is no longer mistaken for the other we are a country of lilliputians , said brahim boulami , who finished seventh in the 3 , 000meter steeplechase at the atlanta olympics we are not big and famous hicham for us is like nasa and boeing are for the united states it is good to be first in the world at something the stringent life of a runner rabat was unseasonably hot in midmarch , the temperature reaching 97 degrees , so elguerrouj decided to spend a few more days training in the mountain resort of ifrane , above the heat and humidity and pollution of the oceanside capital this was elguerrouj s 40th consecutive day in ifrane , living with other runners in a converted hotel , training on a local track and in the cedar forests outside of town in a year , he will spend four months at altitude , for the quiet and the increased benefits in oxygencarrying capacity the rest of his training is done at sea level in rabat he is one of 92 athletes , men and women , in morocco s elite training program , which provides for the athletes with 17 coaches , 3 doctors and 5 physical therapists nutritionists take care of the meals , the federation serves as his business manager and the training centers in rabat and ifrane both contain small mosques where elguerrouj , a devout muslim , prays five times a day he s one of the few people in the world blessed with unbelievable talent , he works incredibly hard , he s got a good support system and excellent coaching , said steve holman , america s top miler they take care of everything he does n't have to worry about anything but training as hard as possible , and clearly he does
after being trounced in iowa and surviving a fourpoint loss in new hampshire on tuesday , bill bradley managed to make it to the next phase of his campaign yesterday , flying into new york in preparation for a primary that his advisers say is critical to any hope he has of being the democratic candidate for president and who was there to greet him , but the very face of democratic politics in new york , former mayor edward i koch mr koch endorsed mr bradley s rival , al gore , during the vice president s first presidential campaign in 1988 , and proceeded to escort his candidate to a thirdplace defeat that mr gore has never forgotten but yesterday , at a rally with new york university students near washington square park , mr koch invoked the crusade for robert kennedy of 1968 in urging democrats to support mr bradley in the primary , as mr bradley applauded in approval of his new supporter for the democratic and republican candidates for president , yesterday marked a new period in the primary campaign , as the compact stages of iowa and new hampshire gave way to a sprawling contest stretching from coast to coast over the next five weeks it will culminate on march 7 , with a battery of republican and democratic primaries in 16 states including california , ohio , missouri , maryland , massachusetts and new york that the candidates view as so important they virtually constitute a national primary but none of them may prove to be as important , certainly to mr bradley , or as interesting , as the one he began campaigning for yesterday , with the slightly odd if revealing image of mr koch sharing the stage with him the new york primary has become a rite of passage for democratic candidates who want to be president although 16 democratic primaries and caucuses will take place between now and march 7 , if history is any guide , none will test and torture these candidates as much as new york s indeed , new york primaries have taken on legendary proportions among candidates and consultants , including those who have survived them and those who have not , for its peculiarly intense mix of ethnic politics , warring constituency groups , and a media market that was roundtheclock and personal well before that was standard in washington the game of politics is played with a sort of speed and toughness in new york that makes it tougher than anyplace else in the country , said susan estrich , who was the campaign manager for gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts , who won the 1988 democratic primary in the state it s fun to watch it s fun to talk about and it s decidedly not fun to be at the center of phil friedman , a longtime political consultant , said the new york primary is always an explosion waiting to happen new york is a state where you have to be wary of your friends , as well as your enemies the new york experience , as a generation of political consultants and candidates have come to remember it , will be at once intensified and diluted this year by the shape of the political calendar for the democrats , there are five weeks until the new york primary , or nearly five times the time span as between iowa and new hampshire that allows candidates plenty of time to get entangled by some new york issue , or stumble into some ethnic minefield but the fact that new york is one of many states this time means that mr bradley and mr gore will , their aides say , most likely be coming in here a day at a time , avoiding the sort of prolonged visit that paul begala , who advised president clinton in his 1992 primary battle in the state , likened to riding over niagara falls in a barrel mr begala said he had always thought it was apt that this was where mr clinton , in an interview with marcia kramer on wcbstv , made the remark about not inhaling that became a symbol of mr clinton s way with words it s a unique political culture , mr begala said it s arguably the most vibrant and exciting you 've just got to ride it the republicans are in a slightly different situation they have a primary in south carolina on feb 15 also , senator john mccain of arizona has been knocked off the ballot in 12 of new york s 31 congressional districts because of challenges by the state s party establishment mr mccain is challenging his disqualifications in court the basic outlines of the democratic contest in new york are fairly clear mr gore , having learned from his loss in 1988 , has collected the support of most of the party s democratic structure nearly all of the state s major elected democrats , leaders of key constituency groups and , perhaps most significant in a primary , unions thus , mr gore was accompanied on his walk through grand central terminal by , among other people , sheldon silver , the speaker of the state assembly , and h carl mccall , the state comptroller and likely candidate for governor there is a history of attractive insurgents winning democratic primary campaigns , and mr bradley is trying to put himself in that mold in contrast to the group that accompanied mr gore to grand central , mr bradley filled his stage yesterday with a more eclectic one , including lowerlevel officials , basketball players , the singer patti smith , political operatives and , of course , mr koch we 're the underdog in this campaign , given the fact that the vice president has tremendous resources in new york , said michael j del giudice , who is serving as mr bradley s new york campaign chairman he s been vice president and he s been working very hard at this mr gore s advisers sought to rebut this view which is , in fact , widely held among democrats and political professionals by noting mr bradley s geographic advantage he as a united states senator from new jersey and played basketball for the new york knicks new york is essentially bill bradley s home state , said chris lehane , mr gore s press secretary it s his madison square garden this is a state that should be his strongest against that known backdrop , new york advisers to mr gore and mr bradley are trying to prepare for the unknowns that have come to distinguish contests in this state will the candidates be asked , for example , to offer an opinion on the trial of four police officers charged with murdering amadou diallo \? \( if history is any guide , they should count on it \) will mr gore ask the rev jesse jackson to come to new york and campaign for him \? some of his supporters are pushing the move as a way of ensuring a heavy black turnout others worry that mr jackson remains a problematic figure among jewish voters , who remain a sizable factor in democratic primaries will the rev al sharpton , who has already complained about mr gore s refusal thus far to hold a public meeting with him , try to influence the contest \? but the most intriguing question might well end up being the interplay with a statewide contest in new york that has so far overshadowed the presidential race the battle between hillary rodham clinton and mayor rudolph w giuliani mrs clinton has said she will formally announce her senate candidacy on sunday , and will then begin a week of campaigning across the state she has endorsed mr gore for president mrs clinton and mr bradley share the same senior new york democrat senator daniel patrick moynihan , who is retiring as perhaps their most prominent local supporter mrs clinton has so far avoided offering any critical words about mr bradley but she could find herself under pressure to do so if mr gore feels that he is in danger of losing new york photo former senator bill bradley , with former mayor edward i koch of new york at his side , addressed a crowd yesterday at judson memorial church in lower manhattan mr koch

istanbul , dec 10 the man who shot pope john paul ii is among about 35 , 000 inmates who might qualify for release from overcrowded turkish prisons under an amnesty bill approved by the legislature furthermore , former prime minister necmettin erbakan , a leader of the country s islamic movement , would avoid serving a oneyear sentence for sedition for challenging the secular government in a 1994 speech he is supposed to start the sentence next month parliament approved the legislation 297 to 72 late on friday despite deep divisions over the issue the bill requires the approval of president ahmet necdet sezer , and people close to him said it was not certain that he would sign by reducing prison sentences by 10 years , the bill would free nearly half of the country s 72 , 000 inmates the beneficiaries would include murderers , robbers and hundreds of political prisoners some death sentences would also be commuted , though none have been carried out in turkey since 1984 however , the bill specifies that terrorists will still face the death penalty , which means that abdullah ocalan , the jailed kurdish rebel leader , could be executed rapists , corrupt government officials , drug traffickers and people convicted of certain crimes against the state , including kurdish guerrillas and leftist and islamic militants , also would not benefit from the amnesty whether mehmet ali agca , who shot the pope , would qualify is unclear he was extradited to turkey in june after being pardoned in italy for the 1981 attack in st peter s square in rome he had served nearly 20 years in prison he is now serving a 10year term for the murder of a newspaper editor in 1979 and is facing trial for armed robbery his lawyer , sevket can ozbay , told the associated press that he would try to get his client released , though mr agca would most likely remain in prison pending a decision in the robbery case while the government said the amnesty was necessary to improve conditions , families of crime victims and some human rights advocates criticized the bill ayten arslan assailed the prospect of freedom for a man who stabbed her 20yearold daughter nemit to death the man s 26year sentence was reduced to 95 years , and he would qualify for the amnesty i will never forgive him and the state does n't have the right to forgive him , mrs arslan said at a news conference here before the bill was passed
washington , feb 6 a report last week that most healthrelated web sites were not honoring their promises to keep personal information about visitors private offered a somewhat alarming snapshot of the state of privacy on the internet the group that conducted the survey from which the report was drawn , the california healthcare foundation , said its intent was to help health sites live up to their promises and win the trust of consumers but it caught government officials and privacy enforcement groups off guard with disclosures that confidential information was being disseminated through banner ads and thirdparty service providers and it underscored the growing policy debate over whether federal officials and private groups can adequately police such a fastgrowing and constantly changing new medium as the net in the five years since the federal trade commission began monitoring electronic commerce about five years ago , few privacy violations have come to light and none of the major groups formed to certify and oversee privacy practices has ever pulled a seal of approval from a member web site so when the california foundation said its study had determined that all but 3 of 19 sites surveyed were violating their own stated practices , privacy advocates held up the results as proof of their longtime assertions that selfregulation of online privacy , as promoted by the ftc and the clinton administration , defies effective enforcement they are not keeping pace with the internet explosion , said jason catlett , president of the junkbusters corporation , a privacy consulting concern in new jersey if you count the number of people in charge of enforcement and look at the growth of ecommerce sites , any way you measure it you 'd come to the conclusion that protection is not keeping up if indeed it ever was adequate the california study said the problems stemmed mostly from new technology that enables some banner advertisers to pick up any personal information a customer enters on the page where an ad is displayed in addition , the study s internet security consultant , richard m smith , said he found a leakage of information between the web sites that promise to keep information confidential and the thirdparty companies that gain access to that information while running services on the sites truste , one of the first and largest privacy certification programs , acknowledged on friday that it was surprised and alarmed to read the study , which identified potential violations by seven members of truste dave steer , a spokesman for truste , said it was investigating the sites identified in the study and was doing random audits of other members to see if they were disclosing information to advertisers and other third parties without saying so in their posted privacy policies truste said last week that it would alert all 1 , 300 of its members that they must include in their posted privacy policies disclosures of any contracts with third parties that could track the members or gain access to their personal data the ftc declined to comment on the health survey but an agency employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said the agency was taking these concerns very seriously on friday , a special 40member advisory committee held its first meeting at the ftc it will help write a report to congress on what steps companies should take to keep their databases secure and how much access consumers should have to the data collected about them further , the commission announced that it was planning a third annual internet sweep to survey privacy practices on the web but as with past studies , the ftc s announcement indicated that the agency would analyze only stated policies , not the actual practices that the california healthcare foundation examined though the california study looked only at health sites , mr catlett and mr smith both said it begged the question whether privacy problems on the internet were widespread there are similar problems on other sites , mr smith said when you have one company working with another , that s when privacy tends to fall by the wayside despite the troubling indicators , mr steer of truste said the government should maintain its handsoff approach to the internet since laws can be quickly outdated by new technologies in contrast , he said , truste requires its members to undergo annual reviews , a process that allows truste to educate sites about challenges posed by new technologies mr catlett , however , said baseline laws were needed to spell out for companies what they can and cannot do with private information they collect online and to allow consumers to take civil action when they think their rights have been violated at the moment , with the clinton administration saying selfregulation is the way we are going to go , that basically says , 'do whatever you want or do as little as you want , ' mr catlett said that s exactly the wrong message to send to companies that have strong economic incentives to collect and use personal information photo in an overflow room at the ftc , visitors watched on friday as a panel that will write a report on internet privacy met for the first time \( carol t powers for the new york times \)
mbarara , uganda , april 1 to the believers , the world was to extinguish at the year 2000 , and so last december was a time for forgiveness and , more practically , lastminute recruitment for the world to come members of the restoration of the ten commandments went house to house to visit former cult members , urging them to return before it was too late maria goreth sekibibi , 54 , left home on dec 22 , without so much as a goodbye to her husband , claudio , who had argued against her going back , partly because of the cult s slippery promise of painless salvation i was telling her all the time , 'jesus went to heaven after death , ' he said 'his mother , mary , went to heaven after death who are you to go to heaven without dying \? ' die she most probably did , along with what authorities here say at last count is some 923 other people , more deaths than in any cult in modern history with mass graves turning up nearly daily , the authorities fear that many more dead may yet be found , perhaps even hundreds more the world was stubborn on jan 1 , and did not end and the ugandan police now speculate that some cult members , who were required to sell their belongings and hand over the profits to the group , rebelled and asked for money back paulina zikanga , a 64yearold widow and a cult member from the group s inception until 1998 , said this was a constant problem cult leaders would set different dates for the end of the world , but the end never came when i was still there , some people already started saying 'how is it that the world does n't end \? ' she recalled they were insisting that if the world did n't end , they should refund their money if the deaths were murder which looks increasingly plausible , though no one can yet say for sure the police speculate that this unraveling of the cult leaders' new year s prophecy may have formed a motive , and another doomsday date was set for march uganda s president , yoweri museveni , has called the killings mass murder by these priests for monetary gain certainly the revised date for the end came with ceremony , and finality the cult had planned a huge celebration for march 15 , and one priest from the cult reportedly bought a strange kind of party favor 50 liters of sulfuric acid , which some investigators say may have helped fuel the fire that exploded in a cult church in kanungu on march 17 , finally alerting the world at the church , the pathologist counted 330 bodies , though the authorities now say 530 died in the blaze another party had been planned for a day later no cult members appear to have survived , though the police believe that some leaders including joseph kibwetere , 64 , a school administrator and middling politician , and credonia mwerinde , 48 , who claimed direct contact with the virgin mary may yet be alive , somewhere at the moment , the police are working on the theory that cult members may have been poisoned , because most of the bodies show no sign of violence there was also , apparently , little struggle , which may indicate that some cult members did go willingly to their deaths indeed , several former cult members said in interviews that part of the indoctrination concerned martyrdom , and from its earliest days the cult preached a gospel of doom and dire consequences from an angry god against people who had long forgotten his word abdan bishoboorokire , 54 , who joined the cult in 1990 , said members were required to fill out a questionnaire about whether they would die for their faith he quit in 1994 and returned to catholicism but he retained his fervor i would like to be a martyr , he said in his home near rugazi , where 155 bodies were found around the house of the former parish priest being a martyr would be good whether mass suicide or mass murder , no explanation for so many deaths is entirely satisfactory and as the details surrounding the deaths grow darker , what becomes clear is that the ten commandments cult was different from others that have periodically burst into public view by making apocalyptic prophecies and persuading or coercing followers to lie down and die in a single instant , usually in mere scores in uganda , incredibly , the deaths seem to have involved hundreds of people and to have taken place over weeks or perhaps months without any hint to the outside world the bodies have been dug out of latrines , from under fresh concrete in a former priest s dressing room , from a packed pit next to a banana field piles of whitened bodies many belonging to small children are not yet rotted enough to erode distinguishing marks of life at least one woman was pregnant another was lame one man showed signs of malaria that these grisly scenes unfolded in uganda is perhaps no coincidence the recent past has been scarred by violence in the 1970 s , the dictator idi amin organized rampages that claimed up to 300 , 000 lives in a country of 22 million while the 1990 s brought economic advances and a leader , mr museveni , who won much western support , the scourge of aids was rampant such difficulties , mr museveni said , make people develop fatalism , pessimism
in many parts of the country , a proposal for a superduper touristattracting megamall would be greeted with howls of protest , followed by reams of lawsuits not in syracuse , where many citizens are embracing the mall plan as a way to revive their struggling city their praise , however , is less enthusiastic than resigned a popular sign at a public hearing last month was , do you have a better alternative \? the mall could well become the largest shopping center in the country \( excluding the island of manhattan \) its developers , the pyramid management group , plan to triple the size of their existing mall , the carousel center , and turn it into a 103acre shopping and entertainment extravaganza , with hotels , restaurants and even an aquarium the current 16 millionsquarefoot mall would be expanded to 45 million square feet the leader in the enormous mall sweepstakes , the mall of america outside minneapolis , is 42 million square feet , although there are plans to expand it , too but metropolitan minneapolis is four times the size of syracuse , which has a population of only 735 , 000 minneapolis is also far more prosperous the average household income around the mall of america is about 66 , 000 , versus about 47 , 000 for households near the carousel center , according to data from the international council of shopping centers dozens of new malls , full of movie theaters , skating rinks and other attractions , are in the works across the country , the council reports none of them are as big as the one proposed for syracuse , and almost all of them are being built in booming areas but syracuse has only recently emerged from a decadelong recession during which it lost residents even the mall s supporters concede that syracuse seems an unlikely place for a mammoth mall intuition tells you this is n't going to be that great , said vito sciscioli , the commissioner of economic development for the city , from which the developers are seeking tax breaks for the 900 million project but , he said , consultants hired by the city to evaluate the plan told him , you 've got a hot one here the reason \? tourists the mall s backers think that millions of tourists will go to the expanded mall , bringing lots of cash into syracuse \( more than 1 billion , by one estimate \) luring them , the developers say , will be stores with outdoor themes , catering to hunters , campers and anglers after all , l l bean draws hordes to freeport , me , and the bass pro shop is the largest tourist attraction in the state of missouri , said bruce a kenan , a partner at pyramid tourists do seem to visit giant malls , especially those that bill themselves as theme parks opry mills , which opened in nashville in may and attracted 100 , 000 people on its first day , says about 30 percent of its visitors are not from tennessee foreign tourists account for more than 5 percent of the 425 million people who visit the mall of america \( which has an amusement park \) each year developers must court travel agents and tour operators and travel writers , however they spend a lot to attract people , said therese byrne , who writes the newsletter retail maxim is pyramid set up to do that \? she asked she added that she was a little dubious of the hunting and fishing theme , noting that 80 percent of shoppers are women but while many tourists shop when they travel , how many travel just to shop remains unclear most successful tourist malls are in places tourists already visit , like florida , southern california and next to the dallasfort worth airport though it is hardly a tourist mecca , syracuse does draw hundreds of thousands of people every year for the state fair , and crowds attend sporting events at the syracuse university the city is at the junction of the state thruway and interstate 81 there s huge snowbird traffic , and they need destinations along the way , said peggy r bendel , a senior vice president at development counsellors international the developers concede that were they not based in syracuse , they would not be pursuing the project if you did n't have the emotional attachment , you would n't do it , mr kenan said that sentiment may help pyramid calm fears expressed at a public hearing and in letters to the syracuse newspapers that the mall expansion will be a windfall for robert j congel , pyramid s founder it may prove less reassuring to the financial institutions backing the project , especially now that interest rates have gone up and enthusiasm for mall deals has cooled the developers said they would expand the mall in two stages , with construction beginning next spring they say the current mall draws 17 million visitors a year and is bursting at the seams we 're 98pointsomething leased , said stephen j congel , whose father , robert , is in charge of leasing space in the expanded mall pyramid built the palisades center in west nyack , ny , which was the target of community protests and lawsuits for more than a decade the company said the shopping mall was doing extremely well but not all of the developers' projects have panned out a shopping center in providence , ri , that pyramid started work on in 1983 changed hands in 1996 and finally opened last year and some of the partners in other pyramid projects recently sued the company and robert j congel , saying he siphoned money from some of his other malls to support the ones in syracuse and west nyack and to pay some of his own bills he and pyramid have denied the charges in court filings pyramid has had some financial problems , in part because the carousel center turned out to be far more expensive to build than expected the mall sits on the site of an old junkyard the land is so marshy that the mall does not sit on pilings but floats on the soupy ground water is pumped in or out to keep it stable the expanded mall would cover more of oil city , which was polluted by oil tanks , north of the city near the onondaga lake and canal one reason syracuse officials are supporting the mall is that the land will probably not find any other takers , unless the government cleans it up , said mr sciscoli , the city commissioner pyramid , which pays almost no real estate taxes now , has asked syracuse to defer levying any such taxes for 30 years the developer would then make payments in lieu of taxes to pay off taxexempt bonds , which would finance road improvements and parking garages mayor roy bernardi and the developers have agreed on the deal , which is under consideration by city and county legislators some in syracuse have suggested that the city would do better to grab real estate taxes on the current mall , rather than give them up for three decades to help finance a bigger mall minchin g lewis , the city auditor , said the city would get relatively little money from the mall s property taxes , but could get a lot more if the expanded mall succeeded the city s being asked to give the developer a baseball bat and hope it hits a home run , he said if it strikes out , we do n't lose anything

dallas , dec 9 commissioner bud selig , an executive of a team said , is studying contraction no , not contractions like do n't and would n't and are n't , but contraction as in consolidation , as in eliminating teams i ca n't honestly say i 've done that , selig said when asked about his study there are people who like contraction what i have said relative to contraction is the problems are so significant that every option is on the table that s one of them we 're no more advanced than that there s nothing critical about it jerry mcmorris of colorado , larry lucchino of san diego and peter angelos of baltimore have been the leading proponents of paring the number of teams to something less than 30 they believe in it very strongly , selig acknowledged there are others who do n't i 've heard from both sides i 've encouraged people who want to talk to me about it to do so even if it is only a signal to owners to discuss the issue , the commissioner seems to have changed his position on contraction earlier this year , when talk of it surfaced , he said he was aware of the talk but added , i really do n't accept that study or not , the idea of contraction has arisen because some owners see it as the solution , or part of the solution , to baseball s economic problems the owners see the problems as being created by player salaries , which continue to soar and leave lowrevenue clubs lagging further behind the highrevenue teams over several days last week , for example , the colorado rockies signed two freeagent pitchers for a total of 1745 million they acted just days after the yankees signed mike mussina for 885 million the montreal expos have not signed any players to those types of contracts lately they are exhibit a in the contraction debate jeffrey loria , the club s relatively new owner , dismisses the talk we are still struggling , he said , but we are confident that our situation will be resolved when baseball resolves its problems i plan on being in this game a very long time i cannot imagine anything that would take place that would take me away from this game that i love the expos are scheduled to receive about 24 million this year , most among the 13 recipients under baseball s revenuesharing plan their revenue problems were exacerbated by their inability to get a reasonable amount of money for local television rights the 800 , 000 they were offered would not have paid one player making the average salary loria , faced with the likelihood that the expos will not get a new stadium in montreal , would be far better off if he moved the team , perhaps to northern virginia the oakland athletics , another candidate for extinction in the eyes of some owners , would benefit from a move to the san jose area but owners of teams that draw fans and television viewers from those prospective locations , the baltimore orioles and the san francisco giants , have balked at the possibility of those moves and selig said recently that relocation would not be considered until a new labor agreement was in place the contract expires at the end of next season some skeptics have suggested that talk of contraction is a negotiating ploy , aimed at making the union nervous about losing jobs so that it would concede some important economic issues donald fehr , however , did not sound like a concerned labor leader when he was asked about the possibility of losing teams if that becomes a real possibility , i assume they 'll talk to us about it , fehr said asked if the owners could act unilaterally , he said i do n't know this is n't something we have an opinion on if it becomes real , we 'll have an opinion none of the owners linked contraction to labor negotiations mcmorris , in fact , called it a last resort i only talked about it in the beginning , he said , because if all else fails and they ca n't support a team in a market , we have to look at what we 're doing with revenue sharing and the central fund sharing that s going to some of these places contraction , mcmorris added , was brainstormed during our sessions with the blue ribbon panel he referred to the committee that produced a report on the state of baseball s economy , making recommendations about revenue sharing and payroll taxes if the recommendations outlined in this report are implemented , it said , there should be no immediate need for contraction but the owners who favor contraction believe management could gain control of player salaries because jobs would be in greater demand and players would sign for less money than they make now they feel the present system creates salary inflation by having too much money chasing too few players eliminating two to six teams , some proponents believe , would be ideal , creating a higher quality of baseball as well as lower salaries montreal , minnesota , oakland and the two florida teams are the candidates most often mentioned no owner of those teams , however , would find the idea palatable even though major league baseball would pay for the franchises

sydney , australia , sept 28 for nearly every firsttime olympian , even one with lofty goals and an abundance of talent , tonight s achievement would have been more than enough for marion jones , it was merely the end of phase 2 after wringing the suspense out of the 200 meters with an ease and controlled class that made it clear she would win before she came charging out of the curve , jones now has two gold medals and the first sprint double at the olympics since florence griffith joyner in 1988 jones s time of 2184 seconds was the best of the season and she won by a stunning 13 feet , but instead of the wideeyed , fistpumping paroxysms of joy which normally would accompany such a feat , there was only a glimmer of delight on her face and a somewhat subdued victory lap the remarkable jones is far from finished here , and she is intent on not losing her focus not in the face of doping allegations against her husband c j hunter in the middle of what were scripted to be her games not in the face of two gold medals when there are three more to be won it s not even halfway over , jones said tonight , as she made her way cordially and professionally past a long line of television crews as you all know , i'm here for greater things than two gold medals i came to prove to myself it s possible to walk away from sydney with five gold medals so in a certain way i'm checking them off the list , but i'm still enjoying them she could have been excused for gloating her victory margin of 43hundreths of a second over the silver medalist , pauline davisthompson of the bahamas , was the largest in an olympic 200 since 1960 when another africanamerican , wilma rudolph , dashed to gold in rome not even griffith joyner , in her season of dominance in 1988 , won by as much in seoul jones later made it clear that it had been more of a struggle than it might have appeared , that she was not in a class by herself but she said that while sitting next to davisthompson and the bronze medalist susanthika jayasinghe of sri lanka after jones left , davisthompson set the record straight i think marion definitely is in a class by herself , davisthompson said she s a very talented athlete and you can take nothing away from her she knows how to compete under pressure , and that s very tough hunter , the reigning world shotput champion , was watching from the stands tonight after it was revealed on monday that he had tested positive in july for the steroid nandrolone just because something like this comes up does n't mean he s going to hide in his apartment , jones said , after embracing her husband during her victory lap that s ridiculous asked if she feared her husband s positive test might give the public the impression that she was not clean , jones responded coolly , i do n't have that fear , because the people that know me and support me and train me and coach me know i'm a clean athlete so i do n't think that at all nor does jones think that the revelations and resulting news media frenzy will have an impact on her performance here as she goes after gold medals in the long jump on friday night and the 4x100 and 4x400 relays on saturday none of us just started training this year , and this has been a dream of mine for a lot of years , she said to let one event in your life , as dramatic as it might be , ruin it , that would n't be worth it at all while jones surprised no one by winning the women s 200 , konstantinos kenteris of greece surprised everyone but himself by winning the men s 200 entering the olympics , kenteris s personal best was 2025 seconds not even good enough to put him in the top 20 in the world but tonight , in a close and relatively slow race , he got the better of the favorite ato boldon down the stretch to win in 2009 the silver went to darren campbell of britain in 2014 the bronze to a legweary boldon in 2020 , 47hundredths slower than his personal best that s what the olympics are about the guy nobody counts on having the race of his life , said boldon , who won a silver medal in the 100 on saturday he did , and i'm happy for him not nearly as happy as kenteris s fellow greeks were for him with the olympics coming their way in four years , they have their first men s gold medal in a running event since spiridon louis won the marathon in the first modern olympics in 1896 in athens kenteris , 27 , will now have a busy social calendar between now and 2004 though he was unknown to track mavens , he was not unknown to boldon , who beat him in the world junior championships in 1992 since then , boldon has gone on to fame and the beginnings of a fortune , while kenteris has struggled with a chronic groin injury and paid the bills by becoming a physical education teacher kenteris began to hit his stride when he switched from the 400 to the 200 this season and joined a team of sprinters that includes the women s 100meter silver medalist ekaterini thanou other winners tonight included ivan pedroso of cuba in the long jump erki nool of estonia in the decathlon , and yanina korolchik of belarus in the women s shot put pedroso did not secure victory until the last of his six attempts , jumping 28 feet 3 4 inch to leap past australia s flamboyant jai taurima , who already had jumped 2710 1 4 with a lot of vocal support from the 110 , 000 fans in the stands roman schurenko \( 273 1 4 \) of ukraine won the bronze for the first time in olympic history , no american man won a medal in the long jump \( excluding the 1980 games which the americans boycotted \) while nool , the first estonian to win a gold , was below par in the pole vault and the javelin , he still managed to outscore the opposition with 8 , 641 points that was more than 300 points lower than the world record held by the czech decathlete and defending world champion tomas dvorak , who finished sixth while suffering from a torn stomach muscle dvorak s countryman roman sebrle won the silver with 8 , 606 points chris huffins of the united states the bronze with 8 , 595 points huffins led after nine events , but after a relatively poor javelin throw left him with only a 14point edge over nool , huffins knew that his chances of holding onto any medal were slim if he did not record a personal best in the 1 , 500 he would do that and more , slicing 1249 seconds off his previous best to hold onto third place , 28 points ahead of britain s dean macey i do n't think any of us had an idea how fast i could run , said the 30yearold huffins , i think i earned a lot of people s respect today , including my own the american middledistance runner marla runyan has earned respect with her success on the track despite a visual impairment that has left her legally blind tonight , she qualified for the 1 , 500meter final by finishing sixth in her semifinal in a time of 4 minutes 614 seconds i started to feel the pressure , and then i thought about it and turned it around , she said it s not pressure it s an opportunity i have the opportunity to show the world and kids that are losing their vision what life is going to be like 'now there s a girl who s legally blind , and she s in the olympic final' i hope parents out there will say , i'm going to let my child be whatever she wants to be as for jones , the questions are whether she can overcome her technical shortcomings to beat heike drechsler of germany , fiona may of italy and others in the long jump and whether her teammates can give her enough help in the relays without jones in the lineup , the bahamas won the 4x100 at last year s world championships davisthompson , a vivacious and voluble 34yearold , was on that team we are still the underdog , she told jones tonight , and we love being in that spot it s just going to make our victory a little bit sweeter photos konstantinos kenteris , left , won the 200 and became the first greek man to win a gold medal in a running event since spiridon louis won the marathon in 1896 in

in a few months , john f welch will step down as chief executive of the general electric company , leaving behind a remarkable 20year run of earnings growth and near cultlike devotion and the three frontrunners to succeed this 20thcentury business icon fit a pattern all are gungho resultsgetters for the company and all are white men in june , ge promoted three more executives who stand ready to replace any frontrunner who bails out if he is not anointed as mr welch s successor these three , too , fit the mold stellar growthandearnings producers , and all white men where are the women \? the blacks \? the latinos \? the asians \? together , these groups make up about 40 percent of ge s domestic work force , but they are not easy to find in the top executive corps of ge , which is regarded in many management circles as america s most admired corporation just 64 percent of its corporate officers are women , compared with an average of 119 percent for all the fortune 500 companies , according to a 1999 survey by catalyst , a nonprofit research and advisory group that studies women in business of the 20 businesses that provided 90 percent of ge s earnings in 1999 , only one is headed by someone who is not white ge industrial systems has an africanamerican president and chief executive , lloyd g trotter , who is also a senior vice president of the parent corporation and the first woman to become chief executive of a ge business sandra l derickson , at ge capital auto financial services left unceremoniously in 1999 after the fastgrowing autoleasing unit posted a sharp earnings decline and had to be restructured a man replaced her ge has had diversity on its agenda for at least three decades , and its efforts to retain women and minorities have intensified in recent years we have put a lot of programs in place to make sure that ge s global diversity is real and lasting , and we measure our progress , mr welch said responding to questions by email , he conceded that ge is n't where we want to be yet , but pointed to current efforts to move more diverse talent through ge s managerial pipeline lest anyone think that mr welch has gone touchyfeely in his final months at the helm , he stressed that diversity was a bottomline necessity today diversity is n't just a nice corporate program , he said it s a business and a global reality the 90 s have been largely about global growth and going after the brightest minds , wherever they may be in the world he added , i believe the future has never been better for a truly diverse ge in the here and now , however , ge s allmale and nearly allwhite leadership slate raises intriguing issues after all , it is no longer unheardof for large american companies to be led by women or minorities american express , maytag and hewlettpackard are highprofile examples catalyst has measured steady annual increases in women corporate officers since it started counting in 1995 , and spencer stuart , the executive search firm , reports a small but growing minority presence in american boardrooms under mr welch , ge has become a gold standard for management practices detractors may criticize its mass layoffs and chemical spills , but its managerial training and promotion practices inspire widespread praise and imitation to many in corporate america , ge is a meritocracy par excellence a place where managers are judged on their ability to meet tough financial goals , not on whether they speak with the right accent , attended the right schools or had the right father why , then , the white , male leadership slate \? is there something about this acclaimed corporate culture that is inhospitable to women and minorities \? dozens of interviews with current and former ge managers turned up much agreement that ge s efforts at promoting diversity had fallen short , at least until recently but there was no unanimity about why it really is a paradox , said karen nelson , a former ge medical systems marketing manager who served as the diversity director of that business from 1991 to 1994 some pointed to the company s practice of grooming talent through frequent relocations , saying that it was tougher on women , and unappealing to minority managers , who would have to drag spouses and children to parochial towns others said ge s engineering history was the reason , arguing that today s statistics reflect the difficulties that all engineering businesses had in attracting women and minorities as trainees years ago mr trotter , ge s most senior black executive , thinks those theories let management , including himself , off too easily if i had managed my business the way i had managed diversity , i think i 'd have gotten fired , he said , noting that ge requires every business unit to be first or second in its market , or risk sale or closure there is no such requirement for diversity the priorities have now changed , mr trotter said , adding that new measures to recruit and retain more africanamericans , designed by ge s black managers themselves , were more likely to work these initiatives , which have more recently been adapted by ge s women , latinos and asianamericans , pose no challenge to ge s culture of meritocracy , but try to bolster participants' confidence , groom them for promotion and give them a better idea of how they fit into the corporate structure still , others who are knowledgeable about ge s workings wonder whether diversity can be achieved within a system that prizes growth and earnings above all else
kostroma , russia nineteenyearold anya , a deaf , blueeyed china doll of a girl , was hemorrhaging out of control after giving birth dr aleksandr n klesarev and his team fought to save her as her heart stopped three times , as her uterus had to be excised , as she lost such a river of blood that soon nothing ran in her veins but transfusions anya and her baby survived , and dr klesarev recalled that recent case with the joy of victorious battle emotionally , acute medical crisis is the easy part of his job it is the chronic crisis that grinds him down , him and the nearly 700 , 000 other russian physicians it is feeling like beggars at work and paupers at home it is scrounging for essential medicines in a system fraying and breaking from poverty even as rising illness and mortality mean that people need doctors more than ever it is getting their trained hands calloused from working in the private vegetable plots that feed their families soviet doctors never had anything like the status and money of western doctors the medicine they practice was considered to be below the levels of the west , the system always suffered from shortages , and the social status of a provincial general practitioner was akin to a schoolteacher s , respectable , but modest that was especially so in provincial centers like kostroma , an ancient city of 280 , 000 on the volga river known among russians as the wellspring of the romanov dynasty , a city that was in decline long before the soviet union collapsed but under communism , doctors at least lived no worse than anybody else and maybe a bit better that has changed caught between an impoverished government that cannot afford universal medical care and a deeprooted soviet scorn for medicineforprofit , many of russia s doctors , especially here in the provinces , seem worn thin , out of canteen water but still marching ahead when everything else took the capitalist road of development , and medicine was left on the socialist road , we got an imbalance that is killing medicine , said dr aleksei golland , one of a handful of private doctors in kostroma it s an economic death , he said if it continues like this , i see the murder of medicine in that the masses of quality doctors do n't have ground to stand on a surgeon has to plant potatoes to feed his family ask what keeps the governmentpaid doctors going and the same words keep coming up vocation duty mercy naked enthusiasm a hospital department head said he could not afford to buy a suit a gynecologist boiled potatoes for lunch in an office teakettle some doctors , city officials say , often walk to work because they cannot afford to pay the equivalent of a dime to ride a bus 'they hope for the best' aleksandr n smirnov , until recently the chief doctor of the 900bed kostroma regional hospital , recalled that he had to take a string of vacation days because he needed the salary advance to pay urgent bills doctors and other hospital staff members generally work sixhour shifts , he said , but so many now extend their hours for extra pay that the 1 , 760 jobs in the hospital are filled by just 1 , 230 workers still , the doctors keep donning the high cylindrical hats that go with their white coats , keep scribbling diagnoses on flimsy newsprint , keep trudging to house calls by bus and by foot beg them , tell me something good ! and they reply at least we can talk freely about this at least we do n't stand in lines anymore we have access to western drugs and technology and literature now , though rarely the money for them or for doctors with profitable specialities , life can be better than it was and for the population , most medical care is still free , at least theoretically young people also have not been deterred there are four or five applications for every spot at the yaroslavl medical academy , a school housed in graceful prerevolutionary buildings where many of kostroma s doctors studied , said yuri novikov , its rector many of the roughly 500 students come from medical dynasties , he said , people who hear about medicine beginning in their diapers , from their mothers and grandfathers they know they will not get rich , but believe that at least a good doctor can always find work our people have a good trait they hope for the best , said marina korzina , an 18yearold student at the academy we have enthusiasm we can develop without equipment if you look at the past , we did n't think about the material side of things a few doctors are doing pretty well there are a handful of legally private doctors and there are the doctors who practice a sort of blackmarket medicine in which they operate in state facilities , but charge their own little tolls a 1997 national survey estimated that russian families were charged some 45 billion that year for medical care that was supposed to be free and paid 14 billion more in bribes no doctor admitted taking such payments , but all acknowledged that such fees went beyond the old custom of giving doctors gifts candy or liquor , usually for good treatment one kostroma newspaper actually published a list of going prices for free medical services but for many doctors , this is still unthinkable after generations of providing free service
washington , oct 3 as a mother and librarian at a suburban high school outside washington , susan madden holds few illusions about the sexual innocence of teenagers she has overheard girls chattering in the corridors about condoms , shuddered at the scantily dressed stars on music videos and come across students' notes that read like intrepid dispatches from between the sheets now , it s everywhere , in your face , she said none too pleased , ms madden , a mother of three , turns to public schools for help there s so much bad information out there , and learning it from their friends is even worse while clashes over sex education often focus on parents who fear schools have been too permissive in teaching about sexuality , a recent survey suggests that the overwhelming majority of parents want schools to provide more , not less , sex education once children reach their teenage years and they want discussions to cover a wide array of topics abstinence , avoiding pregnancy , sexually transmitted diseases , abortion , even sexual orientation the consensus found in the survey by the henry j kaiser family foundation , a health research organization , appeared largely consistent throughout the country , and cut across socioeconomic groups it also blurred the lines of a polarized debate between advocates of a conservative approach that frames marriage as the only acceptable venue for sexual relations and a more liberal one that says teenagers should receive comprehensive information about sex , delivered without value judgments instead , parents said schools should borrow from both sides , discussing abstinence , but also advising students about how to use condoms , discuss birth control with a partner and get tested for aids parents want it all , said steve rabin , a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation the kaiser report polled 1 , 501 sets of parents and students , as well as teachers and principals , from february to may 1999 , with a margin of error of three percentage points for parents , teachers and students , and a margin of error of six percentage points for principals the survey uncovered a gap between what parents say they want and what schools deliver nearly twothirds of parents said sex education should last half a semester or more , and 54 percent said boys and girls should be taught in separate classes the typical class , though , includes boys and girls and consumes just one or two periods of a more general course in health education almost all classes teach children about the dangers of contracting aids and other sexually transmitted diseases , along with the basics of reproduction and some discussion of abstinence but most parents want sex education to cover much more some 84 percent want sex education to explain how to obtain and use birth control even more parents want schools to teach children how to be tested for hiv or aids , how to respond to pressure to have sex , discuss birth control with a partner and deal with the emotional consequences of sex they want schools to tell students what to do if they are raped four out of five parents want teachers to discuss abortion with their children , and three out of four want their children to learn about homosexuality and sexual orientation in the classroom benita garcia , a 40yearold homemaker and mother of three in suburban maryland , said she believed teenagers needed to learn about sex in school they 're living a crazy life , she said sometimes they do n't listen to what the parents have to say they think we 're antiquated with a 13yearold daughter , though , she is worried that talking about sex with students too early could open their mentality when they 're not ready for it heather e cirmo , a spokeswoman for the family research council , a conservative research group in washington , said the report s findings would not change her organization s position favoring abstinence until marriage , with no instructions about obtaining birth control or using condoms to prevent diseases we believe that the parents who are participating in the study have been duped into believing that comprehensivebased sex education is what s best for their children , ms cirmo said if you have a standardsbased approach to sex that says abstinence is what we expect from you , teens will live up to that the kaiser foundation s findings confirmed earlier , if less thorough , polls tracking parental attitudes toward sex education various polls have found steadily increasing support since the 1970 s for teaching about birth control in sex education courses now , as the generation that matured during the sexual revolution is watching its own children come of age , support for frank discussions of sexuality with them has become nearly universal many parents say the threat of aids lends particular urgency to such talks a 1981 survey done by the gallup organization , on behalf of the phi delta kappa association of professional educators , showed 70 percent of americans believed young people should learn about sex in high school of them , 84 percent believed high schools should teach about sexually transmitted diseases , a figure that was up to 98 percent of all parents in the kaiser report some 54 percent of those favoring sex education in 1981 believed it should cover abortion , a sentiment now shared by 79 percent of all parents and 45 percent of those who favored teaching about sex in high schools in 1981 wanted courses to include some discussion of homosexuality today , 76 percent of parents want teachers to discuss sexual orientation with their teenagers
lisbon , june 1 president clinton said today that a historic peace agreement between the israelis and palestinians was within view now , and he urged both sides to make whatever compromises were needed to reach an agreement in remarks after a 90minute meeting with israel s prime minister , ehud barak , in this seaside capital , mr clinton also announced that he was sending secretary of state madeleine k albright to the middle east next week in an effort to work with both leaders on narrowing the gaps between them and he said that he would meet soon with the palestinians' leader , yasir arafat , in washington mr clinton is also prepared to convene a threeway camp davidstyle summit meeting in washington with mr barak and mr arafat , a senior administration official briefing reporters afterward said but before that could happen , both sides would have to make substantial progress , the official said both leaders know from me and they know from their own experience that they now have to be prepared to make an intense effort and to do things that they have not done in the past with real courage and vision if we 're actually going to get a framework agreement that deals with the outstanding issues , said mr clinton , who met with mr barak before heading to berlin for the second leg of a weeklong trip that is to be his last visit to europe as president the president s remarks underscored his frustration that the israelis and palestinians have not made more progress toward completing a final peace accord by their selfimposed deadline of sept 13 negotiations in stockholm aimed at drafting an outline for a final settlement were suspended last week after violent protests in gaza and the west bank that agreement is supposed to settle issues that have been unresolvable for decades the size and shape of a palestinian state , the future of jerusalem and the fate of palestinian refugees before the meeting today , mr barak showed just how tense the atmosphere between the israelis and palestinians is when he accused mr arafat of stalling in the negotiations in recent weeks , we have seen some dragging of feet in regard to the running of negotiations , mr barak told reporters he added , we are trying to initiate a major move forward mr arafat responded , saying it was israel that was stalling the talks , not the palestinians they are the side that is wasting time and not moving toward peace , mr arafat said today in gaza the strong language was a significant change in tone for mr barak , who almost never engages in public criticism of any of his adversaries , even his political opponents at home his comments today could have simply reflected that he is actually upset with the palestinians and the lack of progress or his statement could have been part of the routine backandforth of public diplomacy that mr barak is known to loathe , and seldom use but his uncharacteristically strong words may have been timed to appear resolute before the israelis just as he is apparently ready , according to leaks in the press , to make longdelayed concessions in the negotiations , which are expected to resume this weekend or sooner , though it is not yet clear where it has also been evident from mr clinton s tone during this trip just how much he wants to conclude a peace agreement between israel and the palestinians in the final months of his presidency , and that he is prepared to invest the time it would take to do so on some issues , like kosovo , european security and trade , mr clinton has sounded at times as if business is over for instance , his discussion of a proposal on a limited missile defense system lacks the passion that he brings to his discussion of peace between israelis and palestinians the united states will do everything we can to help them pass this milestone , he said in remarks made to the staff at the american embassy in lisbon this is tough work if it were easy somebody would have done it a long time ago but actually , it is within view now mr clinton and his top aides on the middle east believe that israel s withdrawal from lebanon a week ago has transformed the political landscape in the region and created a new opening for a breakthrough several times in briefing reporters , the senior administration official referred to the new reality on the ground and the moment that will not last forever mr clinton made that clear at a news conference on wednesday when he called the israeli withdrawal from lebanon daring , adding that it imposes a much greater sense of urgency on all the parties to make peace the flurry of activity by mr clinton as his presidency nears its end is reminiscent of the push for an arabisraeli peace by the reagan administration in 1988 back then , the moment to be seized was the palestinian uprising known as the intifadeh , which prompted a new peace initiative by secretary of state george p shultz both mr barak and mr arafat have said their goal is to reach agreement by midseptember if they do not , mr arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare a palestinian state
nagoya , japan akio toyoda is japan s willliam clay ford jr widely regarded as the heir to the throne at the toyota motor corporation by virtue of both his bloodlines and his experience , he seems well on his way to taking over one of japan s most distinguished and financially sound companies but mr toyoda has chosen a somewhat unorthodox means of proving himself he has set out to demonstrate that even a bastion of the economic old guard known as japan inc can make waves in the new economy his pet project , a web site called gazoocom , is widely regarded as evidence that japan s corporate monoliths will find it far easier to thrive and compete in an informationtechnologyenriched economy than many experts originally imagined gazoo is helping toyota speed up the disposal of used cars , cutting the time between orders placed and payment received and providing a treasure trove of customer data it is also enabling the company to retain young , restless employees who might otherwise strike out for bit valley , japan s version of silicon valley the big companies were slow to move at first , but now everyone is incubating new businesses inside of them , said joichi ito , president and founder of neoteny , an incubator backed by whitney company their delay has actually become an advantage because they have all of the cash and the markets are cheap right now similarly , the corporations' reluctance to cut jobs , long criticized as a major drag on the japanese economy , is also now working to their benefit , mr ito said the brains are still at the big companies , he said they 've never quit or been pushed out , so all the good new economy people are still sitting in the old economy companies thus , toyota s web venture is thriving , and fujitsu and the nec corporation are locked in a fierce battle to determine which of them will be the america online of japan even ntt , the former government telephone monopoly whose high prices make it the new economy s worst enemy , is embracing new technology that is likely to make it the leading provider of lowcost , highspeed internet connections and sophisticated telecommunications services that shift will be much to the chagrin of several small , new companies that have been counting on ntt to be too big , too dumb and too slow to compete in new markets to the extent that japan s economy is a reflection of the efforts of companies like these , their metamorphoses suggest there are reasons for optimism despite statistics indicating that growth over the short term may be stagnant at best , and despite fears that the financial sector is lurching toward another crisis still plagued by too much bad debt japan s big companies , only recently dismissed as the brontosauruses of the global economy , are reinventing themselves to stay competitive , and therein lies hope for the economy to be sure , not all japanese companies understand the need to transform themselves , and even those that do are moving cautiously gazoo the name is derived from the two japanese characters for visual , celebrating the site s ability to bring the showroom to the customer was started as a venture business inside toyota , largely to retain young employees chafing at the seniority system of advancement the company has been up and running for the last two years , but planning for it began about five years ago the directors thought gazoo was just a hobby for young kids , said mr toyoda , who is 44 and the only son of shoichiro toyoda , the company s honorary chairman so we did n't get any money to develop it when the gazoo team wanted to buy a computer to test its online venture in a dealership in shikoku , the smallest and least populated of japan s four main islands , the board turned down the request for money so mr toyoda put up a little less than 2 , 000 of his own money to buy components , and the team assembled a computer we did it at less than onethird of what it would have cost to buy the same thing , mr toyoda said proudly maintaining the computer was a frustration during a meeting in hokkaido , mr toyoda received an urgent call on his cell phone from the dealer in shikoku , complaining that it had crashed and asking him to please send someone immediately to repair it a gazoo team member was hastily dispatched , only to discover that the plug had been pulled out of the socket that cost me 80 , 000 yen , mr toyoda said not costefficient one might even assume that toyota had it out for gazoo the company housed its fledgling web business in a brand new office building , but on the 42nd floor a floor that companies in this country traditionally shun because the number 42 is read shi ni , which means death in japanese a toyota spokesman insisted , however , that the floor number said nothing about corporate sentiment toward gazoo the rent was cheap because of the floor number , he said that s what we care about at toyota however skeptical headquarters may have been , the company now appears fully committed to gazoo in june , mr toyoda who studied business at babson college in wellesley , mass , and has worked in various parts of the company since 1984 was named to toyota s board , an unusual appointment for one so young also this year , gazoo was officially placed into a separate division , along with some of toyota s other businesses related to venture capital the action was regarded as a sign of commitment to them top executives have supported us , mr toyoda said
shelter island , ny , july 28 he is not your gardenvariety homeless guy sitting on a plastic lawn chair in a grubby white tshirt and jeans as his two dogs wrestle nearby , john schultheis looks more like a rugged camper than a homeless man battling the brutal city streets his version of a park bench is a grassy field on shelter island , where he sleeps in a tent he bought for 55 at kmart he cooks meals of chicken or hamburgers on a minigrill , talks to his wife on a cell phone and even manages to run his own business every few weeks , he mows but as far as mr schultheis is concerned , he is homeless he said he and his wife , maria , were kicked out of their rental home last month when someone made an offer to buy it that the couple could not match believe me , i really have nowhere to live , said mr schultheis , 36 , who moved into his tent july 7 his wife is living with a nearby family for whom she works as a caretaker mr schultheis was invited to stay there , too , but declined , saying he did not want to be a burden this was my last possible option , mr schultheis insisted this was the only way my wife and i could both survive , save some money until we find a more permanent place to live but in his sleepy hometown of shelter island , nestled between the north and south forks on the eastern end of long island , where his family roots date back five generations , his decision has raised the eyebrows of a few town officials , who have recently ordered him off the property the island is hardly the place for crime the first and only recorded murder in its 350year history took place in 1998 or the homeless to those who call shelter island home , it s a place where almost everyone knows everyone else s business , where an old couple sit out on the porch in rocking chairs waving to passersby , where shop owners leave freshly cut flowers unattended outside their stores , trusting that their customers will pay so , mr schultheis became sort of an oddity when he billed himself as shelter island s first homeless man at a recent town board meeting mr schultheis s longtime friend daniel calabro , a local businessman who owns the lot that he is living on , was issued a summons two weeks ago for allowing him to live there according to the summons , mr calabro is violating a town code that says landowners can allow someone to camp on their property only temporarily mr schultheis says he is a bit surprised at the fuss the town is making and the attention he is receiving from the local press two weeks ago , his story landed on the front page of the shelter island reporter , the town s weekly newspaper vocal town officials have called mr schultheis s actions an embarrassment to the town william banks , the town s building inspector , who issued the summons , says this is the first time he has ever heard of such a thing he has lived here since 1960 and the town has received at least 50 complaints about mr schultheis s tent , he said mr banks says that if one person were allowed to camp indefinitely on the island , then more people , homeless or not , could start pitching their tents mr banks also scoffs at the idea that mr schultheis is really homeless because he has a job and money in the bank it s a very bold , inyourface move , he said i think he s a fool he s trying to prove some kind of a point , but this is no way to go about doing it but mr schultheis says that is all bunk he is doing only what any homeless man would do , he argues mr schultheis says he is just one of many of the native islanders caught in the battle between the island s wealthy summer visitors and yearround residents , most of whom make a modest income working in family stores or operating the ferries that take people on and off the island shelter island has fewer than 3 , 000 inhabitants yearround but during the summer , the island becomes a cozy vacation spot to those with money to spend who shun the glamour of the celebritysaturated hamptons to the south , and the population exceeds 7 , 500 real estate costs have skyrocketed in recent years summer rents for two or threebedroom houses average 10 , 000 a month , which mr schultheis says he does not have furthermore , he says , finding a place where his two beloved labradors , daisy and finneas , can stay was next to impossible mr schultheis says the homes he could afford to rent were already snatched up by outsiders , and none allowed pets people have asked me , 'why do n't you put them in kennels \? ' he said i do n't know how you feel about animals , but these dogs are my children it s like telling me to adopt my kids out mr schultheis says his family has been unable to help his father died two months ago , and his mother , who was married to his father for 53 years , is still grieving he gave up searching and asked mr calabro to allow him to pitch a tent on his vacant parcel mr calabro agreed , provided that he mowed the grassy lot every few weeks and found a bathroom elsewhere maria schultheis then moved in with glenn and gail heinze and their three children the heinzes also invited mr schultheis to stay , but he said he was afraid of putting additional strain on his wife s employers , so he opted for the tent i may be homeless , but i have manners , he said i did n't want to get in the way the dogs wake up early in the morning and bark i do n't want anything to reflect badly on my wife mr schultheis grew up on the island in a welltodo family , his father a prominent dermatologist he said that as a teenager , he went off to boarding school in dublin , nh , then attended a college in switzerland for a year before transferring to a technical college in new york , where he graduated he says he is fluent in french , german and italian seven years ago , he and his wife moved to shelter island , with hopes of making it a permanent home i had dreams of living and dying here , he says but now it looks like i may have to go some place i can afford he and his wife have stored all their belongings in the heinzes' basement each morning , mr schultheis walks to the heinzes' house with his dogs to wash up and change into clean clothes before heading to work his wife s salary has been the schultheises' main source of income since they were kicked out of their home mr schultheis also has a business he started a few months ago called honeydo homecare , doing chores and odd jobs , like moving furniture or cleaning out the garage , for people who are not physically able at some point or another , most town residents have seen mr schultheis s tent pitched off ferry road , the main road that winds through the island most either giggle at his eccentricity or sympathize with his plight mr schultheis hopes to find a place to live by september , when rental prices go down if not , he is planning to leave the island to find a place where real estate prices are a little cheaper he plans to accompany his friend mr calabro to court sometime in the next week to try to get a judge to let mr schultheis stay on the lot longer mr calabro shook his head at the turn of events during the last few weeks i'm just trying to help the guy out , he said no one wants to live like this forever photo john schultheis and his labradors , finneas and daisy , next to his tent on a friend s lot on shelter island he says he is homeless , but town officials say he is illegally camping \( nicole bengiveno the new york times \)
washington behind the growing debate over whether to build a new national missile defense against countries like north korea lies an old and bitter dispute over how to interpret the frustratingly limited intelligence data on one of the world s most secretive nations witness this incident , not previously disclosed secretary of state madeleine k albright had just completed an upbeat , topsecret briefing for the house leadership in july 1998 on the clinton administration s dealings with north korea when one lawmaker posed the question he had been waiting to ask what was dr albright s assessment of a recent intelligence report suggesting that north korea had built a storage installation that housed components for nuclear warheads \? and how long had she known about the report \? dr albright , according to several people who were present , replied that she had learned of the evidence just two weeks earlier in a startling departure from the united front that top administration officials usually present to congress , lt gen patrick hughes , director of the defense intelligence agency , immediately contradicted the secretary of state madame secretary , i have to correct the record , said general hughes , whose agency had produced the report , according to others who were there you were briefed on that intelligence a year ago that tart exchange offered an unusual glimpse of the depth of the disagreements between the nation s senior diplomats and the pentagon s top intelligence officials over how to interpret the few hard facts available about north korea lawmakers said the dispute had spurred them to demand an independent review of the evidence on north korea , which the administration eventually acceded to with the appointment of former defense secretary william j perry as special adviser much of the debate stems from arcane arguments over photos or snippets of intelligence from agents state department officials say the pentagon intelligence agency , known for its hawkish outlook , has been painting far too black a picture , surmising on sketchy evidence that north korea has up to 10 new installations working on a covert nuclear program the state department officials said their skepticism about the quality of the defense intelligence agency s work had been deepened by a 1999 incident in which american diplomats pressed the north koreans to allow inspections of a site the agency had said was part of a nuclear program nothing was found for their part , intelligence analysts at dia are said to believe that the state department has been far too willing to overlook reports of suspicious activity in their view , the failure of a single inspection does not mean the united states should stop pressing the north koreans about suspect installations , including the building suspected of housing warhead components the crisis over north korea s nuclear program began in 1993 , when analysts reviewing evidence from american spy satellites concluded that a north korean nuclear reprocessing center at yongbyon had gone hot had begun to process plutonium american intelligence analysts then watched as the north koreans dumped radioactive nuclear fuel out of the heavy water reactor into a cooling pool in order to replace it with fresh fuel rods the spent fuel rods contained enough plutonium for 10 nuclear warheads , officials said the activity at yongbyon led to a diplomatic showdown , and after months of talks the clinton administration won a north korean pledge to freeze plutonium production at the site in exchange , the united states , south korea and japan agreed to give the north oil and technical assistance to build a peaceful nuclear power program the agreement called for international monitoring of the yongbyon site , and energy department experts were allowed to encase the spent fuel rods at the center to ensure that they could not be used for warheads before the production freeze , north korea was able to produce about 26 pounds of weaponsgrade plutonium , american intelligence analysts agree a consensus developed that north korea could produce one or two bombs political problems surfaced when administration officials began to declare that north korea had agreed to freeze its entire nuclear program eventually , however , the lawmakers realized that the agreement covered only yongbyon and did not preclude nuclear activity at other sites suspicions arose that the north koreans were covertly continuing work on their nuclear program after the administration negotiated the freeze on activity at yongbyon , the defense intelligence agency began to report that it had detected a series of other secret sites , many of them underground , that analysts suspected were related to an ongoing nuclear program by the late1990 s , the defense intelligence agency , working closely with the national imagery and mapping agency , which processes and analyzes spy satellite photographs , compiled a list of at least 10 such sites none , however , was a smoking gun one official termed them enigmas they raised suspicions , yet the united states did not have enough evidence to prove their ties to a nuclear program
draguignan , france , july 14 francois simon awoke this morning with a song in his heart so did christophe agnolutto , didier rous , stephane heulot and nearly 30 other french riders in the tour de france that song was la marseillaise , the french national anthem today was july 14 , the french national holiday if a french rider wins the tour stage on this day , he is celebrated nearly forever , sometimes for as long as several months who was the last frenchman to win on the quatorze \? few in the vast tour entourage seemed to recall that name or date what they did remember , as the french often do , were past indignities on this day those indignities , as they often do , centered on foreigners outrage was generally expressed remember the time , a few years back , when djamolidine abdoujaparov an uzbek ! won the july 14 stage \? remember last year , when giuseppe guerini , an italian , finished first \? what next , many asked , a belgian \? a croatian \? no , a spaniard the stage today was won by vicente garciaacosta , 27 , a humble worker for the banesto team from his homeland in his fifth year as a professional , with two previous victories to his credit and a world ranking of no 309 , garciaacosta split from two traveling companions with 11 kilometers \( 7 miles \) to go and rolled to a festive victory he clapped his hands , he punched the air , he gave thanks to the heavens , he carried on as if it were oct 12 , the spanish national holiday , celebrating columbus s discovery of america , rather than july 14 garciaacosta was timed in 4 hours 3 minutes 2 seconds , a rapid 45 kilometers an hour , for the 1855kilometer 13th stage from avignon east to draguignan in the hills behind the cote d'azur conducted in sunny and breezy weather , the race was watched by huge crowds , especially at the start with thousands on avignon s ancient walls the finish and atop three small climbs en route to add to the fans' disappointment , the two riders the spaniard left in his wake were frenchmen nicolas jalabert of the once team and pascal herve of polti were second and third , 25 and 27 seconds too late respectively to save the day once a 12man breakaway of lowranked riders took form about 60 kilometers along , the pack was content to let it have its head on narrow and zigzaggy roads past perched villages and the occasional vineyard including all the overall leaders , the main pack arrived 10 06 behind the winner that changed basically nothing because garciaacosta began the day in 46th place , nearly 29 minutes behind jalabert , the younger brother of the star laurent jalabert , and herve were in similar dungeons so lance armstrong , the head of the us postal service team , continued to be secure in the overall leader s yellow jersey , nearly five minutes ahead of jan ullrich , the german leader of telekom and the winner of the 1997 tour after armstrong s performances in the first two mountain stages two second places and a daunting display of easy power none of his rivals appear to be overly optimistic about the coming three stages in the alps they begin saturday and continue sunday and tuesday , with monday a day off
to the editor re forced dash to a missile defense \( editorial , feb 17 \) the new missile defense system is primarily meant to prevent destruction of american population centers by a nuclear attack but a far greater risk is an attack by chemical or germ warfare weapons , which can be used by smaller countries or terrorist groups defense against such attacks should be pursued with a higher priority than a missile defense system , whose functionality is still questionable such a defense would , for example , involve making vaccination against smallpox and anthrax available and stored in all major medical centers for my family and me , it will make little sense to have a maginot line in the skies when we get hit by a smallpox blast in the subway dieter linder new york , feb 17 , 2000

the test most commonly recommended to screen healthy adults for colorectal cancer misses too many precancerous growths and should be replaced by a more extensive procedure that examines the entire colon , doctors are reporting today both tests require inserting long tubes equipped with cameras into the rectum to search for abnormal tissue the difference lies in how far the tubes go the more common test , sigmoidoscopy , reaches only about two feet into the colon and is generally used to screen people 50 and older with an average risk of colon cancer the more thorough procedure , colonoscopy , probes the full length of the colon , 4 to 5 feet , and is usually reserved for people with a higher risk , like those with blood in their stool , a history of intestinal polyps or a family history of colon cancer colorectal cancer kills 56 , 000 americans a year , and is the second leading cause of cancer death , after lung cancer doctors say many of the deaths could be prevented by screenings unlike the tests for breast and prostate cancer , which find cancers that have already formed , procedures that examine the colon can actually detect abnormal tissue and remove it before it turns cancerous sigmoidoscopy , which is cheaper and easier to perform , has been used for screening on the optimistic theory that if no abnormalities were seen in the lower colon , none were likely to be found higher up but that theory is contradicted by two studies being published today in the new england journal of medicine , which included a total of more than 5 , 000 healthy people screened by colonoscopy one study , which involved more than 3 , 000 patients , is the largest study to date of the procedure both studies show that it is not safe to assume that the upper colon is healthy just because the lower third looks normal the studies found that half the patients who had precancerous lesions in the upper colon had nothing abnormal lower down if those patients had had only sigmoidoscopy , they would have mistakenly been given a clean bill of health and left with dangerous , undetected growths high in the colon the studies confirm many doctors' suspicions about sigmoidoscopy , said dr daniel k podolsky , chief of gastroenterology at the massachusetts general hospital dr podolsky said many experts liken sigmoidoscopy to screening women for breast cancer by doing mammograms on only one breast he urged that doctors recommend a colonoscopy to all patients 50 and older , and that insurers pay for the test medicare and most insurers do not cover colonoscopy as a screening test , and pay for it only for highrisk patients sigmoidoscopy costs about 200 , colonoscopy 1 , 200 to 1 , 500 an insurance industry spokesman , dr donald young , medical director of the health insurance association of america , said that guidelines for coverage should be reexamined , but that it would be premature to change the rules until experts can assess all the information dr david a lieberman , director of one of the studies and chief of gastroenterology at oregon health sciences university in portland , said , these data do support offering colonoscopy as a screening option dr robert smith , director of cancer screening for the american cancer society , said that patients should consider the findings , but added that quite a lot more needs to be learned about implementing it at the community level in terms of cost , safety and acceptability before we could recommend it as routine dr barnett kramer , senior medical scientist in the division of cancer prevention at the national cancer institute , said , this is important enough information from both of these studies that it should be incorporated into the discussion with people who are pursuing their options about screening but dr kramer was also cautious about offering a blanket recommendation that everyone 50 and older have the test for one thing , he said , the studies were not designed to determine whether colonoscopy actually prevented deaths from colorectal cancer in addition , colonoscopy has a low but slightly higher risk than sigmoidoscopy of causing bleeding or injuring the colon , he said in dr lieberman s study , 10 patients out of 3 , 121 \( 03 percent \) had serious complications , including 6 cases of bleeding and 1 heart attack in addition , colonoscopy , unlike sigmoidoscopy , often requires sedation , which can have side effects and means that patients cannot drive themselves home after the procedure some people , given the nature of the test , prefer sedation dr kramer also said that it would not be possible now to offer colonoscopy to everyone 50 and older , because the test has to be performed by a specialist in gastroenterology , and there are not enough specialists to go around dr smith agreed , and added that it was important to ensure that specialists were available to perform the test on highrisk patients who need it most unlike colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy can be done by a family practitioner , internist or nurse practitioner despite their potential to save lives , the screening tests for colon cancer are not popular all adults 50 and older are candidates for a screening , but fewer than a third are tested in addition to the unpleasant aspects of the tests , most patients dread the preparation , which involves cleaning out the colon sigmoidoscopy requires enemas , and colonoscopy requires a liquid diet for 1 to 3 days until the night before the test , when patients must drink a powerful laxative solution that purges the colon the statistics on compliance with colon cancer screening represent a tragedy , dr lieberman said they are much lower than for breast and cervical cancer , and yet colon cancer kills far more people and is far more preventable but we do n't like conversations about our bowels there s been a problem with patients requesting screening and with physicians offering it a gallup poll of the public last year said that 80 to 90 percent said their doctors had not talked to them about colon cancer screening dr lieberman and his team conducted their study at 13 veterans affairs medical centers , performing colonoscopy on 3 , 121 patients ages 50 to 75 , with an average age of 629 years 968 percent were male , and 836 percent were white one percent of the patients had cancer , and 10 percent had growths in the colon that dr lieberman called serious , meaning abnormalities that could turn cancerous patients with growths in the lower part of the colon the part reached by sigmoidoscopy were more likely than those with no growths in that region to have abnormalities higher up in the colon as well but 66 with healthy tissue below had dangerous growths above , which would have gone undetected if those patients had been given only sigmoidoscopy findings were similar in the second study , directed by dr thomas f imperiale , of the indiana university medical center in indianapolis that study included nearly 2 , 000 healthy patients screened by colonoscopy chart diagram medical update common test may not be enough a new study shows that the most common screening test for colorectal cancer , the sigmoidoscopy , fails to detect more than half of cancers or precancerous tumors high up in the colon sigmoidoscopy onethird of colon medicare and most insurers cover an examination of the sigmoid colon doctors assumed that if the lower colon was healthy , the upper part would be as well colonoscopy entire colon but new findings show that tumors grow high up in the colon even if none are detected in the sigmoid area the authors of the study say a colonoscopy is a better test \( source new england journal of medicine \) \( pg a19 \)
officials of the state university of new york at binghamton are being criticized for their delayed response to what the police say was a bias attack on four asianamerican students by three white members of the school s wrestling team one of the students injured in the feb 27 assault , 19yearold john e lee of the bronx , suffered a fractured skull and internal hemorrhaging the three others received minor injuries or none at all the wrestlers were charged on march 6 by the state university police with seconddegree gang assault , a felony three days later , the university s president , lois b defleur , issued a statement condemning the attack , saying , violence and bigotry have no place on campus the federal bureau of investigation is also conducting an inquiry to determine whether the assault involved a violation of federal civil rights law the accused students have pleaded not guilty , and a lawyer for one of them says the asianamerican students initiated the attack there were reports in the press and sunbulletin of binghamton as early as march 1 that the university police were investigating a bias attack , and at a rally last week , hundreds of students and several faculty members protested the assault and the school s response , which they called unacceptably late the fact that it took them two weeks to issue a statement to the student body was ridiculous , said peter van do , president of the university s asian student union sin yen ling , a legal fellow at the asian american legal defense and education fund in manhattan , which is monitoring the criminal proceedings for three of the four asianamerican students involved , also faulted the university i have to agree with the student union that the response was rather slow , ms ling said university officials say they withheld immediate comment at the urging of law enforcement officials who feared that a public statement would jeopardize the investigation one thing i told a group of students was that if we had compromised the investigation , then we 'd have no case , and then you really would have been angry with us , said rodger summers , vice president for student affairs the attack , along with another confrontation involving one of the wrestlers , stunned the binghamton campus , where asianamericans make up 20 percent of the 12 , 000member student body administrators and students alike say there has been no history of overt tensions between asianamericans and whites at the university the feb 27 incident involved four koreanamerican students , two of whom were visiting from other universities , and three white wrestlers nicholas w richetti , 19 , christopher m taylor , 20 , and an 18yearold student whose case has been sealed because he could be tried as a youthful offender according to law enforcement officials , two of the koreanamerican students were standing outside a campus dormitory shortly before dawn when the wrestlers approached there was an exchange of words , including racial slurs directed at the asian students , and two of their friends , also koreanamericans , raced outside the dorm to see what was going on , officials said a fight ensued law enforcement officials say the wrestlers , who they say were not injured in the fighting , initiated the assault , but their lawyers say the wrestlers are innocent the only gang was four asian youths who instigated the incident , said terence p o'leary , who is representing the 18yearold the charge of gang assault against him is hogwash thomas a saitta , a lawyer representing mr taylor , says that his client happened upon the fight on his way back to the dormitory and got hit in the side of the head mr richetti s lawyer , robert miller , could not be reached yesterday when it was over , two koreanamerican students had suffered minor facial injuries , while mr lee , a freshman , was put in intensive care with a fractured skull after being headbutted and then kicked in the head , according to ms ling mr lee has since returned to school the fourth koreanamerican student was not injured the 18yearold wrestler has also been charged with disorderly conduct for his role in a fight with asianamerican students at a denny s restaurant near campus on feb 11 in addition , mr richetti , who won the championship title in his weight class at last year s state high school wrestling tournament , was charged by the binghamton police with misdemeanor assault in an attack earlier on feb 27 against a white student the wrestlers have pleaded not guilty to all the charges the university has suspended the wrestlers pending further disciplinary action , which could include their eventual expulsion the asian student union wants the wrestlers expelled immediately mr van do said his organization was also demanding that the university hire more asianamerican teachers and two asianamerican counselors at the university s counseling center \( last week , the university agreed to hire one asianamerican counselor \) the criminal case , now in the hands of the broome county district attorney s office , has made use of a fouryearold state charge aimed at stemming group violence
opelika , ala , feb 26 the desk in mike williams s office is a map of his busy smalltown practice it is stacked with cases the underage auburn university student charged with possession of alcohol the collection of rent for a local real estate agent the bitter divorce in which the wife , who is mr williams s client , is charging the husband with adultery the case that does not fit is the one partly contained in the cardboard box on the floor state of alabama v james wyman smith mr smith , 58 , convicted of murdering a conveniencestore clerk , had not had the money to hire a lawyer , and the court had appointed mr williams to represent him at his two trials , even though mr williams had scant experience in the practice of criminal law , not to mention the complex , everchanging , highstakes subspecialty of capital defense mr williams had not even read the entire death penalty statute before his client s first trial in 1987 he had no money to hire an investigator the state paid him so little that in a brief to the court he said he ended up making 498 per hour to prepare for the defense of a human s life sitting in his office , mr williams declared , i will go to jail before i handle another capital case mr smith died on death row two weeks ago , of liver failure a majority of the public across the country supports capital punishment but in states , there is an intensifying national debate over the issue of justice , focusing on the quality of the legal representation provided to poor people accused of capital crimes at its sharpest , it is a question of whether some innocent people are on death row only because their state does not provide the resources for an adequate or competent public defender system last month , the prodeathpenalty republican governor of illinois , george ryan , called for a moratorium on the death penalty after concluding that 13 innocent people had almost been executed , in some cases because of dismal defenses mounted by incompetent , poorly paid lawyers senator patrick j leahy , democrat of vermont , recently introduced legislation that set national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are appointed for capital defendants the justice department has initiated its own review to determine whether the federal death penalty system unfairly discriminates against racial minorities some states , including new york , new jersey and colorado , have multimilliondollar capital defender offices that provide teams of lawyers and investigators for people in death penalty trials at the other end of the spectrum is alabama , which , with a death row growing at the fastest rate in the country , has no statewide public defender system courtappointed capital defense lawyers here are paid so little that many lawyers refuse the work in cities like montgomery and birmingham , where the pool of lawyers is greater , lawyers can remove themselves from the list of those willing to be appointed to capital cases but in smaller jurisdictions , like opelika , a judge can compel a lawyer to take a case , or find the lawyer in contempt for refusing so the job often falls to young , inexperienced lawyers , or older ones who earn a living through court appointments , leaving many of those charged with capital offenses with inadequate representation at trial , and some without representation in the appeals process basically these folks are sent into battle underequipped , undertrained and undercompensated , said kevin doyle , the new york capital defender , who spent five years working on capital cases in alabama with the federally financed capital defense resource center , which congress has since eliminated two people on alabama s death row have been found innocent since executions were reinstated in the late 1970 s nationwide , there were 85 such cases alabama is our top priority , said elisabeth semel , who as head of the american bar association s death penalty representation project in washington recruits law firms across the country to handle cases pro bono the need for competent lawyers there is desperate numerous studies by legal experts of alabama s capital defense system have documented severe shortcomings , including lawyers who fail to do the most fundamental tasks , like investigating the crime and their clients' backgrounds and presenting closing arguments the alabama attorney general , bill pryor , a republican , said he had no concerns about the quality of courtappointed defense counsel for people in death penalty cases at any stage in the process , from arrest to death row my judgment is that at both the trial and appellate level we face very experienced and competent opponents , he said we have not had the problems they have in illinois , he added no one can design a perfect system of justice i would like to have more resources for the young lawyers who come to work for me mr pryor said he is concerned that the appeals process takes too long , a criticism made by many prosecutors of their state justice systems for example , he said , execution is set for friday for freddie lee wright , who has spent 22 years on death row while lawyers appealed his case the 1963 united states supreme court decision gideon v wainwright guaranteed all defendants the right to counsel
erich karl fuchs had his first aids test in 1988 the test , he thought , would confirm the inevitable it would show he was infected with the aids virus mr fuchs , who is gay , had had unprotected sex over the years with men who carried the virus it stood to reason that he , too , would be infected but , to his astonishment , the test showed no evidence of the virus i said , 'this has got to be wrong , ' mr fuchs said then i took the test again and i took it again the results never varied over the next six years , mr fuchs repeatedly contacted aids researchers and asked them to figure out why he seemed to be immune to the virus , hiv but , he said , the scientists told him they were not interested finally , in 1994 , mr fuchs , still uninfected , tried again at a place he had approached earlier , the aaron diamond aids research center in new york this time , he said , the researchers agreed to study him the result was dumbfounding try as they might , in laboratory tests , the center s scientists could not get the aids virus to enter mr fuchs s cells after months of fevered research , the scientists at aaron diamond discovered why mr fuchs and another man with a similar experience were immune the men had inherited a gene that results in a blocked porthole into white blood cells , preventing the virus from slipping in the investigators isolated the gene and discovered how it worked and how many other people had it on may 2 , the research center was awarded a patent for a test to identify people who have the hivresistance gene , allowing it to share in profits from the test but what about mr fuchs and the other man , steve crohn \? they say they approached aaron diamond scientists and suggested that they be studied they offered their blood , they participated in the research project , they helped the research center garner publicity for its discovery i just wanted to do something good , mr fuchs said but once money came into the picture , why not have it be shared with me \? these days more and more patients are asking the same question laboratories offer tests for more than 700 human genes , with more being discovered almost daily and , for almost every gene , some medical institution or some company owns a patent on its use the value of patients' tissues has potentially gone up enormously , said dr barry eisenstein , the vice president for science and technology at the beth israel deaconess medical center in boston but , dr eisenstein said , patients whose cells provided the genes that have been patented are rarely compensated whether any money has been made from tests based on their genes and in the case of the aidsresistance gene , none yet has some patients have become wary about providing their tissue for genetic research a few have demanded money up front before providing tissue others are writing contracts spelling out what they are entitled to if they help scientists find genes some experts on patent law say it would be unfortunate if patients start demanding financial rewards for participating in genetic research i hate to create incentives that would lead people to get greedy , said rebecca eisenberg , a patent law expert at the university of michigan i am worried that there are just too many mouths at the feeding troughs of pharmaceutical products other experts say the current system of awarding gene patents seems unjust dr robert cookdeegan , an investigator at the kennedy institute of ethics at georgetown university , said we have a system where the research participants are treated as pure altruists , but everyone else is treated as a pure capitalist i do n't think that s quite fair the problem , said hank greely , a law professor at stanford university , is that the rules of the game seem to have changed it used to be that when you were a research subject , you were doing it for free and you assumed that the people on the other side were doing it for free at least for academic research , professor greely said these days , there is very little academic research that does n't have some commercial interest , and almost always now the researcher has a potential commercial interest someone might say , 'look , i'm willing to do this for the good of humanity if everyone else is , too but if someone on the other side is going to make billions of dollars , i want some , too' the families i searching for good from sorrow daniel m greenberg , a real estate lawyer in homewood , ill , never thought about potential profit when he helped get a gene search going all he wanted was to help other families avoid what had happened to him and his wife the greenbergs' first child , jonathan , was born on june 12 , 1981 , a perfect present for their fourth anniversary but they soon began to worry jonathan did not roll over when he was supposed to he never sat up finally , when jonathan was a year old , a neurologist discovered that he had canavan disease , a rare genetic disorder that is invariably fatal and almost exclusively strikes ashkenazi jews , those who trace their origins to eastern and central europe the greenbergs were told that jonathan s condition would only get worse and that he would die before he was a teenager \( he died when he was 11 years old \) obviously , our lives were shattered , mr greenberg said it was a tough haul trying to think of your child as a dying child and never being able to do the things that other children can do

kansas city , mo , oct 25 if vice president al gore has failed to close the sale with some voters on policy grounds , like promising to put the medicare surplus in a lockbox , he has now come up with a few new arguments first , there is the notion that mr gore does not care about making money and never has not like some oil speculators and baseball team owners he could mention and this apparently is a good thing , even though many americans would love to have made 15 million by selling a baseball team , as gov george w bush did when his partnership sold the texas rangers in 1998 i have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth , mr gore told a crowd in everett , wash , on monday i have spent the last 24 years fighting for middleclass working families mr gore s aversion to wealth apparently has the approval of his wife , tipper this is a man who has spent his time not getting up every day figuring out how much money he can make for himself , mrs gore said in introducing her husband in little rock , ark , on tuesday , but figuring out how he can fight for working people still not persuaded \? maybe that is because you were not aware that mr gore has attended all of his son s high school football games this fall , despite his rigorous campaign schedule the gores had kept politics and football separate until this week , when an article in the new york times documented the vice president s devotion to the sidwell friends quakers now they seem to have concluded that it is a story worth telling he has made every single one of our son s football games , mrs gore said at a rally on tuesday in shreveport , la , in remarks aimed directly at women i do n't really want to share that with everybody it s personal but it matters kitchen cabinet meetings for each of the last three mornings , mr gore has gone about the task of making pretty pictures by holding kitchen table discussions with voters none have actually taken place at a kitchen table , but that is beside the point on monday , he sat down at a bakery in portland , ore , with a small business owner on tuesday in little rock , he helped bobbie and mollie goza walk their two children to elementary school today , in nashville , he sat down with the guys at a local firehouse such camerafriendly encounters with real people have become a campaign staple for mr gore , who spent numerous nights at teachers' homes and took walks on a florida beach with 13 citizen advisers to help prepare for the debates some moments have been so staged as to appear campy , like mr gore s stroll to school with the gozas , who typically do not walk their children the few blocks to thomas jefferson elementary and the conversation , or at least the snippets that reporters have made out from a distance , has often been less than edifying ian , you 're really in kindergarten \? mr gore asked the gozas' 5yearold son , who nodded affirmatively then there was mr gore s reaction to discovering a rubber halloween spider in a planter of yellow chrysanthemums on the gozas' doorstep yikes ! he said that s scary but whether mr gore s words make news is also beside the point thus far , the gimmick has worked precisely as intended in both portland and little rock , pictures of the kitchentable moments landed on the front pages of local newspapers and were featured prominently in local television broadcasts the national television networks have also made liberal use of the images , and a picture of mr gore with the gozas appeared today in the new york times swinging for fencesitters after two years of campaigning some would say after eight years of campaigning it is not every day that mr gore gets a question he has yet to consider but while speaking to a few reporters on air force ii on tuesday , mr gore was confronted with one of the great queries of our time what do you think of the designated hitter \? asked bill douglas of newsday mr gore had already taken an expedient pass on the question of which team he likes in the world series , saying i'm for new york now , said the reporters on the plane , mr gore paused for 20 to 30 seconds , as if calculating the swingstate impact of his response on undecided voters in various american league and national league cities finally , he answered , sort of i have n't really given it a lot of considered thought i'm tempted to take the purists view that it s , you know , a dilution of the pure game but i do n't know enough about the reasons for it to make a harsh critique based on what i know at this point , i'm not in favor of it
in 1985 , when tahira reid was in third grade at public school 97 in the bronx , she dreamed up an invention that would allow her to doubledutch jumprope even when she could n't find two friends to swing twin ropes in eggbeater fashion her poster drawing of the hypothetical doubledutch machine won her a first prize in a schoolwide competition ms reid went on to jump for a professional doubledutch team in junior high , whirring in and out of the speedy ropes while she danced hiphop and performed gymnastics but she did n't much think about her doubledutch machine again until she was a sophomore at rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , ny , and enrolled in an introductory engineering design class whose theme was challenging the limits in sports and recreational activities there , with the help of classmates , she began working up a more sophisticated version of her thirdgrade idea two and a half years later , ms reid , who is now a senior at rpi , has received a patent for the device at the time , i just figured , hey , it would be a cool project , ms reid said i did n't foresee a patent or anything when ms reid came up with her idea , recalled burt swersey , who teaches a course in invention at rpi , i said , 'wow , this is a great idea there s a market for it but nobody s making it' ms reid is not the first to envision a doubledutch machine a handful of others have already patented permutations of the idea but , according to mr swersey , none is practical what we teach here is that a lot of people have great ideas , but you have to reduce them to practice , he said ms reid and a group of students working on a second prototype hope to eventually produce a doubledutch machine that can serve as a training device for jumpers who want to hone their skills as well as for kids who just want to have fun ms reid s fellow students currently on the project are kevin haynes , maneesh shrivastav , kwasi frye and colleen conlon the machine consists of two drive systems that sit 10 to 15 feet apart and about 30 inches off the ground each drive system has its own motor , which , through the help of a set of pulleys , turns two arms that grasp two different ropes two of these pulleys are connected with a belt configured in a crisscross manner this crisscross causes the ropes to turn in the contrapuntal fashion that simulates the doubledutch pattern that jumproping children love the doubledutch machine has already gotten recognition two years ago ms reid s team received a national collegiate inventors and innovators alliance grant for 10 , 000 to cover patent and prototype costs and the device was part of an alliance exhibit at the smithsonian institution s national museum of american history mr swersey acknowledged that ms reid was still refining the invention this double dutch is a good idea but the way it stands now it s not quite right , he said tahira and her teammates are working to come up with design features that will really make it low cost and practical for people patent 5 , 961 , 425 was assigned to ms reid and to andrew burdick , an aeronautical engineering student at rpi who worked on the original prototype be my valentine , and get a cancer test there are as many ways to woo as there are varieties of candy in a twopound whitman s sampler some suitors demonstrate their love with flowers , others with perfume but a valentine s day card that features a coloncancer screening kit \?

an antimissile laser destroyed an armed katyusha rocket in flight during a test in new mexico on tuesday , the united states army said yesterday the development moves the laser a step closer to possible deployment along israel s border with lebanon missile defenses based on lasers have been developed , tested and debated for decades , but none has been deployed built by a california contractor , trw , and the united states army , the powerful laser has been designed to defend against guerrilla rocket attacks along israel s northern border the system , called the tactical high energy laser , is being built at a cost of about 200 million at the army s white sands missile range in new mexico , the laser focused its light on the moving katyusha s warhead , heating and destroying it , about a month after a successful test against a stationary target the test yesterday was the first attempt at achieving a shootdown of a rocket , and it was successful , said dr thomas romesser , vice president and deputy general manager for laser programs at trw most missile defense systems under development have moved to a hittokill technology , using rocketpropelled interceptors in the 1980 s , laserbased defenses were criticized as technically unworkable , but research continues on several antimissile lasers aside from the israeliamerican program to defend against shortrange missiles , there is an air force program in early tests to shoot down missiles by use of a laser mounted on a jumbo jet , and there is also an effort run by the pentagon to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles with lasers fired from space all of those lasers are powered by chemical reactions that generate intense light dr romesser said that the test on tuesday demonstrated that laser defenses could work i think that there will be a lot of enthusiasm to move forward with these types of weapons systems because they really are effective , he said the israeliamerican system consists of several modules the size of tractor trailers and containing radar , an optical telescope , the laser and a command and communications center all worked together properly in the test , said richard bradshaw , director of the directedenergy , or laser , program at the army space and missile defense command we turned on the high power beam and the very first time put power on the target and it blew up , he said a spokesman for the command said that after new tests against multiple incoming warheads , the system could be shipped to israel for further testing and possible deployment as early as september israel s northern border has been quiet , without rocket launchings or guerrilla attacks , since israel pulled out of a military buffer zone in southern lebanon two weeks ago
it s a long stretch from socrates drinking the hemlock to petscom pulling the plug some 2 , 400 years in fact but alan lightman , a runnerup in the national book award for fiction that was awarded last week , has produced a novel connecting what the author sees as the central tragedy of each epoch mr lightman s foreboding , sometimes darkly comical book , the diagnosis , his third novel , is mainly the story of the informationage meltdown of bill chalmers our man chalmers has a wife who dabbles at selling antiques and who cuckolds him through an online affair chalmers is also the father of a precocious teenage son with whom he communicates more fully via email than in their awkward facetoface conversations the counterpoint to this contemporary tale is mr lightman s fictionalized account of the final days of the philosopher socrates in athens , 399 bc this part of the novel unfolds in installments from plato online , a college course that chalmers s son , alex , downloads from the internet the story that i'm telling , mr lightman said last week in an interview , is a modern american tragedy the tragedy of how we 're living our lives at the turn of the century in the united states to give the story weight and gravity , i wanted to juxtapose it with an ancient tragedy a world where ideas were so important that a man could be executed for them chalmers is on the fast track at a professional firm whose precise business the story never quite identifies , but where status is measured by how many gigabytes of data each worker can process on behalf of clients there seem to be no ideas worth living for , let alone dying over but any minute not spent talking on a cell phone , sending email or checking voice mail is a minute wasted chalmers s life is internet time , 24 7 365 , as it might be measured by kafka the accumulated weight of information overload eventually causes chalmers s physical senses to depart him one by one and in keeping with the book s central theme that information is not synonymous with knowledge , that gathering data should not be confused with understanding life chalmers becomes incapacitated by a disease that cannot be diagnosed , despite endless rounds of sophisticated medical tests in the end , blind and bedridden , he considers himself little more than a brain stem , although a brain stem that is more morally evolved than the robotic data miner we meet at the outset mr lightman , 51 , who holds a phd in theoretical physics and is a professor of writing and humanistic studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , said he hoped readers of the diagnosis would come away with an increased awareness of the way that we 're living and the state of mind in modern america we do n't have time to think of our priorities , our values , mr lightman said we 're just rushing to our next appointment the way that cell phones are used is emblematic when you 're on the cell phone , you 're not where your body is you 're somewhere out there in hyperspace by always being somewhere else , rather than where you are , you 're nowhere it represents the lost state of society we 're nowhere in the novel s back story , socrates s primary persecutor , anytus , a wealthy , powerful tanner , gives the philosopher a final choice exile or death as punishment for spreading ideas deemed dangerous to the established order the ultimatum is presented in a hellish scene around putrid vats of rendered animal hides , which give off such a stench that the egyptian slaves who attend them have long ago lost their sense of smell many of the parallels between the ancient and contemporary in mr lightman s novel are indirect it is only implicit , for example , that the egyptian slaves are forebears of slaves to success like chalmers , rendered insensate by vats of raw data but a closer link is drawn between the two stories when anytus hears that socrates , on his deathbed , has said death is only the separation of the soul from the body men who fear death love the body , and probably power and money , as well chalmers , who finds his soul only while losing use of his body , toils in a temple of modern wealth , the marbleworth building the place is a monument to edward marbleworth , who had made sixty million in the computer software trade by his thirtyfifth birthday and then turned that into three billion in the communications industry early in the novel chalmers is still hoping , despite the onset of his illness , to rise from junior to senior partner in his firm he is egged on by his wife , who during most of his downward spiral is as concerned about the threat to the family s suburban affluence as she is about her husband s physical and psychic wellbeing the pursuit of wealth for its own sake that is a major thread of our modern consciousness , mr lightman said studies have been done on this if you give people the option of cutting down on their workweek and having more time for their families and personal lives , or keeping their workweek and having a pay raise , very few people will give up salary for more leisure time in the 1950 s , when a lot of laborsaving devices were being developed and personal productivity went up , there were predictions that by the year 2000 the workweek would be cut back to 20 hours the cruel joke is that none of this happened instead of creating more time for ourselves and exploring other areas of our lives , we just put more and more time into our jobs and just produced more and made more money at the end of the novel , as he lies in bed longing to finally shed his useless body , bill chalmers conjures a dreamy notion of his son s future and muses , alex might live a life it is a hopeful note in a story that otherwise offers little in the way of optimism mr lightman , who is married to a painter , jean , and who has two daughters , ages 20 and 14 , said he harbored hope that the next generation might be able to transcend what he sees as the current culture s empty pursuit of money and bandwidth maybe our children have to get saturated with this stuff before they can get beyond it , he said when mr lightman observes the undergraduates at mit , i worry about them , he said i have enormous respect for their minds and their originality and their creativity on the other hand , i see them making the same assumptions about the world that our generation has made that more technology is better i think something s going to have to shake them up he said that the bursting of the dotcom stock bubble may have brought some welcome wariness to the rising generation but of course , a lot of mit graduates are capable of working on the hardware end of things , he said so they can go off and found a company that produces a new chip and is not simply selling information on the internet or creating web sites and what bigger event might shake up the next generation \? mr lightman does not pretend to know i'm not highly

peoria , ill the big , boisterous crowd laughed at dick cheney s jokes and shouted his lines back at him mr cheney even pounded the lectern once or twice behind him , on the banks of the illinois river , more supporters watched from a paddlewheel riverboat as the rally ended last week , he made for the rope lines as the theme music from rocky blared and a shower of fireworks exploded overhead it was a far cry from mr cheney s earliest campaign outings in nursing homes , schools and small halls , where he shied away from crowds , hunched over lecterns and mumbled his lines , and once demurred at reading the very hungry caterpillar aloud to children during a photo opportunity in a school mr cheney s campaign for the vice presidency got off to a rocky start indeed he was put on the defensive on everything from his conservative voting record in congress and his business dealings as the head of an oil services company to his previous health problems and his understated , sometimes even dour campaigning style prominent republicans voiced doubts about mr cheney s selection , and rumors even swirled on the internet that former gen colin l powell would step in to replace him then came the vicepresidential debate in danville , ky mr cheney not only held his own during a mannerly and civil exchange with his affable democratic rival , senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut , but actually got in the evening s biggest laugh lines and when it was over , the whispering about dumping mr cheney stopped signs like president cheney in 2008 began popping up through the ups and downs , mr cheney said , he resisted being buffeted by popular opinion i think we 've steered a fairly steady course , he said in a recent interview in a hotel in columbus , ohio it was never as bad as it was portrayed early on none of which is to say that the campaign is troublefree the revelation that gov george w bush was arrested for drunken driving has proved awkward for mr cheney , who was arrested twice himself in the 1960 s for driving while intoxicated after facing intense questioning on friday about the bush arrest , mr cheney canceled interviews and omitted from some speeches his standard pledge to restore honor and dignity to the white house when mr bush tapped mr cheney as his running mate , there was an initial burst of enthusiasm mr cheney had been secretary of defense under mr bush s father during the persian gulf war he had served as wyoming s lone congressman for a decade , and he had been president gerald r ford s chief of staff when he was only 34 he was a respected washington insider , and strategists hoped that he would more than make up for any questions about governor bush s inexperience his speech at the republican convention was well received , and some of its refrains , like it s time for them to go , became rallying cries among the party faithful then the trouble began democrats pointed to mr cheney s record as a congressman in the 1980 s , when he voted against financing for head start , against a resolution urging the release of nelson mandela and against a ban on plastic handguns soon questions were being raised about his retirement package from the halliburton company , the oil and energy services company he had led for nearly five years it included 39 million in stock options that he could not exercise until after the election which could have posed a conflict of interest if he were elected mr cheney eventually promised to forfeit the options if elected all this led critics to ask how carefully had mr cheney , whose job it was to screen potential running mates , been screened himself \? and although his selection almost singlehandedly brought the word gravitas back into vogue among political commentators , the weight he brought to the ticket cut both ways his early forays on the stump were leaden he hunched over , spoke in a low monotone and seemed ill at ease with big crowds the low point , perhaps , came on sept 8 a newspaper reported that mr cheney had not voted in 14 of 16 elections in his five years in dallas a congressional candidate he was campaigning with in connecticut chose that day to unveil a television ad praising mr lieberman , and a report surfaced that halliburton s overseas operations had separate bathrooms for americans and foreign workers tough scrutiny was n't anything new from my standpoint , he said i guess i was surprised that there seemed to be relatively little judgment exercised oftentimes in terms of what was important and what was n't halliburton s toilet policy \? although his only experience as a candidate stemmed from his days as wyoming s congressman he once described campaigning as driving 150 miles to have coffee with five or six guys national campaigns are not new to him as president ford s chief of staff , mr cheney had a frontrow seat at the hardfought 1976 campaign against jimmy carter that campaign is remembered for the way mr ford s running mate , senator bob dole , aimed attack after attack at the democrats and in this campaign , mr cheney has not shied away from such a role he has been a principal messenger of the republican assault on vice president al gore s credibility in the last two months he has said that mr gore simply makes some things up out of whole cloth , and charged that his misstatements raise doubts about whether or not he would deal straight with the american people on the issues of the day just last week he argued that mr gore and mr lieberman lack the experience to lead the country , saying they had spent little time in the private sector mr cheney s frequent salvos drew attention away from his style on the stump and allowed him to stop playing defense one other area where he was able to score points early on was his repeated assertions that the armed forces have been allowed to slip while democrats point out that the cutbacks he denounces began during his tenure , and that mr gore plans to spend more money on defense than mr bush , the issue resonates then came the debate although mr cheney had steeled himself for a number of lines of attack , the ammunition was not needed he and mr lieberman sat down at a table and discussed their policy differences politely afterward , his crowds grew decidedly more enthusiastic and mr cheney grew more relaxed on the stump he began telling jokes and funny anecdotes and getting big laughs he stopped stepping on his applause lines , and began to feed off the crowd when mr cheney went down to austin , tex , two weeks ago for his first campaign appearance in weeks with governor bush , the two men seemed happy and at ease they even joked about the gaffe they shared in front of an open microphone on labor day , when mr bush was caught using a vulgarity to describe a reporter and mr cheney was heard agreeing , big time , an utterance that soon became a catch phrase of the campaign as the two men shared the stage with 28 other republican governors who were endorsing mr bush and listened to a speech by gov tom ridge of pennsylvania , mr bush turned to his running mate and clearly mouthed the words big time mr cheney put his finger to his lips , as if to shush him the crowd laughed then mr bush spoke i picked the right person to be my running mate , he said , not sounding the least bit defensive he s a good , solid man photo dick cheney once seemed ill at ease on the stump , but has warmed to campaigning he appeared last week at a rally in south portland , me \( associated press \)
telltale signs are everywhere your partner no longer excites you , and you find yourself looking at other , flashier potential mates you wonder where the thrill has gone , and fantasize about whether you 'd be happier just going off on your own has the passion gone out of your love affair with mutual funds \? sounds like it but if you 're a mature investor , you know that what you have now is not an infatuation , but a longterm commitment to investing maybe you realize that one offering is pretty much as good as the next and have given up the hunt for the super fund perhaps you have hitched your portfolio to a stock index thus removing decisionmaking from your investments well , you 're not alone signs of mutual fund fatigue are popping up everywhere indexing , which substitutes a computer and a stock index for a human stock picker , is getting more and more attention , despite a recent spate of outperformance by active managers and mutual fund advertising has grown more demure once obsessed with trumpeting performance and celebrity fund managers , fund companies seem to have adopted a lowerkey approach , perhaps in part because so few funds can beat benchmarks like the standard poor s 500stock index over the long term \( a wise man listens to advice , counsels morgan stanley dean witter , citing the old testament in a newspaper advertisement we help you invest responsibly , fidelity investments says in another \) the data on mutual fund inflows also implies disillusionment adjusting for redemptions , cash flows into mutual funds in 1999 were about the same as they were the year before and well below the inflows of 1997 and 1996 , according to the investment company institute , a fund trade organization and while actively managed funds have been kicking up their heels of late with some marketbeating returns , index funds still reaped 39 percent of the new cash for the first 11 months of 1999 , according to the financial research corporation , a mutual fund consulting firm based in boston that compares with just 11 percent in 1996 one factor is revolutionary the rise of inexpensive online investing roughly 12 million households have online trading accounts , and the number is growing at one time , mutual funds were the most sensible , costeffective way to build a diversified equity portfolio in the eyes of many investors , the alternative was an overpriced stockbroker who always seemed to make more money than they did now , however , online investors can achieve reasonable diversification say , a dozen stocks at less longterm expense than if they bought mutual funds at just a few dollars a trade , they can buy shares of walmart stores , intel , general electric and so forth , then reinvest any dividends and get on with life but a fund charges management expenses year after year the avid phase of growth for the industry has largely been exhausted , said avi nachmany , director of research at strategic insight , a mutual fund consulting firm in new york he noted that after growing so fast for so long , mutual funds are now near an astounding 7 trillion in assets as he put it , you cannot grow in an exaggerated way when you are so large the experts point to several factors that help explain the shrinking flow of cash into funds investors are spending some of their enormous gains , which is one of the reasons that the consumer economy keeps booming people are squirreling away some of their profits in cash some are also nervous about pouring more money into a market that has already come so far because the booming stock market has propelled so many people beyond their investment goals , they feel less compelled to invest further but something more fundamental is at work , too people s irrepressible search for the new , the novel and the untried has dimmed the attraction of funds , which are now as familiar as an old shoe of course , none of this means that mutual funds are going away on the contrary , they are likely to remain central to the investment landscape for decades , even if our flaming passion for them continues to mature into a steady , comfortable attachment for one thing , mutual funds have given millions of americans the courage to invest , helping them to overcome their fear of wall street by letting them entrust their money to wellpaid professionals in nice suits and fancy offices who surely have some idea what they 're doing if you forced them to do something else , mr nachmany says of many mutual fund investors , they 'd stay in a bank indeed , mutual funds have become something of an investment comfort zone for people who do n't have the knowledge , confidence or time to invest by themselves after all , even mediocre equity funds have beaten money market funds over the long haul , no matter how much the average equity fund is lagging behind the s p 500 index long term as for indexing , the religion is likely to keep spreading fidelity recently introduced its fourinone index fund , which gives investors a simple way to invest in large stocks , small stocks , foreign stocks and bonds , all passively managed and all with low management expenses similarly , barclays global investors , an indexing giant that has traditionally served mainly institutional investors , plans a boatload of index offerings aimed at individual investors and e trade , the big online broker , offers some index funds of its own to customers but indexing , sensible though it may be , is n't helping the mutual fund industry generate sex appeal or excitement here is one conversation you 'll probably never hear in a bar my index fund trailed the s p 500 by just four basis points last quarter , one investor crows oh yeah \? well , mine trailed the index by just three basis points ! the popularity of index funds may be a sign that mutual fund investors , after an i 'll conquer the world adolescence , are finally developing realistic expectations something that most grownups will tell you is a key to a good marriage if people continue to expect 30 percent annual returns from their mutual funds , you can count on the relationship to end in tears sooner or later but with dampened expectations , funds and their investors can look forward to growing old together another key to an enduring marriage is give and take in the future , i suspect , the fund industry is going to have to give a little more and take a little less fees will have to come down indeed , there is evidence that they are already headed that way and one reality will have to be acknowledged it s tough to beat the averages over the long term and silly to pretend otherwise that , of course , suggests the true cornerstone of any good marriage honesty or , rather , just enough of it too much frankness \( like telling investors that fund managers are basically useless \) could drive the average joe and jane back to certificates of deposit , which will only make

none of us expected the asian fair to be the huge success it s been since day 1 , said khalil rizk , director of the chinese porcelain company in manhattan he was one of the instigators of new york s international asian art fair , which opens on thursday night and runs through march 29 at the seventh regiment armory we came up with the idea in 1994 because we were concerned that asian art was losing its appeal in america , mr rizk said everything we sold went abroad we were all asking ourselves how we could renew interest in asian art and attract young new collectors he met with brian and anna houghton , an english couple who organize many art fairs in new york the idea was to schedule a fair at the same time as the asian auctions , mrs houghton said robert ellsworth , the acknowledged dean of new york s asian art dealers , said , three dealers made it possible he did not say that he was one of the three , but once he signed on , the houghtons knew they could produce a fair this year the fair has 61 dealers from 8 countries , including china mrs houghton said there would be more japanese antiques , early chinese bronzes and antique textiles than in the past what s significant about the asian art market is that it is dominated by dealers , not auction houses , mr rizk explained at the fair you see very little that has been at auction before that s why the museum interest is huge last year on opening night 80 curators were lined up with their trustees when do you see that \?

united nations , july 25 the united nations is considering spending nearly 1 billion on a sixyear rebuilding program to address the structural and environmental woes of its aging headquarters buildings potent , though tarnished , symbols of postwar cooperation and enlightened urbanism from the business standpoint , there is no alternative , said joseph e connor , the under secretary general for management , who presented an analysis of the proposal to reporters today the rebuilding plan would require about a third of the organization s staff members to move out of the complex temporarily or into new quarters on the site , and it would be likely that the general assembly would have to meet in a conference room for a year the proposal is the result of a twoyear study completed last year that is to be submitted to the general assembly when it convenes in september if it is approved by the 188member general assembly , detailed plans will be drawn up , and the work could begin early in 2003 , mr connor said under the 964 million plan , about a third members of the staff of the united nations secretariat would be relocated in swing space during the renovation and refurbishment , which would be conducted in phases by far the boldest and , at 245 million , the most costly of the options for space features a 10story addition to be built atop the secretariat building , new york city s first curtainwalled glass skyscraper and , along with the sprawling , saddleshaped general assembly building , a widely recognized emblem of the organization another addition would be built atop the dag hammarskjold library , and the south annex would be rebuilt because the 17acre site is considered international territory , none of the buildings or interiors at the united nations headquarters have been designated new york city landmarks another , less costly option is the construction of two entirely new buildings , a sixstory structure on an empty expanse of the north lawn , below east 48th street , and a fourstory building off site a third option is to lease commercial office space in the neighborhood , which is less costly but fails to address future space needs significantly , mr connor said although the capital master plan focuses on basic infrastructure and compliance with new york city building codes , it includes plans for expansion of the organization s meeting rooms and conference building , and refurbishing of the general assembly auditorium , public lobbies and visitors' area , at a cost of 74 million the chambers of the security council , trusteeship council , and economic and social council , which are among the more architecturally distinguished interiors in the complex , will remain more or less untouched , mr connor said the united nations buildings , still elegant and imposing when viewed from first avenue or across the east river , have suffered years of budgetbased neglect , and ad hoc maintenance cannot keep pace with the breakdowns corroded pipes leak , railing supports are rusted out , roofs are soaked and spongy motors and water pumps are so antiquated that replacement parts are unavailable , and the airconditioning system has long been a source of consternation the secretariat building a shimmering , 572foot transparent glass slab , built on a northsouth axis , with 5 , 400 windows that actually open and close stands as a modern monument to wasteful energy consumption , and the buildings do not comply with city fire codes , handicapped accessibility standards or environmental safety codes mr connor displayed charts showing that if a rebuilding plan was not approved , the current ad hoc approach to maintenance would cost the united nations almost 12 billion over the next 25 years , mostly in emergency repairs and maintenance , while 490 million would be required to buy energy unless offsite space is leased , the refurbishment would be the first substantial new construction on the site since the completion of the hammarskjold library in 1961 most of the 27millionsquarefoot complex , which was designed by an international team of architects that included le corbusier , oscar niemeyer and wallace k harrison , was built between 1949 and 1952 the united nations will have to rely largely on member states to pay for putting the plan into effect the preferred form of payment would be a special assessment , levied over six to eight years and paid directly in cash , mr connor said consideration will also be given to spreading the cost over 25 years , either through interestfree loans from member states or commercial borrowing through a bond issue based on individual sovereign states' credit ratings the involvement of major contributors like the united states , which according to the united nations already owes more than 1 billion in back dues , will be essential to the plan s success the congress would have to look at it before any proposals can be made in response to this initiative , said don hayes , the representative in charge of management and reform at the united nations but we are the host country , and we will want to play our proper role when our time comes

hollywood , may 10 the anticult networks are kicking up a fuss discussion on internet movie sites is picking over the potentially sinister implications anonymous emails are whizzing around the country charging that , among other things , subliminal messages are being used to recruit unsuspecting moviegoers big summer action movies , filled with stars and special effects , do n't often come with such fascinating accessories battlefield earth , starring john travolta as a ninefoot alien with talons for fingers , will open in more than 2 , 000 theaters nationwide on fridayas directed by roger christian , who most recently had been the assistant director of star wars episode i the phantom menace , battlefield earth is set in the year 3000 and follows the adventures of enslaved earthlings , led by jonnie goodboy tyler \( played by barry pepper , the sharpshooting redneck in saving private ryan \) , trying to break free of the tyrannical psychlos \( led by mr travolta s character \) controversy has swirled around the film because it is based on the 1982 novel by l ron hubbard , who founded the church of scientology , and because the film was the pet project of mr travolta , who has made no secret of his dedication to scientology could this be a sneaky attempt to lure unsuspecting moviegoers into scientology \? the makers of the film and its distributors maintain that battlefield earth has nothing whatever to do with the church of scientology and that it is intended to be nothing more than a big summer adventure , devoid of subterfuge but several anticult web sites have posted warnings about the film in recent months that contain numerous charges for example cultwatch and factnet say that the film carries subliminal messages meant to lure people into scientology , that the film was secretly financed by scientology , and that scientology plans recruiting efforts to coincide with the movie s release scientology has been a flashpoint for controversy almost since its founding in 1954 , but particularly in the last quartercentury as some former members charged that they had been bilked and sometimes mistreated by officials of what many refer to as a moneymaking cult scientology , which says it is a nondenominational religious organization that helps its members reach a state of mental and spiritual clarity , has vigorously denied all such charges warner brothers will distribute the film in the united states in an arrangement with franchise pictures , an independent production company franchise had its first major release earlier this year , the mob comedy the whole nine yards there have been no charges that franchise is affiliated with scientology we have licensed the book as one would license any property , but there is no financial connection with the church , said lora drazen , a franchise spokeswoman no money made from the film would go to the church of scientology , she added rather , the film seems to have come about because of mr travolta s dedication to the story and because it meshed with franchise s strategy of attracting top stars by offering them a chance to make their dream projects scientology officials maintain that they have nothing to do with the making of the film the only things i know about the movie are what i read in the media , said marty rathbun , a scientology spokesman in los angeles he added that the church of scientology has no financial interest in the movie and had nothing to do with how it was made are there subliminal messages in the movie \? there are none , ms drazen said subliminal messages , visual or audio snippets inserted into a film so rapidly that the mind does not consciously register them , are believed by some to create a kind of hypnotic suggestion research , however , has repeatedly failed to show that subliminal messages have any such effect battlefield earth is not a scientology text , the filmmakers say , but an adventure that just happened to be written by the man who founded scientology though some of scientology s teachings revolve around space aliens , they bear no resemblance to the story of the evil psychlos james richardson , a professor of sociology and law at the university of nevada at reno who studies new religions , said hubbard s novel had little bearing on the organization s teachings i read it and thought it was a pretty good yarn , he said in a statement accompanying the film s production notes mr travolta said people have asked me if there is a connection between 'battlefield earth' and scientology' there is no connection l ron hubbard wrote numerous sciencefiction epics , which created the same kind of excitement amid scifi circles as such classics as robert heinlein s stranger in a strange land' and frank herbert s 'dune' other than being created by the same person , the two have virtually nothing to do with one another jonathan krane , who has been producing mr travolta s films for 15 years , was also one of the producers on battlefield earth , and describes the film s genesis in a sample chapter for a book he is writing about filmmaking the 20page entry on the making of battlefield earth is meant to be the book s final chapter , using a case study of the film to illustrate all the points made in the preceding chapters mr travolta had wanted to make a film based on hubbard s book since its publication , when the actor hoped to play the young human hero but it was not until three years ago , mr krane writes , that the actor believed that it was time to use his boxoffice clout to bring the project to fruition so many years had passed , though , that an aging mr travolta felt he needed to play the villain instead mr krane , who noted that he was not a member of scientology , said that he respected mr travolta s devotion to the group but believed it had nothing to do with the decision to make the movie he shrugged when asked whether a controversy might distract from the movie s release i do n't think so , he said the only time it comes up is when the media asks about it the next few weeks will tell the tale i imagine the movie will rise or fall based on how good a yarn it is , said mr richardson , the professor i seriously doubt that someone is going to go out and join scientology just because they see this movie
cuomo can still turn up the heat mario m cuomo has long had a reputation as a fiery speechmaker yesterday , he was a fieryspeech maker his notes went up in flames during a speech titled the soul of the profession thoughts on being a lawyer it s what i get for becoming a lawyer again , mr cuomo , who was governor of new york from 1982 to 1994 and is now a partner at willkie , farr gallagher , said after putting out the fire himself he was not injured he had prepared the incendiary remarks for a breakfast meeting at the association of the bar of the city of new york , on west 44th street near the avenue of the americas the new york law journal and the bar association had organized the session and had invited young lawyers and summer associates mr cuomo was blazing along when he realized his typed notes were ablaze or at least smoking the smoke begins to smell like real smoke from a real fire , mr cuomo said , switching to the present tense when he told the story later in the day all of a sudden , it gets heavier and small traces of flame appear then , a real flame i hold up the pages i say , 'let all of you in the room record that my words burst into flame' can a lawyer without a hose or a helmet play firefighter \? apparently so mr cuomo put the burning pages on a table and pounded out the flames with his fist he said that there was no obvious cause for the fire , though the lamp on the lectern was a likely culprit was there a message in the fire \? let s hope it s not the obvious one , he said anything to do with flames , especially if you 're a prevatican ii council catholic , that s not a good sign there are only two possibilities the burning bush or the other burning place fun beyond the beltway the question was has it come to this \? i'm here with four playboy bunnies in a car , james carville , the limelightloving democratic consultant , said from somewhere in manhattan once he was the campaign manager for bill clinton now he is the campaign manager for captain morgan , the longhaired seafarer pictured on bottles of spiced rum \( at parties like the one mr carville was on the way to , at the penthouse in the fifth avenue building where playboy has its offices , an actor plays the captain so far , the captain is not on the ballot anywhere \) what happened was , they did an event in washington , mr carville said , referring to the rum makers they said , 'hey , that worked out well , let s do one in new york' i come in and do spot events the idea is to poke fun at everything but does n't he risk losing credibility by playing a part in such stunts \? anything in america , a few people could take the wrong way , he said that whole thing is a whole huge spoof the idea is to have a little fun any time i ca n't have a little fun , it s just not worth it palatable across party lines howard wolfson , the chief spokesman for hillary rodham clinton s campaign , and mike murphy , the chief strategist for representative rick a lazio s campaign , have found something they agree on in new york restaurants or , more precisely , a restaurant independently of each other , mr wolfson and mr murphy have both proclaimed shun lee west , at 43 west 65th street , near lincoln center , to be their favorite place for dinner in new york mr murphy , who lives in virginia , ate there on tuesday night mr wolfson , who lives on the upper east side , ate there on wednesday night they have yet to cross paths there , though that seems to be just a matter of time mr wolfson offered a challenge to his counterpart dinner at shun lee west on the night after the election , with the losing candidate picking up the tab mr murphy , who learned of mr wolfson s restaurant preference over dinner at where else \? shun lee west , jumped at mr wolfson s offer , anticipating , no doubt , a free meal come november tell him the only grease i want is on the egg rolls none of his slippery quotes , mr murphy said , laughing the maitre d' better have a first aid kit ready james barron with adam nagourney
philadelphia , june 27 offering a sweeping vision of a future in which pollution is conquered and cars run without a drop of oil or gasoline , vice president al gore proposed tax breaks and other incentives today for both reducing america s dependence on oil and cleaning up the environment and he made clear that he wanted to claim these issues in the presidential election not only with his soaring oratory but with the amount of money that he was willing to devote to them , more than 125 billion over 10 years the plans that the vice president outlined today mostly various forms of tax breaks for businesses that provided or invested in more efficient , less conventional or less polluting sources of energy represented an estimated 75 billion in lost federal tax revenue or spending over 10 years , aides said but they said that the additional proposals that mr gore was expected to make on wednesday and thursday would bring that figure up to more than 125 billion mr gore framed that investment as both an opportunity and an obligation created by the country s current period of extraordinary prosperity there can be a next stage of prosperity in which american creativity builds not just a better product but also a healthier planet , mr gore said outside an energy plant here that was a model for the use of newer , cleaner , more efficient technology we will say to the nation s inventors and entrepreneurs if you invest in these new technologies , america will invest in you , mr gore continued and we will prove , once and for all , that we can clean up pollution , make our power systems more efficient and more reliable , and move away from dependence on others all with no new taxes , no new bureaucracies , and no onerous regulations while economists and business executives often worry that more cleanair efforts and stringent environmental regulations would hamper industry and limit the creation of new jobs , mr gore s approach emphasized the carrot of tax savings rather than the stick of restrictions , and it anticipated the growth of new companies and new jobs on the cutting edge of fuel technology but mr gore s pitch was more than just an exhortation for a cleaner environment it also reflected the sudden emergence of high gasoline prices as a potent issue in the 2000 presidential elections republicans have assailed the clinton administration for an energy policy that they say has left the country too vulnerable to the whims of foreign oil producers mr gore even folded into his speech a call for the federal trade commission s investigation into possible pricegouging by the oil industry to include public hearings , possibly with testimony from consumers earlier this month , when mr gore embarked on what he called a prosperity and progress tour , he said he would spend this week talking about environmental policy but since then , gas prices have become an increasingly heated point of contention between republicans and democrats , and today , the word energy accompanied and even preceded the word environment in the headlines atop the written remarks and policy summaries that mr gore s aides distributed to reporters and mr gore frequently alluded in his 26minute address to the problems of american dependence on big oil , a phrase undoubtedly meant as a dig against his republican rival , gov george w bush of texas , a former oil company executive democrats have said that mr bush s former professional ties and the enormous sums of campaign money he has received from oil companies would make him unwilling to press for lower prices at the gas pump in any case , mr gore said in his speech , our nextstage prosperity must be built on our ability to make sure americans will be free forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil mr gore said that america today stood on a new frontier of energy independence and environmental protection and should not fail to explore it it is an old , timid way of thinking to build our lives and livelihoods around a fuel source that is distant , uncertain and easily manipulated , he said it is a new , bold way of thinking to demand and develop new technologies to free ourselves from gastank pricegouging later , in a satellite interview with an abc affiliate in green bay , wis , mr gore attacked mr bush more directly i have never been afraid to take on big oil , mr gore said but , the vice president added , my opponent comes out of the oil industry his experience is as an oil company executive he called for higher oil prices to boost the oil companies' profits officials with the bush campaign noted that mr bush had endorsed the federal trade commission s investigation into oil companies and said that mr gore was merely trying to deflect attention from the clinton administration s responsibility for gas prices that have risen as much as 50 cents a gallon in some areas of the midwest mr gore , as it happens , will be taking his new energy message to that region over the next few days mr bush s aides further said that what mr gore unveiled today was really a set of environmental proposals , none of them especially visionary , that were recast and reconfigured to sound like an energy plan because the political landscape had changed so quickly the vice president seems to forget who s been in office for seven years , mr bush said at a news conference in michigan this afternoon this is an administration that s been in charge and the price of gasoline has risen steadily the plan that mr gore began to outline today centered on an unspecified menu of financial mechanisms , as material distributed by his aides called it , of tax incentives , loans , grants and bonds to help power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate and healththreatening pollution some of mr gore s proposals represented expansions of current federal programs , while others were new they included doubling the tax credit for businesses that turn wind or landfill methane into electricity and giving accelerated tax deductions to companies for the purchase of equipment that makes cleaner and more efficient use of fuel in the coming days , mr gore s aides said , the vice president will talk about tax breaks for consumers who use solar energy or buy products , like cars , that do not use traditional sources of fuel like oil mr gore s proposals seem to veer in somewhat different directions from those of the last democratic president to offer a sweeping set of proposals on energy use , jimmy carter as a way of trying to reduce dependence on foreign oil , mr carter set import quotas on the amount of foreign oil accepted into american ports and he encouraged the development of alternative sources of fuel , including coal , oil shale , unconventional gas and the sun mr carter asked that utility companies cut their use of oil by 50 percent over a decade , and switch to other fuels , particularly coal and most famously , he ordered thermostats turned down in the winter as a conservation measure and wore a sweater in the chilly white house photo in philadelphia yesterday , vice president al gore visited the trigen energy corporation , which uses more efficient technology mr gore met workers , from left brian budd , frank wolfrom and don ferriolo \( associated press \)
a federal judge has upheld the food and drug administration s policy on genetically modified food , throwing out a lawsuit by biotechnology opponents that sought to require that such foods be labeled and tested for safety the decision represents a victory for the fda at a time when the agency is under fire from biotechnology critics for not regulating bioengineered foods strictly enough that criticism has increased in the last two weeks after environmental groups discovered a genetically engineered corn that was not approved for human consumption in taco shells in the taco case , meanwhile , a man who said he developed severe hives and stomach problems after eating the shells filed a lawsuit , the first known formal claim that anyone had actually been hurt by the corn the dismissed lawsuit was not directly related to the taco shell incident it was filed in 1998 challenging the fda s fundamental policy on genetically engineered foods in its policy statement , issued in 1992 , the agency said genetically modified foods were generally recognized as safe and would not be regulated as food additives it set up voluntary , not mandatory , consultations for companies wanting to market such foods it also said labeling was not required because genetic engineering did not change food in a material way the lawsuit , filed by the alliance for biointegrity and by some scientists and clergy members , said that lack of labeling and mandatory safety testing violated food safety laws the suit also asserted that the fda had not allowed for proper public comment or filed an environmental impact statement on the new policy and it said the lack of labeling violated the religious rights of people who did not want to eat such foods on moral grounds but judge colleen kollarkotelly of the united states district court in washington granted summary judgment to the fda , ruling that the agency was not arbitrary and capricious in its finding that genetically modified foods need not be labeled because they do not differ 'materially' from nonmodified foods the decision was issued friday but the parties involved did not receive copies until late monday judge kollarkotelly also said that the government did not have to follow procedures for public notice and comment or file an environmental impact statement because the 1992 announcement was a policy statement , not a formal regulation the plaintiffs snatched some measure of victory from that reasoning it s a court ruling that there has n't been any regulation on genetic engineering from the fda , said joseph mendelson iii , a lawyer for the international center for technology assessment , a washington public interest group that was one of the plaintiffs an fda spokeswoman said only that the agency was pleased by the decision mr mendelson said the plaintiffs would not appeal because the fda is now changing its regulations those new regulations , while tougher , do not go far enough and could be the subject of a new lawsuit , he said in the taco shell incident , meanwhile , the fda said it had confirmed that starlink corn was in the taco bell brand taco shells and had instituted a formal recall , although kraft foods , a unit of philip morris , which sold the shells , has already voluntarily recalled them the fda also said it would now test other processed corn products wallace wasson of chicago stated in a lawsuit that he suffered a severe stomachache , diarrhea , headache and hives after eating the kraft taco shells mr wasson joined a classaction suit yesterday that had been filed last week against kraft and azteca milling , which made the corn flour used in the shells starlink was not approved for human consumption because of concerns that it could cause allergies but there is no proof that it actually does cause allergies and some experts have said the chances of this are small the environmental groups that first detected the starlink in the taco shells said they had received numerous calls from people believing they had suffered reactions to the shells but even these biotechnology opponents said that many of the claims were dubious and that none had been confirmed an fda spokeswoman said the agency had received a few complaints of adverse reactions and was investigating them according to the complaint filed in illinois state court in chicago , mr wasson ate some taco shells on the evening of sept 20 and awoke in pain at 3 am the next morning on sept 22 , hearing the news about the tainted taco shells , he called the tollfree number listed on the taco shell box and was referred to a doctor , who assured him the shells were safe
as verizon communications prepares to enter its fifth day of bargaining with its striking unions , the question arises has verizon received more than it bargained for with this strike \? the walkout by 86 , 000 workers of verizon , the nation s largest telecommunications employer , has developed into one of the largest and most unruly strikes in years , raising questions about the company s preparation for the contract talks and its handling of the walkout management was distracted for the first six months of the year by the completion of the merger of bell atlantic and gte , which created the newly named verizon and then the company was eager to embark on a huge advertising and promotional campaign to establish the new verizon brand did those distractions lead the company s management to underestimate the unions' intent to transform the aug 5 contract deadline into a point of reference for organized labor s future in hightechnology companies \? i think there probably was a certain amount of arrogance here on management s part , said neil bernstein , a professor of law at washington university in st louis who also works as a labor arbitrator telephone companies have generally not been overly concerned about strikes , mainly because their services are so automated the company denies that it underestimated the challenge of reaching a new contract no company ever wants a strike , and we most certainly did everything we could to prevent one , said eric rabe , verizon s spokesman sometimes it s just necessary to get eyeball to eyeball on issues instead of a token walkout like the twoday strike by bell atlantic s unions two years ago , verizon has received a mounting public relations problem the company s customers in the 12 eastern states and washington , where the strike is taking place , are unable to reach directory assistance and regionwide , requests for repairs have swelled to 82 , 000 , compared with 36 , 000 at this time last month negotiations between verizon and the two unions representing its employees , the communications workers of america and the international brotherhood of electrical workers , deteriorated yesterday , reducing chances for a quick resolution , according to people close to the talks and on the picket lines , tension has increased between management and strikers the unions said yesterday that nine picketers had been hit by managers' vehicles in separate incidents , but that none were hospitalized verizon said that union members had thrown bottles , rocks and eggs at managers trying to enter company buildings so far , 24 union members throughout the region have been arrested during the strike , according to the company a profit warning from the company on tuesday sent shares in verizon down more than 12 percent , and yesterday they fell an additional 37 percent , to 4050 a share since june , shares in verizon , the nation s largest provider of local telephone and wireless service , have fallen nearly 30 percent , to a twoyear low the company s woes come amid a nationwide advertising campaign that began on aug 1 , using actors including james earl jones to make people more aware of the new name , which is pronounced vahriseun and even as chances of a strike mounted before the deadline of 12 01 am last sunday set by the union , verizon chose to proceed with its advertising plans this is clearly not the association you want to build as you launch a new brand , said martin tipping , director of naming at landor associates , a corporate identity consulting company at least people are learning how to pronounce the name according to people involved in the talks , an indication of verizon s handling of the negotiations came in the minutes leading up to the deadline only then did verizon make concessions to one of the unions' main demands , which would allow them to organize in the company s fastgrowing wireless division by that time , though , it was too late to avoid a strike while verizon had also made wage and benefit concessions that the unions found satisfactory , other issues remained stumbling blocks they included the use of nonunion contractors and the relocation of some work in response to the merger or changing corporate priorities labor experts say it appears verizon did not correctly gauge the unions' readiness to turn the strike opportunity into a sounding board for labor s place in the new economy this strike is pivotal because the unions are confronting changes produced by rapid technological advances , said richard hurd , professor of labor issues at cornell university the unions are not emerging from the strike with their image unscathed one union member was arrested today for harrassing a verizon manager at a company building in manhattan and the new york city police department has been investigating the possibility that strikers have been involved in numerous acts of vandalism that have knocked out telephone service in some parts of the city in manhattan yesterday , five police officers from the midtown south precinct who were monitoring picket lines were doused with bird excrement and other waste dumped from the top of verizon s 41story headquarters building on the avenue of the americas at 42nd street the officers were taken to bellevue hospital and treated for exposure to animal feces we 're not going to rule out management or strikers , said sgt andrew mcinnis , a spokesman for the police department photo as contract negotiations continued at verizon communications , reports of vandalism increased a verizon employee inspects damaged phone wires at gildersleeve avenue and white plains road in the bronx \( angel franco the new york times \)
a few weeks ago , i went shopping for a 32inch television set i visited a couple of local electronics superstores , read consumer reports , talked to friends and i searched the internet , where i found just the highly rated , featureladen model i wanted , for 750 , shipping included no tax the salesman at circuit city was willing to match the price , but with the sales tax it would still cost me more so i bought the tv set from an ecommerce site called 800com it arrived recently and works perfectly this was a great deal for me and by making it , i participated in a grand experiment that is helping to hold down inflation while sustaining the booming economy too bad it ca n't last let me explain there are several big reasons why the american economy has managed in recent years to defy the rule of thumb that strong growth and low unemployment inevitably lead the general level of prices up an accelerating escalator perhaps the most crucial factor lately has been fierce competition from internet shopping sites willing to sell goods at a loss in order to lure customers from traditional retailers while comparatively few people actually buy much yet online , the cutrate prices widely available in the virtual economy have forced many companies operating in the bricksandmortar world to respond by keeping their prices low , too as sung won sohn , chief economist at wells fargo bank in minneapolis , recently noted in just one example among many many people check toy prices on the internet and ask toy stores to match them or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it for less on the internet this is heaven for consumers while the general price level for all goods and services has been rising for the last few years at what is still a very modest 2 percent or so , prices in many of the most competitive arenas are actually down the price index for toys , as calculated by the bureau of labor statistics , has been falling since 1995 books , on average , cost less today than in 1997 prices for audio and video equipment , which just joined the ecommerce rush , dipped last year by 038 percent but it is hell for retailers despite the benefit of a sales tax exemption , ecommerce companies selling everything from harry potter and pokemon to dvd players and the saving private ryan disks to watch on them all at big discounts are losing tons of money some say they are inherently more efficient , and it is just a matter of time before they turn a profit others , like buycom , argue that they do n't need to make money on products they sell to consumers , because they expect to make plenty selling ad space on their sites either way , merchants on the web do n't really care , as long as investors remain willing to bid up their stock , making it easy to raise even more cash to cover their losses this situation is bound to come to an end it wo n't happen immediately , but even internet companies cannot continue to lose money indefinitely there s going to be a shakeout , said jose a rasco , an economist at hoenig company in rye brook , ny , who wrote a short report last week on what he calls digital deflation i'm not a big believer in the model that says you can sell at a loss but make it up on volume , mr rasco added and ad spending wo n't hold up in a downturn so when the consolidation takes place and it will suppliers will regain some pricing leverage over consumers none of this diminishes the extraordinary economic benefits to be derived from the commercialization of the internet even after many of the web sites that cannot generate a profit disappear , the internet will remain a powerful tool for bringing together potential buyers and sellers from anywhere in the world the web will continue to empower consumers by giving them a lot more information to use in bargaining for the best price cars , for example , are not sold online , but sites like autobytel \( www autobytel com \) and carpoint \( www carpoint com \) allow buyers to solicit bids from a number of dealers from the haven of their own desks and there is now a wealth of oncesecret wholesale price information available online i remember when the edmunds blue book was practically the holy grail , mr rasco said now you can get it everywhere online for free this freeforall has forced every supplier that wants to survive to become more efficient , enhancing economic growth in myriad ways and consumers , taking advantage of their savings , have more money left to spend freely on all kinds of things but the current arrangement , in which many web shopping sites are practically giving away their products , is too good to last enjoy it while you can graph
of all of the communications and media companies affected by america online s deal to acquire time warner , perhaps none will feel the impact as deeply as att the king of a stagnant industry the longdistance telephone business att has bet more than 100 billion of its shareholders' money that the road to reinvigoration is paved with cable television systems under c michael armstrong , the company s chairman since 1997 , att has acquired telecommunications inc and agreed to buy mediaone group inc when the mediaone takeover is completed , att will be the nation s biggest cable company but it may no longer be the most important a combined aol time warner would not only rival att in cable television it would also be the biggest internet company and would dwarf att in other media including movies and magazines as the bell local phone carriers move to eviscerate att s core longdistance business , att badly needs to sign up cable companies like aol time warner to jointly offer phone service over cable lines a telephone deal att had reached with time warner is on hold until att completes its mediaone deal att , meanwhile , could become a valuable partner in the distribution of america online s internet service time warner s cable systems do not compete directly with att s , and att has been trying to form a partnership with america online at least since last summer in an interview on friday , mr armstrong spoke by telephone from englewood , colo , near att s cable headquarters , about the broad implications of the america onlinetime warner agreement and about what it means for his company following are excerpts from the conversation q what s on your mind with all the news about the aoltime warner deal \? a first , i was delighted that it really confirms that broadband is the future of communications , and in particular , that i think cable has to be now declared the broadband preferred technology the largest transaction in american corporate history was a lot about that and i think as a result it s going to stimulate boardroom thinking about new relationships between content and distribution , including we and aoltime warner i think also , finally , maybe it may and i'm out on a limb here it may begin the reconciliation of the very disparate valuations that are in the marketplace between what is a dotcom and what is n't a dotcom , as all of us become internetenabled and based q are you thinking of this new company mostly as a competitor , as a potential partner or somewhere in the middle \? a this was very positive for the relationship , not only between time warner and att but now , aol and att my bottom line is that i believe that there s more opportunity for communications and strategic relationship because our core strengths today now complement each other much more than they did before they are more contentcentric , we are communicationcentric but we both carry a common purpose we both seek ubiquity in reach and in devices and the one arena that we share , i think , a strength by working together , is in the interactive tv area , which i think is going to really help this whole digital revolution come to maturity q specifically , what are some of the ways in which we might anticipate some sort of cooperation \? a i think our ability to help them reach a large population of consumers and commerce , through our infrastructure , is something that they should be interested in , and i think they are and surely we have interests in using their infrastructure for our communicationcentricity to do the same , to reach an everincreasing number of consumers and commercial enterprises so we ought to be sitting down and i believe we will and expand upon just the negotiation we were having with time warner to now include a wholly new , a newly aligned aol q at their news conference on monday , gerald levin , the chairman of time warner , and steve case , america online s chairman , said they had called you first thing that morning why do you think they made that public , and what did they have to say \? a well , first , i think they made that public because they , too , believed that the relationship that was developing with time warner and it was a very sound as well as friendly relationship and we were in discussions was obviously now going to be redefined and i do n't think anybody would have suggested that aol and att , at least publicly , were getting on that well it was more adversarial and so steve case in particular wanted me to know that we now had much more alignment we now had much more common interest , and that he very much looked forward , along with jerry , to coming to some communications and strategic relationships with att finally , they wanted to let me know that even though there were a lot of things that were going on , they would make the time to have these negotiations so that this would not in any way impede our schedule
an amiably cocky frenchman in sunglasses steals a car , mugs people for petty cash to romance a cute american student and tries to collect money from shady characters so he can run away with her to rome , but she seems more interested in flirting with contacts to secure a writing job , besides which she is pregnant by the frenchman and he seems indifferent to this fact , while a police manhunt closes in on them both no wonder they called it breathless ! actually , the original title , a bout de souffle , might be better translated as out of breath , with more somber connotations forty years after it shook up the movie world , jeanluc godard s brilliant provocation is being revived at the film forum for one week , april 713 , in a new print for his debut feature , godard , now 69 , wanted to make a film where anything goes , and there is still a strong scent of the anarchic and dangerous in his concoction susan sontag once compared godard s impact on his medium with schoenberg s introduction of atonal music and the cubists' challenge to traditional painting having been a young , impressionable film buff when breathless first appeared , i ca n't help but experience nostalgic exhilaration at the memory of its freshness granted , breathless had plenty of company in the early 60 s , such masterworks as l'avventura , la dolce vita , psycho and the apu trilogy were thrilling audiences worldwide , while godard s confreres in the cahiers du cinema circle , the criticsturnedfilmmakers of the french new wave francois truffaut , claude chabrol , eric rohmer , jacques rivette and louis malle , were astonishing us with everything from the 400 blows to zazie dans le metro yet only breathless seemed a revolutionary break with the cinema that had gone before it seemed a new kind of storytelling , with its saucy jump cuts , digressions , quotes , in jokes and addresses to the viewer and yet , underneath all these brash interventions was a mozartean melancholy that strongly suggested classical measure classicalmodern was the way godard phrased it in a later film , bande a part that godardian paradox was already operative in breathless what seemed miraculous when the film first opened remains its greatest coup godard s ability to infuse an improvisatory manner with an underlying mood of grave inevitability the spontaneity came from the way he worked using a fivepage outline by truffaut , rather than a finished script writing the day s dialogue at the last moment and speaking it to the actors just before they had to deliver their lines \( they were shot silent and dubbed in later \) and employing a handheld camera and a wheelchair to save the time of laying tracks for dolly shots but the gravity came from somewhere deep inside godard , a defeatist quality symbolized by those fatalistic overhead shots he thought he was borrowing from fritz lang godard remains the darling of film studies , if only for the way his selfreflective movies highlight issues of cinematic fabrication but will 17yearolds still respond to breathless as revolutionary \? i think they might , because , however much its technical innovations have been assimilated , it still speaks to youth through its rebellious impudence in a curious way , it could even be seen as the progenitor of the youthcult film if you do n't like the sea , and do n't care for the mountains , and do n't like the big city either , the film s protagonist , michel \( jeanpaul belmondo \) , jibes at the camera and us while driving , then go hang yourself so he rattles on with his views of france , hitchhiking , women drivers a few moments later , he has shot a traffic policeman to death \( this combination of yakking and violence would later lead a godardsmitten quentin tarantino to attempt the same in pulp fiction \) whether meant as a gidean gratuitous act or a means of survival , the shooting certainly complicates our attitude toward michel is he a sociopath or just a likable , nonetoobright guy in a jam \? perhaps both he makes himself up as he goes along michel belmondo is forever adjusting his performance , doing faces in the mirror , practicing lines , imitating his hero , humphrey bogart , and aspiring to the toughguy niche he insecurely occupies life is a bluff , we are none of us authentic , the film seems to say just as godard is bluffing at genre , pretending to make an ordinary gangster bmovie meanwhile , death awaits we are dead men on leave , the film quotes lenin the existential pessimism and philosophy of selfinvention in breathless fit right into the mood of young people exiting with relief the conformist 50 s godard also struck an antiauthoritarian note by mocking the police \( who are portrayed like bumbling keystone kops , in what looks like a cheap shot today \) the filmmaker , who was from a family of swissprotestant physicians and bankers , came to antibourgeois sentiments early as david sterritt perceptively observes in his recent book , the films of jeanluc godard , michel s character including its more menacing side draws some of its dark power from the filmmaker s own brushes with this territory mr godard as late as 1952 was known as a chronic thief \( relatives and the cahiers office were among his targets \) , a failed homosexual prostitute , and enough of a social misfit to be committed by his father to a psychiatric hospital for what one biographical sketch describes as 'a considerable period' these antisocial impulses did not constitute the whole story , however godard was also an ethnology student , a sober , thoughtful film critic and an artist of severe integrity
since may , a handful of women have been meeting regularly over cafeteria lunches at the jacob k javits federal building downtown , like relatives brought together with a sad purpose at a hospital lunch is the break in each day of watching the trial of the two men accused of killing their husbands and children they have been together since dec 21 , 1988 , when pan am flight 103 exploded over lockerbie , scotland , killing 270 people we 've been waiting for a trial for 12 years , said joan dater , whose 20yearold daughter , gretchen , was on the plane the truth has been denied to us for all these years they are nervous about the case , which is unfolding in a court in the netherlands , and is being relayed by closedcircuit television in a viewing room in the federal building that is open only to them after hundreds of witnesses , the prosecutors , barristers for the scottish government , are expected to rest their case this week many of the american passengers' hundreds of family members say they are gratified by the workings of justice but they are also facing the possibility that the guilty whom the prosecution say are two libyan agents and the defense says is a web of other palestinian terrorists will go unpunished or worse , they fear , the story lines so laboriously strung together by investigators could come undone and leave no explanation at all many of the passengers' family members who are closely watching the trial are getting by in the same way they have for 12 years since their loved ones died by banding together the families gather to watch in manhattan and washington , at sites set up by the justice department and the scottish courts they are the only people allowed to see the trial in the united states for the halfdozen or so who go to the federal buidling as often as their schedule allows sometimes daily it has become almost a vocation they have watched as prosecutors have argued that two libyan agents sent a suitcase with explosives from malta to frankfurt to london , and from there to pan am flight 103 , bound for new york , while the defense has sought to link the bombing to a palestinian group and a terrorist in prison in sweden the trial has caused the families intense disappointment a witness who was supposed to have seen the defendants with the suitcase could not testify that he had but it has also renewed hope , with evidence that one defendant bought clothing that was packed with the bomb most of those who meet to watch are placing their confidence in the prosecution , even though it has not produced a witness who saw the defendants with the brown samsonite bag at the malta airport the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming , mrs dater said helen engelhardt , whose husband , tony hawkins , was killed , is less certain i just want the truth to come out , she said after one morning s testimony meant to implicate palestinian terrorists arrested in germany if they draw that connection , fine the discussion never stops among the faithful who travel from from uptown and new jersey and brooklyn the other day dr lestra benello , a retired internist who lost her 24yearold son , julian , drove five hours from hanover , nh at a cafeteria table for four , mrs dater , who lives in ramsey , nj , began one of the things we 've learned through the six and a half months we 've been here and stopped when she heard a gasp jane davis , who has a house in connecticut and rented an apartment in manhattan for the trial , had gasped at the words six and half months she looked at kathy daniels tedeschi , who takes the train in from belle mead , nj , and the two broke out into laughter , amazed that so much time had gone by they have been close friends for years some moments are much harder mrs dater could not keep a tear from sliding down her cheek as she said i feel very strongly i'm standing in for gretchen she s saying , 'mom , what happened to me \? ' after friday s testimony , mrs davis and ms engelhardt , who is from flatbush , brooklyn , said they were still a bit shaken by the evidence presented that morning bombmaking equipment and a radio cassette recorder of the kind that was packed with explosives and put aboard flight 103 those gathering for the trial say they are unsettled by looking at the faces of the accused , abdelbaset ali mohmed almegrahi and al amin khalifa fhimah last week they saw mohamed abo talb , who the defense says was part of a palestinian terrorist group that caused the bombing , brought from swedish prison he said that he had known nothing of the lockerbie bombing , but acknowledged other attacks what s he like \? mrs dater asked this is something that s been on my mind for 12 years what kind of people are these \? how do they think \? ms engelhardt said the political intrigue surrounding the bombing meant that none of this is normal grieving the families sometimes think they are the only ones paying attention to the trial in a nation whose interest in international affairs , even in terrorist atrocities , has waned at the table , mrs tedeschi said , nodding to the other women , we can talk to someone on our own level reporters are not allowed to see the televised proceedings , though they are admitted to the court at camp zeist scottish law does not permit the trial participants to talk to journalists whether for lack of headlines or faded memories or because of urgings to put the loss behind them , many friends and even relatives are blurry on pan am flight 103

passaic in the window of el jardin restaurante on main avenue , where the awning advertises comida tipica mexicana , or authentic mexican food , a poster for a passaic county freeholder candidate includes a message that spanishspeaking voters understand all too well ! el momento ha llegado ! elejamos a uno de los nuestros the moment has arrived ! let s elect one of our own the moment , of course , refers to next tuesday s election and one of our own is equally obvious despite the fact that 29 percent , or about 140 , 000 of passaic county s 485 , 064 resident are hispanic , none of the seven passaic county freeholders are and in this city , where twothirds of its residents either come from or have parents who come from places where spanish is the primary language , only two in seven city council members are hispanic the united states department of justice agrees with the poster s sentiments , and has taken the position that many hispanics in passaic county have not even had an adequate opportunity to vote last month , in what amounted to a federal takeover of the county board of elections after the filing of a civil rights suit filed by the justice department in 1998 , a former federal prosecutor was appointed to act as a county election monitor moreover , as far as a justice department spokeswoman , kara peterson , knows , the monitor , walter f timpone who has the power to hire and fire election workers and distribute election material is the only federal election monitor in place in the country this election season the department filed the suit after an investigation into complaints were lodged by hispanic residents here , who claimed that they were discouraged from voting in passaic , paterson , clifton , haledon and prospect park because of the lack of bilingual poll workers and voting materials and intimidation from poll workers and offduty officers from the passaic county sheriff s department basically , one of our major concerns has been the lack of participation of latinos in the electoral process , and the lack of representation of candidates for office in the county that would seem to be a reflection of the population , said daniel jara , president of the state hispanic chamber of commerce and paterson native , who founded the organization in 1989 before moving it to jersey city three years ago it has a big impact because the county awards millions of dollars in contracts , and we do n't have someone who will open the door for us and this goes far beyond passaic county mr jara said 65 percent of the businesses in paterson and passaic , the county s commercial centers , were owned by latinos we are paying the taxes , but we are not being part of the process and part of the opportunities , he said mr timpone , a registered democrat who is a former assistant united states attorney for new jersey , was appointed after municipal elections in may and the county primary the following month in which federal election observers reported that the county had not complied with a consent order it signed in june 1999 he said the complaints cited a pattern of abuses by offduty sheriff s officers either working at the polls or serving as election challengers for the republican party william curry , who is chairman of the passaic county democratic committee and is one of two democrats on the fourmember board of elections , said the abuses have been orchestrated by edwin englehardt , the longtime republican sherrif mr curry charged that because the county s hispanics had tended to vote democratic , it was in the sheriff s interest to suppress the vote these kinds of abuses have been going on for years , he said said sheriff englehardt failed to respond to repeated requests for comment one step mr timpone took almost immediately was to ban lawenforcement officers from working at the polls , a job that pays 100 but other county republicans have defended the sheriff , who at a 1988 rally for vice president george bush referred to the american civil liberties union as that great organization that s against everything that is right with america freeholder walter w porter jr , one of three republicans on the sevenmember board , said the sheriff was popular among all groups in the county and had appointed more minorities , including and blacks and hispanics , than any other county department head i know englehardt well enough to know he would not tolerate any hankypanky , mr porter said he does n't need to win an election by intimidating people miguel de la carerra , one of two republicans currently running for freeholder , said , i have n't heard of any intimidation out of the sheriff s office in a gesture that mr timpone called encouraging , the freeholders unanimously approved a resolution in support of the ban on lawenforcement officers working the polls the resolution states that the ban is intended to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest , not an actual conflict , and nowhere does it suggest that voters have ever been intimidated mr porter , who has been a freeholder since 1980 , noted dryly that board members did not have much of a choice but to pass the resolution and that by doing so did they hardly go out on a limb how can you be against motherhood and apple pie \? he said to meet terms of the consent decree , mr timpone said that all the required bilingual sample ballots would be mailed out in advance of wednesday s deadline , and that a republican and a democratic polling worker each bilingual had been recruited for all of the 140 polling places in the five communities involved the consent decree also called for an outreach campaign to assure hispanics they would be welcomed at the polls mr timpone estimated that more than half of the 11 , 433 new registered voters in the county since august were hispanic as of last week , there were 239 , 116 registered voters in the county , including 44 , 600 republicans , 53 , 216 democrats , 909 independents and 140 , 391 undeclared voters they 're not going to steal anything while i'm on the watch , vowed rudy filko , a republican who was named county superintendent of elections in april under a separate suit filed against the city of passaic in february , the justice department is seeking to replace the city s current form of government , in which each of the seven council members is elected by voters citywide in nonpartisan elections the department has charged that a highly cohesive voting block of nonhispanics has produced an ethnic makeup of the council disproportionate to the city s demographics last tuesday night , the third game the world series was getting under way when narendra trivedi was among 150 poll workers leaving passaic city hall after a training session attended by mr timpone and county election officials mr trivedi , 50 , who immigrated here from india and has been a united states citizen for 15 years , said that he had never heard of voter discrimination in his native bombay , and that he hardly expected to hear allegations of it in passaic county i was surprised , yes indeed , said mr trivedi because my understanding was it was always fair and no intimidation but you realize it can happen photos the justice department appointed walter f timpone , left , as an election monitor in passaic to assure that hispanic voters are not discouraged from participation passaic county is 29 percent hispanic \( trish lease for the new york times \)
augusta , me , march 13 breaking new ground in the national campaign to legalize the medical use of marijuana , the sheriff of maine s most populous county recommended to lawmakers today that marijuana confiscated during drug arrests be doled out to the ill such a system , sheriff mark n dion of cumberland county told legislators , would mean that patients would not have to violate laws against buying marijuana and become criminals in order to survive their illness sheriff dion spoke at a hearing on a bill that highlighted the increasingly common confusion and contradictions that ensue when a state approves a referendum allowing use of marijuana for patients with cancer , aids and certain other diseases thus far , the hawaii legislature and voters in eight states have passed such ballot measures , all in the west except maine , which approved its maine medical marijuana initiative last november by 61 percent to 39 percent the law exempted patients from state laws against the personal use of marijuana and said they could grow up to six plants to supply themselves but the initiative could not exempt patients from federal laws , nor could it help those who could not grow plants themselves and must buy marijuana from suppliers who were , by definition , criminals so maine , like other states , has found itself facing a knotty question voters have said they wanted medical marijuana available , but how can it be legally distributed \? one answer is the bill examined today by the legislature s joint committee on health and human services , which sets a national precedent by proposing that the state take a step beyond the approval of medical marijuana and actually supply it the bill would create a system for registering patients whose doctors had affirmed that they had a condition that might be alleviated by marijuana , and it would have the maine drug enforcement agency provide them with confiscated supplies the bill s sponsor , senator anne m rand , argued that such a system would help lawenforcement officers , who could better distinguish who was a legitimate possessor of marijuana and who was not , and might even discourage mainers from growing more marijuana themselves committee members raised several questions and objections , including concerns that confiscated marijuana could be contaminated or laced with harder drugs , and the state would thus find itself in the position of distributing harmful substances to vulnerable patients they also worried that such a distribution system might incur the wrath of the federal government , which might then cut off millions of dollars in grants to maine i do have a real fear of the feds coming down on us and mucking up the works , representative lois a snowemello said sheriff dion said that he worried about the federal authorities too but that he believed retaliation was unlikely , and , in any case , he added , shall we as a sovereign state be held hostage by the federal government simply because we intend to treat our sick and afflicted \? in addition , supporters of the bill said , other states that have begun implementing medical marijuana laws have not incurred retaliatory cuts from federal authorities , though none have the kind of distribution system maine is proposing as for the possibility of contamination , supporters of the bill said buyers faced that threat now , and the new arrangement would not increase it sheriff dion also suggested that the supply for patients could come from confiscated plants rather than dried stashes of marijuana , thus ensuring that it had not been laced with any harder drug the law is only as complex and out of reach as we make it , he said this is not really rocket science but legal questions do remain an assistant attorney general , james m cameron , said his office supported the plan to register patients , but opposed a distribution system that would make dedicated police officers criminals under federal law the committee is scheduled to discuss the bill further on thursday , and could choose to vote then representative thomas j kane , a committee cochairman , said that given the voters' clear will as expressed in the initiative , we ca n't let it die sheriff dion s support for the bill and his support for last year s medical marijuana initiative put him in what he cheerily called a pretty small fraternity , with two or three california colleagues , of lawenforcement officials who publicly support such a change in laws no other maine lawenforcement official is supporting the bill or supported the initiative , he said but sheriff dion said he believed that being a police service professional means more than enforcing the law it means , too , that he should advocate for social justice when the law fails to meet the needs of its citizens

larry bird went out with a victory in his last home game as pacers coach , his team embodying the principles of their hall of fame player move the ball around the perimeter , help out on defense , rotate and refuse to give up layups or dunks and shoot the lights out 574 percent for the game , including 10 of 20 3pointers miller s last of four 3pointers came with 10 minutes 44 seconds remaining , a 26foot shot from the right wing that made the arena rumble that shot put indiana ahead , 9368 , and sent miller into the arms of his ecstatic teammates as phil jackson called timeout on the lakers' sideline miller received all the help needed from them jalen rose could not be stopped , scoring 20 firsthalf points as indiana took the game to the lakers early he finished with 32 i was talking about not letting them celebrate on our floor , and i was serious about that , rose said we did not want that to happen , especially after the season we had it just was n't going to happen against the most accomplished defensive team in the league , miller and rose combined for 42 points and the pacers shot 61 percent to take a 6445 lead into halftime the lakers trimmed the margin to 13 midway through the third quarter , but another pacer binge sent indiana into the final period with an insurmountable 8667 cushion o'neal \( 35 points and 11 rebounds \) was the only laker who had presence on the offensive end after the indefatigable bryant played 47 minutes and scored 8 of his 28 points in the lakers' game 4 overtime gem on wednesday , he returned to earth tonight picking up his fifth foul with 1 minute 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter , he missed 16 of 20 shots and never found the rhythm that carried his team to victory after o'neal had fouled out in overtime i did n't have a good game tonight , but whatever , bryant said we came here and did what he had to do which was get one now it s back to the staples only seven teams in nba history have recovered from a 31 deficit in a sevengame series to win it , and no team has ever accomplished the feat in the finals indiana cannot take much solace in the idea of having to beat a 67victory team twice on its home court over the next four days to record its first nba title i still think they feel real good about themselves , bird said they 've got two games at home and shaq is still playing well they 've still got the upper hand but the lakers have had their problems in closeout games , falling to 36 with the game 5 loss they lost their composure at several junctures , none more noticeable than when derek fisher rushed out to defend a miller 3pointer at the outset of the fourth quarter and was called for the foul arguing vehemently , he was hit with a technical miller made all three free throws , plus the technical the lakers had given up their second 4point possession of the game it was a night that everything seemed out of the ordinary , said fisher , one of the more composed lakers those were four points that hurt us to start the fourth quarter the noise inside the arena was more deafening than even for game 4 , when indiana seemed on the cusp of knotting the series at 22 before falling by 120118 in overtime rik smits , too , gave indiana a monstrous lift he parlayed his 24point night in game 4 with a 12point performance in game 5 the more he makes o'neal respect his jump shot , the more energy the lakers' 7foot1inch , 330pound center expends the lakers simply could not overcome a firstquarter onslaught from the pacers making 15 of their first 20 shots and leading by 3928 after the first quarter , indiana looked intent on sending the series back to los angeles after rose dunked with 5 56 left in the second quarter , he scored on a reverse layup moments later to push the lead to 5435 jackson looked disgusted at glen rice , who looked like a cardboard cutout against rose miller and rose looked as cocksure as ever , shooting an unreal 8 of 10 from behind the 3point line in the first half midway through the first quarter , miller shot a 26footer from the right wing , drawing a foul from ron harper and finishing a 4point play with a free throw miller found himself alone again behind the line on the left baseline with time running down in the second quarter he gave brian shaw a pump fake , set himself and released a picturesque shot with 441 seconds left as shaw went crashing into the first row all net almost even photos the pacers' jalen rose reaching back to stuff a shot by the lakers' ron harper last night \( jed jacobsohn allsport \) reggie miller led the charge for the pacers , who won to force a game 6 on monday night in los angeles \( ezra shaw allsport \) \( pg d1 \) the pacers' reggie miller driving past the lakers' kobe bryant last night in game 5 at conseco fieldhouse \( ezra shaw allsport \) \( pg d6 \)
she was a recording star , a nightclub star , a television star and then , at 23 , a broadway star but the show business ascent of leslie uggams started at the age of 6 , on a television series called beulah one year later she was a warmup act for ella fitzgerald , louis armstrong and dinah washington at the apollo theater in harlem an excerpt from the liner notes of the original cast recording of hallelujah , baby ! , ms uggams s tony awardwinning broadway debut in 1968 , puts the life of a child of stage and television into perspective in no uncertain terms , the notes read what she did for her first six years is her own business ms uggams s dramatic flair was no secret in that oddly structured broadway musical , a sixdecade sociomusical journey of a black entertainer \( in which none of the characters aged \) ms uggams played a maid who bursts out of the kitchen of rich white people into a career that , in retrospect , parallels her own pop music triumphs but her broadway pizazz star quality and a heavensent voice that kept soaring back up to celestial heights were major distractions broadway , las vegas and atlantic city did n't care that ms uggams , even with tony in tow , went after intensive dramatic training or that nine years after she conquered broadway , she showed the real goods in roots , the highest rated miniseries of the time her portrayal of kizzie , a life force and a survivor of abuse , in harrowing forms , is a television milestone but her effervescing image of a pop headliner kept her name in boldface and in neon , while diminishing her completeness as a performer that ms uggams has careened from career to career , to borrow a stephen sondheim lyric , and that she s still here , is as much a statement of show business inanity and theatrical shortsightedness as it is of her own resilience while biding her time , and often wasting it , she has been a box office draw , mostly in concerts and in mishmashes like jerry s girls and blues in the night , on broadway and on interminable tours now for the real payoff it remains for theater works in hartford to reveal the urgency , fire and nuance that can only emanate from the flowering of a talent against practical odds and it is revelatory indeed in john henry redwood s warm and appealing fourcharacter play , the old settler , ms uggams is not so much repeating as deepening her performance in the play s limitedrun off broadway almost two years ago that followed her dramatic success in a considerably lesser play , black girl , off off broadway in 1995 without giving up her countrywide musical gigs , ms uggams goes where the real work is mr redwood s very well made play recalls a golden age when the american theater was a welcoming place for the drama of ordinary people , not astoundingly dysfunctional , just troubled , resilient , comic and \( his thematic essence \) forgiving once there was an uncelebrated time in harlem , between the glamorized renaissance and ghettoization that was world war ii , which mr redwood s play evokes panoramically no facile black vs white diatribe , the old settler looks , without being judgmental , at binding , intrinsic humanity two sisters in their 50 s \( ms uggams and lynda gravatt \) live together , past animosities surfacing , then receding , until a confrontation occurs a roomer brings it on he s a country boy , looking for his true love \( or so he thinks \) who has fled to the big city he means to find her , marry her , and take her back to frogmore , sc he is an innocent who wants to see the sky in the city there are no trees , no lightning bugs , he says but there is elizabeth \( ms uggams \) who is significantly older but not old , he tells her and here comes an unbelievable mismatch made in a middleaged woman s fantasies and a playwright s daring imagination and open heart in a lovely ensemble , ms uggams glows with the discovery of a second act in life , never having had a first her penultimate scene , in silence and in repose , is heart stopping even though she looks too terrific , she manages to appear transformed and rejuvenated and her nononsense declarations \( do n't play with me , she warns her young , young beau \) are emblazoned by a classical singer s earthshaking vibrato in a raucous , then unutterably moving performance , ms gravatt travels from a handsonhips

chicago in a lifetime as a judge , lawyer and lawmaker , i can safely say i 've encountered few judges guilty of outright dishonesty even when i started practicing law in chicago in the bad old days , the number of crooked judges was small but that is not what people believed then or believe now that is why so much is built into our judicial system from the black robe and all rise custom to lifetime tenure for federal judges to help foster the notion of judicial integrity it all becomes meaningless , however , when private interests are allowed to wine and dine judges at fancy resorts under the pretext of educating them between 1992 and 1998 , according to a report from the community rights counsel , a nonprofit publicinterest law firm , more than 230 federal judges took one or more trips each to resort locations for legal seminars paid for by corporations and foundations that have an interest in federal litigation on environmental topics in the seminars devoted to socalled environmental education , judges listened to speakers whose overwhelming message was that regulation should be limited that the free market should be relied upon to protect the environment , for example , or that the takings clause of the constitution should be interpreted to prohibit rules against development in environmentally sensitive places judges who attended the seminars wrote 10 of the most important rulings of the 1990 s curbing federal environmental protections , including one that struck down habitat protection provisions of the endangered species act and another that invalidated regulations on soot and smog in six of these cases , according to the report , the judge attended one of the seminars while the case was pending before the court and , the report reveals , many judges failed to disclose required information about these seminars on their financial disclosure forms if an actual party to a case took the judge to a resort , all expenses paid , shortly before the case was heard , the judge and the host would be perceived to be acting improperly even if all they discussed was their grandchildren the conduct is no less reprehensible when an interest group substitutes for the party to the case of course it may be a coincidence that none of the seminars financed by private interests take place in chicago in january or in atlanta in july it may be a coincidence that the judges who attend usually come down on the same side of important policy questions as those who financed the meetings it may even be a coincidence that environmentalists are seldom invited to speak but surely any citizen who reads about judges attending fancy meetings under questionable sponsorship will have wellfounded doubts about their objectivity i know one federal judge who has been on a dozen trips sponsored by the three most prominent special interest seminar groups i remember at least two occasions where judges on judicial panels where i also served took positions that they had heard advocated at seminars sponsored by groups with particular interest in the litigation the federal judiciary has a federal judicial center that provides educational seminars for judges on a wide range of legal topics since it uses taxpayer funds and answers to congress , the program locales are not exotic , but the presentations are balanced unfortunately , the united states judicial conference , the governing body for all federal judges , has punted on the propriety of privately funded seminars , advising that judges assess their appropriateness case by case short of requiring judges to stick to federally sponsored seminars , the government could , at least , require that whenever a judge attends any professional seminar , the government must pay his or her way then citizens might begin to ask questions about what they were paying for and whether it was really likely to promote judicial fairness
twenty barrels of potassium cyanide that were stolen earlier this month from a new jersey warehouse were found yesterday afternoon in the underbrush along a residential street in the bronx the discovery of the highly poisonous chemicals prompted the authorities to evacuate about 70 homes as a precaution before removing the steel barrels , which were the size of beer kegs , emergency crews from the police and fire departments , clad headtotoe in baggy protective biohazard suits , and a city chemist examined them and tested the air around them to make sure that none had broken open then they were loaded into a truck from the radiac research corporation , which operates a chemical warehouse in williamsburg , brooklyn the orangeandwhite barrels were found about 12 20 pm along pugsley avenue in the clason point section of the bronx after an anonymous caller , possibly alerted by news reports about the stolen chemicals , telephoned the police emergency number , the authorities said the barrels had been dumped in an area of heavy underbrush next to a baseball field , across the street from a row of attached duplex houses the barrels , along with some perfume and flavoring additives , were inside a tractortrailer that was stolen from the magic transport inc warehouse in linden , nj , on may 3 , the authorities said the potassium cyanide , which has a common industrial use in electroplating , was to be sent by ship to puerto rico , the authorities said the empty trailer , without its cab , was found friday night in an industrial area in the long island city section of queens while the world health organization has said potassium cyanide can be used as a chemical weapon by terrorists , the police and the fbi said they believe that the crime was nothing more than a simple truck theft richard j sheirer , director of the mayor s office of emergency management , said officials presumed , based on the way the barrels were dumped , that the thieves had no idea what they were taking mr sheirer said the residents of about 70 homes were evacuated shortly after the chemicals were found all were back in their homes by about 4 30 pm , he said my job is to err on the side of safety , so i had the team that was police and fire and a chemist from the department of environmental protection we had them suit up to make sure that they and the public were protected , mr sheirer said but the flurry of activity along normally quiet pugsley avenue , a broad thoroughfare that was choked with emergency vehicles , frightened some residents it s a little scary , said latoya brown , 20 , who lives at 540 pugsley avenue , directly across the street from the site where the chemicals were found you do n't know what else is being dumped out here photos emergency workers , above , were sprayed off yesterday after they inspected barrels of deadly potassium cyanide dumped in the bronx after the barrels were righted and found to be unopened and safe , a truck was backed up to load them , left it took the chemicals away \( photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \) map of the bronx showing location of missing cyanide barrels barrels of cyanide were found next to a baseball field
president clinton acted as a standin yesterday as he stumped across the bronx , harlem and brooklyn urging new york democrats to turn out en masse for his vice president and his wife but at times , this retiring politician whose name will appear on no ballot on election day sure seemed like the main attraction before he made his wellpracticed pitch , mr clinton had to quiet the crowd , which surged forward for a glimpse of him at rally after rally and roared whenever he tried to open his mouth you 're the man , bill ! one giddy onlooker shouted , teetering atop a chair for a peek at the president at the marina del ray , a restaurant in the bronx packed with 1 , 000 democrats thank you , bill ! thank you , bill ! came another thunderous chant later , in harlem , mr clinton was the featured speaker at a getoutthevote rally in african square plaza that drew more than 5 , 000 excited onlookers we want bill ! we want bill ! the crowd was shouting when his motorcade pulled up and continued shouting long after he took the stage mr clinton may well be a detested figure in some parts of the country and he may well turn off swing voters and energize the republican base , as the gore campaign has calculated but none of that was on display yesterday as mr clinton stuck to solidly democratic turf i'm preaching to the saved , he noted at one point while trying to boost the fortunes of al gore s presidential campaign and hillary rodham clinton s senate bid why are new yorkers so fanatically loyal to president clinton \? fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president and likely mayoral candidate , asked in introducing the president the answer is simple for the first time in my lifetime , there has been someone in the white house who has felt comfortable with people like us others seemed to agree the focus was supposed to be on mr gore and mrs clinton , both of whom are locked in tight races , but the democrats who turned out yesterday could not help repeatedly invoking the name of mr clinton you ca n't help but love the guy , said tecala t hall , a social worker and democratic activist he gets down with the people gore is n't quite there yet , but i want him in the white house he 'll get there fred judd , a union advocate from brooklyn and a fervent backer of mrs clinton , said her connection to the president is one of her pluses hillary s going to be good for new york because of all the insider connections she has from the president , mr judd said she 'll have a pipeline between washington and new york she 'll get things done mrs clinton did not campaign with the president yesterday , but she too was clearly concentrating on her getoutofthe vote effort in the suburbs and the boroughs joined by representative nita lowey , mrs clinton addressed an abortion rights rally at manhattanville college in purchase , knocked on doors of homes in new rochelle and , earlier in the day , strolled through a retail district in scarsdale with president clinton working to get traditional democratic voters excited about tuesday s election , mrs clinton set her sights on women who might otherwise not support her she talked mostly about abortion rights and the importance of future appointees to the supreme court , but she also stressed her opposition to school vouchers and her support for gun safety measures mrs clinton got a rousing response from the largely partisan audience at manhattanville , but she also seemed to make some headway among the handful of republicans and independents she met throughout the day , including in scarsdale christine conklin , 35 , a republican from eastchester , said she would vote for mrs clinton , in large part because she likes the idea of a woman representing new york leslie hansensturm , 56 , a real estate agent and independent , said she had recently decided to vote for mrs clinton as well she s got backbone , whether you like it or not , said ms hansensturm , who was among several dozen people who greeted mrs clinton outside the coffee tree shop near the train station in scarsdale i think she will really do something for us in rochdale village in queens last night , about 400 residents turned out at a democratic rally as mrs clinton beseeched members of the predominantly black audience to vote my race is tight , mrs clinton told them it is volatile i never know what they are going to do next the president , too , remarked on his own about the surprises mrs clinton has experienced along her 16month campaign journey , which he said he knew from the start would be a slugfest she has been subject to a campaign that has been amazing to me , and i 've been through a lot , mr clinton remarked but hey , you know , that s part of the deal she s met every test she s worked her heart out for 16 months mr clinton clearly relishes all the embraces in these waning days of his presidency , but he also clearly agrees with another line from mr ferrer , who cheered bronx democrats by saying , the legacy of the clintongore administration hangs in the balance over the next four days mr clinton said yesterday that he had never seen a presidential election as close as this one as he does to audiences everywhere , mr clinton touted the current economic prosperity and argued that republican policies would squander the surplus and endanger all that his administration has struggled to build if you want to keep the prosperity going , you 've got one choice , he said in the bronx , surprising no one with his answer al gore joe lieberman and hillary photo president clinton joined in the applause as representative charles b rangel prepared to introduce him at a campaign rally yesterday in african square plaza in harlem \( chang w lee the new york times \)
three thousand miles from where john franco was staring at potential ruin to a baseball season , from a distance so much safer to make the call , joe gambuzza talked to the television as if it had ears and the ability to pull the string on barry bonds throw the changeup , not the fastball , gambuzza pleaded throw the changeup throw your pitch he also made this suggestion to his wife , with the understanding that she was in no position to shake off mike piazza , with the count 32 , the tying run on first and the san francisco giants down to their last out oh , gambuzza was reminded about his union of 13 years with dorothy gambuzza it happened to be the direct result of a blind date arranged by none other than johnny franco , his erstwhile prize pupil more than two decades earlier at lafayette high in brooklyn franco s wife , rose , was pregnant with their daughter , nicole , gambuzza recalled the four of them went out for italian food , and he and franco made a side deal if gambuzza tugged on his ear , that meant he was less than infatuated , and they all might want to skip the cannoli that s a whole other story , gambuzza said yesterday from the dean s office at lafayette the school sits on the edge of the bensonhurst section of brooklyn , separated by the elevated train tracks from the marlboro houses , where franco , son of a new york city garbage man , grew up back to a more conventional sign , the fastball piazza was calling for , as bonds batted in the home 10th inning thursday night , the giants trailing , 54 , after shocking the mets in the ninth with j t snow s threerun , gametying homer off armando benitez bobby valentine had moved to avoid the mistake that dusty baker had already made , sticking too long with a power relief pitcher following the egoshattering experience of surrendering the gamealtering long ball suddenly , for the climax of a night on which the mets' postseason desperately hung , here came franco , defrocked closer , to save them it was pure baseball theater , filled with tension , laced with irony and embellished by the kind of endgame confrontation franco had relished for so many years before benitez took his job not a year ago , when it was obvious to almost everyone that benitez was a force that could not be held back , franco had contemplated going elsewhere to continue a run on the career saves record of 478 held by lee smith franco at the time had 416 , but was not about to catch up , not here , if he pitched until he was 50 his mantra was i did n't lose my job because of performance i lost it because of injury but his old coach had to tell him the truth , trying to convince him that benitez was the new sheriff at shea i said , 'john , even if i was the coach , i 'd do the same thing , ' gambuzza said i said 'benitez is younger he throws harder you 're better off going to some other team , out west , where they do n't know you' that was the whole point of staying , though here , people knew him , all over his native brooklyn and his adopted home in staten island here , he could be with his kids and see his brother , jimmy , and pitch for a team , his hometown team , that sniffed the world series last fall franco told gambuzza one night that he had decided to stay and , not only that , he was n't conceding anything to benitez , either he said , 'i'm going to get a shot' blah , blah , blah , ' gambuzza said as it turned out , benitez was given the closer s job and made himself at home in it franco finished this season with four saves in five opportunities he never publicly complained about being a setup man , but people like gambuzza knew what he was thinking because , otherwise , he would n't be franco the same way he was when i first got him at lafayette , when he was 13 , 14 years old , gambuzza said and you know what \?

los angeles , june 19 even in a city that is used to being looked down on , there has been something particularly galling about the way the french have long regarded hollywood that makes it all the more provocative that the latest foreign company to buy a major movie studio has been vivendi sa , a french media giant the french always have been the most irate about american domination of the movies , so to think that now it will be the french who are financing these american movies , well , you 'd have to say that s ironic , said peter bart , editor of variety the reality is , though , that it has been a long time since the days when hollywood was run by a small clique of american moguls the movie studios were all acquired by larger conglomerates and , in the last decade , the business of making films has become an increasingly global one sony owns columbia for a time , credit lyonnais controlled metrogoldwynmayer inc so the news that universal studios , one of the earliest movie pioneers , which began making silent shorts before world war i , was being purchased by a french company has been greeted here with something less than shock i do n't find it ironic at all that a french company has bought universal , said tom pollock , who was a top executive at universal under three owners canal plus has built an incredible empire in europe on the strength of american movies and television the pay television company , canal plus , is 49 percent owned by vivendi mr pollock and others said that the french business officials they had encountered displayed none of the antihollywood sentiments espoused by some french critics , filmmakers and government officials maybe leftist intellectuals in paris are decrying american films , but the french people are eating them up , said one independent producer they ca n't make our movies , so they 'll buy them most here expect that pierre lescure , the chairman of canal plus , will not move his offices to universal city but remain in paris universal studios will become one of the corporate divisions under his control instead , as in the case of almost all of the other purchases of hollywood studios by foreign companies , it is anticipated that some established hollywood insider will be chosen to run the studio under mr lescure among the names mentioned was terry semel , a former top warner brothers executive officials at universal said today that it was not yet a foregone conclusion that the current president , ron meyer , would be leaving in the late 1970 s and 1980 s , when universal pictures was owned by mca , a former talent agency , and run by lew wasserman , it was among the most lucrative and powerful studios in hollywood much of its strength was based on the talent of steven spielberg , a young filmmaker the studio had discovered and nurtured in 1991 , mca was purchased by a japanese conglomerate , the matsushita electric industrial company the japanese company , in turn , sold universal in 1995 to seagram , whose chairman , edgar bronfman jr , has displayed much more interest in expanding the company s music empire than in the movie business i ran universal when it was an americanowned public company , i ran it for five years when it was owned by the japanese and i ran it for under a year under edgar bronfman , mr pollock said during the japanese era , they never made one decision as to what movie got made or did n't get made they let management in place run the company i have no idea whether the french will be the same way or not the betting money is that they will one of the most unfortunate aspects of canal plus buying universal may be that the french company , which has been particularly active in financing american independent films to help feed its television channels , may shift its attention away from small , quality films toward the big , starstudded blockbusters that make up a traditional studio slate when sony bought columbia pictures , there was all kinds of talk in the american media about , oh , we 're selling our culture to foreigners , said mr bart , the editor of variety the interesting thing is that , this time , there s none of that that s because times have changed most people are n't aware of it , but there s been so much in the way of european money flowing into hollywood in recent years to help finance american movies and it s beginning to affect the kinds of movies that are being made and the way they 're cast they 're putting people into movies who are known in europe

argun , russia , jan 13 russian troops scattered to look for rebel snipers as nikolai p koshman climbed out of his helicopter to inspect this battered chechen city it was not long before he was bombarded with complaints an agitated man said russian artillery strikes had destroyed his home an elderly woman whimpered that it was very hard for families to endure the war , and children had nothing to eat mr koshman promised to look into their problems , and offered a few encouraging words we have to finish our work , and then everything will be normal we have to establish order together it was just another day for mr koshman , a russian deputy prime minister and the man the kremlin has charged with reestablishing normal life in the russiancontrolled regions of the breakaway southern republic of chechnya it is more than a humanitarian mission mr koshman s task is not just to restore gas and electricity , reopen the schools and hospitals and generate jobs in a region that has been tormented by war and disorder for the better part of a decade it is also to secure the loyalty of a wary population , depriving the separatist militants of the popular support they need to wage a long guerrilla war the job would be hard enough in peacetime , and rebel raids behind russian lines have severely complicated that task born in ukraine , the 55yearold mr koshman has often had tough assignments he served in the railroad troops , the part of the soviet military assigned to guard and build rail lines he was involved in the cleanup of the chernobyl nuclear disaster , and came to chechnya in 1994 to help restore tracks damaged in the earlier war with separatists in this republic , which ended with a humiliating russian defeat and the de facto independence of chechnya wearing his trademark cap and leather jacket , mr koshman hopscotches his way around chechnya by helicopter and military jeep burly soldiers , equipped with machine guns , grenade launchers and sniper rifles , hand grenades , pistols and flares , jump out with their weapons every time mr koshman s motorcade stops and gird for a possible ambush mr koshman , however , does not appear to be worried about security he mingles with townspeople , jotting down their pleas and complaints in a notebook there are many appeals during a visit to tolstoyyurt , a poor settlement north of grozny , chechen students asked for his help in transferring to russian universities because none are functioning in chechnya in gudermes , a doctor told him russian soldiers had stolen a hospital s trailer and asked him to help get it back those are the easy issues , and mr koshman s job has become more difficult as russian troops have occupied more and more of chechnya at first , mr koshman focused on northern chechnya , which is generally sympathetic to the russian presence it has become something of a showcase for russia s efforts to restore basic services to secure the loyalty of a largely obedient population , the russian government has started paying wages , pensions and subsidies for families with children payments that residents say were not made under the administration of the chechen leader , aslan maskhadov now that russian troops have moved into the chechen lowlands , however , mr koshman is contending with people who are less friendly to russian troops and an area where rebel raids remain a worry his problems will multiply exponentially if russian troops take grozny , the capital in a december interview , mr koshman suggested that russian forces might be better off if they simply surrounded grozny , gradually helped the civilian population leave and let the rebels sit in the ruined city the kremlin is intent , however , on taking grozny , and mr koshman is loyally drawing up plans to restore the city he estimated that it would cost 10 to 12 billion rubles 350 million to 420 million to rebuild the chechen lowlands south of grozny , a sizable sum for a cashstrapped russia for grozny alone , multiply that by three or four , he said certainly , chechnya s problems are legion most oil wells have stopped working and 12 wells have caught fire , burning 2 , 500 tons of oil a day six thousand people used to work in chechnya s oil industry , but that work force has shrunk to 500 restoring petroleum production is vital for mr koshman s plan to generate jobs and bring in badly needed revenue for chechnya s development agriculture is in a state of crisis most of chechnya s cattle , sheep and poultry have perished of 900 , 000 acres of farmland , only 67 , 000 have been ploughed and 21 , 000 sown with winter wheat with tuberculosis and other diseases stalking chechnya , medical care is a major worry there were about 11 , 000 hospital beds in chechnya in the early 1990 s today , there are only 2 , 200 russian officials are proud of the progress they have made in restoring electricity , but there is plenty more to do about 500 miles of electrical cable has been fixed , but much more needs repair mr koshman said chechnya s residents would be able to vote in the russian presidential elections in march elections to pick a new chechen leadership , however , will not be held until the end of this year or the beginning of 2001 still , mr koshman insists that he is confident that he can carry out his task he is even planning to move his headquarters in a few days from the russian military base at mozdok , northwest of chechnya , to gudermes , chechnya s secondlargest city the move , mr koshman says , will place him and his staff closer to the chechen settlements they are trying to help it also appears to be a symbolic effort to demonstrate that russia is establishing control over chechnya despite recent rebel attacks in the beginning of february , we will be in grozny , maybe even earlier , he said in an interview on saturday night , pointing , on a map , to the airport on the northern outskirts of the city in argun , a city six miles east of grozny , it was clear that he had plenty of work ahead of him hundreds of rebels fought their way into the city last week and killed the russian military commandant there before retreating aza khadzimuradova , 33 , said argun s residents have no gas , no electricity , no working schools , no pensions and a hospital that has only recently started to operate with his customary optimism , mr koshman was undaunted achkhoymartan , shali , argun and other settlements in the lowlands are like the north was at the end of october , mr koshman said come back in february the schools and hospitals will be working and you will see serious changes photo nikolai koshman , a russian deputy prime minister , visited a damaged oil refinery near tolstoyyurt as he toured areas of chechnya \( james hill

mount vernon for the last 20 years , the region s jazz fans have faithfully circled the dates on their calendars the second sunday of each month from september through april the ca n'tmissit attraction \? concerts presented by the presbyterian jazz society in the parish hall of the landmark first presbyterian church on lincoln avenue in mount vernon our jazz concerts are like big family reunions , said dotti johnson , secretary and board member of the presbyterian jazz society members of the audience sit informally at tables , spreading out the food they brought for dinner , sharing a bottle of wine with those at the next table , mingling with the musicians before and after each set along with the downhome atmosphere , the concerts offer a chance to hear topnotch musicians at a reasonable cost tickets , sold in advance , are 15 while the society may not have the money to book major stars , it still manages to assemble a formidable lineup , mixing luminaries like milt hinton , dr billy taylor and clark terry with younger talents like the saxophonist eric alexander and the pianist benny green in a tribute to the quality of the venue and the knowledgeable fervor of the audience , many artists have reduced their fees to fit into the society s annual budget , said judy wernick , a board member who helps book the acts the society traditionally begins its concert season with a performance by the saxophonist houston person of croton falls and the vocalist etta jones of the audience , mr person said , they like jazz the way it should be played bluesy and swinging the society was founded two decades ago by the rev clinton glenn , pastor of the first presbyterian church in mount vernon from 1975 to 1990 and now a resident of manhattan , where he is still active in the clergy and owns a managerial development firm saying that he started the concert series purely and simply out of my love for jazz , mr glenn said his effort was modeled after the jazz vespers program that the rev john garcia gensel established at st peter s lutheran church in manhattan , at the citicorp building mr glenn said that leaving the society s helm in 1990 to focus on new career interests was tough in many respects , but he said it was made easier by the dedication of the society s eight board members and others devoted to the group they 've taken up the cause and have made it a lasting resource in the community , he said there is no formal connection between the first presbyterian church in mount vernon and the jazz society it houses , other than a landlordtenant agreement and a nominal rental charge frankly , i thought the imprimatur of the church would be a good marketing tool , which is how we chose the name , mr glenn said none of the jazz society s members , in fact , is a member of the church s congregation centrally situated in mount vernon , the church is quite a busy place its large , threestory residential wing serves as a homeless shelter and also houses the mount vernon music academy , where more than 300 students go for instruction i look at the church as a giant tree with all these different ministries nesting in its branches , said the rev rose niles mccrary , pastor of the first presbyterian church since 1996 from the start , the jazz society s concerts have been successful , with audiences usually numbering about 150 herbert mooney , the society s treasurer for the last five years , said that on the two occasions that he could recall when the society did n't break even on a show the reason was bad weather to a degree , the presbyterian jazz society has helped satisfy an existing cultural need southern westchester had a reputable jazz scene through the 1950 s , with several venues featuring live jazz by 1980 , though , the only place a jazzbo could find nourishment was at defemio s , a restaurantcumjazz club in yonkers that has a weekly jam session on wednesday nights but defemio s closed two years ago two special events help keep the society solvent there is the postholiday blues party , a special fundraising dinner dance with a live band in january , on the saturday night before the super bowl in may the society ends its season with its annual tribute to a legend concert , in which a renowned artist performs and is honored by the society last may , the society celebrated the career of jimmy heath , the saxophonist and composerarranger , and the parish hall s 250seat capacity quickly became standing room only at each show a hat is passed for contributions to the jazz foundation , a nonprofit organization , which aids indigent musicians and retired jazz artists who do not have health insurance a lot of churches are n't comfortable with the idea of hosting what could be called a jazz club , but i think it s wonderful , said ms mccrary i perceive such joy and fellowship at the jazz society concerts a real sense of community photo houston person and etta jones , in concert last month for the presbyterian jazz society , traditionally begin the society s seasons in mount vernon \( fran collin for the new york times \)
in 1971 , philip leider , the founding editor of artforum , walked away at the magazine s peak of influence during his almost 30year disengagement from an art world that grew up during the same period , mr leider never spoke publicly about his artforum years , nor did he agree to be interviewed about them his involvement with challenging art artforum 19621974 , a book coming out this month from soho press , parallels a resumption of his writing in american art periodicals in 1994 , he began a dialogue with the book s author , amy newman , a former editor of artnews following are excerpts from a recent conversation about the professional decisions he has made and about his views of contemporary art newman where are you these days \? leider as in where are you physically or as in where are you at \? newman well , let s start with physically leider i live in jerusalem i just finished my last of 10 years of teaching here at the bezalel academy of fine arts newman and where are you at \? leider two places , actually , both pretty interesting the first place is the chestnut tree cafe , with the rest of the ghosts , drinking victory gin and trying to make out what s passing the darkening window the second is something like where john lennon was when he wrote that song about i do n't beleeve in beatles , i do n't beleeve in zimmerman , etc , etc sometimes the two places are different , sometimes they seem the same newman explain leider well , in the chestnut tree cafe we spend most of our time pondering what it s like to have fallen behind you get in free when you 've arrived at the certain conclusion that you have fallen behind then the waiters keep filling your glass without your asking the tv is on but without sound , and you usually sit with your back to it there s no fax , no email the waiters pat you on the back and say , you guys do n't need that stuff falling behind turns out to be a stage in one s career as real as the stages of paying your dues , getting in , being on top of things , the nice period of instant comprehension when you do n't need anyone to tell you what s going on , then a kind of unconscious withdrawal , then a kind of conscious withdrawing , with snarling and anger and the certainty that everything has turned to nonsense and then , if you 're still alive , there s falling behind in the realm i work in , when the smoke cleared , it turned out you 'd fallen behind if you had n't gotten masaccio you 'd fallen behind if you had n't gotten manet and cezanne you 'd fallen behind if you had n't gotten picasso and braque , pollock and newman , stella and smithson you were wrong , they were right now i do n't get anyone from julian schnabel to matthew barney and realize that it s much more likely that i 've fallen behind than that what i thought was real art simply ended , like at a certain point mosaics or stained glass simply ended i mean by that the possibility that it is n't set in stone that what i consider art is something that people will always make it s possible that sometime or other someone will hold up a paintbrush and say , what s this \? but when i look around the chestnut tree cafe and see all those ghosts around me who all saw the end of art , from clement greenberg back to john ruskin , i figure the probabilities , and the probabilities favor jeff koons and kiki smith and all the other artists i do n't get newman why do n't you just take the position that it s a bad time for art , a bad period \? leider that s what you say before you take the pledge and confess you 've fallen behind first you say it s bad , then you say you 're out of sympathy , and then you say you 're out of it , period newman can you identify what happened to get you here \? leider i think the most important thing that happened was the death of smithson in 1973 it s possible he was the one carrying the ball at that moment , the way pollock was around 1946 , or goya was in 1800 if pollock had died in 1946 or goya in 1800 well , you 'd just see a void and around the same time , all the good people just walked away the better critics , the better artists the void got filled with warholism newman what s warholism \? leider shorthand for everything i 've fallen behind of about the only thing i get , in all this art i do n't get , is the sense that it all goes back to warhol newman did n't you admire warhol at one time \? leider sure i did , early on i may have taken him more seriously than anyone else i'm sure i was the first to put him on the cover of an art magazine , and i think i wrote one of the earliest appreciations of his influence but it turned out that warhol did n't care about art he really was into what he called glamour and the decline in his art registered that pretty quickly but the worse his actual work got , the more people he seemed to attract it was weird for example , i have the notion that all these utterance artists came out of warhol at some point people seemed to have the idea that his frequently quoted utterances were art , and started making utterances themselves barbara kruger , jenny holzer they never seem to achieve that banal brilliance that made warhol so amusing anyway , that s what i mean by warholism is that crazy \? newman it could be seen that way

i am appalled that none of the governmental authorities mentioned in the cover article on the mosquito season \( april 9 \) took into consideration that many of us in connecticut get our drinking water from individual wells floating solid cakes of pesticide chemicals \( or spraying these areas \) will contaminate the ground water and , therefore , our drinking water for example , the standing water in an improperly graded storm drain is less than 100 feet from my well , and upstream from the wells of my neighbors i understand very well the nasty risks from viruses such as the west nile , but a cardinal rule of medicine is first , do no harm i do n't want cancer down the line why is n't someone thinking about the contamination of the water supply \? priscilla howland loewenstine newtown
london supporters of a manned mission to mars have been out in force since nasa s announcement last week that there are recent , perhaps even current , sources of liquid water on the planet they argue that water will enable human colonies to thrive but it would be foolhardy to bend the findings to justify a manned mission the quest for life has become the focus of nasa s mars program , and without question , the discovery of persuasive evidence for it \( there is none yet \) would have profound implications for our perception of our place in the universe if life is not even unique to earth within our solar system , it may be common in the cosmos at large finding life \( or the fossilized signs of it \) means following the water , for without liquid water , life cannot exist by this reasoning , we should perhaps be looking instead to jupiter s moon europa , which seems to have a global ocean of salty water beneath its icy crust but mars is nearer and in many respects more earthlike besides , it has sentimental attractions , dating from the astronomer percival lowell s claims in the 1890 s to have seen canals built by a dying civilization to the later fantasies of h g wells and edgar rice burroughs the evidence that water once flowed on mars is all but incontrovertible the planet is covered with sinuous channels that cannot easily be interpreted as anything other than driedup river valleys these features are at least a billion years old , but the new findings reveal that at least some of this water went underground the gullies now seen by the orbiting mars global surveyor appear to be young in geological terms , which means they might be anywhere from a million years to a week old the discovery , another triumph for the global surveyor , demonstrates just how effective unmanned missions can be and at 165 million it is something of a bargain but nasa knows too well that cheap missions can be false economies in september last year the mars climate orbiter was lost , followed in december by the mars polar lander , the victim of human calculation errors these experiences have forced nasa to rethink its strategy it was trying to do too much with too little to answer a barrage of scientific questions with budget spacecraft that , in the end , cut too many corners yet the impulse to use unmanned craft was the right one simple , focused missions can pay rich dividends , as the 1997 pathfinder mission demonstrated by successfully landing on mars and returning new images of the planet s environment there is much more science to be reaped from unmanned orbiter and lander missions than from the hubristic endeavor , at many times the cost , to put people on martian soil nasa would do well to resist the temptation to act upon the invitation inherent in the words of dr michael malin , who heads the global surveyor imaging team one of the most interesting and significant aspects of this discovery is what it could mean if human explorers ever go to mars , he said , explaining how useful water would be for drinking or splitting into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel while cathedral science huge projects that are more inspirational than useful has its place , we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the supposed glamour of manned space flight the unmanned mars missions are themselves cathedrals of which nasa can be proud , and they needed no passengers to make that so

the characters of the young directorplaywright richard maxwell are not what you would call an excitable lot their voices are as uninflected as a refrigerator s drone , their postures those of exceptionally passive people who have been parked somewhere and told to wait in mr maxwell s breakthrough work of two years ago , house , a couple of them were murdered , and it was hard to distinguish the dead from the living now mr maxwell who has previously considered such american phenomena as cowboys and indians and mall rats has moved into the world of amateur prizefighting in a play called boxing 2000 it is probably safe to say that no sporting event , even in the current olympics , has generated less adrenaline than the match shown here well , among the fighters , anyway audience members for boxing 2000 , which runs at the present company theatorium through sept 30 , are likely to feel a wideawake energy in the presence of these somnambulists they may also experience the quickened , hopeful heartbeat that comes from watching that rare phenomenon , a genuinely original new talent at work it s a sensation that s felt all too rarely these days watching mr maxwell s work makes you think of what it must have been like to stumble upon the baffling but seductive creations of the young sam shepard in the early 1960 s in the east village a richard maxwell play is unlikely ever to show up on broadway or even on the institutional stages of the public theater or the manhattan theater club this author s style is antipolish , even to the point of deliberately seeming amateurish read cold , the texts of his scripts are unlikely to have much resonance it s the whole miseenscene , under the control of one artistic imagination , that makes boxing 2000 so effective to take it out of its calculatedly crude , experimental realm and spruce it up would be fatal in the meantime , in its own context , this dramatist s voice seemingly as flat and thin as pasteboard is sending off depth charges that keep vibrating like many artists of his generation , mr maxwell is a connoisseur of cliches none of the nine characters in boxing 2000 have anything remotely fresh to say their conversations , if you overheard them on the street or in a supermarket , would inspire glum thoughts that people as a whole are not an interesting species these are folks that seem bored even with themselves yet mr maxwell , who achieves his distinctive tone as much through his direction as his writing , is listening hard to his characters and demands that we do , too by slowing down rhythms of speech and inflating pauses , he parses the banalities of everday talk and finds the whispering fear and confusion beneath it makes you grateful that there is nothing like a slowmotion instantreplay device monitoring your own life boxing 2000 begins with three men planted motionless in a naked space in front of a corrugated metal wall there is jojo \( gary wilmes , a maxwell veteran \) , who wears an industrial uniform and many keys on his belt his younger brother , freddie \( robert torres \) , who has the deadest stare this side of a morgue , and a fellow identified as promoter \( christopher sullivan \) , who is silent for so long that he might be mistaken for a george segal statue the dialogue emerges slowly and in spurts , like a car being started with an undercharged battery it is repetitive and circular there is talk of what jojo should buy his father for a birthday present of some arcane mishap at work involving the confusion of room numbers suddenly jojo announces , with no change of tone , that he is looking for that one moment of goodwill in his life the declaration is thrown away it registers as just another instance of someone s repeating something he has heard and vaguely feeling it might be appropriate to the occasion yet mr maxwell is n't sneering at his creations any more than flaubert was sneering at that most famous receptacle of received ideas , emma bovary platitudinous these people may be , but there is a genuine yearning that emerges , despite itself , from their numbness this becomes even clearer as the play s focus shifts to freddie , who has agreed to participate in the boxing match organized by promoter and who has a girlfriend , marissa \( gladys perez \) , who talks in the language of spiritual selfhelp books freddie is mr maxwell s 21stcentury answer to clifford odets s golden boy , a smallertime , even more manipulable boxer who does n't even know what to do when he finally gets into the ring or whether he has won or lost at the end mr torres s freddie manages to come across as both stolid and highly impressionable it may not look like it , but he s paying attention when the promoter talks about investing in ira s instead of lotto or when marissa tells him to find his inner voice i'm thinking a lot of what was just said now by him , freddie in a typical declaration unlike his older brother , whom mr wilmes portrays with as much heartiness as a monotone allows , freddie still has a shred of an attention span left in mr maxwell s world , this is not necessarily a blessing more than most of mr maxwell s plays , this one conspicuously features physical movement there is a dance sequence in which freddie and marissa slowly move in circles , wanly shifting their weight the spirit of stunted passion here seems of a piece with freddie s idea of foreplay , which is to brush at marissa s breasts and then quickly withdraw his hand then there is the boxing match itself , for which an authentic ring has been provided \( stephanie nelson is the set and costume designer \) mr maxwell , needless to say , milks every ounce of anticlimax from this climactic event , as freddie listlessly takes on the older , marginally more animated jerry \( jim fletcher \) nobody in the ring or out of it seems to know how things should proceed , including the referee \( lakpa bhutia \) the usual ringside patter that is the staple of boxing films is here delivered with the conviction of old porn stars simulating sex i like it when you hurt each other , urges the promoter blandly freddie s father \( benjamin tejeda \) materializes to express , in spanish , his disappointment with his son s performance marissa appears briefly to beg freddie to withdraw this is the sort of material that has been parodied for years in spoofs like the 1978 film movie movie mr maxwell , however , is n't sending up an established genre his characters are in a realm where even the energy of satire is beyond them the delivery of the actors , many of whom are nonprofessionals , flattens speech to the point that distinctions between irony and sincerity , between questions and exclamations are erased mr maxwell s burnedout , overprogrammed americans are one step shy of becoming automatons the playwright s great accomplishment is to make us care about them nonetheless it s that last flickering spark of humanity that makes them so funny and so sad boxing 2000 written and directed by richard maxwell producing director , barbara hogue sets and costumes by stephanie nelson technical director ,

in july 1948 , the republican presidential nominee , thomas dewey , met in washington with two top advisers , john foster dulles and senator arthur vandenberg , to decide what stance their party should take on one of the first showdowns of the cold war the soviet blockade of berlin speaking to reporters afterward , dewey , who had a substantial lead in the polls over the incumbent , harry truman , said that the berlin crisis was so grave that it must be exempt from partisan wrangling the present duty of americans is not to be divided by past lapses but to unite to surmount present danger , dewey said that policy of indispensable unity , he added , was the vandenberg policy , meaning it bore a republican stamp even though it had been formulated under democratic administrations such words found an echo last week when gov george w bush sided with the clinton administration in opposing a measure pushed by senate republicans that would have set a strict deadline for withdrawing american troops from kosovo he called it legislative overreach , which , if enacted , would hamper his ability to conduct policy should he be elected president in november the bill failed , but 40 of the 55 republican senators supported it what exactly lay behind this rift between mr bush and the republican congress \? important strategic or tactical differences \? evidently not what this is about on the republican side is a deep dislike and distrust for president clinton , explained senator chuck hagel of nebraska , who voted against the kosovo provision it was a candid admission by a respected republican lawmaker that many in his party have let their antipathy toward the president dictate their votes on issues normally considered above partisan bickering this is not to say that congress has no business disagreeing with the president on foreign policy legislative consultation is essential to strong , durable policy there was far too little debate , to cite the most obvious example , when lyndon johnson began escalating the vietnam war in 1965 nor are presidential candidates barred from developing their own foreign policy ideas on the contrary , as mr bush s recent comments on nuclear security show , he is willing to state his differences with president clinton on sensitive matters but in doing so , he has sent a broader message of continuity , most obviously by appearing at a news conference on tuesday with henry kissinger and colin powell , two republicans who are respected by democrats unlike congressional republicans , mr bush seems to recognize the distinction between principled opposition and vengeful obstructionism , and to know how destructive the latter can be consider what happened after the 1948 election dewey did n't win , of course truman did in their frustration , republicans embarked on a mission to punish the democrats some claimed the truman administration had treasonously handed china over to the communists in 1949 then senator joseph mccarthy accused secretary of state dean acheson and others of being servants of the kremlin it was slander , yet senior republicans like robert taft tolerated and even egged on mccarthy s assaults a few republicans came forward to challenge mccarthy , but none had the stature of arthur vandenberg he died in 1951 , having supported truman s cold war policies to the end democrats , too , have indulged in the politics of vengeance in 1974 the watergate congress , seething with hatred of richard nixon , cut the lifeline to south vietnam as it was about to be overrun by north vietnamese troops if not for president gerald ford , who insisted that south vietnamese refugees be transported to the united states , many thousands more would have been killed or imprisoned senator hagel hastens to assure us that congressional republicans are under control if you have a president bush , he said , you 'll find all this settle down considerably but if we have president gore instead , the republicans might grow even testier , battling the perceived usurper at every juncture will they attack mr gore just as mccarthy and company attacked harry truman , not only for his sins but for those committed by the popular president whose coattails he rode into office \? senator hagel s words seem to carry an implicit threat if our guy does n't win , more trouble will come republicans would do far better to follow mr bush s lead , not only because it is more statesmanlike but because history is on his side in staking out common ground with the current administration , mr bush is aligning himself with dwight eisenhower , richard nixon and ronald reagan , all republicans who came into office on the heels of democratic presidents despite differences with their predecessors , each achieved triumphs by staying the course of a bipartisan foreign policy and each had legislative help if mr bush is elected , he will need it , too but he also needs it now if the country is to feel confident in republican leadership he needs an arthur vandenberg sadly , he does n't appear to be in sight
bat yam , israel , sept 27 in her immaculate apartment here , farahnaz rabizade , an iranian immigrant , was tempted to set an extra place at the rosh hashana table for her missing husband but she did not let herself be that maudlin , she said , because she did not want to upset her children , who have been waiting four years for their father to show up in israel for the jewish new year mrs rabizade s husband is one of 11 iranian jews who disappeared while emigrating the men set off from iran at different times three groups in 1994 and mr rabizade s group in 1997 lacking travel documents , they all chose to leave illegally , presumably by hiring smugglers to help them across the perilous iranian border , where many travelers disappear in kidnappings none of the jews have been heard from since my father sacrificed himself for us , dahlia rabizade wrote in a 10thgrade essay at her new israeli school he was like a candle that lights the way while he himself is the wax that melts the 11 missing men came to the attention of human rights and american jewish groups only in the last month until then , iranian jews , who prefer to handle sensitive issues with the iranian government very quietly , had used back channels to search for the men recently , israeli officials , frustrated by the lack of response , decided to push for an international campaign on behalf of the 11 men given iranian governmental hostility toward israel , some jewish groups and experts on iran did not think that this was wise one expert here said that he was personally told by a jewish member of the iranian parliament that the government was working hard to locate the men i think they might get some good results , the expert said , and maybe the israeli authorities should be a little more patient but the israeli officials believe that , on the heels of the recent convictions of 10 iranian jews on espionage charges , which the american government and others condemned as unjust , the time was ripe to develop international sympathy for the men iran might be more receptive than imagined , the officials added , having become more sensitive about its image and eager to portray itself as tolerant of minorities the original assumption was that it would be easier for the iranians to respond positively when they were approached discreetly , said sallai meridor , chairman of the jewish agency but this assumption has not been proven correct and we do n't think the families should have to wait any longer it s time for answers whether the men were arrested and imprisoned by the authorities or fell prey to the violence of the no man s land that exists in iran s border zones is unclear the frontier with pakistan , in particular , is treacherous territory for a stranger , with tourists and others including many bahais from iran disappearing in kidnappings but israeli officials and iranian jewish leaders outside israel say they have reason to believe that at least some of the men are alive and in prison there have been recent reports of sightings by other prisoners , they said if they were behind bars , the men would be in the company of thousands of muslims and other iranians who have also been apprehended while fleeing the country a senior clinton administration official told an american jewish leader that the case of the 11 men should be treated as part of a broader human rights problem emigration from iran is restricted in general and , an amnesty international official noted , record numbers of iranians are seeking political asylum elsewhere , even in this time of peace and relative openness in iran but world jewish leaders say the issue of emigration is particularly resonant for jews because of a history of flights from peril the idea of jews in this day and age seeking safety and being intercepted is a horror story and even worse , said a senior official at an american jewish organization , who requested anonymity because he has not decided that going public with the case is a good idea mrs rabizade , 37 , has taken a hebrew first name , urit , a job as a nanny , and an apartment in this immigrantfilled town near tel aviv her children have assimilated very rapidly but the whole idea of coming to israel was her husband s dream , not hers so , she said , she cannot help but feel displaced in her new life , especially when her old one , in the southern iranian city of shiraz , was quite nice her husband owned a clothing shop , and she was a sales clerk , she said their jewish life was open and free , she said , with plenty of kosher food available and a lovely old synagogue in walking distance from their home jews are a protected minority in iran although they do suffer official discrimination , the case of the 13 convicted of spying for israel on what many believe were trumpedup charges was an anomaly in their history still , mrs rabizade s husband , who is 18 years older than she is , set his sights on a life in israel after several trips here , and she , too , believed it was our land generally , the iranian government did not permit all members of a jewish family to travel abroad at once but in late 1996 the rabizades decided to try
the killing of a woman whose partly clothed body was found thursday on a mattress in a vacant lot in williamsburg , strangled with her sneaker laces , may be linked to the slayings of five other women in brooklyn , the police said yesterday the other bodies were found over the last 10 months on rooftops in williamsburg , in apartments in bedfordstuyvesant , and , in one case , in a utility room beneath the brooklyn ramp to the williamsburg bridge , the police said some common elements tie the slayings together detectives from the brooklyn north homicide squad and the 90th and 79th precincts in williamsburg and bedfordstuyvesant are investigating them on the theory that they were committed by one person but investigators said they did not have enough evidence to conclude that a serial killer was stalking the brooklyn neighborhoods where the women were slain we are treating all of these homicides as possibly being linked , police commissioner howard safir said we do not at this point know for sure that they are linked in all of the cases , the women were strangled , apparently with whatever the killer found at hand two with their own sneaker laces , one with the drawstring from a pair of sweatpants , two with electrical cord and one with a piece of cloth , the police said all the women had arrest records for prostitution or drugrelated offenses and all were found nude or partly clothed , a senior law enforcement official said none of the victims' bodies showed any signs that they had struggled with their killers the killings are being investigated as a group , said lt joseph heffernan , who is overseeing the inquiry and heads the brooklyn north homicide task force , because of the similarities , in an effort not to get caught short , not to miss something but some things set the five deaths apart , he said the victims ranged in age from 21 to 48 years old two were hispanic , three were black and one was white detectives said they thought the killer had struck two of the women in the face in the first three cases , one in august and two in september , dna evidence recovered from the bodies suggested the same man had sex with the women before they were killed , but investigators do not have evidence that he killed them , according to the senior law enforcement official three of the women , including the most recent victim , were killed on thursdays and a fourth , rhonda tucker , 21 , who was found in her bedfordstuyvesant apartment on sept 25 , a saturday , was last seen alive on a thursday in the most recent case , the victim , patricia sullivan , 48 , was found about 2 20 pm on thursday in a vacant lot in williamsburg , across from 28 bartlett street , the police said she was seen walking earlier that day into the lot , which was overgrown with tall grass and strewn with garbage , with a man , but police were not sure whether he was her killer the other victims were vivian caraballo , 26 , who was found in the elevator room on the roof of the building where she lived on south second street on aug 26 joanne feliciano , 35 , who was found on the roof of a south fourth street building on sept 16 katrina niles , 34 , whose body was discovered inside her marcy avenue apartment on oct 4 and an unidentified 43yearold woman whose body was found under the williamsburg bridge map of new york shows location of brooklyn one person may have killed six women in brooklyn in 10 months
boston , april 19 in the past , the game film junkie in jeff van gundy thrived on the pattern of the firstround playoff series until this season , coaches like van gundy could retreat with their teams to a minicamp , spend five days putting their opponents through a timelapse breakdown and inspect their every tick before game 1 after the blueprints were finished , the series would unfold in games played about every other day there was a rhythm to the spacing of the games , an even tempo that fans could latch onto easily this season , that groove is being disrupted by a television schedule that will begin the threeoffivegame firstround series this weekend on three to four days' notice the schedule will include gaps between games that could reach three days and stretch the series over a 13day period the knicks were expected to play game 1 against toronto on sunday i liked the fourday break because i thought it was good for the buildup to the games or series for everybody , van gundy said before his team s practically meaningless season finale , a 11285 loss to the celtics , at the fleet center tonight again , it s understandable why they 're doing it they 're trying to boost tv ratings we all benefit from that the new schedule was part of a plan by turner sports to grab higher ratings for tnt and tbs television executives said the new strategy would eliminate doubleheaders that put the cable networks in competition with each other but with games spaced so far apart , there is a chance that fans who have short attention spans will miss the drama that used to build between tightly scheduled games i think there is a little slippage , van gundy said i do n't know about momentum from the teams , but in the interest once the series begins between the thirdseeded knicks and the sixthseeded raptors , there will be a challenge for players to keep fresh historically , patrick ewing has been particularly ineffective on three days' rest on five such occasions this season , ewing has shot 37 percent in games after he has had too much time to lose his rhythm latrell sprewell has also seen a similar drop in his productivity , shooting 39 percent with three or more days of rest before the series begins , the knicks will be pressed for time in two days , van gundy must devise a strategy to dilute the impact vince carter has had on the knicks this season in four games , three of which ended in doubledigit victories for the raptors , carter averaged 32 points and shot a phenomenal 602 percent against the knicks for ourselves , being the team who will have to do most of the adjusting , the more time we have the better off it is , van gundy said but you know what \? we 're just going to have to play well and i believe we will play well all season , van gundy has played musical chairs with his defenders , alternating his carter coverage with sprewell , larry johnson and marcus camby with a little game film , van gundy will try to come up with another solution if he does find the golden answer , there could be another scheduling glitch to face for any team that happens to sweep its firstround opponent , the players could be sitting around for a week while their next opponent finishes its series it seems like an unlikely scenario for the knicks to deal with considering their daunting opponent with thursday as an off day , the task for van gundy and his staff to prepare the knicks will begin on friday with twoaday practices at sunypurchase i do n't think it s ideal , van gundy said but that s the way it is it s for the benefit of tv whatever the schedule is , that s how we have to play rebounds with an uninspired effort by the starters in their limited time against boston , the knicks head into the playoffs after losing three of four games and yet the players were energized after wednesday night s loss by the chance to face down their demons vince carter and the raptors latrell sprewell , for one , has been bedeviled by carter that s why i want him it s a challenge , said sprewell , who will be among several knicks expected to defend carter i would expect i would get some of that action i do n't know how much it depends on how much success i'm having , or he s having when asked why the knicks had a chance against the raptors after losing three of four games to them in the regular season , patrick ewing bellowed as he left the room new day it s a new day chris childs was the only knick who did not play tonight he was held out of the game because of knee tendinitis , but said he would be fine for the playoffs marcus camby , who missed his second game with a sprained knee , also said he would be ready for the postseason in an inglorious season finale for the knicks , allan houston scored 11 points \( 5 of 12 \) , sprewell added 12 \( 5 of 14 \) , ewing ended with 15 \( 5 of 9 \) , and larry johnson hit just 1 of 4 shots none of the four played more than 29 minutes , and yet they combined for eight turnovers photo kurt thomas defending against the celtics' antoine walker last night during the knicks' loss at boston \( associated press \) \( pg d2 \)
arusha , tanzania , jan 16 nelson mandela began his duties today as the new mediator for the conflict in burundi with an extraordinary attack on the nation s warring leaders seated in a long row in front of him for failing their people and shaming all of africa he came here on his way to new york to brief the security council on the situation in burundi , a small nation in central africa whose violent ethnic war has been declared a priority for the united nations mr mandela said the outside world is horrified at the huge number of people who have died as many as 200 , 000 in a nation of fewer than six million since the civil war began in 1993 when they hear this they say , 'africans are still barbarians no human beings could do what they are doing , ' said mr mandela , who retired last year as the first president elected by south africans of all races he pleaded , please , join the modern world why are you lagging behind \? he asked at another point why do you allow yourselves to be regarded as leaders without talent , leaders without a vision \? mr mandela was appointed to the mediator s job last month by regional leaders after the last mediator , julius nyerere , the former president of tanzania , died in october mr mandela signaled that he means business in the search for peace in burundi , where ethnic hutu , who make up 85 percent of the population , are fighting to overthrow the minority tutsi , who run the government and army the war in burundi is particularly ominous to the outside world because it shares the same explosive ethnic split that led to the killings of at least 500 , 000 tutsi in neighboring rwanda in 1994 , and burundi has its own history of big ethnic massacres mr mandela began his job at a tense time the government has forced about 350 , 000 hutu to leave their homes and to move into more than 50 camps to keep them from giving support to guerrilla fighters following a series of rebel attacks last summer near the capital , bujumbura foreign governments and rights groups have criticized the camps as dirty , diseaseridden breeding grounds for more violence in the last month , 30 , 000 refugees have poured into camps across the border in tanzania to escape fighting in the nation s southeast there was no indication at the start of the meeting today that mr mandela planned so strong an assault on representatives from the 18 different parties , including the government , who gathered in this town in northern tanzania dressed informally in a golden batik shirt , he walked into a conference room here with a smile and slow step , asking permission to shake hands and joking about his age some of you are very young , he said to the burundian delegates mr mandela is 81 , and some burundians have sniped over whether he is up to the task of finding peace for a small country with an outsized war many have also wondered aloud if mr mandela , who has also been active in middle east peace efforts , has time for burundi but mr mandela showed quickly he had done his homework , outlining major points of contention with businesslike precision those included disarming combatants , integrating more hutu into the army , developing a timetable for elections and forming a transitional government he also suggested that he hopes to bring regional and even world leaders including president clinton , jacques chirac of france and king fahd of saudi arabia into the effort to find peace for burundi he was adamant that the negotiations be expanded to include armed rebel groups not now included in the talks because of internal squabbles among the various opposition groups the hope is that this may stave off violence immediately and lead to a more solid peace for the long term there can be no guarantee that the decision we take here even if unanimous will be respected by the armed groups on the ground , he said but near the end of his speech he began his criticism of the burundian leaders for taking too long to find peace , for not compromising and for putting their own interests above their nation s saying that they did not measure up to leaders in places like namibia , mozambique or zimbabwe , he seemed intent on shaming them into action the fact that women , children and the aged are being slaughtered every day is an indictment against all of you , he said you have reached a stage where none of you is completely right and none is completely wrong the burundian delegates applauded only tepidly at the end of the speech , which lasted over an hour , but afterward suggested that they were proud to be scolded by a man of such moral authority he is accurate , said leonce ndarubagiye , a leading member of a hutu rebel group , the national council for the defense of democracy there are things he said that did not please everyone but they are things that needed to be said mr ndarubagiye also made clear how difficult the search for peace will be , even with mr mandela at the lead of the talks officials say that his group once controlled many of the fighters , but has since lost many of them in an internal leadership struggle , but he said he opposes including any more groups in the talks the armed groups are represented here , he said if there are others , we do n't know them still the peace effort which had languished after mr nyerere s death has been given a needed jolt from mr mandela and his sharp words as the man who united his own nation , once also ruled by a small minority , he may be the best person to find peace for burundi mandela is very important because he is the symbol of a solution without revenge , said mario marazziti , spokesman for the community of st egidio , a catholic lay organization that is helping mediate the conflict reconciliation is the only hope for burundi and who better to preach reconciliation than mandela photo nelson mandela greeted sylvestre ntibantunganya , burundi s ousted president , in tanzania yesterday \( associated

ed mcbain is not a writer to be trifled with , so before delving into his background i thought it prudent to give him his miranda warning against selfincrimination the objective was to untangle this prolific writer s dual identities as mcbain , the author most recently of the last dance , and as evan hunter between the two pen names he has written 94 novels , with 100 million copies in print in almost as many languages as are spoken at the united nations in police parlance why the different a k a s , and how does he thrive under radically different styles as mcbain , the tenacious observer of squad rooms and murder scenes , and hunter , the literary novelist \? as evan hunter the author s legally adopted name he has also written four screenplays , including the hitchcock film the birds , four children s books and two shortstory collections in his spare time he squeezed out three plays \( none of which were critical successes \) since the sharpeyed mcbain focuses on sartorial and culinary clues to his characters' personalities , it seemed only fair to corner him at one of his favorite hangouts the sitdown occurred on a soggy winter s day at primola , an unpretentious restaurant on manhattan s east side even with a coppery beard , the 73yearold hunter has the look and energy of a man in his 50 s six feet tall but compactly built , wearing a black crew neck shirt and a conservative gray sports jacket and sitting with his back to the wall , he resembled the prototypical manhattan homicide detective who knows the value of dressing fashionably and blending in with the environment for the record , he volunteered that his original moniker was salvatore albert lombino and that he grew up in manhattan s east harlem and in the north bronx his first crack at the writing game began in the navy during the final years of world war ii combating boredom , he churned out neophyte adventure yarns and short stories for magazines , all of which were rejected back in civilian life , he graduated phi beta kappa from hunter college and later landed a variety of jobs in new york city he was a substitute schoolteacher , a lobster salesman and an agent at the scott meredith literary agency determined to become a writer , he labored nights and weekends and got enough rejection slips from publishers to paper the walls of his bathroom eventually , he began selling \( for as little as 1250 \) adventure , crime , western , sports and fantasy stories to magazines under an assortment of six pseudonyms the pen names served as disguises when three or four of his stories were published simultaneously in the same issue of a pulp magazine in 1952 he sold his first novel , find the feathered serpent , a tale about a time traveler , under his favorite alias , evan hunter all the kids that i grew up with had names like mario and rocco and evan sounded like a real exotic name , he explained and hunter sounded like a guy who wanted to achieve and become somebody in this city there was also a commercial reason publishers warned that lombino was too hard to pronounce and might hurt sales his breakthrough as evan hunter came in 1954 with the publication of the blackboard jungle , a bestselling novel about the perils of teaching in an innercity high school the book was based on his sixmonth stint as a teacher in 1950 , and he completed it in just two months after the triumph of the blackboard jungle , an editor at pocket books who recognized hunter s potential talent as a crime novelist designated him the successor to the company s popular mystery writer , erle stanley gardner instead , hunter conceived a series on urban crime with a collective hero , the 87th precinct detective squad , as a more realistic and relevant subject than a lone , mythic detective before hunter finished the first book , editors suggested a pseudonym for the series they were certain that if it became known that evan hunter was writing mysteries , it would damage my career as a straight novelist , he said the name mcbain came out of the blue as he typed the last page of the first manuscript , cop hater , in 1956 mcbain s voice is that of a cynical new yorker , not a sophisticated guy who has been to paris or rome , hunter said he s a guy who has been around a police reporter or an excop before inventing the police procedural novel , hunter had no experience in the insular world of bigcity cops in the first 20 years of the series' existence , he steeped himself in police dialogue and tactics by becoming a fly on the wall in squad rooms , riding with detectives on calls to crimes in progress , observing them at autopsies and at interrogations the plots for the novels spring mainly from hunter s extensive reading and his analysis of contemporary crime trends he admitted that the 87th precinct detectives are idealized while in reality many police forces are rife with corruption , brutality and racism i know that all cops are not sterling characters , he said but you have to have someone to root for i balance it with rotten cops who will take a bribe , who will beat somebody up the mcbain mysteries are easier to write and more fun to create than the complex hunter novels , he said , adding , changing writing styles is like an actor taking on a different part but the dual roles have spawned difficulties for him with critics and authors i'm not quite accepted among mystery writers because they suspect that i think i'm slumming when i'm ed mcbain , he said wistfully and i'm not quite accepted in the 'literary community' because i write mystery novels hunter writes at his home in connecticut and spends a day or two each week in new york to keep up with bigcity currents although he suffered three heart attacks between 1987 and 1997 , he has never been afflicted by writer s block and continues to generate 10 , 000 words a week under one name or the other he recently completed the 22nd evan hunter novel , rain after sundown , but is mum about discussing the theme he has also returned to the theater long enough to write the book for the night they raided minsky s , a musical comedy about the old burlesque theater , soon to go into rehearsals retirement is not in sight for hunter or mcbain but hunter has chosen the title exit to close out the 87th precinct series if he decides to lay down his pen with the final plot he hopes to prevent another writer from continuing the series and tampering with his concept and style i have n't written it yet , he added with a trace of superstition i'm afraid that as soon as i put in the final period for 'exit , ' i 'll be hit by a bus
toronto in the end , it was a shot you would not have the nerve to try in a game of horse that broke the raptors' back it sent the knicks into the second round of the playoffs and dispatched the raptors to the summertime hammock no one had ever suggested to butch carter of toronto that coaching was as easy as eating noodles , but to suffer this , after all he had gone through in the past week , was to suffer abjectly larry johnson , with the game on the line , squared up as nice as you please from beyond the 3point arc , almost straightaway from the hoop , and lofted a shot that sailed high , seemed to hang for a moment like a burnt orange moon among the lights the record crowd of almost 20 , 000 in the air canada center grew hushed , after trying for a full game to ape the madding throng with uncommon success in madison square garden the score was 8280 , knicks there were 249 seconds left in the contest the darlings of the hometown fans were down , two games to none , in the threeoffivegame firstround series johnson s shot descended , but not through the net , at least not at first , which is the conventional mode for a score from that angle the ball bounced off the backboard , like a ricochet in a pinball machine , and plopped into the twine larry said he called 'glass , ' chris childs , the knick guard , said later , with a winner s chuckle but i did n't hear it whatever johnson did or did not call , the ball took the air not only out of the crowd , but out of the raptors themselves when the ball went in , said allan houston , the knicks guard , i could see the heads of the raptors drop vince carter , the raptors leaper who found he could not jump as high in the playoffs as he did in the regular season , said it s hard to bounce back after a shot like that it was tough to swallow i said to larry 'you did n't call glass you should give a point back' he just smiled then johnson made that insipid l sign , for larry , with his arms if he must signify , one wishes he would try to make the k sign , not only for the degree of difficulty , but for the sake of the team the raptors then missed a few 3point attempts and the game was over , 8780 , with childs adding two free throws for icing but it was not only johnson s shot that sank the raptors , to be sure one shot does not a series make there is a cliche in sports that championship teams find a way to win the knicks keep finding those ways and while accidents happen , the knicks find a way to take advantage of even those accidents how was it , though , that the knicks were able to finish on top in three close games , in three games in which the outcome was in doubt until the final minute or two \? knicks coach jeff van gundy said he does not subscribe to the theory that experience was the key factor in the toronto series talent is more important , he said but it is what the talent does with itself that is most important and the knicks , as a team , faced critical games in the playoffs last year when they went to the national basketball association finals this is the first time the raptors , a team in existence for five years and with young players as a nucleus , have made it to the playoffs charles oakley , a toronto veteran , has a facility for summing things up with the quickness of cliffs notes , if , sometimes , not with the same transparency they made the plays , he said they did n't fight the double team they passed the ball in other words , the raptors fought the double team , which was primarily the knicks' way of containing vince carter , who , during the regular season , traversed above and through the knicks like blackstone the magician s floating light bulb butch carter , meanwhile , was still taking heat doug christie , who in the series played smaller than the 5foot3inch muggsy bogues , to whom he lost his starting position , was complaining after the game that his coach s outside distractions hurt the team the coach had sued marcus camby for defamation of character , had come out with a book saying bob knight was not even an earl and challenged his veterans with the assertion that none of them have yet stepped up and assumed leadership roles did n't faze me , vince carter said about his coach s controversies my job the team s job was on the court to play to win that was our only focus if butch carter learned anything about this , his first playoff series as an nba head coach he has built a previously ragtag team into a playoff team in a bit more than two years it is that he overprepared i should have spent less time with x s and o s and more time on talking about keeping our emotions under control , he said but the intensity of the playoffs is so great that it was hard to anticipate he is a broadbuilt man with a soft smile , who seems as open as an embrace learn anything else \? yes , carter said when you 're losing , talk less at the conclusion of the game , vince carter was the last man to leave the court , as the disappointed crowd summoned the energy to cheer him in response , he took off his basketball shoes , and tossed them do you usually do that , he was asked no , he said end of the season , i do n't need them the knicks , however , were holding tight to their footwear , believing it will be useful next sunday in miami photo larry johnson showed perfect form on his pivotal 3point field goal with 249 seconds left yesterday that sent the knicks to the second round \( barton silverman the new york times \)

the mosquitoes of east 91st street are back for years , people living near east 91st street and second avenue have complained about swarms of biting mosquitoes that periodically plague the area , even in cold weather it took time to persuade city officials that the problem was real but in september 1999 , after some mosquitoes in new york were found to carry the virus that causes encephalitis , they began to take the situation seriously , though they have not figured out where the mosquitoes are coming from in 1999 , engineers from the department of environmental protection spent over 100 , 000 replacing and sealing sewer lines , hoping to eliminate underground water sources that could provide breeding grounds that seemed to work until last spring , when the mosquitoes came back in march , department officials discovered that some properties in the area had leaky connections to the main sewer , and ordered the owners to repair them the problem seemed to improve again , until earlier this month my office has received numerous complaints that the mosquitoes are once again invading residents' homes , city councilman a gifford miller of manhattan wrote on dec 11 to the environmental protection department and to the city department of health sandra mullin , a health department spokeswoman , said her agency was awaiting approval from state environmental conservation officials to apply larvicide in the area over the winter charles g sturcken , chief of staff at the city s environmental department , said his agency would continue to chlorinate and flush the main sewer lines , but added that mosquitoes could be lodged in private sewer connections , just lying in wait mr sturcken said it was the responsibility of property owners , and not the city , to flush out sewer connections this problem has been very odd , mr sturcken said none of us have ever seen such pesky mosquitoes david kirby drawing \( j j boye \)
by day , pamela sybrandy works as a nurse in san diego but in her free time , she is a cyberwarrior for al gore part of a growing band of grassroots activists , ms sybrandy has set up a web page with no ties to the democratic party or the gore campaign to promote mr gore s views on family and children s issues until now , ms sybrandy s only political involvement was to gather bumper stickers and buttons at the local democratic headquarters but this year , she said , she looked at her political participation and decided to kick it up a notch and create a site \( www all4gore com \) to promote mr gore in a way that gave her more clout in the 2000 election , such independent and homegrown web pages , created by individual voters with some webdesign skills and a little spare time , are multiplying exponentially and now number about 6 , 700 often rivaling the sophistication of the official web sites of political parties and candidates , these grassroots web sites are a new way for ordinary voters to engage in the political process a hightech version , many say , of putting a sign in a voter s front yard or a bumper sticker on a car it s kind of democracy at work , said eddie mahe , a washington consultant and former deputy chairman of the republican national committee historically , those same things have been said in every campaign the difference is that they used to be said in a bar or at the corner coffee shop but now , on the internet , everyone has a megaphone in their unorganized way and by their sheer numbers , grassroots web sites are challenging the traditional role of the two political parties and individual candidates of controlling their own messages , to direct grassroots activism and to orchestrate the rhythm and pace of a political campaign if the 2000 election is the one in which the internet meets traditional campaigning , it is also one in which politicians are sorting out whether this grassroots cyberactivism is a friend or foe politicians do n't know if this will be a benefit or if it is where they start losing control of their campaigns , said ari schwartz , a policy analyst at the center for democracy and technology , a nonprofit organization in washington as of last week , 3 , 775 homegrown web sites had the bush name in them and 3 , 066 had mr gore s name , compared with virtually none containing candidates' names in the last presidential campaign not all , of course , support one of the two candidates some praise , some mock , some parody and others simply repeat much of what the two candidates have said or post news articles about them from other sources so far , the bush campaign seems to have suffered the greatest sting from parody sites , particularly over questions about whether he used drugs the bush campaign , in fact , tried to restrict one scathing web site , www gwbush com , arguing that the site should be regulated as a political committee , but the campaign s complaint was dismissed last month by the federal election commission it s like someone walks down the street at lunch time and yells at the top of their lungs that a presidential candidate is wrong or unattractive , said robert f bauer , a lawyer for the democratic party the candidates cannot demand a retraction or make a citizen s arrest this is not different for the most part , however , these sites are earnest efforts at political activism and , because of that , they raise a number of tricky issues on one hand , grassroots web sites represent a wellspring of new activists for candidates and parties to tap , especially when so many political observers have lamented a decline in voter participation but this new medium also creates a series of whatif s for the parties what if a wellmeaning web site contains information the candidate or party believes misrepresents it \? what if confusion arises between official party and candidate web sites and grassroots ones \? what if some of these web sites contain links to groups on the far right or far left that a candidate would rather not be associated with \? and , even more basic , what if these web sites begin to shift political power away from candidates and parties and to individuals with a large electronic presence \? until now , guilt by association was a very effective political weapon , said one republican party official on the web , heaven and hell are only two clicks away to criticize a candidate for something on a link that is three or four sites removed from his own web page will be problematic for every political player on the web they are all going to face it makers of these web sites do not see their activities as a series of whatif s , but rather as a chance to participate in politics in their own way , on their own schedule if my site was run by the republican national committee , they 'd be saying , 'do this' or , 'do n't say that , ' said travis main , a computer technician in eugene , ore , who set up www voterepublican net i wanted to be involved promoting republican conservatives but i did n't have the time to get involved with the parties or be an activist in that sense the internet gave me the opportunity to be active and work at it on my schedule
sana , yemen , nov 25 when an american guided missile destroyer sailed into aden six weeks ago , the pentagon , in effect , was taking a conscious risk it was making use of the best natural harbor on the arabian peninsula , but depending for the ship s safety on a government that relies on the uncertain loyalties of army officers , muslim clerics and tribal leaders with longstanding links to islamic militant groups so far , fbi officials investigating the suicide bombing of the cole on oct 12 , in which 17 american sailors were killed and 39 injured , say they have no evidence at least none they have divulged that anybody at any official level participated in the bombing , beyond the lowlevel suspects already arrested by president ali abdullah saleh s security police for issuing false documents and helping with other logistics but from the beginning , fbi agents have kept open an alternate possibility that the attack may have involved powerful figures inside yemen with close ties to osama bin laden , the fbi s mostwanted terrorist despite vigorous yemeni denials , the fbi has wanted to know whether any part of the cole bombing was supported from within the government , or by powerful men with islamicmilitant credentials who live under official protection from a base in afghanistan , mr bin laden , the 43yearold son of a yemeniborn saudi arabian construction billionaire , reached out to yemen for thousands of recruits for his holy war , first against soviet troops in afghanistan , later against american troops in the arabian peninsula and the persian gulf along the way , he met men now prominent in sana , the capital , including a top army commander , the country s most militant muslim cleric and a prominent tribal leader western intelligence reports say he gave them money to send yemeni recruits to afghanistan , and back to yemen when the afghan struggle ended those socalled arab afghans about 3 , 000 yemenis , and perhaps twice as many nonyemeni arabs , including algerians , egyptians , iraqis , jordanians , somalis , sudanese and syrians were then enlisted in terrorist attacks aimed at communists who had run a separate yemeni state from aden between 1967 and 1990 , when the two yemens merged under president saleh , the sana ruler that pact reached its culmination in a 1994 civil war mr saleh finally defeated the communists , using large numbers of arab afghans formed into islamic terrorist units as his shock troops , then rewarding their service and buying their further loyalty by bringing them into the big tent of his disparate government the fbi s concern over possible links to the cole bombing appears to have grown as the yemeni investigation of the bombing has progressed the yemenis , denying the fbi direct access to interrogations and other key aspects of their inquiry , say that their investigation is nearly complete , that it shows that two bearded men who attacked the cole in a fiberglass skiff were saudi arabianborn yemenis , like mr bin laden , and that the most useful leads in the case now lie outside yemen in the last week , the fbi s concerns were heightened by the government s decision to open a trial , probably in january , of half a dozen key suspects , mostly arab afghans who had lowlevel government jobs american officials say an early trial , based on evidence the yemenis say links the bombers to mr bin laden s network but not to anybody at senior levels in yemen , could obscure more than it reveals the american officials draw parallels with the saudi investigation into the 1996 truckbombing of the khobar towers military barracks outside dhahran , which killed 19 american servicemen saudi officials prevented the fbi from questioning any suspects and eventually held a trial , executing the alleged conspirators without giving the americans any access but the khobar towers analogy , and the mere suggestion that prominent yemenis may have connived in the cole bombing , have enraged the yemenis this week , prime minister abdul karim aliryani , a yaleeducated biogeneticist , called an american reporter and denied any suggestion of a coverup throughout his tenure , dr aliryani has been caught in a political crossfire resulting from his government s desire for improved relations with the united states as evidenced by the agreement on navy ships refueling in yemen and its desire not to provoke yemenis who are militantly antiamerican over the fierce resistance of yemeni secret police , the prime minister has been negotiating with the american ambassador , barbara k bodine , for better fbi access to the yemeni probe , including the right to have fbi agents watch yemeni interrogations through a oneway mirror or a live television relay until now , all the fbi has seen of the interrogations has been edited transcripts in the telephone call , dr aliryani reiterated that it is nonsense , absolute nonsense to suggest that some of mr bin laden s old allies in sana could have played a part in the bombing of the cole referring to the arab afghans who settled into yemen s remote mountains and deserts in the early 1990 s as jihadis , or holy warriors , he said they had been contained since joining the government
a week ago , former president jimmy carter made the unexpected announcement that he was severing his lifelong ties to the southern baptist convention he would remain active in his church in plains , ga , he said , but he would no longer consider himself a member of the denomination itself , which he said had become increasingly rigid theologically under a conservative leadership mr carter made news nationwide , but another decision , to be made next week , could have a greater impact on the denomination , which has nearly 16 million members on monday afternoon , as many as 7 , 000 texas baptists will gather in corpus christi for their statewide annual meeting , where they will decide whether to take a step toward financial separation from the denomination the question before the texas group , which tends to be more moderate than the denomination over all , will be whether to redirect 54 million in contributions from the southern baptists' national budget and give it instead to baptist causes in texas previously , most of that money was channeled to six southern baptist seminaries but if a proposal by a special committee is approved at the meeting , the amount given to those seminaries would be cut sharply and the balance used to help three other seminaries in texas , all run by baptists , but none under the control of the denomination there is another proposal , too , to redirect 11 million away from two of the denomination s agencies and use it to finance spanishlanguage churches and other causes in texas on the surface , this may seem an inhouse matter , but it signals a new stage in one of the most remarkable developments in recent religious history the fight among southern baptists for control of their denomination , the largest protestant body in the nation in 1979 , a deeply conservative group won control of the denomination and began shifting seminaries , missionary boards and other agencies toward the right where the new leaders said most baptists had always been the leaders hold that scripture is inerrant , literally true in all respects , and that the bible forbids women to serve as pastors for several years , a more theologically moderate faction struggled to reverse the tide , saying baptist tradition did not permit anyone to tell another how to interpret scripture or whom a congregation may hire as pastor in annual meetings , the conservatives prevailed but moderates never lost control of a few state conventions , as baptist organizations are called , most notably the biggest one , the general baptist convention of texas in june , the rift between the two sides has deepened then , southern baptists , following their leaders' request , revised the denomination s statement of faith to include provisions supporting inerrancy and arguing against women as pastors the document is important because seminary professors and southern baptist agency employees are expected to affirm it since then , some moderate congregations have left the denomination mr carter , in a letter announcing his decision , denounced the revised statement as a creed a word anathema to baptists , who have prided themselves on not having a specific formula of faith given how long the division has existed , the proposals in texas have generated sharply conflicting responses the current issue of the baptist standard , the texas baptist newspaper , carries differing advertisements on facing pages , one appealing to texas baptists to continue giving money to denominational seminaries , the other supporting the proposal to redirect the money to the three seminaries in texas the southern baptist convention s internet site , in a section called baptist2baptist , carries an essay by r albert mohler , a seminary president , denouncing the proposal on the seminaries as a propaganda effort to split texas from the denomination but david currie , a rancher who is coordinator of texas baptist committed , a group that supports the proposals , said they would help support new seminaries in texas but mr currie also said , obviously , there s been a dramatic change in 20 years in baptist life many of us in texas feel there s been a dramatic move away from traditional baptist theology , far to the right muslim group backs bush earlier this week , a muslim political action committee , affiliated with the american muslim political coordinating council , which represents four islamic organizations in the united states , said it was endorsing gov george w bush of texas , the republican presidential candidate coincidentally , that decision followed by less than a week the publication of a broad , though unscientific , survey of political opinion among american muslims , a group that may number as many as six million the survey , undertaken by the council on americanislamic relations , an advocacy organization that belongs to the coordinating council , found mr bush ahead of the pack forty percent of respondents favored mr bush , while 25 percent supported ralph nader , the green party candidate , and 24 percent backed vice president al gore , the democratic candidate the council said it had distributed its survey by hand , fax and email to muslim individuals and organizations nationwide , and received 1 , 022 responses the council s spokesman , ibrahim hooper , said , i see it as an accurate poll of politically engaged muslims in america
following are excerpts from the main points of the ruling yesterday by judge thomas penfield jackson of federal district court in washington in the antitrust case against the microsoft corporation conclusions of law the united states , 19 individual states , and the district of columbia \( the plaintiffs \) bring these consolidated civil enforcement actions against defendant microsoft corporation \( microsoft \) under the sherman antitrust act the plaintiffs charge , in essence , that microsoft has waged an unlawful campaign in defense of its monopoly position in the market for operating systems designed to run on intelcompatible personal computers \( pc s \) specifically , the plaintiffs contend that microsoft violated section 2 of the sherman act by engaging in a series of exclusionary , anticompetitive , and predatory acts to maintain its monopoly power they also assert that microsoft attempted , albeit unsuccessfully to date , to monopolize the web browser market , likewise in violation of section 2 finally , they contend that certain steps taken by microsoft as part of its campaign to protect its monopoly power , namely tying its browser to its operating system and entering into exclusive dealing arrangements , violated section 1 of the act upon consideration of the court s findings of fact \( findings \) , filed herein on nov 5 , 1999 , as amended on dec 21 , 1999 , the proposed conclusions of law submitted by the parties , the briefs of amici curiae , and the argument of counsel thereon , the court concludes that microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the web browser market , both in violation of section 2 microsoft also violated section 1 of the sherman act by unlawfully tying its web browser to its operating system the facts found do not support the conclusion that the effect of microsoft s marketing arrangements with other companies constituted unlawful exclusive dealing under criteria established by leading decisions under section 1 the 19 states and the district of columbia \( the plaintiff states \) seek to ground liability additionally under their respective antitrust laws the court is persuaded that the evidence in the record proving violations of the sherman act also satisfies the elements of analogous causes of action arising under the laws of each plaintiff state for this reason , and for others stated below , the court holds microsoft liable under those particular state laws as well i section two of the sherman act a maintenance of monopoly power by anticompetitive means section 2 of the sherman act declares that it is unlawful for a person or firm to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states , or with foreign nations this language operates to limit the means by which a firm may lawfully either acquire or perpetuate monopoly power specifically , a firm violates section 2 if it attains or preserves monopoly power through anticompetitive acts see united states v grinnell corporation \( the offense of monopoly power under section 2 of the sherman act has two elements \( 1 \) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and \( 2 \) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product , business acumen , or historic accident \) eastman kodak co v image technical services \( our section 2 monopolization doctrines are directed to discrete situations in which a defendant s possession of substantial market power , combined with his exclusionary or anticompetitive behavior , threatens to defeat or forestall the corrective forces of competition and thereby sustain or extend the defendant s agglomeration of power \) 1 monopoly power the threshold element of a section 2 monopolization offense being the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market , the court must first ascertain the boundaries of the commercial activity that can be termed the relevant market in this case , the plaintiffs postulated the relevant market as being the worldwide licensing of intelcompatible pc operating systems whether this zone of commercial activity actually qualifies as a market , monopolization of which may be illegal , depends on whether it includes all products reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes see rothery storage van co v atlas van lines inc \( because the ability of consumers to turn to other suppliers restrains a firm from raising prices above the competitive level , the definition of the 'relevant market' rests on a determination of available substitutes \) the court has already found , based on the evidence in this record , that there are currently no products and that there are not likely to be any in the near future that a significant percentage of computer users worldwide could substitute for intelcompatible pc operating systems without incurring substantial costs the court has further found that no firm not currently marketing intelcompatible pc operating systems could start doing so in a way that would , within a reasonably short period of time , present a significant percentage of such consumers with a viable alternative to existing intelcompatible pc operating systems from these facts , the court has inferred that if a single firm or cartel controlled the licensing of all intelcompatible pc operating systems worldwide , it could set the price of a license substantially above that which would be charged in a competitive market and leave the price there for a significant period of time without losing so many customers as to make the action unprofitable this inference , in turn , has led the court to find that the licensing of all intelcompatible pc operating systems worldwide does in fact constitute the relevant market in the context of the plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim the plaintiffs proved at trial that microsoft possesses a dominant , persistent , and increasing share of the relevant market microsoft s share of the worldwide market for intelcompatible pc operating systems currently exceeds 95 percent , and the firm s share would stand well above 80 percent even if the mac os were included in the market the plaintiffs also proved that the applications barrier to entry protects microsoft s dominant market share this barrier ensures that no intelcompatible pc operating system other than windows can attract significant consumer demand , and the barrier would operate to the same effect even if microsoft held its prices substantially above the competitive level for a protracted period of time together , the proof of dominant market share and the existence of a substantial barrier to effective entry create the presumption that microsoft enjoys monopoly power
was that the last wave \? three multibilliondollar buyouts shook wall street this year , fulfilling predictions that banks would rush to snatch the remaining independent securities firms the deals narrowed the longstanding divisions between banks and brokerage firms and widened the gap between the global giants of finance and their regional competitors with the list of available firms on wall street whittled to a few , the endgame in the competition to provide financial services to the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals has arrived in 2001 and beyond with most wall street firms feeling the pressure from a slowdown in trading and new stock offerings the survivors are expected to concentrate more on honing their strengths than on bulking up through the sort of acquisitions that transfixed wall street this year within several months , the swiss bank ubs bought the painewebber brokerage firm for 12 billion credit suisse bought the donaldson , lufkin jenrette investment bank for 13 billion and then came the real stunner chase manhattan agreed to buy the venerable j p morgan for 32 billion , a deal that is expected to close before the end of the year there was a different strategic rationale behind each transaction , and each may have been possible without the legislative change late last year that repealed the depressionera divisions between banks , investment banks and insurance companies that had been mandated by the glasssteagall act but a simple belief motivated each of the buyers the view that size and global scale would be necessary to compete in a lessregulated financial services industry ubs , credit suisse and chase manhattan all want to be among the lasting group of global financial powerhouses , so they are bolstering themselves by paying big premiums for established competitors the three buyers each took advantage of the availability of an essentially freestanding firm , a dying breed on wall street j p morgan and painewebber were independent public companies and donaldson s owner , the french financial conglomerate axa , wanted to sell it what we have seen is the last frenetic scramble for the big firms to position themselves as global toptier companies , said jerome kenney , who plots corporate strategy for merrill lynch foreign banks rushed to capitalize on relaxed regulations about who could own what , and some american companies did not want to be left without a partner , he said you can make a lot of money as a major investment bank , but the market ca n't support 50 of them , mr kenney added few analysts or financial executives think that the merger trend is over , but some say that they expect fewer marriages of convenience and more strategically focused transactions they may be stating the obvious because , by most measures , only two major wall street firms of digestible size remain independent lehman brothers holdings and the bear stearns companies but they argue that simply becoming bigger is not a panacea what is more important is having a leading market share in core businesses we 're seeing a broad restructuring of the industry and the concentration on building critical mass , business by business , said robert w stein , chairman of the global financial services industry practice at ernst young we will continue to see financial services institutions positioning themselves to have a bigger presence in narrower and narrower markets mr stein said the sale of donaldson , lufkin jenrette was a prime example credit suisse bought the firm , known as the leading underwriter of junk bonds , to broaden the offerings of its investment banking division , credit suisse first boston donaldson was on the block because axa had decided to concentrate on the insurance and money management businesses and donaldson was not really compatible with them , mr stein said but that type of consolidation was not the focal point of the revision of the financial services law that measure , known as grammleachbliley , was passed by congress at the end of 1999 and paved the way for the convergence of various services , including banking , brokerage and insurance businesses in fact , the biggest convergence of all , the formation of citigroup , was forged before the repeal of glasssteagall on the assumption that the repeal legislation would eventually pass when citicorp , the nation s biggest banking company , announced plans to merge with travelers , a big insurance and brokerage company , many analysts heralded that deal as a sign of things to come in the consolidation of financial institutions but , while there has been a rush to grab the remaining midsize firms on wall street , none of the transactions has much resembled the citigroup deal i do n't see this as a race , said rocco maggiotto , head of strategic planning for pricewaterhousecoopers at various times , the strategy , the available currency and the price come together whether that confluence can continue with the financial markets in a pronounced slump is unclear , mr maggiotto said in a more uncertain economy , firms will probably be more inclined to test relationships through alliances and joint ventures before plunging headlong into a merger , he added as a example of such a relationship , he pointed to the nascent venture between merrill lynch , the nation s largest brokerage firm , and hsbc , the londonbased banking company they are joining forces to offer online banking and brokerage services in canada and in several european countries some analysts see the arrangement as a possible prelude to an acquisition of merrill by hsbc , though executives of both companies have denied that james gorman , a former mckinsey consultant who is now a merrill executive , said the joint venture represented the way financial services firms were going to do deals for its part , merrill has sat out the latest round of the consolidation game it has made acquisitions to strengthen its mutual fund and stocktrading operations but has not bought any banks or insurance companies and has rebuffed overtures from potential acquirers , like chase manhattan mr kenney has been predicting for years that there will eventually be as few as seven global banking firms after this year s mergers , he said , there will be eight ubs , credit suisse , deutsche bank , citigroup , morgan stanley , goldman sachs , merrill and the combined j p morganchase that group has formed around one of the main axes of financial services combining banking , securities and money management , mr kenney said along the other axis are companies that will concentrate on insurance and asset management , like axa and allianz of germany citigroup looks more and more like an anomalous hybrid , with its emphasis on crossselling to its various customers everything from life insurance to mutual funds to credit cards citigroup executives maintain that crossselling is working , but many analysts now argue that the most successful approach will be to build lasting relationships with customers by providing what they want , how they want it photo douglas a warner of j p morgan , left ,

washington , april 15 central intelligence agency officials plotting the 1953 coup in iran hoped to plant articles in american newspapers saying shah mohammed reza pahlevi s return resulted from a homegrown revolt against a communistleaning government , internal agency documents show those hopes were largely disappointed the cia s history of the coup says that its operatives had only limited success in manipulating american reporters and that none of the americans covering the coup worked for the agency an analysis of the press coverage shows that american journalists filed straightforward , factual dispatches that prominently mentioned the role of iran s communists in street violence leading up to the coup western correspondents in iran and washington never reported that some of the unrest had been stagemanaged by cia agents posing as communists and they gave little emphasis to accurate contemporaneous reports in iranian newspapers and on the moscow radio asserting that western powers were secretly arranging the shah s return to power it was just eight years after the end of world war ii , which left american journalists with a sense of national interest framed by six years of confrontation between the allies and the axis the front pages of western newspapers were dominated by articles about the new global confrontation with the soviet union , about moscow s prowess in developing nuclear weapons and about congressional allegations of red influence in washington in one instance , the history says , a cia officer who had been a reporter was apparently able to use his old contacts at the associated press to put on the news wire an article from tehran about royal decrees that the cia itself had written but mostly , the agency relied on less direct means to exploit the american media the iran desk of the state department , the document says , was able to place a cia study in newsweek , using the normal channel of desk officer to journalist the article was one of several planted press reports that , when reprinted in tehran , fed the war of nerves against iran s prime minister , mohammed mossadegh the history says the iran operation exposed the agency s shortcomings in manipulating the american press the cia lacked contacts capable of placing material so that the american publisher was unwitting as to its source the history discloses that a cia officer , working under cover as the embassy s press officer , drove two american reporters to a house outside tehran where they were shown the shah s decrees dismissing the prime minister kennett love , the new york times reporter in tehran during the coup , wrote about the royal decrees in the newspaper the next day , without mentioning how he had seen them in an interview , he said he had agreed to the embassy official s ground rules that he not report the american role in arranging the trip mr love said he did not know at the time that the official worked for the cia after the coup succeeded , mr love did in one article briefly refer to iranian press reports of american involvement , and the new york times also published an article from moscow reporting soviet charges that the united states was behind the coup but neither the times nor other american news organizations appear to have examined such charges seriously in a 1960 paper he wrote while studying at princeton university , mr love explained that he was responsible , in an impromptu sort of way , for speeding the final victory of the royalists seeing a halfdozen tanks parked in front of tehran s radio station , he said , i told the tank commanders that a lot of people were getting killed trying to storm dr mossadegh s house and that they would be of some use instead of sitting idle at the radio station he added , they took their machines in a body to kokh avenue and put the three tanks at dr mossadegh s house out of action mr love , who left the new york times in 1962 , said in an interview that he had urged the tanks into action because i wanted to stop the bloodshed months afterward , mr love says , he was told by robert c doty , then cairo bureau chief and his boss , of evidence of american involvement in the coup but mr doty , who died in 1974 , did not write about the matter , and by the summer of 1954 , mr love decided to tell the new york office what he knew in a july 26 , 1954 , letter to emanuel r freedman , then the foreign editor , mr love wrote , the only instance since i joined the times in which i have allowed policy to influence a strict news approach was in failing to report the role our own agents played in the overthrow of mossadegh mr love said he had hoped that the foreign editor would order him to pursue the subject but he never received any response , he said i wanted to let freedman know that i knew there had been us involvement in the coup , but that i had n't written about it , he said i expected him to say , 'jump on that story' but there was no response mr freedman died in 1971
carpentras , france , july 12 the tour de france took a day off today and the riders relaxed , sleeping late , doing a little training , entertaining friends and families at their hotels whatever else the 160 men left in the race did , anybody who said he did not spend some time thinking about the giant of provence , mont ventoux , was lying mont ventoux , on the schedule thursday , is a 21kilometer \( 13mile \) climb past the tree line into a desolation of strewn rock it can be obsessive to tour riders many of them have suffered there , and one of them tom simpson , who suffered heat asphyxiation , complicated by amphetamine use , during a 1967 stage died there few have climbed the mountain with the joy they find in the pyrenees and the alps the ventoux is a god of evil , to which sacrifices must be made , wrote roland barthes , the french philosopher , pioneer of semiotics , sometimes windbag and fulltime bicycle racing fan it never forgives weakness and extracts an unfair tribute of suffering lance armstrong , wearing the yellow jersey as the overall leader , may never have deconstructed barthes s halfcenturyold essay about the ventoux in the collection mythologies , but he agrees with the sentiment it s just a weird place , a very weird place , he said recently , recalling his climb there in a race last month it s the hardest climb in the tour , bar none there s no life rocks any other climb there s vegetation , grass and trees not there on the ventoux it s more like the moon than a mountain tyler hamilton , an american teammate of armstrong s with the united states postal service team , won the ventoux stage last month in their final preparatory race for the tour it s a very difficult climb , he said you need to have a lot of respect for it , a lot of respect the last six kilometers are very difficult when i attacked there with about a kilometer to go , did the 100 percent effort , i was suffering barthes would understand , and probably approve
chase manhattan has agreed to acquire the beacon group , a private manhattan investment and advisory firm founded in the early 1990 s by a group of former goldman , sachs deal makers the terms of the deal were not disclosed but chase plans to name beacon s founder , geoffrey t boisi , a former goldman banker who once held the no 3 executive position there , as a vice chairman and head of investment banking , replacing the sometimes outspoken james bainbridge lee jr mr lee , who started the investment banking department at chase 18 years ago , said he wanted to spend more time with his family and his banking clients the acquisition is the latest in a recent series that chase , the giant new yorkbased banking company , has embarked on in an effort to expand its mergersandacquisitions talent pool and shore up its investment banking operations last year , chase executives actively courted brokerage firms hoping for a blockbuster combination with none in sight , chase began snapping up smaller companies in april , it announced the 77 billion acquisition of robert fleming holdings , the britishbased investment management firm with operations in asia as well as europe and in december , it bought the san franciscobased hambrecht quist with the hope of gaining more equity business in lucrative technology industries we feel good about these deals , said william b harrison jr , chase manhattan s chairman they fit they are smart since opening its doors in 1993 , beacon has attracted a roster of prominent deal makers , including david coulter , the former president of the bank of america , who was ousted a year and a half ago when the company was acquired by nationsbank we were growing by leaps and bounds , mr boisi said the 14 partners there were at a point where they had to either grow larger or stay small we did a lot of soulsearching in recent days in fact , the move may be as interesting for mr boisi as it is for chase mr boisi , 53 , will now compete head to head with rivals at the goldman sachs group , where he started his wall street career he joined goldman as a summer intern in 1970 and in 10 years worked his way up to become head of mergers and acquisitions \( he still keeps a photograph of goldman s weekend football team from those days on the wall of his office \) mr boisi advised on some of the biggest deals of recent years , including the pairing of texaco and getty oil as well as the philip morris acquisition of general foods in the mid1980 s , he was promoted to head of investment banking and oversaw goldman s expansion abroad , including founding the global finance department in 1987 but in 1991 , he left goldman to focus on onetoone , a national charity he cofounded that matches disadvantaged youths with adult mentors it has since been renamed the national mentoring partnership at the time , mr boisi , then 44 , said he wanted to spend more time with his family but wall street executives speculated then that he left because it would be several years , if at all , before he would be considered for goldman s top spot it did not take long for him to return to wall street in 1993 , mr boisi started beacon with a group of former goldman partners who specialized in niche areas mr lee , for his part , will focus on what he likes to do best cutting checks and deals he has been largely responsible for expanding chase s syndicatedloan business , helping finance blockbuster deals like last year s 34 billion takeover of telecom italia by olivetti , and the pending 58 billion acquisition of the mediaone group , the big cable company , by att you ca n't overestimate how hard it is to run one of these large investment banks , given the world is in internet time , mr lee said mr harrison said it was only in recent months that he had approached mr boisi , whom he has known for a few years and who has advised chase on deals over the next several months , beacon s 120 employees will be integrated into chase s private banking , mergers and acquisitions and wealth management departments the deal is expected to close on july 1
los angeles , june 8 without fear or remorse , reggie miller fired shots until the bitter end wednesday night , refusing to believe that they would not fall afterward , despite making an unfathomable 1of16 attempts , miller issued a warning to the los angeles lakers that was as outrageous as his performance i could n't put the ball in the basket , first and foremost , miller said today but i tell you what , if they continue to give me those looks , they 're going be in trouble my first four baskets went in and out , and every shot but one felt good if they 're going to play me like that , it s only a matter of time down one game to none in the national basketball association finals , the indiana pacers followed miller s bravado today and suggested that the lakers should be worried heading into game 2 on friday night as blurry as their aim was in game 1 , the pacers ca n't imagine their crosshairs being cloudy two games in a row the pacers clung onto several lifepreserving moments from their 10487 loss they rallied from a 6449 deficit to close within 7771 through three quarters , before being outscored 2716 in the fourth quarter rik smits was a nonfactor after picking up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter and like miller , jalen rose was swallowed whole by the laker defense smits and rose finished with 12 points each but mark jackson and austin croshere kept the pacers from being blown out of staples center jackson led a thirdquarter rally and had 18 points , 7 assists and 5 rebounds croshere added 16 points indeed , the pacers figure things cannot possibly get worse , particularly their defense against the lakers' shaquille o'neal , whose 43 points and 19 rebounds , indiana claims , will be proven an aberration it s not an easy series for us , pacers coach larry bird said the matchups are n't good they 're a quick team they 're big with shaq and strong they 're able to score points in bunches but if we have the effort of mark jackson that we did last night , if jalen picks his game up , if reggie picks things up and rik starts hitting a few shots , we 'll be right there with the lakers bird s list of ifs included shooting at least 46 percent as a team despite miller missing 15of16 attempts , the pacers shot 42 percent wednesday as crazy as it sounds , jackson said , we feel good about where we are right now miller especially looked on the bright side after his futility never wavered throughout game 1 he was 0 of 6 in the first quarter , 0 of 1 in the second quarter , 1 of 5 in the third quarter and 0 of 4 in the fourth quarter he missed each of his three 3point attempts , made 5 of 5 free throws and finished with 7 points , 4 assists and 2 rebounds it can only get better , miller said i'm going to shoot my way out of it i ca n't stop shooting i feel bad i only got up 16 shots if i was going to be 1 for 16 , i at least should have been 1 for 25 or something like that i really feel i did n't get enough looks bird said we do n't give up on reggie miller next game , i hope he takes another 17 to 25 shots miller estimated that 11 of his 16 shots were basically uncontested the lakers used the clever defense of the veteran ron harper and the youthful quickness of kobe bryant to keep miller guessing , allowing him to drive and often funneling him toward the middle , where 7foot1inch , 330pound o'neal menacingly waited i 'll continue to attack the basket , miller said shaq stands there and zones the middle , but if they 're going to give me the baseline , i 'll take it every time you ca n't just settle for jump shots you have to get to the freethrow line , especially in the playoffs still , miller downplayed being overexcited about making the nba finals for the first time in his 13year career he said he just needed to fuel an attitude toward the lakers like the contempt he holds for the knicks i do n't have any bad feelings about la , but you need that extra motivation , you need to create that little something to get you ticked off , miller said i think i 've created that myself by going 1 for 16 in game 1 of my first ever nba finals so , i'm more upset with myself now i 've got to contend with myself , which is kind of scary bird said he s never been here yet , so this is a new experience for him , a great experience but he found out the hard way last night
let it blurt the life and times of lester bangs , america s greatest rock critic by jim derogatis illustrated 331 pp new york broadway books paper , 1595 unlike most rock critics , who scrutinize the sun sessions as if they were the dead sea scrolls , lester bangs was never fanatical about elvis presley in the earlytomid70 s , the years in which bangs poured forth the best of his discursive and radiantly unbuttoned writing , he was too busy championing the kind of music he liked to call imperative groin thunder among his obsessions were the stooges , the troggs and lou reed to spend many afternoons blowing the dust from his old presley lp s \( if elvis really wanted to matter again , bangs cracked in 1971 , he should join the doors \) yet after presley s death , in a piece for the los angeles heraldexaminer , bangs quoted a memorable line from one of elvis s producers it s like someone just came up and told me there are n't going to be any more cheeseburgers in the world when lester bangs died in 1982 , apparently of an overdose of the prescription painkiller darvon , it was as if someone had taken the french fries and the chocolate shakes , too bangs was among those rare american critics who operate on their own wildcat frequency all riffs , all the time he could be childish , inaccurate , unfair , lazy yet decades later , his sentences have lost little of their crackle the only critics worth paying attention to , mencken once wrote , could make the thing charming , and that is always a million times more important than making it true bangs managed to charm even most of his enemies he made more than his share part of the fun of flipping through psychotic reactions and carburetor dung \( 1987 \) , a sampling of bangs s work edited by greil marcus , is watching him strew carnage in all directions for bangs , grossness was the truest criterion for rock 'n' roll his preference for music that gave him barking fits helped him define the aesthetics of punk and heavy metal and he loathed pretension and cheap sentiment thus the members of led zeppelin were emaciated fops the jefferson airplane was made up of radical dilettante capitalist pigs and an infamous essay about egocentricity in rock was titled james taylor marked for death \( if i hear one more jesuswalkingtheboysandgirlsdownacarolinapathwhilethedilemmaofexistencecrasheslikeaslabofhodonjt sshoulders song , bangs wrote , he would grab the first greyhound bus and track taylor down himself \) he could be even more passionate about the music he loved , whether van morrison s astral weeks or lou reed s headacheinducing metal machine music there has n't been another rock critic like him , and there is n't likely to be it s hard to imagine , in the cool and wellventilated world of today s music magazines , who would publish him as jim derogatis s readable and wellresearched new biography of bangs makes clear , he lived as exuberantly as he wrote he was a hard guy to miss in a crowd at 6foot1 and more than 200 pounds , bangs looked like a manic version of rob reiner circa all in the family he rarely bathed \( the village voice once referred to him as a walking dirt bomb \) , and he ingested enough cheap stimulants \( romilar cough syrup was an early favorite \) to fuel a decade s worth of keith richards solo tours but his restless intellect , outsize personality and big heart drew people to him he may have been the last rock critic in america to attract groupies of his own at times , let it blurt can read like a transcription of a saccharine vh1 behind the music documentary a catalog of bangs s excesses and upallnight gab sessions followed by the inevitable morningafter homilies \( lester seemed to be gripped by a loneliness that intimates could not alleviate \) derogatis , a pop music critic for the chicago suntimes , is a capable writer if rarely an inspired one it s not his fault that every time he quotes passages from bangs s own writing , the book seems to shift from black and white into color one of derogatis s achievements here , however , is his evocation of the shaggy world of the firstgeneration rock magazines notably creem \( founded in 1969 \) , but also rolling stone \( founded in 1967 \) and the even shaggier writers they attracted bangs fell in with a group of aggressive , largely selfeducated critics that included nick tosches , dave marsh and richard meltzer , and derogatis contrasts their antics with the more professorial demeanor of robert christgau , the village voice writer and editor , and greil marcus , who was rolling stone s first fulltime record reviews editor \( there s a funny scene where bangs spots marcus in the crowd at altamont , donnishly smoking a pipe \) while no one will mistake this gang for the new york intellectuals , their work has , for better and sometimes worse , defined rock criticism as a genre , and for some readers the gossip about them and others will be worth the price of admission derogatis brings home the goods there are pages of bickering , debauched behavior and romantic angst whether it s christgau hurling food at his former girlfriend ellen willis , who was then the new yorker s rock critic , bangs stealing the critic james wolcott s girlfriend out from under his nose , or bangs falling for the writer cynthia heimel after she approached him at a rock club and announced , i just took half a quaalude and drank three scotches , and i'm not responsible for anything i do
chicago three years ago , fruit of the loom was trading at 44 a share , and nobody was questioning william f farley sure , there had been smirks years before , when the hunky chief executive donned underwear to star in a television commercial , and raised eyebrows about a man who once touted himself as white house material but investors cared more about a company that ranked no 14 in the fairchild 100 survey of the world s most recognizable fashion brands and analysts cheered a new marketing slogan , everybody loves fruit now , with fruit of the loom wallowing in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and the company s shares down to 131 on friday , nobody loves fruit and all fingers are pointing at mr farley a growing band of critics say there were signs everywhere that mr farley , a veteran of the hugely leveraged takeovers of the 1980 s , had been steering the company toward disaster for years they point , now , to a 1998 classaction lawsuit that charged mr farley and other executives with insider trading to 103 million in personal loans guaranteed for mr farley by the company to bloated pay packages and rich deals with mr farley s private company to simple mismanagement of underwear sewing plants yet much of this had been disclosed in fruit of the loom s regulatory filings , and none of it stopped bankers from lending mr farley tens of millions of dollars to solidify his control of the company or wall street analysts from enthusiastically recommending the stock to investors or respected investment banks from underwriting hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds , even as the company was coming unglued after years of inaction , and some would say complicity , the board of directors finally ousted mr farley last aug 30 four months later , the company filed for bankruptcy protection by then , investors were out billions on friday , fruit of the loom said it lost 576 million in 1999 the financial world s failure to call a halt to the high jinks appears to be one more example of wall street s capacity to be blinded by charm and by stories it wants to believe i look back and say i should have never done it , said donald yacktman of yacktman asset management , a big shareholder it was a big brand name , and it s hard to believe a company with this kind of market share could get killed like this but it did today the fate of fruit of the loom is being played out in two locales a delaware bankruptcy court , and at the company s operational headquarters in bowling green , ky , where a former executive has been called out of retirement to pick up the pieces fruit of the loom , a brand name first used by a warwick , ri , textile mill in 1856 , has asked the bankruptcy court for permission to begin liquidating mr farley s assets the company wants to use the proceeds to pay down a 65 million personal loan it guaranteed for mr farley last year , and became liable for when he stopped making payments himself in an interview a few weeks ago , his first since he was removed as chief executive , mr farley , 57 , defended his tenure and insisted his conduct was beyond reproach not a day goes by when i do n't think about it , he said wistfully , the questions of what could have been done , could we have escaped this ugly situation but people are forgetting , he said , that he was the visionary who acquired fruit of the loom in a leveraged buyout in 1985 and built its sales to 2 billion blaming directors and managers for foiling his plans , he is threatening legal action , too , saying the company owes him about 100 million in severance and pension benefits only one outside director of the company responded to telephone calls about the board s oversight of fruit of the loom , and of mr farley it s a besmirch on my long history of integrity and honesty , said henry a johnson , a director since 1988 and the retired chief executive of spiegel inc , the catalog retailer but i 'll have to live with it 'dale carnegie personified' before the fall , bill farley was living the high life in 1985 , forbes magazine listed him as one of the richest americans he had a ski house near aspen , colo , a home in kennebunkport , me , and a lavish apartment on lake shore drive in chicago , where he played host to president clinton at a 1998 democratic fundraiser he dated the 1989 miss america \( he was one of the judges who picked her \) before meeting shelley mcarthur , a chicago model and singer who is now his fourth wife mr farley grew up in pawtucket , ri , the football playing son of a postal worker , and said once , i want to create companies in my own image he pursued that vision at fruit of the loom obsessed with fitness , he installed athletic facilities at company plants cigarette machines were banned , and meetings often began with mr farley leading his managers in aerobics he was charming and energetic , a deal maker dale carnegie personified , said one former colleague but much of his wealth was tied to the stock of fruit of the loom and things began to unravel there in 1997 , when the company , which also owns the bvd brand , was facing stiff competition from apparel makers like hanes , a division of the sara lee corporation
walter hahn plays golf on a public course in nassau county about three times a week , and the recent fee increases approved by county officials do n't make him happy people come to long island for the way of life and boy , you 're really paying for it now , he said between shots at the cantiague park driving range but what can you do \? it s nassau county and you 're just not getting too much bang for the buck here any more the fee for 18 holes of golf at eisenhower park , the course mr hahn most often plays on , went up 6 this month to 28 on weekends and 24 during the week mr hahn , a 29yearold health care worker from franklin square , said the increase would probably not mean that he 'll be lugging his clubs out to the course any less often but he still resents the gouge it takes out of his wallet without any prospect that the additional fees will go toward improving the three eisenhower courses , which could stand some sprucing up i could see paying it if conditions got better , but that s not going to happen because the money s just going into fixing the county s deficit , mr hahn said and the deficit s not our fault , it s because of all the years of mismanagement mr hahn said that the fee increases were really not that unreasonable , but that they nonetheless made him angry because they are a reminder of the county s fiscal straits and mr hahn , like many of the other park users interviewed , was quick to place blame squarely on the shoulders of county executive thomas s gulotta he got us into this , mr hahn said gulotta should just be a man and say we need to increase taxes we 're paying for it anyway and doing it this way , with a fee here and a fee there , is conniving the county legislature approved a long laundry list of parks fee increases last month as part of a fiscal recovery plan that mr gulotta proposed as wall street bond rating agencies threatened to reduce the county s bonds to junk status the fee increases are expected to generate 23 million , an amount that will barely make a dent in a projected budget shortfall most recently estimated at 178 million but the agreement between democratic and republican legislators to enact the increases was momentous since partisan bickering and fingerpointing in nassau county has been cited by rating agencies as a reason for the county s inability to correct its fiscal course mr gulotta said he was not too surprised to hear that taxpayers had focused their anger at him i am the chief executive officer of the county and ultimately the buck stops on my desk , he said and i accept my share of responsibility for the positives and the negatives he also said it was not unusual for taxpayers to focus on the fee increases as a symbol for the county s financial crisis people have read so much about the shortfall , it s a logical tendency to associate whatever happens with it , he said the fee increases cover virtually every county recreational offering , from golf courses and softball fields to marinas and beaches the legislature also has approved increases in fees for tax lien registrations and services for people on probation , for an additional 408 , 000 in revenues other proposals the legislature has yet to vote on that would bring in another 347 , 000 include fee increases for gun permits , for home improvement permits that involve digging up streets and for handicapped parking violations none of this is fair to taxpayers , said jim sclafani , a golf pro at cantiague and north woodmere parks we 're already paying some of the highest taxes in the country how about eliminating some of the higherpaying county jobs \? they 're looking at it from the wrong end mr sclafani , 50 , has lived in nassau county for 35 years he said he owned a house in merrick for years and recently moved into a rental apartment in bethpage now , he said he is seriously considering moving out of the county , maybe even out of state with the way things are going and taxes going up even more , he said , slowly there 'll be no more middle class here because we just ca n't afford it gail baratta , a telecommunications worker from levittown , said that each separate increase on its face was not unrealistic after all , she said , everything goes up so the added charges on weekly ice skating lessons for her 9yearold daughter caitlin at the cantiague park rink do n't bother her that much if not for the county s circumstances , i would n't mind at all , she said but when you look at the overall picture , everything adds up and we 're just getting kicked in the teeth robin herz , whose daughter ashley also takes skating lessons at cantiague park , agreed it s not that much money but it makes me angry , she said i do n't think it s right that we should pay for gulotta s mistakes , and there s other ways to cut instead of hurting children and recreation john b kiernan , commissioner of the recreation and parks department , defended the increases and said some of the fees had n't been raised since 1991 you have to remember that these are discretionary leisure activities , he said and when you 're talking about cuts to social service agencies and the public bus system , it s not unreasonable to look to user fees as part of the budget solution he also said the department compared prices at nearby parks before setting the new fees and does not expect usage to drop off , particularly since discounts for senior citizens at most places have been maintained we did a market study and we did n't do anything that was outrageous , he said the weekend fee for a round of golf in nassau county 28 to 30 at eisenhower park , depending on the course is comparable to staterun golf courses that charge 29 courses run by new york city and suffolk county , however , only charge 23 for residents there were golfers like joe verini , an engineer from hicksville , who said he did n't even notice that fees had gone up six dollars more is infinitesimal compared to what it would cost to join a country club and play on a private course , he said he estimated that a round of golf at a private club averages about 150 after factoring in initiation fees and annual costs when you 're looking at 20 , 000 just to get into a club , 30 for a round of golf is bubkes , he said doug mccunn , of merrick , also said he did n't mind the golf fee increase too much , as he packed his golf clubs into his car after playing at eisenhower park but as captain of rose and thistle , a softball team that has played in a county league for the last 27 years , he said he was more bothered by a 190 increase on the registration fee that brought the fee to 630 it s not so much that it went up , but that it 'll just go up from there , he said and when the deficit goes down , the fee wo n't go down with it his wife , joan , said she thought it was unfair that softball players were being asked to help pay for a deficit they did not create most of the guys on the team work and have a couple kids and this is their one activity , she said so why should they get penalized \? mr merrick admitted the increase was not that much when divided up among the team s 10 players when you break it down , it comes out to about 10 more for two hours of entertainment every week , he said how can you argue with that \? then he sighed and added , i guess what bothers me the most is we 've all been negligent about the running of the county , and look where it got us photo joe verini was one of the few who defended higher fees \( scott brinton for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) chart rising prices for recreation shows the new prices for recreational sports , beach parking , and shooting ranges in nassau \( source nassau county department of recreation and parks \) \( pg 10 \)
sydney , australia they left before the closing ceremony , flying to honolulu for fuel and then on to los angeles , where varied connections did their part allan houston to new york alonzo mourning and tim hardaway to miami vince carter to toronto off to their own worlds it s going to be an adjustment , going back to the nba this quick , houston said after the united states weathered two scares before leaving the 2000 games with the gold medal in men s basketball the atmosphere of this whole trip has been laid back , houston said people having a great time golf you 're playing with the best players in the world and now you get back to your normal life listed on the junket usa basketball planned to entice some of the world s best players were san diego , hawaii , japan and australia five weeks three continents thirteen games all expenses paid no one , of course , warned them about lithuania , a roughneck bunch of 68 forwards in crew cuts , who nearly made history before losing to the americans , 8583 , in the semifinals or the litany of foreign players who now identify a national basketball association allstar as less of an icon and more the guy who is making more than me in america no one warned them about the disapproving crowds in australia , who jeered carter when he preened after dunks , feeling he was rubbing it in or about the international news media comparing them unfavorably with michael , magic and larry reporters were standing and rooting for the swaggering millionaires to lose , if only because it would make a tremendous story some junket the last few weeks of representing the united states made 12 players see themselves for who they really are fine , skilled players with flaws , all of whom got along famously , but who had trouble blending seamlessly on the court and understanding that there is indeed basketball played outside the united states worth worrying about something like this gives you a little humility , makes you understand that as big as you are , there is always someone who wants to be where you are , houston said i do n't think all of us understood that sometimes with roughly the same amount of time to prepare as the men , the united states women s team played a selfless , nearly perfect game to win the gold medal by routing australia on saturday lisa leslie and sheryl swoopes are women s national basketball association stars , but they are not multimillionaires , or oneperson entertainment conglomerates whose annual income dozens of people depend on they are ballplayers , who happen to be some of the best in the world beyond the practices , games and leisure time , the united states men s team visited an aboriginal community in the impoverished redfern section of sydney a visit many players said reminded them of poor urban areas in america they walked into the opening ceremony to the loudest ovation they could remember , 110 , 000 people waving and chanting playing for the united states was hardly a vacation it became more like going to the summer camp they did n't want to go at first , but they returned home with a larger sense of the world carter came back with a meaner disposition , a player who got in your face if he felt you were trying to undercut him he was out of line on a few occasions , but by the end of the games he began to understand that not everyone was out to get him one of his favorite moments involved a spectacular dunk over the 7foot2 frenchman frederic weis in a preliminary game but he had a better moment yesterday in the 8575 gold medal victory over france the same thing was about to happen on the same side , carter said of a firsthalf midair encounter with him and weis and this time he fouled me and he looked at me and started smiling that was the greatest thing ever because we were n't taking it on a personal level we were just playing basketball of his boorish behavior at times , carter said i just say i gave it my all i was n't doing anything out of the ordinary i think i was protecting myself because after all this is over , some of these guys go back and i do n't know what they do , but i have to go back to the states , and i have a career to uphold and continue mourning came back home a father , missing two games on the trip so he could witness the birth of his daughter , myka sydney , nearly 10 , 000 miles away in miami , before returning for the medal round ray allen , often overlooked , returned as one of the most complete , mature players in the game at merely 25 years old , a guard almost as explosive to the basket as carter and as dangerous on the perimeter as reggie miller he may be a most valuable player in two years gary payton and vin baker , who understand they cannot carry the load by themselves , returned to a new teammate , patrick ewing , who was dealt to seattle nearly two weeks ago shareef abdurrahim came back a genuine winner , one who broke through the stigma of playing for a losing team in vancouver steve smith and jason kidd came home smiling , knowing they had imparted some of their class and integrity to a team sometimes found wanting in those areas houston returned with the first gold medal by a male athlete from louisville since the kind , loquacious man who knows his mother and who stopped by his birthday party when he was 3 grand avenue now has two gold medals , houston said , smiling i would n't even want my name mentioned in the same sentence with ali , that s how much i think of him but i suppose i 'll take it because we earned it we did earn it indeed , along with carter , antonio mcdyess and kevin garnett returned with the knowledge that none of their teammates would have stood proudly on the medal podium yesterday in sydney , gold medals around their necks , if they had not bailed out the team in the most important 45 seconds of their careers in the crucible of the olympic semifinals , the americans were trailing by 1 point but carter converted a difficult jump shot along the baseline , garnett stole the ball in the backcourt and mcdyess grabbed a monstrous rebound and put it back for a score , preventing an unimaginable loss for american basketball when they needed a basket , a stop , a rebound and a loose ball to save their pride , the game and , as kidd said , our citizenship , those three young players came through the bottom line is , because the games are little bit closer , people are saying , 'aha , this team we 've sent must not be this good , ' said russ granik , the usa basketball president and nba deputy commissioner i think what s really happening is the rest of the world is getting better the more they play against us , the less afraid they are the more they 're now coming out to play basketball , as opposed to '92 , when it was like they felt like they were playing against the gods houston to new york mourning and hardaway to miami carter to toronto the basketball gods came home last night , humble and more human than ever
the voysey inheritance was presented at the mint theater in manhattan last spring here are excerpts from d j r bruckner s review , which appeared in the new york times on june 17 the play returned yesterday for a run through feb 13 at the mint , 311 west 43rd street , clinton few theatrical works so shrewdly raise profound questions about the role of morality in the making of money as this play by the british actor and director harley granvillebarker , and none in english does it with such elegance and wit the voysey family is a collection of willful eccentrics whose money comes from a solicitors' partnership run by the head of the family and his youngest son , edward edward discovers that for 30 years his father has used money entrusted to the firm to play the stock market the father dies suddenly , and when edward sets out to restore the looted accounts , inevitably one client uncovers the manipulations , with social and legal consequences that make this play an intellectual thriller actually , the dialogue makes it sound like a parlor comedy , and anyone following its arguments might think it is a fabian socialist critique of capitalism , a not unreasonable conclusion since granvillebarker was george bernard shaw s closest collaborator but little here is didactic the arguments made by most of the voyseys for their cavalier use of other people s wealth carry much more force than edward s doubts the lines are so sharp that even if they were read in a monotone a listener would be startled by the depths of character they reveal but there is nothing monotonal here george morfogen as the senior voysey is a generous thief trusted by everyone with one exception , the male voyseys are so ridiculously confident they make contempt a pure joy edward \( kraig swartz \) grows almost imperceptibly from a scandalized young prig into a man who finds total loss is salvation as for george booth , the family friend who brings down the house of voysey , there is not a sillier , more delightful or vapid ninny in the literature , and chet carlin plays him as if he owns the part at the end many people expressed surprise that they had been sitting enthralled for three hours a playwright , and a company , ca n't do much better than that photo kraig swartz , left , with george morfogen and lisa bostnar in the voysey inheritance , being presented by the mint theater company \( michael gottlieb the voysey inheritance \)
for diehard theatergoers the kind of devoted fans who gnawed their cuticles over the battle between dreamgirls and nine in 1982 , or agonized over which actor from two trains running , laurence fishburne or roscoe lee browne , to root for in 1992 , or pulled for pacific overtures to upset the popular favorite , a chorus line , in 1976 the tony awards have been as exciting as the oscars and here it is again , that theatrical rite of spring tony time , when this season s actors , directors , playwrights , choreographers and designers get to enjoy their brief anointed status as nominees , and producers can salivate about the prospect of being able to plaster best musical or best play above the titles of their shows and hear their box office cash registers go kaching many theater professionals say the tony awards are a prestigious prize that celebrates broadway s talent and sells broadway shows , and that the awards' marketing power is potent , particularly on the road but these same professionals concede that tony season has also become an annual opportunity for carping and soulsearching within the industry , not only about the theater but also about the tonys themselves this year , the debates seem to point to a fundamental shift in the conception of what constitutes live theater on broadway the controversy over whether contact , a dance show with no singing or live music , should be considered a musical goes to the heart of a larger question about the direction of the american musical the three other shows besides contact nominated for best musical this year also defy conventional definitions james joyce s 'the dead , ' which recently closed , is a play in which the characters sing irish songs for one another at a christmas party swing ! is a dance revue that mixes classic swing music with new pastiche pieces and michael john lachiusa s wild party , like his other new musical this season , marie christine , features virtually no dialogue at all , blurring the lines between musical theater and opera indeed , this year s tony awards suggest a rejection of the traditional book musical , given that disney s aida was not nominated for best musical , although it received five other nominations the nominators were apparently hard pressed to fill out the category for best musical revival , nominating tango argentino , a dance show , which has closed , and jesus christ superstar , which received almost universally poor reviews , in addition to cole porter s kiss me , kate and meredith willson s music man two members of the tony nominating committee resigned this year a r gurney , the playwright , said he resigned because he was not permitted to abstain from the vote on whether mandy patinkin should be nominated for best actor in a musical mr patinkin had been absent from the performance mr gurney attended of the wild party i just did n't think it was fair to vote for or against him if i had n't seen him , mr gurney said \( the playwright elaborates on his concerns about the tonys in an article on page 9 \) jack goldstein , the executive director of the theater development fund , resigned over objections to contact s being considered a musical some nominators expressed frustration that they were unable to award something special to the two actors who alternate roles in true west , philip seymour hoffman and john c reilly even though the nominators had taken the trouble to see both versions of the production , they said they were forced to vote for best actor based only on the play s opening night casting they 're both superb and they both share the play , said frances sternhagen , the actress , who serves on the nominating committee so why do we have to have this rule \? theater so needs a boost that you do n't want to be difficult , ms sternhagen continued but it s just so hard when you want to give credit where credit is due the tonys this year also had to grapple with the notion of what is a broadway show for example , dame edna the royal tour and jackie mason much ado about everything were deemed ineligible despite their popularity with audiences one way the tony administrators have handled unorthodox shows is to give them special tony awards , as they did this year with dame edna the nominations this year also speak to the dearth of new writing on broadway two revivals kiss me , kate and the music man led the nominations , with 12 and 8 respectively two of the four productions nominated for best new play are actually old , though they are new to broadway true west by sam shepard was originally produced off broadway in 1980 , and the ride down mt morgan by arthur miller was first produced in london in 1991 similarly , noel coward s waiting in the wings is eligible for consideration as best new play because it has never before been on broadway , even though it was written in 1960 despite various complaints about the selection process , most people associated with new york theater agree that the tonys are no more problematic than any other awards show in which an industry honors itself
what is most striking about the celebrity portraits that arnold newman photographed for life , look and other magazines is their elegant simplicity as shown in arnold newman \( taschen , 3999 \) , the photographer has focused his camera primarily on artists , writers and political figures for the past 60 years he usually captures his famous subjects with revealing backgrounds or telling compositions a pensive stravinsky is seated at a grand piano that dwarfs the composer as its raised lid resembles an abstract sculpture of a musical note poised on a sofa with wide stripes and matching wallpaper an amused diana vreeland makes her fashion statement with a robe that clashes , yet oddly complements the pattern robert moses is depicted standing messianically on a steel beam suspended over the east river , with blueprints in hand and the manhattan skyline as backdrop as if to remind us that photography is , in a sense , painting with a newfangled brush , newman had several artists pose with an easel or a blank canvas framing their heads , including mondrian , de chirico , man ray , georgia o'keeffe and hans hofmann recent photos of woody allen and president clinton testify that newman has lost none of his skill for apprehending an inner mood with an outer expression david kaufman photo jean cocteau , photographed by arnold newman in paris , 1960 \( from arnold newman \)
port st lucie , fla , march 15 it was n't so much today s starting pitching that displeased the mets' manager , bobby valentine glendon rusch , a lefthander competing for the fifth spot in the mets' rotation , was neither excellent nor horrible that is the problem with the exception of the no 1 starter , mike hampton , who has looked sharp his last two outings , none of the mets' starters have done much to impress the manager it has been a spring of not bad , but not great our pitching has to come around this spring , valentine said after the mets and the los angeles dodgers played to a 66 tie in 10 innings other than hampton , our pitchers all need to improve the mets are not overly concerned about al leiter , rick reed or bobby j jones but the fifthstarter candidate with the most success so far is the one who is still the long shot to win the job the veteran knuckleballer dennis springer , who has held opponents to a 184 batting average springer allowed two runs in five innings as the mets won their other game today , 63 , over the cleveland indians at winter haven , fla rusch did not allow a run in six innings in his first three appearances but in five innings today , he allowed five runs on six hits , walked one and hit two batters he was struggling with his twoseam fastball , a pitch he learned from kenny rogers last year and which he must have to get ground balls , and his sinker was also ineffective it s going to go the way it s going to go regardless of how much i worry about it or anybody else worries about it , rusch said i just need to keep improving every time out today was kind of a mediocre day for me rusch , 25 , was acquired from kansas city last september in a deal the mets believed made too much sense to turn down they traded dan murray , who is a righthander with less major league experience than rusch has and is a year older rusch has more major league innings \( 330 \) than bill pulsipher and bobby m jones , the other lefthanders being considered for the fifth spot the mets do not believe rusch has the potential of pulsipher or jones jones probably throws the best , valentine said but he may be the most polished knowing how to pitch , valentine said , is more important to this decision than potential i saw real good composure , real good competitiveness , valentine said of rusch he had an idea of what he was doing at all times pulsipher , who starts thursday , has a 750 earned run average jones s is 788 springer , who was 616 for florida last year and has pitched the most innings of any of the four candidates , is a nonroster player and remains on the fringe of the competition there s a thought , valentine said of springer winning the job not a plan , but a thought steve phillips , the mets' general manager , is less inclined to trade for another fifthstarter candidate than for a frontoftherotation pitcher the sluggish competition has not changed that chance , phillips said , and a trade for a starter of any kind still seems unlikely one pitcher who could reenter the competition is the righthander pat mahomes , who told valentine at the beginning of camp that he would rather return to his long relief role than be considered as a starter mahomes could get back in the mix , valentine said , but so far he has not been extended as a starter would the competition could be decided in japan , where the mets play two exhibition games before their seasonopening series with the chicago cubs march 29 and 30 the mets will bring 30 players to japan and make their final roster decisions there the outfield presents another difficult decision , with one spot probably coming down to jay payton or benny agbayani , who both bat righthanded payton went 3 for 3 against cleveland to raise his average to 429 , while agbayani ran gingerly in his first game back from a pulled right hamstring if these games counted , agbayani said , he would not have been healthy enough to play but valentine told him to give a 75 percent effort to protect the hamstring , and agbayani tried he chased after a fly ball by geronimo berroa in the third inning , but it landed over his head for a tworun double later , shawn green hit a triple to the gap in rightcenter field if he were healthy , agbayani said , he would have caught berroa s hit and held green to a double i want to be out there , but i want to be contributing to the team , agbayani said i have to be healthy in order to contribute inside pitch the mets continue to talk to teams about dealing a lefthanded reliever , probably jesse orosco or rich rodriguez , and club officials expect that effort to intensify in the coming days the mets appear less likely to trade dennis cook , who has pitched well and has expressed no desire to be traded but cook , who has been traded five times , does not feel secure usually when they start to say it s not going to happen , it does happen , he said i 've been hearing that they 're not going to trade me , but nobody s untouchable manager bobby valentine is waiting for robin ventura to tell him when he is ready to play in the field again ventura , who is recovering from shoulder surgery , was the designated hitter wednesday against cleveland , but he has told valentine he could throw across the infield if needed
practically the only exports these days from the nations of the former soviet union are worldclass athletes that is a situation that is not likely to change , particularly with the top club in ukraine , dynamo kiev in the past year , dynamo has sold its international defender oleh luzhny to arsenal of the english premier league and striker andrii shevchenko to ac milan in italy for a 25 million transfer fee now the club is close to peddling its top scorer , striker serhii rebrov , to either tottenham , arsenal or milan , according to the club s president , grigoriy m surkis right now , it s natural for our players to want to leave , surkis said last week during an interview in new york for us to ever be able to import players is not so simple i compare ukraine to a desert where a tree finds it hard to grow we do n't only want mediocre players a star player is like a tree , and that tree will find our country to be a desert rebrov currently leads the ukrainian league with 18 goals in 23 games dynamo has a 17point lead in the league standing the club , under the direction of the fabled valery lobanovsky , played credibly in the european champions league this season before being eliminated in the second round of group play in previous tournaments , dynamo advanced to the quarterfinals and semifinals in successive seasons lobanovsky , who had been the national team coach of the soviet union in the 1970 s and 80 s , was recently appointed as national team coach of ukraine after jozef szabo resigned following a loss to slovenia in qualifying for the european championships he will retain his job in kiev , surkis said surkis is a successful businessman with interests in oil , banking , the news media and commodity trading and is also a member of the ukrainian parliament he rescued the club from insolvency and has seen it win six straight league titles and three doubles \( cup and league championships \) in 1993 , '96 and '98 since surkis took over the club , dynamo has built a sports academy that has developed players like shevchenko and rebrov , homegrown talents who eventually earn valuable foreign exchange for the club shevchenko was only 11 years old when he made his first trip to milan and saw the san siro stadium , surkis said on that day he told me that he wanted to play there our academy creates social conditions for the players , with living quarters , new cars , furnished apartments what we try to do is get them to concentrate on soccer for now , dynamo kiev will have to rely on its homegrown talent and players imported from other countries that were once part of the soviet union the club s roster now includes three players from belarus , two from russia , one from uzbekistan and one from georgia kansas city wizards kansas city has a 602 record and 20 points after a 00 draw in los angeles on saturday night to lead major league soccer s western division the wizards finished with an 824 record last season , second in futility to the metrostars the metrostars play at arrowhead stadium this saturday night and will be facing their former goalkeeper tony meola , who appears to have salvaged his career meola , 31 , missed most of last season with a knee injury after being traded to kansas city by the metrostars this season has been different , however , and now meola , a native of kearny , nj , is near the top of bruce arena s list for the united states national team meola is the league s top goalkeeper with six shutouts \( he has an mls record 27 in his career \) and a gaudy 049 goals against average \( 019 goal against in april \) he has not allowed a goal in the past 345 minutes \( the league record is 414 minutes , a record meola set in 1996 \) the wizards have the league s best goal differential \( 17 goals for , only 4 against \) with kasey keller \( rayo vallecano in spain \) and brad freidel \( liverpool in england \) having seen limited playing time during the past couple of months , meola could get a callup to the national team as world cup qualifying approaches in july corner kicks two famous european clubs are going in opposite directions atletico madrid , a ninetime champion , dropped out of spain s primera liga for the first time in 65 years atletico became the first spanish club to be relegated in the same season as reaching the spanish cup final in england , manchester city was promoted to the premier league after an absence of four seasons adin brown , the goalie for the mls colorado rapids and the united states olympic team , is being pursued by rosenborg of norway rapids officials are none too pleased that mls , which owns all player contracts , is considering a move that could net the league a substantial transfer fee and leave the rapids little to show jack bell
the immediate crisis may be over for residents of most illegal loft apartments in new york city , but the larger issue remains what to do about a growing stock of unlawfully converted buildings and the people who have made them their homes an uproar arose dec 15 when city inspectors suddenly evicted 60 people from an illegally converted factory building in brooklyn , citing fire hazards officials then confirmed that 120 other sites in brooklyn were also being investigated that prompted fears that up to 2 , 000 other residents would be removed , until mayor rudolph w giuliani s office intervened with a prechristmas assurance that there would be no mass evacuations but rather than resolving the issue , the threat of evictions made the illegal conversions too visible to ignore and the scope of the problem may be much wider than the 121 buildings that have officially been acknowledged there are glimmers of a solution in albany by a stroke of good timing , march 31 is the expiration date of the state law that legalized lofts existing in 198081 , most of them in soho , tribeca and chelsea the chance to renew the law opens the door to changing it some city and state officials are now talking about not just a routine renewal , but an expansion to cover the new generation of illicit lofts that have sprung up across the city , mostly in brooklyn the discussions are far from over , however although the dec 15 evacuation of the residents of 247 water street in brooklyn was traumatic , the event , by virtue of the publicity it generated , may well prove to be the catalyst for a solution to a broader issue it s almost like when we did n't recognize red china it was out there with a lot of people but we could n't officially talk about it , city councilman kenneth k fisher , a democrat from brooklyn , told a crowd of about 200 loft tenants on dec 20 at a hastily called meeting arthur rhine , a lawyer who has specialized in loft cases for 20 years , said in an interview things are exploding we 've met with several politicians , and things are starting to happen in ways we could only have dreamed about six months ago even before the recent evictions , the loft issue was being reviewed by the chairman of the state assembly s housing committee , vito j lopez , a brooklyn democrat whose district includes loft buildings we are trying to work in a collaboration with the city and state to consider legislation to grandfather in these loft tenants , said his chief of staff , diana reyna chuck delaney is the tenant representative on the city s loft board , a panel set up to oversee the legalization of lofts that existed in 1980 and 1981 , and a leader of the lower manhattan loft tenants group the situation is reaching critical mass , mr delaney said but much remains unclear it s hard to craft a solution till you have an idea of what s in play , and nobody really knows what we 're talking about in terms of numbers mr rhine said the 121 listed buildings were truly the tip of the iceberg he added , i would think there are probably a thousand buildings i'm talking just brooklyn and 10 , 000 tenants in addition , he said , there are a few hundred buildings in the other boroughs , including 200 in manhattan but the proposal to expand the loft law , which gives legal status to those illegal conversions of two decades ago , does not have universal backing some tenants do not want to be covered by it , saying it allows too many landlord abuses some tenants say exploitive landlords encourage them to invest in renovations and then push them out and bring in new tenants at higher rents it s a scenario i 've seen over and over again , mr rhine said others say they fear that legal status would make their neighborhoods so valuable that they would be priced out of them , or that , if a residential use was allowed , their buildings would be demolished for luxury developments another obstacle to expanding the loft law is that it was intended to be a onetime exemption , allowing the legalization of lofts that had been renovated to meet residential building codes and prohibiting later conversions but rising real estate prices in manhattan and the city s tightening housing market have driven people to vacant industrial space in stagnant neighborhoods the city did little to stop the trend , mr rhine said there are philosophical discussions about what should be , but we 're dealing with what is , he said proponents of lofts say they use neglected space , revive neighborhoods , stimulate the economy and ease the housing shortage critics say that they are illegal , unsafe and unplanned the center for an urban future , a nonprofit research group , said the lofts are squeezing out potential employers others argue that many loft tenants are selfemployed artists , consultants and other professionals , industries of another sort there s no way to roll the clock back , said councilman fisher , whose district includes many lofts in williamsburg and greenpoint the area , he said , had been transformed , a de facto rezoning from a heavy industry series of neighbors to a mixeduse and residential neighborhood all sides agree that safety is paramount no matter how much space or how cool the nabe , it s not a good deal to live in a firetrap , mr rhine said while state officials face a spring deadline on the loft law , a different pressure is mounting on city officials after one loft building was vacated last year , mr fisher began pushing the city to confront the broader problem the many agencies involved , including buildings , fire , planning and the loft board , complicated the matter at a meeting of agencies early this year , everyone acknowledged the problem but no one took the lead or offered a solution , mr fisher said no one wanted to be the last one who touched the ball before it went out of bounds , he said although fire department officials say they identified the 121 sites a year ago and notified the buildings department , that agency said it got the list only recently and acted promptly the two agencies have often been at odds critics say that what really prompted the sudden crackdown was an inquiry from the daily news about the list the resulting evacuation caught the mayor by surprise he told the two agencies of his displeasure and ordered the other sites reinspected teams returning from buildings with the most serious problems reported that none required evictions , and everyone seemed relieved for the moment but now we 've got to figure out what to do with all these buildings , mr fisher said so far , there has been plenty of blame for all concerned everybody s wrong here , said leslie samuel , a fashion consultant , as he stood outside the water street building , where he had lived and worked for six years we were wrong for going into an illegal building the landlord was wrong the city was wrong for letting it go on , and then for throwing us out without any notice now they should all sit down and work it out
purchase , ny , jan 16 the way the knicks delicately stepped around a grieving charlotte team on saturday night might have been understandable to coach jeff van gundy if not for the opendoor policy his team has had toward opponents all season once the knicks take a big lead , once they all but tuck a team away , they have a habit of inviting opponents back into the game the same knicks who play unselfishly and intensely to get that edge start playing star search as they begin auditions for highlights and if the knicks are listless in guarding the ball , if they are languid in their transition defense , they have shown a pattern of using the circumstances as an excuse the same knicks who dominate one night are as passive and laid back as a flower child the next so when the knicks threw away an 18point lead against the emotionally drained hornets and had to scramble for the victory , when they used the awkward position they were in as a crutch for their inconsistency , when they declared the game should not have been played at all , van gundy acted as if his team were crying wolf if we 'd played 32 games really hard this season and then we played a game like we did last night , then it s understandable , van gundy said today after his team practiced at sunypurchase but unfortunately , i think that was just another in a long line of excuses that we give ourselves we 're too eager to do that as i told them today , i'm not being anything other than realistic there are two teams on a mission to win a championship maybe three , because i have n't seen portland and it s the lakers and indiana they are focused and driven every night van gundy s reaction sounded harsh and insensitive but he sees a detroit pistons team led by grant hill looming on monday at madison square garden the same one that chewed up the knicks' defense , 114108 , last wednesday and does n't like the pattern the knicks have established none of van gundy s best players are displaying wellrounded games patrick ewing has played unselfishly , but his performance has been inconsistent as a result , he did not play in the last 13 minutes against charlotte , the second time in a week that van gundy had sat ewing down for the entire fourth quarter i know he s not happy with it , van gundy said but , like i said to the group , i'm not happy with them so , i do n't care if they 're not happy with me now , he s done it van gundy has broken with his new year s promise to be eternally optimistic in the aftermath of every victory he suffered a lapse today and vented his way through a list of problem areas , like sleepy transition defense while allan houston has been unleashing a constant flow of jumpers , he has been blistered by cleveland s bob sura , detroit s jerry stackhouse and charlotte s eddie jones , all in the past week if it is fatigue , it s something he 'll have to fight through , because allan will be playing big minutes , van gundy said and the guys he s against are playing big minutes allan is as good at shooting and scoring as anybody , but the thing that is going to elevate him to where he wants to be is rebounding , defense and passing some games , he does that very well he 'll get seven rebounds one game then i want to know why he gets two over the four previous games next to houston , latrell sprewell has been streaky and prone to mindless hiccups on defense marcus camby has been brilliant on the boards one night and has vanished beneath foul trouble the next and no one on the team , particularly the point guards , seems able to contain his man the hornets , emotionally frayed in the aftermath of bobby phills s death , managed to zip right by knick defenders , who reacted by reaching in to foul over the last two games , the knicks have gone to the freethrow line 21 times , while their opponents have had 78 attempts on wednesday , the pistons had 39 freethrow attempts to the knicks' 9 revealing one of their more glaring weaknesses , the knicks have n't been quick enough to keep players like hill in front of them and when the knicks do help out on defense , they are slow to get back with the knicks , you never know , and that inconsistency is what bothers van gundy the most his team is 2214 a nice record but to him the knicks have played far below their potential most of the season when you 're on the floor , you play hard and you play together , van gundy said charlotte had a good excuse not that our players and staff did n't feel for bobby phills and his family , but i did n't think it had any impact on how we went out there it s been like this for a while now some guys play hard and focused and good others do n't my point is , when do we cut off the excuses \? in the preseason , it was because it was training camp 'well , it s no big deal that we 're not focused' then , at the start of the season , it was because we had injuries and then , 'well , we 're not good in backtoback games because it s really hard' enough already ! you know what , we 're 36 games into the year let s just play every night it s not that hard play together and hustle rebounds perhaps resting his bad back , larry johnson asked out of practice sunday but was expected to play against detroit after saturday s game , chris childs was spotted embracing charlotte s david wesley , who the police have said was racing with bobby phills before he lost control of his porsche and died wednesday david and i have been friends for a long time , childs said sunday i just told him to stay strong for bobby , and that i loved him
one of the most interesting points in philip glass s symphony no 5 or , to be fair , the single interesting point came right at the end the work was receiving its north american premiere at the brooklyn academy of music on wednesday evening , with dennis russell davies conducting the brooklyn philharmonic , the dessoff choirs and the brooklyn youth chorus , and for more than an hour and a half it had been supplying the composer s usual earnest musical rudiments to clothe sacred writings from around the world in a 12part history of the cosmos when space turned around , the earth heated didadidadidadida let the day perish wherein i was born didadidadidadida may i be a protector for those without one didadidadidadida always the same oscillation in the orchestra , sometimes faster , sometimes slower , with scales that might go up or down , or , as a surprise , up and down in the same phrase always , too , the same solemn chanting , whether from the choir or from the soloists \( kimberly e jones , milagro vargas , john mcveigh , andre solomonglover and stephan macleod \) and always , in addition , a deadening uniformity in the orchestration , with the threat or actuality of a broadwaystyle overwhelming of the strings by brass , keyboards and percussion given that the symphony , in 12 movements , summarized the entirety of creation and human life , the homogeneity that was also found in the musical invention was perplexing dedication of merit the last movement , a buddhist prayer for peace to emanate from virtue did not sound so different from the creation of sentient beings \( the fourth movement \) or , indeed , from most of the rest moments of difference stood out all the more one came at the start of the seventh movement , suffering , where the bass soloist took a theme from the psalms my god , my god , why have you forsaken me \? and suddenly started to sound as if he meant it the pathos was unwarranted and thereby sentimental there was another exceptional passage at the start of a setting from the tibetan book of the dead in the 10th movement , judgment and apocalypse the noisome moral that you are suffering comes from your own actions it is not due to anybody else was set as a jolly round , which was the only instance of counterpoint in the entire work admittedly it did not last long , but still yet another unusual idea was the violence in the middle of the evil and ignorance movement , underlined by matthew frey s lighting \( a swinging white box \) , which was inventive and beautiful throughout but none of these was the moment that counted what mattered was that right at the end , with an emphatic conclusion in sight , mr glass drew back , took his music into darker , more chromatic territory , had his choir reenter in moaning disconsolateness , and only then moved toward his close irony is not his strong point , but here it seemed that he was , within his own work , undercutting its preposterous pretensions photo dennis russell davies leads the brooklyn philharmonic , dessof choirs and brooklyn youth chorus in a premiere of glass s symphony no 5 \( stephanie berger for the new york times \)
for just a few seconds , the lights went out in new york city yesterday at 5 07 pm on a bustling friday , office lights , elevators and computer screens all went dark for many , the power interruption was only a momentary flickering , but in the subways the impact rippled through the system , as disabled signal lights brought whole lines to a halt at the height of the evening rush tens of thousands of commuters were left stranded on trains , while platforms quickly became overcrowded with homebound commuters as it turned out , consolidated edison company said , the problem was traced to three electrical lines on a network in westchester county that just happen to power the entire city the lines mysteriously shorted out , causing a systemwide dip in voltage each of those lines two overhead , and one underground feeder that con edison shares with the long island power authority carries 345 , 000 volts of electricity , said mike clendenin , a con edison spokesman almost as quickly as they went out , the lights and power were back on , according to con edison it was only a momentary problem , mr clendenin said the system is design to to handle this kind of situation but for commuters , the impact was not so fleeting scott ellis , a financial consultant traveling from the flatiron district to a friend s home in midtown by way of the lexington avenue line , said that his crowded train abruptly came to a halt somewhere in the darkness of the tunnel north of east 23rd street the lights flashed out , back on and then out again , he said after getting off the train at grand central terminal we were packed no one knew what was going on , not even the train conductor mr ellis and other passengers said they sat quietly in the pitchblack train , save for some friendly chatting , for minutes before the mood began to shift after lights came back on janice perlin , a lawyer who boarded a no 6 train near city hall , said it suddenly stopped somewhere near union square everybody was frustrated , she said the lights were on , but none of the trains were moving it appeared that commuters on the 1 , 2 , 3 and 9 trains on the west side were most affected melissa farley , a new york city transit spokeswoman , said the problem appeared more severe to subway commuters because the incident occurred during a friday rush hour in december the signals went dark briefly and there was crowding at station because of the busy holiday season , she said but i would in no way use the word pandemonium the power was out for only two seconds she said trains were moving again , though noticeably slower than usual , within minutes it takes time , minutes , to get trains that were stopped during a peak time back moving again , ms farley said the voltage dip was felt throughout the city at police headquarters , a spokesman said , the lights flickered here too , but we did n't get any reports of problems or injuries by 7 pm , mr clendenin said , the two overhead power lines were functioning properly again he said the underground line , which con edison shares with the long island power authority , was still out michael lowndes , a spokesman for the power authority , pinpointed the problem to sands point , on the north shore of long island , but said it was unclear what caused the incident he said that as workers were digging at the site of the underground line , they found a spill of dielectric fluid , a nontoxic insulation and cooling oil used on large electrical conducting lines , and were cleaning it up fortunately , it s not dangerous , but it s messy , he said con edison also was uncertain about what caused the moment of darkness mr clendenin compared it to a similar incident that occurred in july , when a tree branch apparently strayed too close to a 345 , 000volt transmission line in the dunwoodie section of yonkers , causing that line to send the electricity into the tree that incident happened at noon and snarled subway service for roughly two hours it also drew stern criticism from mayor rudolph w giuliani , because it happened at a time when the utility was already facing criticism for a smallscale power disruption on the upper east side the mayor held a press conference on yesterday s incident as well , but only to announce that problem appeared under control mr clendenin said none of con edison s three million customers in new york city and westchester county were severely affected by the yesterday s twosecond disruption it really was just brief voltage dip , he said photo a power loss disabled some subway signals yesterday , bringing trains to a halt and delaying commuters \( frances roberts for the new york times \)

dover , england , june 22 the dutch driver of a truck that became the sealed tomb of 58 illegal chinese immigrants packed into its airtight container was charged today with manslaughter , the police said a spokesman for the kent police , mark pugash , said that the driver , perry wacker of rotterdam , will be arraigned on 58 charges of manslaughter or unlawful killing when he appears in court on friday the driver , 32 , has been held since the suffocated corpses of the young immigrants were found early monday piled in the rear of his truck mr wacker was also charged with trying to bring the victims into the country and with facilitating the entry into britain of two survivors , who have been hospitalized and are being questioned by the police his truck had made a fivehour ferry crossing from the belgian port of zeebrugge in unseasonable heat the severity of the charges appeared to reflect the outrage in britain and throughout the european union over a case that has highlighted the unease generated by immigration european states are deeply uncertain whether to view young immigrants as a burden or a potential benefit to their aging societies because legal immigration into states of the european union is almost impossible for unskilled workers , and not easy even for the skilled , growing numbers try to enter illegally and then seek asylum this seems to have been the goal of the 60 chinese people packed in the truck , most of whom were in their 20 s and had apparently traveled overland from china s southern fujian province , the police said the global reality now is that you cannot stop people from poorer countries aspiring for life in richer countries , said tan wahpiow , a londonbased lawyer who deals with asylum cases that is what drives these people from fujian but people in european states are not ready to confront this reality mr tan has become involved in the case because four days after the discovery of the deaths , none of the victims has been identified he said he was outraged by this failure and contended that it reflected the refusal of british authorities to guarantee that any chinese relatives of the dead who come forward will be granted amnesty it appears that these relatives may themselves be in england illegally and are afraid to present themselves to the authorities for fear of detention or even expulsion those seeking asylum routinely destroy all their documents , so the dead are thought to have had no identification on them mr pugash hinted in a radio interview today that any relatives would be treated with understanding , but he declined to offer any guarantees of immunity we have said from the beginning that we will welcome anyone with any information , he said we will treat them sympathetically asylum status is not an issue for us britain s labor government , under strong pressure to stem a rising flow of immigration widely seen as placing unacceptable strain on the welfare state , tightened its asylum laws earlier this year in 1999 , more than 70 , 000 people applied for asylum , compared to about 5 , 000 before the berlin wall fell in 1989 the kent police have arrested two other people a chinese man and woman in connection with the case the dutch police have arrested arie van der spek , 24 , who lived at the address listed for the company registered as the owner the truck , and one other man the case has also acquired a belgian dimension the police there are holding three asian men arrested in april in connection with the illegal presence of a large group of chinese immigrants in two villages it is not yet clear whether these chinese citizens , who were detained by belgian authorities and then put unescorted on a train to antwerp , are the same group that later died in the back of mr wacker s truck the british police are examining fingerprints of the group made by the belgian police two months ago relations between belgium and britain have been strained over the way the chinese were treated , with belgian ministers curtly rebuffing british suggestions that the arrest and subsequent release of the group made little sense these bitter exchanges have illustrated the fact that the 15 nations of the european union have no common policy on immigration or asylum some , like belgium and germany , are members of the socalled schengen area , a group of states that have effectively dismantled the borders between them others , like britain , are not china today called for tighter controls on immigration , suggesting some european countries were too lax it is worth noting that criminal groups usually use legal loopholes in some countries to organize secret passages , said zhu bangzao , a foreign ministry spokesman countries concerned should coordinate efforts and crack down severely on these crimes photo human rights campaigners paid their respects yesterday in the belgian port city zeebrugge , where a truck secretly carrying 60 chinese left for dover ,

as we reset the great clock , new technologies are appearing by the minute some filmmakers who have worked in the medium believe that largeformat 3d is the wave of the cinematic future the next click , in the words of brett leonard , director of trex back to the cretaceous , a 1998 film that has become the most popular largeformat title to date from this viewer s perspective , however , largeformat 3d looks to be something more interesting than that , as distinct from conventional cinema as symphonies from opera or poetry from prose fiction , with a potential for greatness all its own beginning with we are born stars , an 11minute history of the universe created for the fujitsu pavilion at expo '85 in japan , the largeformat 3d catalog now numbers 16 main attractions apart from christine edzard s imax nutcracker \( 1997 \) , a nonsinging , nondancing holiday treat to rival madame tussaud s \( based on the same e t a hoffmann tale that inspired tchaikovsky \) , each of them springs surprises inconceivable in any other form runaway blobs of paint caroming through space \( roman kroitor and peter stephenson s lighterthanair cartoon paint misbehavin' , 1997 \) a sky that hangs overhead not like a dome but like the lid of an azure box , painted with clouds \( mr leonard s siegfried roy the magic box , 1999 \) spherical holograms and luminous technical displays that glow in midair \( allan kroeker s l5 first city in space , 1996 \) beyond image or point of view , what gives these moments their charge is the sensation of physical presence stereoscopic photography , the technical heart of the medium , supplies two slightly shifted flat perspectives of each image , one for each eye still or moving , it has a long history but the largeformat cinematic variety takes a quantum leap associated with the imax corporation , a torontobased company that developed all aspects of the system from cameras and sound to its proprietary projectors and theater design , largeformat 3d has been picked up by producers including sony pictures classics , lsquared entertainment and mandalay media arts it s not your parents' 3d ! trumpets the trailer for ben stassen s encounter in the third dimension , which opened last year beneath the cloak of zany escapism , the film incorporates a casual survey of 3d from its tentative beginnings to the present day we see the very first , very brief threedimensional film clip , l'arrivee du train , shot by the lumiere brothers in black and white in paris in 1903 for original audiences , we are told , the illusion of an oncoming train was so potent that they ran panicstricken from the theater the chronicle continues with stereoscopic images wittily including people in exotic dress and faroff lands gazing through stereoscopes at other stereoscopic images vintage horror hokum from midcentury gets an airing , too mr stassen s original material features a dizzy supporting cast of gadgets with a life of their own , a mad scientist and elvira , the bouncy morticia addamstype cult personality , who is imprisoned in two dimensions for those who miss the point , her little song and dance about a haunted house is frozen in midphrase , someone gives her a push and she falls over a cardboard cutout thus mr stassen makes a joke of a glitch attentive viewers may occasionally be troubled by elsewhere in the largeformat 3d canon the illusion of depth without the illusion of roundness and solidity ghosting can be a problem too , not to mention the spacey phenomenon of bodies that look round but empty , like soap bubbles as mr stassen shows , a flaw consciously exploited ceases to be a flaw in what may be his wildest flourish of dropdead bravura , he presents a pretitle sequence behind the movie screen , which hangs there like a dusty windshield then the words of the title appear , blasting through one flying letter at a time , shattering the screen and leaving the view crystalclear ok , the imax variety is n't your parents' 3d what is it \?

in 1939 the composer paul hindemith visited hollywood , full of enthusiasm for walt disney s first fulllength cartoon feature , snow white and the seven dwarfs hindemith headed for the studio in which disney and leopold stokowski were working on the second fulllength cartoon feature , fantasia but its cartoon renderings of bach and beethoven repulsed hindemith he thought the new medium was being abused by philistines hindemith s highbrow condemnation was shortsighted it was the disneystokowski melange of longhair and mickey mouse that was prescient fantasia , completed in 1940 , proved at least as enduring as anything hindemith composed on settling in the united states in the same year disney lavished 23 million on fantasia for its new york premiere , the broadway theater was equipped with 90 speakers to convey stokowski s philadelphia orchestra in fantasound an early form of stereo special engagements were booked coast to coast time magazine ran a cover story but fantasia was a financial disaster , and \( to stokowski s dismay \) disney scuttled plans for a sequel yet fantasia lived on reissued in 1956 , it turned a profit the home video release , in 1991 , was a bestseller and now disney s nephew , roy disney , has created fantasia 2000 , a second animated classical music medley previewed at carnegie hall last month , it has just opened at imax theaters a general theatrical release is being considered for june no one today would demand the highculture pedigree hindemith looked for 60 years ago but what to look for instead \?

it seems that it was only yesterday actually , it was two days ago when dick vermeil was still the coach of the super bowl champion st louis rams he was operating on no sleep , gearing up for the flight home and the giddiness of the victory parade , but there was also the feeling of a relatively sane 63yearold man taking a last look around somebody who knew vermeil when he was a crazed middleaged coach asked him if he had ever fulfilled his dream of going back to his ancestral home in france vermeil replied that he might do it , since his wife had taken french lessons he sounded like a man who was about to get a life what else do you have to prove \? asked his wife of 44 years , carol vermeil it was a good point , even with nearly 4 million left in the final two years of his contract yesterday , with the roar of the super bowl still in his ears , dick vermeil announced he was leaving the rams it was better than getting fired , which had been an option going into this past season not many coaches can say they went out as world champions i feel good about it , vermeil said , with a characteristic sob there is something to be said for quitting on top john wooden won his 10th college basketball title in 12 years with ucla in 1975 and he retired red auerbach won his ninth title with the boston celtics in 1966 before turning the team over to bill russell , who had something to do with all nine , to be sure and vince lombardi won three straight championships , including two that were retroactively labeled super bowls , before retiring from the green bay packers in 1968 none cited burnout , as vermeil did when he left the philadelphia eagles in 1983 they had just done it long enough sometimes coaches come back lombardi tried it again with the washington redskins until cancer cut him down phil jackson , who retired along with michael jordan after the 1998 championship , is back in los angeles after a mindclearing sabbatical but vermeil does not expect to be back he confessed that in some ways the game had passed him by after winning nine games in his first two years with the rams , he was literally forced to hire an offensive coordinator , mike martz , who replaces him athletes also retire near the peak of their game just the other day in atlanta , three men who could still be making respective tons of money announced the formation of some new company john elway had won two super bowls and retired jordan had made a jump shot to win the national basketball association championship and wayne gretzky still had the touch if not the statistics in his last years with the rangers some of the great ones quit on top jim brown led the league in rushing and limped off the field for good he said he had done everything he wanted and could make as much money in action movies as getting whacked by linebackers ted williams , after coming back from injuries and military hitches , hit a homer into the gale in fenway park and never even bothered to come down to yankee stadium for the final weekend of 1960 sandy koufax was a great pitcher in 1966 , but he quit because he did n't want his arthritic left arm to fall off jackie robinson was aging rapidly , but he chose to quit as a brooklyn dodger rather than accept a trade to the hated new york giants three tennis players named chris , martina and steffi all quit near the top because being a quarterfinalist was just not in their selfimages and secretariat won the triple crown and retired , although not by his choice , to the breeding shed , at which he was spectacularly ineffective rocky marciano , as frugal as he was , retired undefeated as a championship boxer the unappealing alternative was joe frazier , battered in a gift draw with one jumbo cummings , and muhammad ali , barely able to shuffle , bombarded by trevor berbick in their last fights there is no law against a 300 hitter dwindling down to a 250 hitter not at the outrageous sevendigit salaries but timely retirements have a certain mystique to them jim brown still looks as if he could get you a first down , inside the tackles , anyway and michael jordan , who retired once already , is currently the best player in the washington wizard scrimmages do n't hold michael to anything , but dick vermeil sounded as if he meant it
tampa , fla , feb 23 darryl strawberry loped around the outfield here this morning , joking with teammates , fielding fly balls and grounders for one more hour , he was a baseball player but while strawberry waited for his turn in batting practice , he was ordered to leave the yankees' spring training workout , under a directive relayed from commissioner bud selig s office , which is close to concluding an investigation of strawberry s most recent failed drug test strawberry quietly walked off the field through a back exit , unnoticed by fans , in what may have been his last appearance in major league baseball strawberry and his wife , charisse strawberry , met tuesday with selig and robert dupuy , a highranking baseball lawyer baseball officials say selig is considering suspending the slugger for at least a year , for testing positive for cocaine jan 19 the decision may come thursday or friday , or perhaps at the beginning of next week selig , who would not comment on the case today , suspended strawberry for 60 days after his first failed drug test in 1995 , and last year , strawberry received a 120day suspension after he pleaded no contest to charges of possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution selig felt he was being lenient in handing down the 120day sentence , according to others in major league baseball , because strawberry was still being treated for colon cancer at the time of his offense without such mitigating circumstances in place this time , strawberry is in greater jeopardy strawberry , sentenced to 18 months of probation last may 26 for his arrest on cocaine possession and drug solicitation , does not face further legal consequences for failing the drug test that was administered on jan 19 shelley tomlinson , a probation specialist for the state of florida , recommended that strawberry undergo further evaluation , testing and treatment , and a judge has agreed with that recommendation major league baseball administered the january drug test that strawberry flunked , according to two officials with the state of florida in compliance with the terms of strawberry s probation , they then reported the results to the state s department of corrections baseball officials say that in the aftermath of the failed test , selig s office waited for the corrections report , and that once it was filed on feb 8 , major league baseball intensified its own investigation strawberry is a repeat offender of baseball s drug aftercare program , and he is not contesting the result of the drug test , according to joe papy , a regional director for the department of corrections we have a positive result , papy said today he s admitted to using cocaine george steinbrenner , the yankees' owner , lives in tampa and is wellconnected here but today he said he did not know of strawberry s latest troubles until monday , when the player and his wife met him in his office here at legends field the strawberrys , steinbrenner said , were remorseful , very , very sad charisse strawberry is five months pregnant with the couple s third child , the fifth child fathered by the player they came up because he wanted me to know , steinbrenner said i feel for the kid strawberry and his wife met with selig in milwaukee tuesday afternoon , and in the meeting selig assured strawberry that his purpose was not solely to punish people , but to help them strawberry then left selig s office feeling somewhat hopeful about his situation , according to a baseball official strawberry also thought selig gave him approval to resume his workouts until a ruling is handed down the story of strawberry s positive drug test broke tuesday evening , and yankee officials were not sure whether he would be allowed to practice in the team s first fullsquad workout today as strawberry drove to legends field this morning , manager joe torre called him initially , their conversation was awkward , but they agreed that as long as strawberry was going to be at the park to meet with the news media , he might as well work out many of his teammates learned tuesday evening about strawberry s failed test david cone was called by a friend from new york , derek jeter heard from another patron in a restaurant and tino martinez saw a report on the local news the players who had spoken with strawberry in recent weeks said they had no inkling of his relapse and reiterated their support for him it just shows you what the effect of drugs can do , jeter said there were no blank stares , no one overcome by emotion some of the players spoke with reporters before seamlessly making the transition into the usual clubhouse banter with teammates strawberry appeared on the field briefly to speak with reporters , his eyes red he had just met with torre , and his lower lip was quivering slightly i came here today because this is where i feel i want to be , he said , declining to elaborate on his situation he then returned to the clubhouse , and after cone and bernie williams and others greeted him with hugs , strawberry pulled on his uniform , the yankeeblue jersey with no 39 when torre began the yankees' team meeting , strawberry addressed the team briefly , his tone light , but he acknowledged his trouble i need your support , he said
albuquerque , aug 17 an fbi agent admitted in federal court here today that he had provided inaccurate testimony last december on a critical point that made a los alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets appear deceptive when he had not been the issue is crucial because the government has successfully argued since last december that the scientist , wen ho lee , be held without bail in part because his pattern of deceptions , along with the fact that computer tapes containing a vast amount of nuclear secrets remain unaccounted for , suggested he was a major threat to national security in his written decision denying bail last december , the federal judge , james a parker , cited dr lee s deeply troubling deceptions dr lee is trying for bail a third time , and the government is now acknowledging what amounts to misleading testimony dr lee is the first person to be accused under the specific atomic energy statute cited in his 59count indictment , and a growing number of asianamericans and civil rights advocates have rallied to his side , saying he was singled out at least in part because of his chinese ancestry robert a messemer , an fbi supervisory special agent , had said under oath last december that when dr lee improperly downloaded weapons secrets six years ago onto portable computer tapes he lied to a colleague , kuokmee ling , in order to get permission to use dr ling s computer mr messemer testified that dr lee told dr ling that he was just going to download a resume , which was not true but since then , dr lee s defense lawyers have gained access to dr ling s previous grand jury testimony , and it does not mention dr lee speaking of a resume mr messemer today acknowledged that he had made an honest error on this critical point in his december testimony at no time did i intentionally provide false testimony , he said i made a simple inadvertent error mr messemer insisted that , in other areas , dr lee had indeed been deceptive there were , however , several other instances in which the defense appeared to show that the government had misled the judge in describing dr lee s supposed deceptions mr messemer had testified at the december bail hearing that dr lee had not disclosed certain contacts with chinese scientists during officially sanctioned , professional visits to beijing in the 1980 s but the defense lawyers have since obtained a report dr lee filed after a 1986 trip in which he listed seven chinese scientists with whom he had spoken mr messemer also acknowledged that , though dr lee had clearly disclosed the contacts , he was never subsequently questioned about them mr messemer also disclosed that he had never consulted dr lee s trip report before testifying in december he still maintained that dr lee had been deceptive because he had not been open about the full nature and scope of his contacts the government contends that until dr lee faced questioning a year ago , he failed to report a highly suspicious meeting with a chinese scientist in his hotel room in a 1988 visit the government also insists that dr lee s downloading of the huge library of weapons secrets was itself a deliberate act of deception that took more than 40 hours of computer time and that he had knowingly violated rules on the handling of classified data none of the statements in court here today or yesterday appeared decisive the government presented weapons experts who insisted that dr lee s downloading was unprecedented and a grave threat to national security because the data , in hostile hands , could alter the global balance of power the defense offered its own experts who insisted that most of the information was already public and that its usefulness to another country was extremely limited in one tense exchange , paul robinson , the president of the sandia national laboratories and a witness for the prosecution , said that one defense expert , harold m agnew , a former director of the los alamos national laboratory , had simply not understood the information dr lee downloaded or had not understood the threat posed by dr lee s actions dr agnew fired off a written affidavit to the court yesterday in response to that testimony , saying , what paul said is a bunch of bull , and then rebuted parts of dr robinson s testimony in two other areas today , defense lawyers tried to show that government witnesses had provided misleading evidence in december mr messemer had said dr lee failed to disclose correspondence with some chinese scientists , saying he had only exchanged christmas cards today , one of dr lee s lawyers , mark holscher , produced a transcript of an interview with dr lee and the fbi on march 5 , 1999 , in which dr lee did discuss correspondence with the chinese scientists in addition , mr messemer said in december that in the search of dr lee s home , the fbi had found letters that dr lee had sent to several foreign scientific institutes seeking a job the prosecution has said in previous filings that they believe the principal reason dr lee improperly downloaded the nuclear secrets was to enhance his job prospects with the foreign institutes but under questioning , mr messemer acknowledged today that the fbi had found some letters but had no evidence they were either mailed or received by the foreign institutions , which were in countries like australia , france , singapore and switzerland the bail hearing will resume on friday judge parker has allowed the examinations and crossexaminations of the witnesses , much of it in closed sessions because it involved classified information , to go on far longer than is usual at bail hearings
belfast , northern ireland , july 10 the protestant orange order succeeded in practically shutting down northern ireland today cities and villages turned into ghost towns with only army and police vehicles moving about the streets the summons to paralyze ulster came from the chapter of the order in portadown , county armagh , which was angered at being barred from parading on sunday down an avenue running through a catholic neighborhood after annual commemorative services at drumcree church the militants were already vehemently opposed to the new powersharing catholicprotestant government in recent years , the parade has been the flash point for firebombings in the town center , riots on the hillside at whose crest stands the unadorned , 18th century drumcree church , and for widespread disruptions across the province with the violence of the past week , protestant church leaders and some orange order senior officers have criticized the portadown lodge for leaving the organization open to the charge of fomenting disorder but but harold gracey , 63 , the group s district master , has refused to condemn the violence and has urged members to continue taking to the streets eight straight nights of violence across the province have brought a familiar tension back to life , and the motivation for businesses closing at midday could have reflected the fear of being caught up in the protests as much as of showing support for the militants public transportation halted early to forestall bus hijackings and burnings , and people were seen running through downtown streets to make their homebound connections before midafternoon intimidation also was a factor in clearing the streets neighbors of a municipal pool operator in portadown said he had received telephone calls warning that if there were any cars in his parking lot by 3 pm , he would be burned out at a time when the protestant community is increasingly fractious and insecure , many people have been unnerved by the presence at demonstrations of johnny adair , known as mad dog , a recently released paramilitary leader with a shaved head , muscular bearing and coldeyed glower his group , the ulster freedom fighters , is held responsible in a new book called lost lives for the killings of more than 400 people , most of them catholic civilians , over the past 30 years the police suspect that some of the nighttime disorder is being coordinated by protestant paramilitary groups , which , although on ceasefire , have the capability to send marauding youths and masked members into the streets adding to the volatility , protestant paramilitaries are themselves at loggerheads , with one group , the ulster volunteer force , accusing the ulster freedom fighters of being behind gun attacks last week against officers of the province s police force , the royal ulster constabulary at highway junctures across ulster , some of the 80 , 000 orange order members , their wives and children gathered in milling groups to shut down traffic roadblocks of hastily nailedtogether wooden slats were thrown up on city corners during the declared 4 to 8 pm protest period and then set on fire once darkness fell demonstrators surged at police lines and shouted abuse at officers in various towns , but while daylight held , there were none of the car burnings and firebombings of recent nights police reported skirmishes with protesters in portadown and drumcree throwing rocks and bottles at officers who responded with water cannons david trimble , the first minister of the new northern ireland assembly and leader of the largest protestant party , the ulster unionists , appealed for calm , saying that anyone resorting to violence would dishonor and disgrace the cause they profess to support mr trimble , once a portadown orange order marcher himself , is a pariah with the organization now , since it is vehemently opposed to the new government he heads the government was set up by the april , 1998 peace accord that was aimed at putting an end to three decades of sectarian struggles that have cost more than 3 , 600 lives mr trimble has barely kept his leadership of the ulster unionists in two recent votes that have exposed yet another fissure in the protestant ranks between moderates and hardliners the portadown orangemen said they were staging their shutdown of the province to persuade the governmentappointed parades commission to reverse its decision to bar them from marching down the garvaghy road , a thoroughfare into town lined on either side by catholic housing blocks but peter mandelson , britain s northern ireland secretary , said that every stone , every missile , every petrol bomb will militate against that goal mr mandelson said he firmly backed the commission s declaration that the only way for the portadown orangemen to march down the garvaghy road was to enter into dialogue with the people living along it the portadown lodge members have refused to speak directly to the residents or to meet with members of the parades commission this was the third straight year that the panel had ruled against the portadown orangemen portadown is known as the protestant citadel because the orange order was founded there in 1795 , and the parade from the downtown lodge hall out dungannon street to drumcree and then back along the garvaghy road dates from 1807 there are 2 , 500 protestant parades that go off without incident in northern ireland each summer they mark epochal protestant moments like the battle of the boyne in 1690 , when william of orange , the king of england , overcame his catholic rival , james ii protestants consider them proud expressions of their culture catholics complain that they are reminders of the supremacy protestants long held over them here photo the shankill road area near the center of belfast was almost deserted during rush hour yesterday after businesses closed for fear of violence \(

as brainstorming police chiefs , speaking from multiple video monitors , grill a precinct commander about a rising burglary rate down the hall , at a mock crime scene , visitors examine the broken glass , forgotten crowbar and grimy carpet of an apartment where there has been a burglary to test their analytical skills against those of veteran detectives and around the corner they pause at a wall of tributes to several of the 580 new york city officers who have died in the line of duty with interactive exhibits , computer simulations , vintage uniforms and antique badges , the new york city police museum , which officially opened last week on lower broadway in manhattan , presents a multifaceted view of the rigorous , clearly dangerous , at times political and often tedious life of a police officer some historians who visited the museum said they felt the exhibits were too sunny in their depiction of the police but the museum , which is privately run with city support , sees its mission differently to preserve artifacts of new york police department history , to educate people about the history and sacrifice of police work and to correct what some police officials say are distortions in the portrayal of the police by members of the media fascinated by the sensational or scandalous the museum , police commissioner howard safir said at its opening on wednesday , will show young people and the citizens of the city what the nypd really does , not as it s shown in tv shows or the movies the real story , mr safir said , is that police officers do n't join the force for adventure , they join it for service the opening of the museum comes as police officials are striving to focus attention on the recent achievements of the department , including a historic reduction in crime , that have been overshadowed often in the last year by accusations of brutality and racial insensitivity rising out of the fatal shooting of amadou diallo and the torture of abner louima residents and tourists alike will now have a place they can go to find out the real stories behind the best police department in the world , mr safir said in a prepared statement one story , however , they will not see is that of frank serpico , the officer whose revelations about police payoffs led to the knapp commission hearings in 1970 similarly , there is no mention of the 1930 seabury investigation into widespread organizedcrime payoffs to politicians and the police it is a puff piece , a selfdelivered valentine , said mike wallace , a historian and a coauthor of gotham a history of new york city to 1898 \( oxford , 1998 \) , a pulitzer prizewinning book that devotes many of its pages to the story of the police in new york mr wallace said he believed the police museum was obligated to treat its subject matter in a more complex fashion that paid attention to all sides of a story if you are interested in raising some important questions about the history of the police , this is not the place to get it , he said another historian , however , said that museums of this type often avoid airing any dirty laundry the fire museum in new york , for example , does not chronicle blunders that might have led to firefighter deaths , nor does the transit museum catalog fatal subway accidents you have to look at what are your expectations when dealing with a police museum that is sponsored by a municipality , said andrew darien , a historian who was associate curator of new york s finest , an exhibit about the police at the newyork historical society in 1998 i have been to many police museums and none of them deal with what you and i may think are historical questions about substantive issues a spokesman for the police museum , steven rubenstein , said its curators were interested in presenting a variety of material but were hampered by limited space they could not address everything , he said but the museum is considering rotating exhibits that may touch on issues of corruption as well as efforts by the internal affairs bureau to combat it , he said the drive for a new museum was spearheaded by carol safir , the commissioner s wife , who serves as the unpaid president of its board replacing a dusty , cramped gallery at the police academy on east 20th street , the museum , which is open daily and free with a suggested donation , occupies 10 , 000 square feet on the second floor of the old cunard building at 25 broadway there is even enough room to display a 1972 policepackage plymouth fury from an era when patrol cars were still green and black among the flourishes of modern museum craftsmanship are time lines that track more than just events one , for example , shows that the ratio of officers to citizens today \( 1 for every 200 \) is far different from the ratio in 1734 , when there was only 1 constable for every 833 new yorkers
for months a young woman had been flirting with george w bush , resulting in a cash bet among coworkers about whether they would end up having an affair and now the flirtation had provoked a crisis mr bush had told the woman off , humiliating her , and a top campaign official stormed into his office and rebuked him she s hurt , the official scolded , glaring down at mr bush you really hurt her good , good , mr bush replied icily from his chair i'm a married man i'm glad she got the signal it was the end of 1987 in washington , in the decrepit eighthfloor headquarters of vice president george bush s presidential campaign doug wead , then a campaign worker who happened to be in george w s office talking to him when the confrontation occurred , recalled the episode , along with a senior campaign official who also witnessed it mr bush , who had moved to washington to help his father s campaign , even asked mr wead to stick by when they were on the road and to stay with him in his hotel room until late at night , mr wead said the aim was to fend off the woman , whose seductive energies mr bush valued so long as they were directed at voters he wanted everyone to know that nothing was happening , mr wead said george w bush was getting a firstrate political education , and proving his skill in maneuvering through an often treacherous electoral world he describes himself in those days as having been a warrior for george bush , and he became a singleminded one , constantly and sometimes rudely driving home the sole goal of getting his father into the white house he learned the importance of a disciplined , loyal and tightly focused campaign he made sure that campaign officials would be distracted neither by hormones nor by the opportunity to become media stars and as he got his first real taste of national politics , mr bush found that he loved it and was good at it he also learned from a master strategist , lee atwater , how to woo baby boomers and destroy opponents yet one paradox stands out mr bush immersed himself back then in the practice of national politics while remaining largely oblivious to its substance some people get into politics because they feel passionately about certain issues mr bush s passion in the 1988 campaign was for his father my motivation was , he s been a great dad , he told reporters recently , speaking of the 1988 and 1992 campaigns he pushed no particular agenda , and no one seems to recall instances when , of his own volition , he pressed for one policy or another likewise , the correspondence between father and son during the bush presidency , obtained from the bush presidential library through the freedom of information act , turns up plenty of times when george w asked his father to send autographs to texas friends or even to consider particular people for federal jobs but virtually none in which he suggests that his father take a particular position on an issue all of this paints mr bush not as a political chameleon , exactly , but at least as an ad hoc decisionmaker who lacks bedrock passions like president ronald reagan , mr bush is an amiable leader with tremendous communication skills and limited interest in policy details , but mr reagan had a clearly defined ideology he stood for something mr bush comes across as far more flexible in his beliefs , and it is much less clear what he stands for the upshot is that mr bush , in that first encounter with national politics , proved immensely talented at steering his ship to avoid shoals and rough seas , while keeping the passengers content but he sometimes seemed less concerned with precisely where the ship of state was headed escape from a drying well george w bush was drawn into politics in part by his failings as a businessman he has sometimes portrayed his year and a half on his father s presidential campaign , in 1987 and 1988 , as simply a bid to help his father , and there is something to that but he had not been active in his father s unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1980 the difference may be that in the runup to 1988 , oil prices had collapsed mr bush s oil company in midland , tex , had been acquired by a larger concern , leaving him with a fancy salary as a consultant but no company to run so he accepted a standing invitation from mr atwater to join his father s presidential campaign republican campaign officials were nervous in april 1987 when mr bush settled in a town house on massachusetts avenue and began working in the ratty bush headquarters at 733 15th street nw in washington he would sit in his bare office , door always open , his cowboybooted feet on his desk , a wad of tobacco under his lip and a plastic foam cup in his hand as his spittoon the general rule of the campaign staff is to keep as far away from the candidate s family as possible , said james pinkerton , who had an office across the hall from mr bush s you can never win you can never be as respectful as you need to be , you can never work as hard as you should but mr pinkerton and others said they quickly warmed to junior , as he was called
the worstcase scenario that quarterback kerry collins and the giants' coaching staff feared saturday night did not materialize yesterday tests on pete mitchell did not reveal a seasonending injury , but the giants' only experienced passcatching tight end will be out of action for the sept 3 opener against the arizona cardinals , and possibly longer mitchell severely sprained his left knee in the giants' 208 loss to the bears on saturday at giants stadium an mri yesterday ruled out a torn anterior cruciate ligament , an injury that would have ended mitchell s season after speaking with doctors , giants coach jim fassel would not put a timetable on mitchell s return , saying only that the tight end would miss at least the opener fassel preferred to wait until mitchell has more tests before making a definitive statement , but the coach did not rule out an extended absence yesterday s exam did not show any significant ligament tears but mitchell will undergo a cat scan today on his knee i would say right now the only procedure that would be under consideration would be a scope , fassel said in a conference call , referring to possible arthroscopic surgery such a procedure would be used partly to examine the knee , but fassel did not believe it would reveal further damage that would require a more serious operation with little depth , the giants dreaded any type of injury saturday but while fassel maintained he was pleased with the firstteam offense s ability to drive the field in the first half despite not scoring a touchdown , he was less optimistic when it came to replacing mitchell that injury could have a harrowing domino effect on the rest of the offense as the only proven pass catcher among the team s tight ends , mitchell was a key component to the giants' revamped offense under the new coordinator , sean payton fassel said mitchell s injury would not scale back the giants' ambitious plans of opening up the passing game there 'll just be another guy doing it , fassel said as far as dropping anything , no fassel discussed different candidates to fill mitchell s role temporarily , and said he did not anticipate searching outside the organization unless i get some surprising news today fassel did not even mention howard cross , the starting tight end , because cross is used strictly as a blocker beyond cross , the options on the team are running back sean bennett , tight end dan campbell and wide receiver joe jurevicius based on their resumes alone , they are not ideal replacements bennett , a secondyear back , has never played tight end he has been learning the role in practice and the giants planned to use him more as a pass catcher out of the backfield campbell , mitchell s backup , has never caught a pass in two professional seasons jurevicius is the team s third receiver and would need to be replaced there if he saw time at tight end the rookie ron dixon would then be elevated from the fourth string it s understandable why collins fretted after seeing mitchell on crutches along the sideline saturday collins , who hopes to benefit from the giants' plans to loosen their offense , said saturday it would be a blow to lose mitchell for the season extra points after one preseason game , coach jim fassel is already prepared to revamp his special teams i 'll make some changes in that group right now , fassel said after watching the bears return one kickoff for 65 yards and a punt for 50 i ca n't comprehend our coverage playing like that we showed a total lack of being able to get off a block , or we ran around blocks and opened up seams perhaps no player carried as much fanfare into saturday s game as ron dayne , last year s heisman trophy winner from wisconsin fassel was impressed with dayne in his first professional game , but said dayne also showed the hesitation of a rookie he made two guys miss where maybe in the past our guy does n't get back to the line of scrimmage , fassel said he s reading correctly , but sometimes i do n't think when he read it correctly he reacted to it as quickly as he has in the past that s something that s going to take some time dayne carried 17 times for 48 yards ron dixon , the thirdround pick out of lambuth university , did not impress anyone with his tendency to stopandgo on kick returns he s got to learn to get the ball and go upfield , fassel said there s too many people who are fast on the field fassel expected defensive end michael strahan \( back stiffness \) , defensive tackle keith hamilton \( hamstring strain \) and linebacker mike barrow \( sprained knee \) to practice today none played saturday running back joe montgomery , who also did not play , will practice lightly this week in anticipation of playing friday at jacksonville photo pete mitchell s sprained left knee is worrisome for the giants because they do n't have an experienced passcatching tight end to replace him \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
lawyers for earl washington jr , the former death row inmate who was pardoned in virginia on monday after 17 years of imprisonment , say their long struggle to prove his innocence through dna evidence was necessary because the state has the most severe limits in the nation on submitting new exculpatory evidence it is insurmountable , bob hall , a defense lawyer , said of the state s 21day limitation for submitting new evidence after conviction after that , a judge loses jurisdiction even if he feels there s been a gross miscarriage of justice acting on the results of dna testing , gov james s gilmore iii , mr washington s only recourse for appeal , granted an absolute pardon in the 1982 rape and murder of rebecca l williams , a culpeper county homemaker rebutting criticism of the 21day evidence limit , the governor s office said that mr gilmore felt that over all , the virginia criminal justice system works quite well with its recourse to executive clemency even if there was a twoyear rule , this might not accomplish what the opposition wants , while executive clemency will , said lila white , a spokeswoman for the governor mr washington s lawyers disagreed it s a sham , complained eric m freedman , a law professor at hofstra university who has been working for mr washington s cause for 15 years virginia has the lowest reversal rate in capital cases in the united states , which means either it has the best system of justice or the worst , he said , calling the 21day evidence limitation a symptom of the worst the governor is left acting in a totally distorted legal framework , mr freedman added , noting that other states , including new york and california , set no time limit for submitting new evidence earlier this year , a proposal to expand the period during which evidence could be submitted in virginia to 3 years was amended to 45 days and died in the state senate after lowerhouse passage mr washington , a 40yearold mentally retarded farmhand , remains in prison because the governor declined to recommend parole on an unrelated assault conviction that carries a 30year sentence state corrections officials said yesterday that mr washington s remaining sentence would be recalculated as soon as possible to see whether he might be eligible for parole now mr washington s lawyers maintain that he would normally have been released for that conviction several years ago for good behavior and that governor gilmore showed punitive political motives in not recommending his immediate freedom in compensation for the injustice of the murder conviction the governor s office stressed that the case was decided entirely on its criminaljustice merits in the face of fresh dna evidence and that the assault sentence deserved to stand mr washington s lawyers , while intent now on winning immediate parole on the assault charge , said they would use the pardon and erroneous conviction to press once more for reform of the evidence limitation that limit cost earl at least 6 years longer in prison , said gerald t zerkin , a defense lawyer who described the frustration of being unable to bring exculpatory evidence to light until news organizations brought pressure on the state for dna testing the murder conviction is now a nullity , and the state should recalculate the good time earl has served , mr zerkin said of the complex state formulas for deciding parole he maintained that , by any formula , mr washington would have been released for good behavior by now but for the headlines and political controversy stirred by his challenging the virginia system of justice mr washington was nine days from execution in 1994 when his death sentence was commuted to life by gov l douglas wilder , a democrat , after an initial dna test raised doubts about his guilt that test suggested the possibility that someone else might have been involved in the crime , but state officials insisted the test was not fully conclusive in his pardon , governor gilmore said the new test confirmed the possibility that another individual , a known convicted rapist , might have been involved in the murder critics of virginia s time limit on evidence maintain that it ends court jurisdiction well before any possibility for full justice it places the victims of unjust convictions at the discretion of elected political officials , said peter neufeld , codirector of the innocence project at the benjamin n cardozo school of law in new york , a pro bono defense program that has won dna appeals in capital cases you would think the state would offer at least a word of apology for this miscarriage of justice , but there s none in the governor s pardon of earl , he said the culpeper police originally said that mr washington , who has an iq of 69 , waived his right to a lawyer and then confessed to a series of unsolved murders after he was arrested on a charge of assaulting a neighbor all the murder cases were later dropped except the williams case mr washington was convicted largely on the basis of a confession that he recanted and sought to challenge with exculpatory evidence after the 21day limit when new lawyers took up his cause mr washington was informed of the pardon on monday night by barry weinstein , another member of his defense team earl said , 'i 've been telling everyone i did n't do it i guess i'm free ! mr weinstein related i had to tell him , 'no , not yet , earl'
john pizzarelli feinstein s at the regency john pizzarelli is the keeper of a certain kind of cool call it happy cool this virtuosic jazz guitarist and crooner keeps tragedy at bay by making music that is synonymous with simple pleasures far from evoking the hedonistic highs of sex , drugs , sports and gourmet food , his music portrays the kind of joy that sneaks up on you at odd moments when you 're just walking around and feeling good for no particular reason in his new show , which plays through feb 14 , mr pizzarelli has taken a risk by turning it into a family affair in addition to his trio , which includes the pianist ray kennedy and the guitarist s younger brother , martin pizzarelli , on bass , the show has segments featuring his wife , the broadway singer jessica molaskey , and his father , the guitarist bucky pizzarelli although family musicales can get awfully sticky , this one has none of the forced jollity that such occasions invite ms molaskey , who appeared with her husband in the broadway musical dream , shares his gift for understated humor , and her version of dave frishberg s quality time , a withering spoof of urbane yuppie argot , captured just the right attitude of goodhumored mockery as dueling guitarists , the father and son traded sparkling lead guitar riffs in a hybrid of stars in your eyes and nuages , in which the elder pizzarelli lovingly echoed django reinhardt s soulful notebending in a threeway honeysuckle rose , witty singlenote solos on the two guitars and bass coalesced into a thunderous orchestral strumming all the strengths of the trio fused brilliantly in a taut , frantically swinging version of i got rhythm in which mr pizzarelli and mr kennedy exchanged ideas like manic mind readers , making music that wore an eartoear grin it made you want to jump for joy stephen holden
you do n't have to be a brilliant political analyst to realize that the republican nominee for president \( whose identity is still , amazingly , in doubt \) is going to have trouble making an economic case for his candidacy as bill clinton put it , declaring that he had a lot of sympathy for the republicans i mean , it s hard for them to figure out what to run on they ca n't run against the longest economic expansion in history no , but they can try to claim credit for it in the months ahead , there will be a deafening chorus of pundits insisting that it was ronald reagan who laid the foundations for our extraordinary prosperity indeed that today s prosperity is the ultimate vindication of reaganomics the other day i happened to read a fairly typical example of the genre , an article titled it s the reagan economy , stupid the piece , circulated by a neoreaganite pressure group called the club for growth , was written by lawrence kudlow , who was an adviser to steve forbes s campaign , and the club s president , stephen moore \( mr moore is also director of fiscal policy studies at the cato institute \) the title says it all rapid growth in the late 90 s is the continuing legacy of mr reagan s tax cuts , way back in 1981 and reading the piece , an idea occurred to me you see , the usual riposte to this sort of thing involves a weary reiteration of the basic economics involved one tries , for the umpteenth time , to explain that nothing extraordinary happened to the us economy during the reagan years well before the events of the 80 s , scenarios of disinflation had become standard exercises in the macroeconomics textbooks in these scenarios , an initial period of rising unemployment and slow or negative growth would be followed by a period of rapid , noninflationary growth and falling unemployment , with the unemployment rate ending up about where it started and that s just what happened but though it s the simple truth , this explanation is too complicated to be heard over the shouting so what do you say we focus on the character issue instead \? are the commentators who say that our current prosperity vindicates reaganomics being honest \? if they are , then if things had gone differently if the economy had done badly under bill clinton logic implies that they would have reached a different conclusion if good news vindicates the reagan legacy , bad news would have called it into question , right \? i suppose i could stop right there you know and i know that if the economy were slumping instead of booming , the same people would triumphantly contrast the clinton record with mr reagan s and declare the contrast surprise ! a vindication of reaganomics but we do n't have to leave this as a mere conjecture instead we can be scholarly , and look at the literature that is , earlier writings by some of the reaganite faithful , from the years before it became clear that their problem would be how to explain away the economy s continuing success for example , it so happens that in october 1996 , little more than three years ago , mr moore and william niskanen , cato s chairman , put out a report titled supplyside tax cuts and the truth about the reagan economic record this report was vehement in insisting that in assessing mr reagan s achievement one must not include any data after 1989 , which marks the end of the reagan era the years from 1981 to 1989 provide a convenient and unique laboratorylike testing ground for assessing the success or failure of reaganomics and the report went on to argue that the slower growth from 1989 to 1995 demonstrated the superiority of reaganite policies it does n't get much better than this if the postreagan economy stumbles , the great man s responsibility ends on the day he left office but if the good times keep rolling , so does mr reagan s legacy as they say in the scholarly journals gotcha ! of course , none of this will make any difference either to the views or the behavior of the faithful commentators will commentate , fulminators will fulminate , and everyone will pretend to base his arguments on the evidence but now that you know the truth , here s a suggestion next time you hear a talking head start to explain how ronald reagan deserves the credit for bill clinton s economy , switch to the discovery channel where you might actually learn something
when we were orphans by kazuo ishiguro 336 pp new york alfred a knopf 25 in one of his many shrewd essays on the carpentry of fiction , graham greene suggested that a writer s technique is more than anything else a means of evading the personally impossible , of disguising a deficiency a good novelist , greene wrote , has an acute consciousness of what he cannot do , and that is something that on their march to oblivion the secondrate never quite manage to learn i ca n't presume to say what it is that the british writer kazuo ishiguro knows he cannot do but for all their varied settings prewar england and postwar japan , the mitteleuropa of the unconsoled or the shanghai of this slippery and rewarding new novel his books share in a body of technique , a set of rigorously observed narrative protocols none of them takes place in contemporary england and each of them features a firstperson narrator who is in some sense hiding from the past and its attendant emotions each narrator seems at first reliable , a figure whose weaknesses the novel only slowly uncovers and each is defined by a prose caught between awkwardness and elegance , a language obsessively concerned with small details but somehow also impersonal yet despite this thematic and stylistic consistency , ishiguro has with each novel become a stranger and less predictable writer it is almost as if his career were going backward in everything except accomplishment his first substantial audience came in 1989 with the remains of the day , an account , half p g wodehouse and half henry james , of a butler s inability to step outside his role the novel well deserved its booker prize , even though it is perhaps too smoothly made , a craftsman s masterpiece whose perfection cries out to be noticed i myself was unconvinced by ishiguro s next novel , the unconsoled , a 500page fauxkafka chronicle of embarrassment and interruption that some regard as a triumph but i admired his willingness to abandon the tight control of his earlier work now , with when we were orphans , ishiguro appears to have found his synthesis , not only in its expansive yet finely modulated narrative but also in the way it bends the hallucinatory world of its immediate predecessor toward the surface verisimilitude of the butler s story as a new boy at his english boarding school , ishiguro s narrator , christopher banks , quickly learns to reproduce his classmates' mannerisms with such expertise that not a single of my fellows noticed anything odd or thought to make fun and so his life will go englishness in fact , human interaction of all kinds will remain for him a form of learned behavior , in which he compounds the simulacrum of a character from both the gestures of the people around him and his reading in the wind in the willows or sherlock holmes conan doyle s fiction will even be of professional use to banks , who soon establishes himself as a private detective in a london that resembles that of an english mystery of the 1920 s and 30 s it was the summer of 1923 , the summer i came down from cambridge , when despite my aunt s wishes that i return to shropshire , i decided my future lay in the capital and took up a small flat at no 14b bedford gardens in kensington that s the book s first sentence , and it s one no talented young novelist of banks s own generation greene himself , or evelyn waugh would have thought worth writing but banks does n't have his contemporaries' cool eye , and that first sentence belongs instead to the world of john buchan , to the guilty pleasures of such thrillers as the thirtynine steps in banks s london , the private eye has become a public figure , burdened by the scale of responsibility that befalls a detective with any sort of renown , and in constant danger not from criminals but from the fashionable circles that are forever trying to recruit him our hero modestly alludes to such triumphs as the mannering case or the trevor richardson affair , allusions that , in proper holmesian fashion , remain unencumbered by details we never see him follow a case to what i am sure he would call its denouement the knowingness with which ishiguro employs this excessively bookish machinery might make when we were orphans seem like another deft postmodern exercise , a historical novel that s not concerned with the life of the past so much as with its literary assumptions yet ishiguro stops just short of parody , and though he wo n't let his readers surrender to the genre , he does n't condescend to it either for by placing its cliches in banks s mind , ishiguro makes their slight pomposity an essential part of the man s character , a mark of both his limitations and of the psychic necessity that moves him this is n't a detective novel , it only looks like one as in his earlier books , ishiguro s real concern is with his main character s unerring ability to miss the call of freedom , in the blindness that his sense of obligation imposes upon him for banks , those obligations stem from his childhood in the international settlement of shanghai , a childhood that ends with his parents' unexplained disappearance first his father

new jersey s funniest person contest , round two being held in new york city , of all places if ever there was a column that could write itself , i thought , this was it i thought wrong sure , there were more momentous things to muse about the fate of our great democracy , for instance the machinations of the highest courts in the land or the double date that al and tipper and joe and hadassah went on to see you can count on me and if i had wanted to write about something funny , i need not have driven to new york city at rush hour just as jesse jackson was rallying the troops for mr gore in times square i could have written about my behindthescenes brokering to get dreidel , dreidel , dreidel included with the christmas carols at my town s annual tree lighting but no my friend deb had signed up for the funniest jerseyean contest at stand up new york , and one of the requirements was that she bring four audience members with her deb , who does improv , is one of the funniest people in new jersey , and i always like to watch her perform besides , i thought an easy column the comedians would practically write it for me i even volunteered to drive in the car with us , also along for moral support , was deb s friend frankie spears , who actually was a finalist in a similar , but unrelated , contest in 1998 the funniest woman in new jersey needless to say , if we had gotten into a fatal accident on the way there , new jersey today would be in the midst of a serious humor shortage the thing was the contest was n't all that funny sure , deb was she riffed on how life as a suburban mom dumbs you down , and segued into a routine on jesus as a toddler \( jesus christ , put down that frankincense right now ! \) there was also a schoolteacher from wayne , t c tanis , who had some funny stuff about the squeegee guys , pregiuliani , who used to extort the bridgeandtunnel crowd \( if you 're going to rob me , just do it it 'd be like sitting home , and a toothless man with a gun comes in your house and power steams the drapes \) but much of the night s entertainment was a series of lame jokes about organized crime , pot , sex and siamese twins some of the stuff that passed as comedy did n't even make sense one guy tossed beanie babies into the audience as it turned out , the line i laughed the hardest at was when the mc announced that the winner would automatically get a berth in the funniest person in the greater new york area contest i looked at my yellow legal pad , which contained three scant pages of notes , and thought how am i going to get anything out of this \? adding insult to injury was the fact that , at 44 , i have become utterly invisible to the kind of people who frequent comedy joints not only did nobody try to hit on me , not only did none of the comics ask me where i live or what i do for a living , none of them even made eye contact and then bad went to worse the judges did n't pick my pal deb some guy who was obsessed with flatulence finished ahead of her as if blazing saddles had not gone over that territory pretty thoroughly i thought the drive in , with deb s preperformance jitters , had been bad but on the drive home , i had to deal with the loony tragedy of a comic scorned not only was i working with some thin material but i realized that i had to be careful of that volatile combination friendship and journalism i may not do standup , but i know what it s like to put your humor and your ego on the line and there s nothing less hospitable to a woman in her 40 s than a new york comedy club , which by its very nature favors the young , the male and the obnoxious even when the audience is a bunch of yahoos from new jersey here s how i see it jane austen is revered as one of the drollest authors of all time , and her subjects were , in effect , the suburbanites of the 18th century but if her career depended on her standing up in a new york comedy club , we would never have heard of her today deb , at least , was n't as invisible as i some guy tried to hit on her on her way out and , by the way , she was over it by the next day as she put it , you just ca n't stay mad with a straight face and say , 'i lost the funniest resident of new jersey contest' drawing \( nancy doniger \)
the xerox corporation , which only days ago was fending off rumors of its impending bankruptcy , is talking to venture capitalists about selling its palo alto research center , which in the 1970 s pioneered much of the technology for the personal computer industry struggling to raise cash as its sales and stock price plummet and its competitors grab shares of the copier market it once dominated , xerox is also shopping around its financing arm and other assets , according to executives who have been approached by the company the company is not close to completing any specific sale , they added , but even its copier and printer businesses may not be sacrosanct xerox based in stamford , conn , and with 14 , 000 manufacturing employees in rochester would neither confirm nor deny talk of asset sales the company promises to lay out all its plans on tuesday , when it announces the size of its thirdquarter loss xerox s competitors in what is called the imaging business kodak and polaroid , along with names like lexmark and pitney bowes are sharing its pain the economy is softening , prompting consumers and businesses alike to put off buying new copiers , printers and cameras technology has created new competitors , with the likes of sony selling digital cameras and hewlettpackard dominating the market for computer printers but even against that backdrop , xerox seems to be suffering most last week , when the company was unable to tap the commercial credit markets , it was forced to issue a statement after rumors circulated that it would seek bankruptcy court protection instead , it said it was relying on a 7 billion line of credit while xerox has refused to provide investors with more details , analysts and investors are estimating it is already using about 4 billion of that 7 billion to finance its shortterm debt while no one seriously predicts bankruptcy , investors , with little hard information to go on , remain anxious what s driving the stock where it is today is fear , said david giroux , an analyst with t rowe price , a mutual fund company they have not done a good job of allaying fears the stock has tumbled from nearly 64 in may 1999 to close yesterday at 675 , a 10year low as a result , some investors are now calling for the board to make sweeping management changes others even suggest the board itself should turn over xerox s board has been sitting on its hands and needs fresh ideas from neweconomy entrepreneurs , said roger kenny , a managing partner of boardroom consultants xerox may be forced to sell its half share of fuji xerox , its japanese printer and copier arm , to fuji , some analysts suggest and a few even contend that xerox might bail out of copiers and printers altogether and turn itself into a solutions company , one that designs and runs document systems for companies the solutions approach at least lets them salvage cash and right the ship , said benjamin a reitzes , an analyst with painewebber several silicon valley venture capitalists say xerox has begun talks with them about buying all or part of the palo alto research center , which is commonly known as parc an initial meeting with accel partners , a leading venture capital firm in palo alto , took place last week , according to several people close to the talks accel executives refused to comment on the negotiations but another venture capitalist at a firm that has talked with xerox said that the accel talks were serious but preliminary no asset sale would be painless but the loss of parc would be a blow to the psyche of xerox as well as a strategic loss xerox did not turn many of parc s inventions into viable products , but parc had various claims to fame the computer mouse , the userfriendly icons that make personal computers so attractive to consumers and ethernet , which links computers at remote sites xerox would hate to part with them because they are the future , said tom long , a former xerox executive who is now chief executive of oce printing systems usa xerox may have little choice unless they can float more commercial paper or get additional capital that will cost them an arm and a leg in interest , they will have to sell assets to stay out of bankruptcy , mr reitzes of painewebber said neither xerox executives nor its directors are talking its senior management has been in continuous meetings at the stamford headquarters , mapping out the strategy it will announce on tuesday the plan is in place , locked and loaded , said jeffrey simek , a xerox spokesman but what happened \? how did this company , whose name was once a synonym for photocopier and wall street supremacy , fall so far \? i do n't know if i blame management , but the problem certainly is n't the people who are putting the machines together , said gary bonadonna , director of the rochester joint board of the union of needle trades , industrial and textile employees , which represents xerox employees for decades , xerox all but owned the copier market but over the last few years , the lines between printers and copiers have blurred moreover , the fastestgrowing segment of the document processing world is lowpriced printers and copiers for the smalloffice and homeoffice market , now dominated by hewlettpackard xerox has been late to get products to that market and to establish solid relationships with staples , comp usa and the other retail outlets
the dictionary definition of parity and the one invoked in today s sport culture are rarely the same in my edition of webster s , the word means the state or condition of being the same in power , value , rank , etc equality when commissioners of professional leagues , or their surrogates that is , television executives use the word , it s usually in response to dwindling fan interest , low ratings or the unexpected decline of a powerhouse or two neither definition is accurate , however , to explain what occurred over the weekend in college football nine teams ranked in the top 25 of the associated press poll were defeated seven of them by unranked teams it was as if a child played 52 pickup with the ranking and left the deck scattered on the floor check this week s ranking to see how voters went about that task of assessing the state or condition of being the same in power , value , rank , etc but judging by the reaction of those who scattered the cards , there s really no consensus two coaches of unranked teams declared their team s victories among the biggest in their careers coach dennis erickson of oregon state , who won two national championships at miami , choked with pride for his squad after the beavers beat southern california , 3121 , to end a 26game losing streak to the trojans , improve to 40 and enter the ranking for the first time since jan 4 , 1969 , at no 23 mississippi state coach jackie sherrill , who has won big games at pittsburgh and texas am , echoed those sentiments after his bulldogs defeated no 3 florida , 4735 , and returned to the ranking at no 20 , after a week s absence it s as high as i 've ever been , erickson said this was right up with any of them surprisingly , northwestern s randy walker , who has a right to be ecstatic , chose a tempered , if not blase , posture to laud his wildcats after they followed an overtime upset of wisconsin with a 3717 rout of no 18 michigan state on saturday sure , walker left miami of ohio as the school s most successful coach before arriving in evanston , ill , last year , but really , coach , how about giving it up to your players \? we are a better football team this week than we were last week , he said of his team , which entered the top 25 at no 22 i think over all we played pretty solid it was a nice job by the offense , and i knew that it would be because of the optimism we had coming in we came out of the blocks and got the job done leave it to coach steve spurrier of florida , however , to speak , actually to hiss , on behalf of the once mighty mississippi state ought to be embarrassed tearing down the goal posts after beating this team , spurrier said of the starkville fans' postgame celebration like much of what the irascible and antagonistic spurrier says , there s a bit of truth in his putdown he has stated repeatedly that his gators are not that good so far this year he has benched players for improper displays of invincibility , barred them from meeting members of the news media because he was tired of hearing their barely backed up trashtalk , and rotated quarterbacks in an attempt to get some traction on what he knew was a dangerously slippery season his is not the only program struggling how about unranked penn state \( 24 \) upending purdue , no 22 last week \? or unranked alabama , once as high as no 3 , defeating south carolina to improve to 23 and make the return to the top 25 of lou holtz and the gamecocks a brief one \? now , none of this means a state of equality has descended on college football while florida state supplanted nebraska as the nation s no 1 team this week , nobody can dispute that the two teams own five of the last 10 national titles but the weekend s games do reflect that the gap has narrowed between , say , a no 40 and a no 10 like new issues on the nasdaq , college football teams can become movers in the polls unlike the professional leagues , with their advanced scouting of a limited pool of players , a solid college coach and an enthusiastic recruiting staff can unearth overlooked talent last year , marshall , behind quarterback chad pennington , finished no 10 in the final poll with a 120 record this year it looks as if texas christian \( 40 , no 14 ap \) may follow the powerful legs of ladainian tomlinson , a heisman trophy candidate , up the ranking the tougher climb is from no 10 to no 1 last year virginia tech played florida state for the national championship and almost completed that feat the hokies are now no 3 for the past three years , kansas state has yoyoed within that index now the wildcats loom at no 4 still , college fans embrace upstarts they root for teams because they represent their state or their alma mater or because their father or mother or brother or sister went there they either spend saturday afternoons with 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 likeminded folks in stadiums , or click to the games on television with a remote even the most ardent fans understand that it is hard to get disgusted , or even upset , with 18 to 22yearolds whose mistakes on a football field can unplug a powerhouse so webster s definition of parity is n't true and sports executives' use of the word is n't necessary the fun is that next saturday the deck of cards will be thrown to the ground once more , and for the rest of the week we 'll discuss how to reorder them
a day after withdrawing his name for consideration for the washington wizards' head coaching job , st john s coach mike jarvis said yesterday that the only college coaching job he wanted was the one he had despite a statement attributed to his agent late monday that jarvis was considering a major college coaching position in the big ten jarvis issued a statement disputing remarks attributed to his agent , robert ades , by the associated press that , besides considering a couple of other national basketball association possibilities , his client was interested in an unnamed big ten school that was a step up from st john s in terms of stature anything that is said , in regards to any job regarding mike jarvis , will be made by me and only me , jarvis said in a statement released by the university the statements that are attributed to rob ades are false and inaccurate ades told the associated press yesterday that he had not spoken to the news agency at all the report , the news agency said , was based on a telephone call with a person who identified himself as ades to an associated press sports reporter the news agency said last night that it was checking the source of the call in his statement , jarvis added i have said on numerous occasions , and i will say it for the last time , that i have no interest in any other college coaching job and i have not changed my mind i feel i have the best college job in america , bar none , because of the fact that i'm at st john s university and i'm in new york the greatest city in the world jarvis stepped away from the negotiating table with the wizards monday after talks between ades and michael jordan , washington s president of basketball operations , stalled , apparently over money and decisionmaking power jarvis , who coached at george washington for eight years , was believed to be seeking a deal worth 3 million a year or more than 1 million over what the wizards had offered the st john s coach acknowledged that he and jordan had not been able to come up with an agreement and said that he intended to turn his full attention and energy to preparing for the red storm s upcoming season jarvis has led the red storm to a 5317 record and consecutive national collegiate athletic association berths in his two years at st john s he has consistently expressed interest in the nba and did so again yesterday the day may come when i leave to coach in the nba and i 've been consistent in my statements regarding those aspirations as well but until that time comes i'm the head coach at st john s university and i look forward to the upcoming season with great anticipation university administrators have insisted they have been kept abreast of jarvis s job opportunities and said they stood behind their coach mike has always been upfront and honest about what his ambitions are , ed manetta jr , st john s athletic director , said he s been consistent in delivering that message to me i'm behind him 100 percent , and now it s time to move on from this issue
washington , april 1 as many as 50 , 000 women and children from asia , latin america and eastern europe are brought to the united states under false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes , abused laborers or servants , according to a central intelligence agency report that is the government s first comprehensive assessment of the problem the carefully annotated and exhaustively researched , 79page agency report international trafficking in women to the united states a contemporary manifestation of slavery paints a broad picture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that government agencies face in fighting it completed in november , the report is based on more than 150 interviews with governnment officials , lawenforcement officers , victims and experts in the united states and abroad , as well as investigate documents and a review of international literature on the subject lawenforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years of trafficking in immigrant women and children , some as young as 9 years old but the report says that officers generally do not like to take on these cases because they are difficult to investigate and prosecute what is more , it says , the nation does not have sufficient laws aimed at this problem , meaning that the penalties often are insubstantial two years ago , attorney general janet reno chartered an interagency task force , saying , we are not interested in containing modernday slavery we want to eradicate it the report mentions many efforts to fight the problem , but also many barriers to doing so over the last two years , while up to 100 , 000 victims poured into the united states , where they were held in bondage , federal officials estimated that the government prosecuted cases involving no more than 250 victims the justice department said it could not provide precise figures the report was prepared by a government intelligence analyst who was working on assignment to the cia while the report is not classified , it has not been made public another government official who wanted the report s findings publicized provided a copy it describes case after case of foreign women who answered advertisement for au pair , sales clerk , secretarial or waitress jobs in the united states but found , once they arrived , that the jobs did not exist instead they were taken prisoner , held under guard and forced into prostitution or peonage some of them were , in fact , sold outright to brothel owners , the report says examples of this may include latvian women threatened and forced to dance nude in chicago , the report says thai women were brought to the united states but then forced to be virtual sex slaves chinesekorean women were held as indentured servants and mexican women and girls , some as young as 14 , were promised jobs in housekeeping or child care but , upon arrival , were told they must work as prostitutes in brothels serving migrant workers girls from asian and african countries , some 9 years old , were essentially sold to traffickers by their parents , for less than the price of a toaster , one government official said this mainly happens in cultures where female children are not valued the girls are smuggled into the united states where , in a typical case , they are forced to work in an indentured sexual servitude arrangement , the report says a nigerian smuggling ring , the report says , citing an immigration and naturalization service case , charged parents from that country 10 , 000 to 12 , 000 to bring their children to new york so they would have better educational opportunities but once here , the smugglers forced the nigerian children to work as domestics some of these cases received news coverage when they were discovered but they are only a tiny fraction of the problem the report says 700 , 000 to two million women and children worldwide are victimized by traffickers each year although the numbers who come to the united states are relatively small , the report says that the problem is likely to increase in the united states at a conference in manila this week , delegates from 23 asian countries called on governments to seize the profits of the crime syndicates involved a filipino group estimated those profits at up to 17 billion a year the countries that are the primary sources for traffickers are thailand , vietnam , china , mexico , russia and the czech republic , the report says other countries that are increasingly providing victims include the philippines , korea , malaysia , latvia , hungary , poland , brazil and honduras , the report says the ins , one of several federal agencies with jurisdiction in this area , noted in an internal assessment last fall that agents had found 250 brothels in 26 cities that appeared to be holding trafficking victims it was not always easy to tell , the cia report says , because the victims generally did not speak english and might have been even more afraid of lawenforcement officers than of their captors after raiding one of these brothels , the immigrations officers generally move to deport the women because they are in the country illegally often the officials do not have enough information to prosecute their captors
i live in a neighborhood built in friendlier times , before central airconditioning and television rendered front porches obsolete by local standards , my porch is barely adequate it s not particularly gracious , it does n't wrap around , it is n't screened and it s just big enough to support a couple of window boxes , a few chairs and a table but that s enough , when the weather gets nice , to give me a purchase on the outside world at the same time i'm engaged in that despicable activity known as work in the summer , i work on my porch almost every morning as long as the wind is n't too strong , and none of my neighbors have just had their lawns sprayed , if the grass and tree guys are busy on other streets and the teenagers next door are n't washing their cars with the radio blaring , i can thanks to modern technology talk or type to my heart s content i can work and yet be in touch the season real grownups those titans of industry and politics who march into the city with their briefcases and organizers and who have trouble finding enough casual clothes to wear on fridays might not understand but some of us cannot labor contently under fluorescent lights , no matter how much money , power or starbucks you offer us especially in summer i was in high school the first time i worked inside during the summer my boss was my dad , who owned a small publishing company , and i was frequently told how lucky i was to get the experience but although i made a small fortune by teenage standards , and had already begun to build my resume , i might as well have been a princess trapped in a dungeon the end of light and air in summer was , quite simply , the end of childhood fast forward a quarter of a century to life in the electronic cottage , the homebased information age economy predicted by alvin toffler how mr toffler figured this all out before the modem , the laptop and email were invented , i 'll never know but i bet he worked it out all out on that forerunner of the laptop the portable typewriter sitting on his front porch , enjoying the breeze and feeling superior to all those drones still chained to offices well , the virtual office is here and if you 're still laboring under fluorescent lights when you could be outside , you deserve your pallid complexion if necessary , put it in your schedule , said carol gerrish , a businesssuccess coach in monmouth junction , nj because it s too good to pass up ms gerrish should know it s her job to counsel those titans of industry on how to put more success , and balance , in their lives part of what she does is to remind them that the outdoors exists and that they are actually allowed to go there ms gerrish is an avid gardener she spends as much time as possible outside once the temperature hits 60 , reading productivity magazines at her backyard bistro table research and development , she said david alpern , a senior editor for newsweek , often does interviews about the magazine s polls from his deck in sag harbor , on long island it s clearly more fun to able to do it in the backyard with the sun and the trees and the moss and the hot tub gurgling on one side and the cat gurgling on the other , he said you do n't even have to have a yard or a laptop or a cordless if your job involves thinking , all you really need to work outside in fair weather is your brain although pen and paper might come in handy that s basically the only equipment used by ira gassman , who worked outdoors when he wrote the book and lyrics for the broadway musical the life mr gassman , who splits his time between manhattan and sag harbor , has done all his writing for the past 20 years outside when mr gassman is in sag harbor , he starts his writing shift on the porch of the american hotel by 3 pm , when he wraps up , he s worked at picnic tables , benches and beaches all over town , from long wharf to marine park i usually like to stay in the sun , so as the sun moves so do i , he said he also likes the hubbub of human activity i like people around me it energizes me , he said mr gassman , however , is more energized by people on the whole than in the specific he does n't particularly want to be reached while he s in a creative mood phooey on phones , he said another soul who likes to write on the beach is dan rattiner , publisher of dan s papers , in bridgehampton , also on long island mr rattiner has been writing on beaches for 15 years he started going there to escape his children , who were always bursting into his home study i get kind of into a dreamland state , he said i can be irritable if i'm interrupted even in the dead of winter , mr rattiner works at the beach inside his lincoln navigator and if he happens to experience a small adventure while he s there , even better since the life of the south fork of long island is , after all , his beat he has witnessed fishermen show up late for feasts that the seagulls enjoyed just moments earlier , and once , having noticed some strange tropical birds on the beach , he just happened to run into east hampton s town environmental officer , who was able to identify the species i too have found working on my front porch providential it s easy to strike up conversations with dog walkers , baby strollers and mail carriers who pass my way several years ago , one regular dog walker happened to mention that she was seeing an md , who was also an acupuncturist i wound up writing a story about him , then seeing him for back pain and eventually he and i became friends last winter , i attended his wedding none of this would have happened had i been holed up in my garret of course , the outside home office is n't always a garden of eden as i write this outside on my porch , of course i'm discovering that it s about 10 degrees cooler than it looked when i decided i could work outside today barely had i opened my laptop when i found that neighbors two doors down were having two trees removed now they 're feeding the limbs into a machine that turns them into sawdust , and which sounds like an electric pencil sharpener attached to jimi hendrix s amplifier and as in the garden of eden , i sometime come across knowledge i 'd just as soon not that my mail carrier reads the postcards that inform us of our property taxes , for example or that certain neighbors back out of their driveways at frightening speeds luckily so far i have n't witnessed any squalid extramarital liaisons the outdoor working life is not for everybody gil gordon , a telecommuting consultant in monmouth junction , has worked at home for 18 years , but rarely takes his job outside i want to preserve the feeling of separation and relaxation i get when i'm in the backyard or by the pool or by the lake , he said i do n't want to soil it with work mr gordon is working on a book due out next spring from random house , turn it off controlling the anytimeanywhere office mr gordon also points out that there are certain tangible physical hazards from setting up office outside , like having your children trip over the extension cord plugged into your computer actually , that happened to me just the other day , and i barely caught my laptop before it hit the deck had it crashed , though , i probably would have just bought a new and better one one with a working battery , so i would n't need that extension cord in the first place then i could take it to the pool photos dan rattiner , publisher of dan s papers on long island , does his writing on the beach carol gerrish , a

the army this week brushed off new reports that american forces needlessly attacked retreating iraqi troops after a ceasefire was declared in the persian gulf war the accounts , contained in a new yorker article written by seymour hersh , cannot be so easily dismissed though questions about the battle were raised as the war ended in 1991 , and subsequent army investigations found no fault , there is good reason for the pentagon and congress to revisit the matter some officers familiar with the american assault offer detailed testimony that one of the country s most decorated commanders , gen barry mccaffrey , ordered a punishing and unwarranted attack the sequence of events described by mr hersh is complex and filled with the confusion and ambiguities that are common in war there are conflicting accounts about what happened and why , and general mccaffrey , now retired from the army and serving as the clinton administration s top drugcontrol official , has vigorously defended his actions but none of that justifies the army s cavalier response to the new yorker article few matters are more important to a democracy than the conduct of its military forces , and any credible accusation of reckless or unjustified killing by american servicemen must be thoroughly investigated by an independent panel of experts the army s internal inquiries are not an adequate answer the core issue raised by the hersh piece is whether general mccaffrey , who was commander of the 24th infantry division , deliberately provoked a fight with retreating iraqi forces after the ceasefire was in place by blocking a main escape route and then seizing on the firing of several iraqi weapons to launch a withering assault the ferocity of the american attack is not in question american ground and air units all but pulverized a republican guard tank division on march 2 , 1991 , in one of the most devastating and onesided battles of the war a number of general mccaffrey s fellow commanders , including lt col patrick lamar , who was the division s operations officer , told mr hersh that excessive firepower was used against a weakened and retreating iraqi force that did not seriously threaten the americans they believe that the american assault was a clear and willful violation of the ceasefire rules of engagement that had been established by the pentagon general mccaffrey maintains that he acted properly to defend his troops after the iraqi forces initiated combat he denies that he blocked their escape route in hopes of forcing a confrontation mr hersh examines other serious charges involving general mccaffrey s troops , including reports that they massacred a group of iraqi prisoners of war , but the evidence he cites here is not definitive the army s investigations of all these matters , which cleared general mccaffrey and the division , should not be the last word the military services have a poor record of holding their own members accountable for misconduct , especially top officers as walter cronkite , the former cbs news anchorman , noted in a letter to the times earlier this week , the pentagon s efforts to restrict coverage of the war denied the american people an immediate and full account of the battles american forces fought in kuwait and iraq more comprehensive coverage might long ago have clarified whether general mccaffrey s order to attack was appropriate the senate did not inquire deeply into the 24th infantry division s actions when it approved promotions for general mccaffrey after the war or when it confirmed his appointment to the drug policy post secretary of defense william cohen should appoint an independent review panel if he does not , the senate or house should conduct its own investigation if general mccaffrey acted responsibly , he should welcome an unflinching examination of the facts
washington anyone who went to the supreme court argument , as i did , hoping that the court would rescue us from the election morass with a clear , unifying decision would have left disappointed in their comments , the justices seemed as divided as the rest of us indeed , the hour and a half of argument raised a troubling new possibility that the justices will divide in this case along liberal conservative lines that would seriously damage the one national institution that the public still overwhelmingly respects , the supreme court of the united states of course what the justices say from the bench is not a sure clue to how they will decide and there is a powerful institutional imperative here to come as close as possible to unanimity that is important for the country as for the court as someone , not a lawyer , said to me , we need them to be unanimous the argument focused on a hitherto littlenoticed statute passed by congress after the disputed hayestilden election of 1876 title 3 , section 5 of the us code it says that if a state , before choosing presidential electors , has enacted laws on the handling of any contest by judicial or other methods , determinations under those laws shall be conclusive when the electoral vote is counted theodore b olson , representing george w bush , argued that the florida supreme court had violated that statute by rewriting the law of florida in its nov 21 decision allowing manual recounts to continue the decision , he said , essentially rewrote a state statute setting a nov 14 deadline for canvassers to report their totals mr olson ran into heavy weather right at the start justice sandra day o'connor and chief justice william rehnquist said section 5 looked like a direction to congress if it has to resolve a dispute over electoral votes , not like a rule to be enforced by the courts but when laurence h tribe argued for vice president gore s side , the same justices plus antonin scalia gave him a hard time they seemed to be assuming that section 5 was judicially enforceable and suggested that the florida supreme court had violated it intricate as it sounds , the interpretation of section 5 may answer a determinative question is there any issue of federal law in this case , or is it only a matter of florida law \? if the latter , the us supreme court has no power to change the florida court s decision it was an extraordinary argument in the sense that , inside that quiet marble courtroom , everyone was aware of the less orderly external events and in that regard , there were ironies i do n't mean to suggest , mr olson said , that there was a lack of integrity or any dishonesty by the florida supreme court but that is exactly what governor bush and his point man , james a baker iii , suggested , loudly , when the florida court made its decision have messrs bush and baker thought better of their disgraceful and dangerous words \? there was also a heavy irony in mr olson s central argument that the florida supreme court had changed the rules after the game was played governor bush and his people have accused that court of in effect making an ex post facto law yet at this very moment bush supporters in the florida legislature are polishing up a plan to meet in special session and choose the state s electors themselves , overriding the people s vote if it turns out to be for vice president gore that would be ex post facto with a vengeance one curiosity is that none of the lawyers seem to have noticed section 2 of the 14th amendment its framers , to prevent any southern denial of the vote to blacks after the civil war , provided that a state lose representatives in congress if it denied the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president that clause has never been enforced to reduce any state s representation but the language shows , at the least , that when the 14th amendment was adopted , in 1868 , the assumption was that citizens , not legislators , would choose presidential electors it makes the florida legislature s plans look even more brazen but for the moment we wait on the supreme court we are very quiet there , justice holmes said in 1913 , but it is the quiet of a storm center
trenton , sept 29 for all the concern over campaign finance reform and rich businessmen buying elections , the sobering reality for wealthy candidates is that they are no more successful than anyone else from 1990 to 1998 , 38 nonincumbents spent more than 1 million of their own money running for the united states senate , and 32 of them ultimately lost as the biggest spender of them all 50 million and counting jon s corzine , the democratic candidate for senate from new jersey , is providing a vivid glimpse of what money can and cannot do for rookie politicians so far , in his first race for public office , he has insulted a quarter of the state s voters with an offensive joke about italianamericans , concealed a donation to a group of black ministers who later endorsed him , and allowed persistent questions about his tax returns and charitable giving to turn his money into a liability as well as a strength but if mr corzine , a former investment banker worth 400 million , has been as prone to missteps as anyone with what political consultants like to call rich man s disease , he has skillfully managed to avoid the disastrous strategic mistakes that have sunk many of his affluent peers he has also been extremely fortunate he faced an unpopular former governor , jim florio , in the democratic primary he faces a littleknown , underfinanced republican congressman , bob franks , in november and he is running in a state that has been particularly kind to wealthy candidates with bottomless budgets indeed , he is trying to replace senator frank r lautenberg , a millionaire who won a senate seat in his first political race but in addition to his ability to spend his opponent into oblivion , mr corzine appears to have learned important lessons that were lost on some of the more extravagant failures of the past , most notably michael huffington and al checchi , californians who squandered nearly 70 million between them on fruitless races for senator and governor of course , no two millionaire candidates are exactly alike , and they fail for different reasons mark warner , a former virginia state democratic chairman with grassroots support and more than 10 million of his own , may have erred only by challenging a popular senator , john warner , in 1996 , a year that favored incumbents and some of them win , like herb kohl of wisconsin , who had gained popularity as the man who kept the national basketball association s milwaukee bucks from leaving town in his first few months after announcing his interest in the senate race last year , mr corzine quickly grew tired of hearing mr checchi s name thrown around as a cautionary tale , his aides have said but there was good reason mr checchi , the former chairman of northwest airlines , jumped into the 1998 california governor s race as a democrat and burned through 389 million of his own money before placing a distant second in a threeway primary mr corzine , too , vowed to spend whatever it took to win his race he also hired mr checchi s media adviser , bob shrum , and his polling firm , penn , schoen berland associates , though both had been widely criticized for their work and their fees in the checchi race they seem to have learned from the experience , because mr corzine has repeated few of mr checchi s mistakes mr checchi ran at first as a centrist his early ads did not even identify him as a democrat defying conventional wisdom that says democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal he started his television campaign six months before the primary , and began it not by introducing himself softly , but by trumpeting his business success and declaring his stands on the issues there were two different campaigns that could 've been run , said darry sragow , mr checchi s campaign manager one was to say , 'i'm successful , i'm great , i want to be governor' the other was to say , 'i'm a living testament to the american dream , and i'm running for office because i want every kid growing up in california to have the same opportunities' that last one would 've been very complex , mr sragow added , but it would 've been successful mr corzine has done the exact opposite of mr checchi he ran as an unabashed liberal in the democratic primary and has barely moved toward the center this fall his television ads last spring began with gauzy autobiographical messages about his bootstraps rise from illinois farmer s son to the head of goldman , sachs company and at every step , mr corzine humbly acknowledges how he benefited from good public schools and cheap tuition at an affordable state university america helped make me who i am , he said in a radio commercial broadcast today now i want to extend america s promise to everyone mr checchi faced two other democrats in the 1998 primary jane harman , a congresswoman who spent 163 million of her own , and gray davis , a veteran politician who ultimately was elected governor ms harman s pollster , fred yang , and her campaign manager , kam kuwata , both recalled mr checchi s television ads as lacking a coherent , consistent theme they were all over the board , mr kuwata said that s the problem , when you have so much money you yield to temptation whereas when you have a more limited budget , you ca n't afford to
the inspector general of the metropolitan transportation authority said yesterday that several subway lines were potentially in danger of experiencing a train collision , derailment or serious delays because supervisors failed to make hundreds of inspections of signal equipment an investigation started last year by the inspector general , roland m malan , after an anonymous tip , found that during 1999 as many as 358 pieces of signal equipment did not undergo an annual inspection that looks for wiring problems the city began the inspections after a 1989 accident in which a crowded broadwaylocal train slammed into a cashandtoken train parked in a station on the upper west side both trains derailed , and more than 50 people were injured the national transportation safety board determined that the probable cause of that accident was wiring problems near the station that caused a signal to malfunction this allowed the train to enter the station without its automatic brakes being activated new york city transit officials said yesterday that they strongly disagreed with the findings and conclusions of the inspector general s report , which also said it appeared that signal maintenance supervisors had falsified records to make it look as if they had performed various kinds of inspections when they had not albert w o'leary , the chief spokesman for new york city transit , said that agency officials firmly believed that passengers' safety was not put into jeopardy by any failure to perform signal inspections , many of which are first performed by signal maintenance crews and then doublechecked by supervisors mr o'leary said the 507 reports that were identified by the inspector general as having been falsified represented only 13 percent of the signal inspection data recorded during 1999 transit officials said they believed the mistakes in the reports could have been honest ones we do n't believe there was any attempt at fraud , mr o'leary said the investigation found , however , that in many cases supervisors were on vacation or off work on days when transit records showed they had made dozens of inspections the report added that 53 percent of the signal equipment on the a , b , c , d , e , f and g lines throughout the city and the r line in brooklyn was overdue for backup visual inspections by supervisors at the end of 1999 the report added that the backup supervisory inspections were important because regular signal maintenance crews did not have the knowledge , experience or expertise of supervisors about the wiring inspections , special checks only supervisors are allowed to perform , mr o'leary said the agency considered those inspections redundant because they are designed only to ensure that wiring repairs are done properly the agency already requires supervisors to inspect repairs as they are made unless somebody touches it , you ca n't have a problem with it , mr o'leary said of the signal wiring after investigators recently alerted new york city transit of the possibility that none of the wiring inspections had been done in 1999 , lawrence g reuter , the transit president , did order that those inspections be made on all the equipment the inspections were completed last month , with no problems found but mr o'leary added that the agency was looking into whether the inspections are unnecessary and should no longer be required in the report , the inspector general recommended that the wiring inspections not only should be kept , but also should be given higher priority asked to comment yesterday on the transit agency s response to the report , officials from the inspector general s office said only that they stood by their findings
princeton steve forbes well knows the important dates of the new political season jan 24 , is the the iowa caucuses feb 1 , the new hampshire primary feb 8 , delaware \( could be good for him , but who s going to notice \? \) and feb 19 , the south carolina primary and the the start of the battle for the south but here are two more dates for mr forbes to remember april 13 , deadline for filing in the new jersey primary , and june 6 , deadline to submission of petitions for the general election ballot for the united states senate we know , we know the forbes campaign is sick and tired of the background chatter about how the candidate will finally give up on his quest to win the white house and will dutifully come home to new jersey and pay his dues by running for the senate seat being vacated by frank lautenberg mr forbes has made it plain that he is in the republican primary race to stay , and a strong showing in the iowa caucuses , where he has worked particularly hard and spent particularly openhandedly , would only cement his determination to stick it out still , in a presidential race that is widely expected to be all but decided by the end of the superprimary tuesdays in march , a change of heart is not beyond reason running and winning a senate seat in 2000 would at least remove one of the biggest burdens from mr forbes , a wealthy publisher that he has never held elective office even governor whitman , his far hills neighbor and longtime acquaintance , was a county freeholder before she tried for the senate and then went on to win the governor s race can a republican win the republican nomination without ever having held elective office \? sure , dwight d eisenhower did it in 1952 , the last candidate to do so but winning world war ii is a little more commanding of public attention than running a publishing company some republicans and other conservatives have been vocal in urging mr forbes to forget the presidency for now and focus on the senate the weekly standard , a conservative journal , has urged him to do so , and so has the new york post , twice senate republican leaders have spoken warmly of mr forbes switching races to become a selffinancing republican in the race , particularly if the similarly selffinancing democratic contender , the retired financier jon corzine , gets the democratic nomination the problem with all of these voices is that none of them are in new jersey , and while mr forbes has pursued the white house , his home state has produced a host of candidates who make no bones about their desire to be senator james treffinger , who has twice been elected county executive in essex county , a democratic stronghold state senator william gormley , an atlantic county moderate representative bob franks , who has all but given up his union county seat to run for the senate , and murray sabrin , the ramapo college professor who is an antiabortion conservative each candidate represents regional and ideological alignments , and each has begun raising money for mr forbes to bigfoot them at this stage would cause resentments no matter governor whitman is no stranger to such maneuvers , and it does not seem to have hurt her but mr forbes would also bring strengths , as assemblyman scott garrett , a conservative warren county republican , noted in a conversation he could come in next month and run some polls and i'm sure his name recognition would be as good if not better than anyone elses , said mr garrett , who on friday announced his plan to challenge representative marge roukema again for the nomination from the 5th congressional district like most state republicans , mr garrett is focused on his own race and has not given mr forbes much thought , except when the question what if he did it \? comes in up hallway conversations and forbes has the financing , mr garrett went on , and he has a bunch of conservative credentials that would help him money , name recognition , his fashionable status as a political outsider and his credentials as a firebreathing antiabortion candidate could indeed have special value in the primary , which is an event that most rankandfile republicans ignore , but that that antiabortion republicans , outsiders themselves , turn out for in force in a crowded field , mr forbes could have the nomination with only a small share of the turnout but first he has to try for it , and not many professionals in new jersey seem to be holding their breaths about the possibility he s run for president twice , said chuck haytaian , chairman of the state republican committee , so maybe running for the senate would be coming down a peg for him photo iver peterson
there will be speeches a politician or two will limber up a rusty arm to lob ceremonial first pitches an umpire will shout the traditional command , and minorleague baseball will come to long island , following a trend that has swept the new york region the debut of the long island ducks this friday night , in a gleaming new 199 million stadium in central islip , will follow a script that has played out several times in just the last six summers in new jersey , connecticut and the hudson valley last year , it happened in newark and bridgewater the year before it was bridgeport , conn , and atlantic city next year , under current plans , it will be camden a decade ago , the region had only one minorleague team , in new britain , conn this season , with the arrival of the ducks and new teams in queens and the catskills , there will be 16 teams playing in four leagues within 100 miles of times square baseball executives cite two overriding reasons for the growth in the region and elsewhere the popularity of two baseball movies in the past dozen years , field of dreams and bull durham , and new , fanfriendly stadiums , most of them built with taxpayer money from cities and towns that have turned to the sport for help in reviving rundown or dormant neighborhoods and polishing their images these communities have pumped millions of state and county dollars into new stadiums the ducks alone have reaped nearly 20 million in public funds for their new stadium in many places , the investment appears to have paid off the success of trenton s team has led to construction of an arena and other new development bridgeport , too , is building an arena the ducks' new stadium finishes a major redevelopment project in central islip that includes a gleaming new federal courthouse , a state courthouse and hundreds of units of new housing but as the roster of teams grows , some of the ball clubs are starting to ask how many are too many in connecticut , where some of the older teams are leery of an upstart in bridgeport and a proposed team in hartford , the old guard is starting to snipe at the newcomers and fret about them muscling in on their territory and some industry analysts are wondering just how long the interest will last , and what will happen to public investments if the novelty wanes there certainly is going to be a saturation point , said andrew zimbalist , a professor of economics at smith college in northampton , mass , and a student of baseball finance i think they may be pushing up against it now but the jury s still out for now , experts say a mix of novelty and a fresh love for the ageold essence of baseball has made the minor leagues appealing it represents an older america that we crave , said michael aaron rockland , chairman of the american studies department at rutgers university it represents a softer , sweeter , slower time most of us are sick and tired of living by the clock here s a game that does n't go by the clock baseball offers us a vision of peace , quietude and timelessness such qualities can also be applied to majorleague baseball but promoters of the minorleague variety add a few more nouns , like value and intimacy their games are affordable for most families , with most tickets priced under 10 , rivaling movies , bowling alleys and amusement parks the new stadiums are closer to home for many fans the ducks' new eab stadium , for instance , is a godsend for long islanders weary of trips west to shea and yankee stadiums lou ottens of clinton has forsaken the yankees for the somerset patriots , now two years old , in their new brick and steel stadium in bridgewater traffic on the george washington bridge and the stadium parking lots are too much of a hassle , mr ottens said now i just have to go 20 minutes from my home mr ottens stopped by the ballpark the other day and bought seven tickets for the patriots second home game for 5950 he and his wife plan to share them with any of their 20 nieces and nephews who want to go to the game such an outing to yankee stadium would have been too expensive , he said plus , i honestly feel these players will give you a better game than the guys in the majors because they have something to prove , he said they 're working with a goal they want to get to the majors sometimes i feel the guys already there do n't particularly give you a good game sometimes bob tait and his wife , marion , have tickets for half the patriots' 70 home games it s absolutely great entertainment , mr tait said there s thousands of people around here who ca n't get away from taking care of their kids , so they just take them to the ballpark it s safe , it s wholesome , it s close to home , and there s great community spirit joe tozzi , 42 , of piscataway , came to buy two patriots polo shirts in the park s gift shop , well stocked with team umbrellas , waste cans , caps , clothing and seat cushions he saw several games last summer with his brother phil and his nephew , 9 , and niece , 5 it s not as restraining for the kids as yankee stadium , where they have to stay in their seats , he said here , they can walk around it s like a big picnic everybody seems to know everybody else

six a day most of the cases were unsolved yesterday and the authorities said the reasons behind many of the crimes were not clear rank and file officers said the surge in violence was partly a result of a brief but oppressive heat wave that made some people irritable , pushed them out of their homes , and increased the number of violent encounters on the street warm weather , more activity , an officer said ms mode rejected that idea she said no clear pattern could be deduced from the reported attacks i would n't make a correlation with the weather , she said all of these incidents appear unrelated , and for the most part they appear to be between people who knew each other we see ups and we see downs , ms mode said the violence after the parade cast a shadow over what had been a

eric bentley , the eminent theater critic , playwright and brecht translator , has cause for celebration his 84th birthday \( which was last thursday \) and the recent publication of a volume of his theater criticism , what is theater \? 19441967 \( hill wang \) most of the essays in this portrait of new york theater , drawn mainly from the 1950 s , appeared in the new republic recently , mr bentley and nathaniel g nesmith , a president s fellow in theater at columbia university s graduate school of arts and sciences , talked in mr bentley s manhattan apartment here are excerpts from their conversation nathaniel g nesmith nowadays it is common for people to bemoan the death of the theater is the theater dying \? eric bentley the theater is dying is something that has been said over and over if it is put as a question , the real meaning is whether mass communication \( movies , television and radio \) has killed off live theater up to now , the answer is resoundingly no but who knows \? everyone today is talking about the internet , the latest threat nothing is eternal the drama is an art that may end sometime if we are going to discuss it from an artistic point of view , i think there is something to the live theater that i would certainly work to preserve when you are in the theater with a living actor , a kind of electric current is established between you and the actor it has to be his presence and , psychologically , this makes for a different experience for the audience for example , acrobats on a high wire if you see it on television , you just watch it but if you are in the theater audience , you are wondering if they are going to fall off ! you do n't know the future now , that is a psychological factor that is present all the time you are in the living present with a not totally certain future nesmith you studied with c s lewis what influence did he have on you \? bentley i was a student of his and i was his assistant when he was sick , i replaced him i took over his students after i graduated there was much more distance between the teacher and the pupil in england than in america although he did not put on airs , i always revered him as if he were a bishop he was very important to me beyond anything academic in that he gave me confidence and selfesteem when i did n't have it he did it in a particularly subtle way it began by him criticizing me devastatingly i felt even less selfrespect then he talked some more and helped me very much i wrote a very pretentious paper \( when you are young and ambitious , you get beyond yourself trying to sound profound and big \) at oxford , you have the wonderfully privileged system of having the teacher s attention alone for an hour you read your stuff to him he takes notes or interrupts he did n't interrupt on this particular occasion when it was over , there was a pause he said , it makes my head swim i asked what was the main trouble he mentioned one or two passages and then he asked what one sentence meant he picked one of the worst sentences to show you how naive i was , i said i lifted that from another critic i did n't understand it , sir , but i thought you would he laughed and said , well , i do n't i asked if any passages were better he said yes then i asked if any passages were really good he said one or two i asked if he would tell me which ones because i really did n't know he got his notes and said the passage about so and so i asked if that was really good he said yes , that was interesting i started to listen and wanted to argue with you i said that was only me talking he said to continue to talk and ignore those other voices lewis persuaded me that i was worth listening to i asked him not to encourage or flatter me because it would do a great deal of harm i said , if you are telling me that this is really good , i want to know if you really believe that our aim at oxford was to get first class honors in the degree , which is difficult to get i was working hard on it he said to me , if you do n't get a first , i do n't know who would i asked if he really believed that \( i did n't feel that i would get it , though i did , as it turned out \) he said , certainly i believe that nesmith what is your fondest theater memory \? bentley well , i do n't have one among the fondest memories is the first shakespeare i saw performed with top actors that would be john gielgud in hamlet and romeo and juliet peggy ashcroft was juliet it was somewhere in the middle 1930 s , when i was a high school student those were revelations of what the theater is , what acting is and what shakespeare is everything together in the simplest way gielgud was at that time an independent actor , with none of these fancy modern interpretations put on shakespeare i felt i was getting the pure shakespearean article by a man who knew how to speak it and act it it was so moving even though it was long ago , i can still see images of particular moments for example i was wondering how he was going to do to be or not to be we had all read hamlet he did it so you had to lipread he did it without his voice he knew all the high schools kids were out front waiting for it i do n't know if he did that every time , but he sure did it for us later on , it was going to berlin and seeing mother courage in the ruins of berlin , directed by brecht there can be no recapturing a moment like that because it was n't just the play but the fact that it was done in berlin , at that moment in time , for that audience it was overpowering for a dramatist who used to pretend that he did n't want to arouse emotions , it was an overwhelmingly emotional occasion nesmith your worst memory \? bentley the worst is forgotten , i think but when i see one of my own plays badly done or misunderstood , it is really painful i would like to walk out but i ca n't because i am the guest or something i have the helpless feeling that i am sitting at my own funeral sitting and seeing one of your own plays being done badly is one of the most unbearable things in life particularly if you think your play is pretty good nesmith of all the roles you have achieved critic , scholar , educator , director , translator , actor , playwright is there one for which you would most like to be remembered \? bentley i have published a lot of things , many volumes if you look at writers in the past , even some of the greatest voltaire , for instance his collected works in the library fill several huge shelves yet all that is read is candide and one or two other short things a man who published thousands of influential pages , he survives by a couple of hundred pages if i am to survive at all , if people read me when i am dead , i would like to be remembered by one of my plays though i do n't know which one photo the critic and scholar eric bentley in his manhattan apartment this month \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
robert mann gallery 210 11th avenue , near 25th street chelsea through march 18 the title of this excellent presentation of works from the 1950 s reflects not only the subject matter stone walls on martha s vineyard and divers in flight but also the paradoxical nature of aaron siskind s art starting in the 1940 s , siskind sought to create a kind of photographic equivalent of abstract painting by getting rid of anecdotal imagery and focusing on flat , boldly frontal subjects one of the works here , a picture of a crumpled , oilstained piece of paper made in 1950 , looks suspiciously like a painting by the photographer s friend willem de kooning , and it is interesting to learn that de kooning owned a copy of the image the paradox is that siskind s works remain traditionally photographic machinemade , crisply focused and transparently illusionistic , they have none of the material immediacy or gestural spontaneity of the painting that inspired them siskind s always perfectly framed boulders or sections of graffitied or peeling walls can make one think of motherwell , kline , twombly and others , but rich as they are , they have an almost clinical sobriety to them they are like specimens collected by a scientist on the other hand , in monumentalizing pictures of bare feet , formality is animated by a comical strangeness that verges on the surrealistic and in pictures of young men diving , the subjects are at once frozen , emblematic shapes on white squares and exhilarating images of the expressive freedom that one suspects the photographer envied in his painter friends ken johnson
garden city , ny , sept 29 the owner of one long island company has pleaded guilty to cheating workers out of 300 , 000 in wages , and two officials at another company face similar charges that they underpaid workers by nearly 780 , 000 , the authorities said today in the first case , ralph garofalo of huntington pleaded guilty on wednesday to a felony count of scheming to defraud and a misdemeanor count of willful failure to pay prevailing wages the prevailing wage includes union pay , overtime and other benefits required of contractors who work on public projects the charges stemmed from a 1998 investigation of garofalo carting inc , a garbage carting company in brentwood , said james m catterson jr , the suffolk county district attorney as part of his plea , mr garofalo is expected to be sentenced to one and a half to three years in prison , mr catterson said sentencing is scheduled for nov 21 mr garofalo and the company have agreed to pay 300 , 000 in restitution to the workers as part of a settlement with the federal labor department in a separate case , douglas and carolann ryan of massapequa have been indicted on charges that they withheld 779 , 000 from employees of trade wind plumbing inc , mr catterson said the ryans pleaded not guilty on thursday mr catterson said plumbers employed by their company were underpaid between january 1998 and may of this year the workers were assigned to projects awarded by the suffolk county water authority as well as by fire , library and school systems from melville to east hampton , he said the ryans were arraigned on a 160count indictment resulting from an investigation they knew about for several months , said david s smith , a lawyer who represents trade wind plumbing and its principal , mr ryan they have entered pleas of not guilty to all charges , and we are confident that at the end of this case they will be acquitted , mr smith said this is a small company that will survive this unfortunate , lengthy and costly process melvyn k roth , a lawyer for ms ryan , said i think in the end they will be vindicated they are reputable people they run a good business during the investigation , the wife of one of the plumbers told an investigator that her husband worked three jobs just to make rent payments , mr catterson said these are people who are looking for day work , mr catterson said if they get it steady , none of them are in a bargaining position
boston , april 2 the massachusetts attorney general is to announce on monday that he will begin carrying out the strictest and most comprehensive handgun safety laws in the nation , banning all gun makers and dealers doing business in the state from selling handguns that do not have tamperproof serial numbers , trigger locks and safety devices enabling a user to know whether the gun is loaded the regulations , issued under massachusetts s consumer protection laws , will also prohibit the sale of all socalled saturday night specials , cheap handguns favored by criminals and they will require new devices that make it impossible for handguns to be fired by children under age 6 officials in the massachusetts attorney general s office say they do not know how many handguns for sale by the 700 federally licensed dealers in the state are in compliance with the rules , but they estimate that a large percentage are not so on monday they will begin inspections of dealers to issue warnings against the sale of any guns that do not meet the standards and will send similar warnings to gun makers and wholesalers nationwide from now on , an official said , the sale of any handgun that does not meet the new standards will be subject to a 5 , 000 fine and possible contempt of court penalties the rules are the first consumer protection regulations in the country to concentrate on handgun safety , said state officials and dr garen wintemute , director of the violence prevention research project at the university of california at davis and an authority on gun safety i think it s a wonderful idea , said dr wintemute fundamentally , firearms are a consumer product by contrast , dr wintemute pointed out , congress specifically exempted the gun industry from regulation by the federal consumer product safety commission the action by the massachusetts attorney general , tom reilly , is the latest of several recent blows to the gun industry , which for years had largely succeeded in warding off gun control laws and lawsuits through the power of the national rifle association in congress and state legislatures over the past year and a half , 30 cities and counties have sued the gun industry , charging it with negligently distributing guns in ways that help criminals buy them two weeks ago smith wesson , the nation s oldest and largest handgun manufacturer , in springfield , mass , announced that it had agreed to many restrictions in exchange for ending some of the suits then on wednesday the attorneys general of new york , connecticut and maryland said they had begun antitrust investigations of the gun industry because of evidence that some companies and dealers were conspiring against smith wesson in reaction to its willingness to compromise an official of the massachusetts attorney general s office said today he hoped the new regulations here would be the sharpest blow yet to the gun industry the rules were originally issued in 1997 by former attorney general scott harshbarger , but were tied up in court appeals by gun companies until last week several major handgun manufacturers will be able to meet some of the new rules , but officials said they believed none would be in compliance with all the regulations and a number of gun makers have resisted many of the key provisions , so it is difficult to predict what will happen when the state begins enforcement among the provisions are that all handguns sold within massachusetts be equipped with trigger locks and devices that make it impossible for children under 6 to pull the trigger , that they have serial numbers that cannot be removed , and that they not be made from cheap materials which make them prone to accidents the guns also must have load indicators to show whether the gun is loaded as well as magazine safety disconnects to prevent accidental firing if there is a bullet in the chamber even though the magazine has been removed dr wintemute said that less than one quarter of all handgun models had load indicators or magazine disconnects a general accounting office study of accidental shootings found that 30 percent of them could have been prevented with the devices , dr wintemute said
indianapolis , april 1 florida is a young , exuberant basketball team that loves to run and trap and press but when the game gets gritty , the gators get greedy ask north carolina the tar heels threw their size , experience and tradition at florida the gators snapped back in fact , there was little florida could not handle on its way to a relentless 7159 victory over north carolina here in the rca dome that showed why florida \( 297 \) is in the national championship game it meets michigan state here on monday night for the title we tried to get the game up and down the floor , so brendan haywood could not sit on the post and hurt us , florida coach billy donovan said , referring to north carolina s center once the pace was increased , carolina did n't get the ball as much into his hands we were a little disruptive i think you have to ask carolina if they were tired carolina certainly looked tired and carolina coach bill guthridge did not deny it i think they just wore us out , he said that s the first time this year we 've been in foul trouble we 've played six players most of this year and it did n't affect us they threw waves at us , and it was a factor florida threw a trap at north carolina on the court and in the tar heels' minds that turned the game its way the gators pressured north carolina \( 2214 \) all night with a variety of fullcourt presses , and the result was 17 carolina turnovers florida made sure the game was played in a speed and pace that it likes and , most of all , florida baited carolina into serious foul trouble guard joseph forte and forward jason capel fouled out in the final minutes for carolina both played most of the second half in foul trouble so did point guard ed cota even haywood \( 20 points , 12 rebounds \) played a long time with four fouls it was florida s quickness , and its deep bench , that pushed carolina to fouls and to the brink the florida bench outscored carolina s by 372 while nearly all of the carolina starters played at least 35 minutes apiece , florida kept rotating , using its numbers , remaining fresh and putting the tar heels in a bind we stuck with our game plan , and our style of play is to wear the other guys out , said florida forward donnell harvey the foul trouble hurt them , but they were also getting tired we 're used to that florida is the first fifthseeded team to advance to the championship game over the last two seasons , florida is 317 when it limits its opponents to 70 or fewer points florida s pressing defense paid dividends once the tar heels crossed halfcourt and began to run their offense north carolina made only 20 of 57 shots \( 351 percent \) , its worst shooting performance of the season balance was florida s staple three players \( mike miller , udonis haslem and brett nelson \) scored in double figures , and florida shot 391 percent from the floor north carolina , the longtime atlantic coast conference power , had won seven straight games over teams from the southeastern conference but florida was too balanced , too focused , too fresh it matched carolina in rebounds and showed its quickness with nine steals , compared with only three for carolina ten gators played 13 or more minutes all 10 scored my team was n't confident with me playing with four fouls , said cota , who scored 9 points , grabbed 8 rebounds and made 8 assists in 39 minutes i was n't that comfortable with it , either i had to back off my man and give up some open shots my teammates might have gotten tired , but i felt ok it was the fouls that was the trouble we got off to a bad start and that made it easier for their second team to come in relaxed for the first eight minutes of the game , florida worked its game plan to perfection nelson swiped the ball away from haywood under the goal major parker did the same , helping haywood commit three firsthalf turnovers pressure , solid post defense and consecutive 3pointers by nelson and forward kenyan weaks gave florida an 183 lead five minutes into the game then , what florida feared materialized haywood began to exert himself , establishing the paint as his own haywood led the nation this season in fieldgoal percentage , making 655 percent of his shots of course , being 7 feet tall , he can usually stand near the basket and simply flick it in or dunk it he did a little of both and brought carolina back his 5of6 floor shooting and 16 firsthalf points led all scorers , and carolina closed the gap to 2117 with 8 15 left the gators led by 3734 at halftime but even at this juncture , florida s depth was a factor the gators' bench scored 22 points , compared with none for the carolina bench in the first half that has been a trend for florida it arrived at the final four with 10 players who had averaged 13 or more minutes a game so young with 11 freshmen and sophomores on its roster florida loves to run it rode its speed and quickness this season to an average of 846 points a game \( fourth best in the nation \) , to a 162 pointspergame scoring margin \( fifth in the nation \) and to a schoolrecord 351 steals our guys have done a tremendous job of being focused and being willing to learn , donovan said we 're a young team , but who s to say our time is n't now \? we know that michigan state can play the game any way you want to play it we 're excited about being one win away from a championship photos florida s brett nelson driving past north carolina s joseph forte last night \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg 3 \) florida s mike miller driving under the basket

east rutherford , nj from the front door of the devils' home rink , a hockey fan can look east and see the skyline of manhattan , so near and yet so far with national hockey league headquarters and major news media outlets located among those tall buildings , the stanley cup finals featuring a local team ought to be a big deal and they are important in dallas , the home of the visiting team , and in many other cities across north america and even europe but the last round of the tournament is not so special in the devils' backyard , not really just as the empire state building defines the skyline , new york s hockey consciousness is dominated by the rangers , even when they lose and miss the playoffs for three consecutive seasons under wasteful and selfdeluded management with the devils holding a 10 lead going into game 2 of the finals tonight at the meadowlands , the attention of most local hockey fans will instead be on madison square garden there , glen sather , the former president and general manager of the edmonton oilers , is expected to be introduced as the new chief executive of the rangers this ranger business is a hockey story so compelling that even the basketball buffs who dominate sportstalk radio might mention it between gusts of wind about the knicks so before returning to the devilsstars and other topics , let us consider the positive and negative spins around the hiring of sather , through the prism of the recent history of the edmontonnew york pipeline positive spin the hiring of sather will be like neil smith s acquisition of mark messier from the oilers in 1991 back then , skeptics said messier s best years were behind him , that he was coming to new york only for fame and money and that the rangers were foolishly trying to buy a trophy in fact , messier s leadership skills reached new heights as a ranger his era at the garden featured some of the most successful and interesting teams in franchise history at age 56 , with five championships on his resume , sather will seize the new york challenge in the messier manner and reinvigorate a franchise that is crucial to the league s success sather is still smart , bold and crafty and now he has the money with which to use those tools within five years , sather s rangers will be playing in the finals and commanding the attention of even casual fans and news media negative spin the hiring of sather will be like neil smith s acquisition of wayne gretzky , the former oiler , in 1996 back then , boosters insisted gretzky still had great things to offer , that he was coming to new york not for money and selfgratification but for another chance to play for a champion in fact , gretzky s seasons in new york were anticlimactic for him and mostly dismal for the team the gretzky era at the garden featured some of the worst and leastspirited teams in franchise history and so will the sather era at age 56 , sather has five championships on his resume , but none since 1990 his arrogant bluster has disguised a decade of poor drafting , mediocre trading and excusemaking to rival neil smith s his era at the garden will resemble gretzky s in terms of false hype and dashed hope in five years , after wasting millions of dollars on him , the garden will seek sather s replacement as both the rangers and the nhl struggle for recognition in their own backyard so there as for the finals , let us assume dallas will provide a better show than it did in a 73 defeat tuesday night goalie ed belfour , claiming cold symptoms and aftereffects of medication , is experienced enough to bounce back derian hatcher , the big captain and defenseman who left the game with a knee injury , said he is almost certain to return some of their veterans know how to relax after practice today , they headed for the yankee game as the players bustled around the arena for practice and news conferences , the nearby airports were filled with hockey talent , young and notsoyoung the top teenage prospects were arriving for a luncheon yesterday to introduce them and promote the draft in late june in calgary some hockey officials here for the series made a day trip to montreal for the funeral of maurice richard , the great canadien whose death has prompted a moment of deep reflection within the hockey community dallas general manager bob gainey , like richard a former montreal captain , attended the funeral and said the streets around the cathedral were lined with people who wanted to be a part of it and to show a sincere and moving response it had both the sadness of a passing and the joy of celebration , gainey said of the ceremony ron maclean , a commentator for hockey night in canada , made the trip with don cherry , his colleague maclean said it was moving to see players like gordie howe in attendance and jean beliveau as a pallbearer by evening , all had returned the new day would bring hopeful kids on display and current stars on ice at night a news conference at a rink across the river would promise a better , brighter future even in this bigtime basketball market , hockey seems alive , if one only cares to seek it photo glen sather had lots of success in edmonton , just not recently \( associated press \)
although most boxing aficionados will be concerned only with lennox lewis s ability to defend twothirds of the world heavyweight title against michael grant tonight at madison square garden , others will be scrutinizing the new york state athletic commission s attempt to strengthen its punch , alias its credibility once upon a time , when the garden had weekly , or monthly , friday night fights , the new york commission was the most respected in boxing but with the absence of regular garden cards , the commission s clout slowly disintegrated no fights , no strength and , worse , no respect when the cablevision honchos tried to restore the garden s reputation as the mecca of boxing , outside promoters like don king and bob arum moved in as if the commission did n't exist and for all practical purposes , it did n't now that its apathy has been exposed , the commission is desperate to regain its authority this will be the garden s first heavyweight title bout since the commotion over the debatable draw between lewis and evander holyfield early last year that provoked investigations by a state senate committee and the manhattan district attorney this is also the garden s first card since arturo gatti s weight was announced as the prescribed 141 pounds at a feb 25 weighin , the day before he knocked out joey gamache in the second round on an hbo bathroom scale the night of the bout he weighed 160 gamache , who was hospitalized for two nights with a concussion and has said he will never fight again , has threatened to sue the commission and its executive director , tony russo , alleging fraud and negligence expect an inspection of the scorecards of tonight s three titlebout judges steven weisfeld of union , nj , and melvina latham of ardsley , ny \( who are licensed in new york \) , and the socalled neutral judge , anek hongtongkam , imported from thailand for the occasion the referee will be arthur mercante jr , who worked the lewisholyfield draw according to mel southard , the chairman of the state commission , none of the judges are attached to the international boxing federation , whose president , robert w lee , is now on trial in newark on federal charges of bribery and racketeering lee recommended the atlantic city judge eugenia williams , who somehow had holyfield ahead of lewis on her scorecard in their bout weisfield has judged about 15 world championship bouts , lathan about 20 , southard said hongtongkam , a longtime world boxing council judge , has judged over 20 championship bouts as for the weighin , the 6foot7inch grant was 250 pounds and the 65 lewis was 247 on thursday , but with heavyweights , the poundage is immaterial because there is no limit boxers in other divisions should be weighed the day of the fight , as they always were years ago until promoters realized that earlier weighins provided another prefight story and television highlights the other boxers on tonight s card , notably junior jones of brooklyn and paul ingle of england in the ibf featherweight title bout , will step on the scale at 9 this morning , as they should , at the commissioner offices at 123 william street , not far from city hall with a knockout , lewis or grant would make the evaluation of the appointed judges' scorecards academic in his 3511 record , lewis , who will automatically be stripped of the world boxing association title as soon as he steps into the ring for not having defended against john ruiz , has 27 knockouts grant has 22 in his 310 record lewis , unbeaten since his 1994 knockout by oliver mccall , still has a feared right hand , but he sometimes gets too casual what i learned from the two holyfield fights , said don turner , who trains grant and holyfield , was that lewis does n't like rough fights for a change , lewis will be looking up slightly at an opponent , but he considers that to be an advantage my height should be a problem for him , lewis said , because he s not used to fighting guys my size grant is also not accustomed to fighting boxers of lewis s experience , but if the 27yearold challenger can avoid the big mistake , such as dropping his hands , his heavy punches could detach lewis from the title and ease the commission s credibility photo michael grant , left , will face lennox lewis \( reuters \)
sydney , australia , sept 23 between the bodysuits and the 15 world records and the routine brilliance of two dutch swimmers named inge de bruijn and pieter van den hoogenband , it was an unusual olympic meet but when it came down to the final two events of the final day , it ended as olympic meets almost always end with the americans dominating the medley relays the women went first , with b j bedford , megan quann , jenny thompson and dara torres smashing china s sixyearold world mark by more than 3 seconds to finish in 3 minutes 5830 seconds the men went last , with lenny krayzelburg , ed moses , ian crocker and gary hall jr improving on the united states' fouryearold world mark by more than a second to finish in 3 3373 it was an appropriate finish to a competition that was both a fan s and a statistician s delight though a greater number of countries are producing remarkable swimmers the netherlands in particular the united states remains the lone superpower despite concerns about the team s inexperience , about the strength of ian thorpe and the australian men , and about the small time gap between the united states olympic trials and the games , the americans put together their most impressive collective performance in the pool since montreal in 1976 both the men and the women finished atop the medal and goldmedal counts , and the american team s 14 gold medals were its most since 1972 in a nonboycotted olympics \( the americans won 21 in los angeles in 1984 , the year the soviet union and most other eastern european nations boycotted \) the american team s 33 medals in sydney were its most in a nonboycotted games since 1976 , when it won 34 when faced with a worthy opponent , it forces you to get your act together and step up , hall said in reference to australia we were able to use that threat of being dethroned as the best swimming nation as motivation to reach a level that otherwise we might not have reached it was a remarkably balanced effort the only americans to win two individual gold medals were krayzelburg , who swept both men s backstroke events , and brooke bennett , who won the women s 400 and 800 freestyles the rest of the individual victories ranged from the predictable \( tom dolan in the 400 individual medley tom malchow in the 200 butterfly \) to the mildly surprising \( quann in the 100 breaststroke hall and anthony ervin , who tied for gold in the 50 free \) to the very surprising \( misty hyman in the 200 butterfly \) but the success did not come only at the top of the pyramid according to dennis pursley , the united states national team director , more than 50 percent of the american swimmers improved on their personal bests in the games in seoul in 1998 , that figure was down in the 20 s and in atlanta it was in the 40 s , pursley said we really clicked here , and it was like a club team or college team where everybody gets in on the action we had people from lane 8 grabbing a medal it was n't just two or three superstars getting the job done superstars were the explanation for the unprecedented success of the netherlands , a country with only a handful of fulltime elite swimming coaches and only about 20 , 000 registered competitive swimmers compared with the united states' 220 , 000 and australia s 100 , 000 de bruijn and van den hoogenband were a twoheaded medal detector , combining for five individual golds and five world records on saturday , de bruijn , who had never won a medal in an olympics or a world longcourse championships until sydney , won her third gold medal , holding off the silver medalist therese alshammer of sweden and the 33yearold dara torres of the united states to win the 50 free in 2432 seconds , 19 100ths of a second slower than the world record she set in friday s semifinals a 27yearold who declined to compete in the last olympics because she was unmotivated and out of shape and afraid she might embarrass herself , de bruijn has now broken or rebroken 11 world records in the last six months before the olympics i thought all my world records could n't be broken , and i broke them all here , de bruijn said they 're all going bananas back in the netherlands they are even letting children out of school to watch the olympics it s getting crazy usually it s only soccer in the netherlands now everyone is talking about swimming because of what we 've done here it s a great feeling the home team also had its moments , none more memorable than thorpe s phenomenal freestyle anchor leg on opening night to give the australians a victory over the americans in the 4x100 freestyle relay but while it finished with five gold medals and 18 overall medals , australia did not entirely live up to its premeet potential thorpe was beaten by van den hoogenband in the 200 susie o'neill was upset by hyman , and neither michael klim nor geoff huegill won the 100 fly that honor went to lars froelander of sweden but there was still enough gold and more than enough emotion to give the eight consecutive sellout crowds their australian dollar s worth , and in the men s 1 , 500 freestyle today , the australians grant hackett and kieren perkins were accompanied by a constant roar the enormously popular perkins was trying to become the first man to win the same event in three consecutive olympics , but though he managed to break 15 minutes in the semifinal and improve on that slightly in the final , it was only good enough for silver hackett , who like perkins hails from the northern state of queensland , would win the gold in 14 4833 perkins finished in 14 5359 well short of his sixyearold world record of 14 4166 the american chris thompson finished third in a nationalrecord time of 14 5681 i hope grant appreciates it as much as the rest of the team does , perkins said of the opportunity to swim in sydney because no matter what any of us do in the rest of our careers , or what we 've done before the last eight days , will never come close to it just because of this place and this atmosphere it s quite exceptional the question that continues to nag swimming is whether all the exceptional times and performances are legitimate though blood testing was introduced in sydney in an attempt to detect the banned synthetic hormone known as epo , pursley said he was disappointed that only 4 of the 48 american swimmers here were required to submit to blood tests i 'd like to see us get to a point where every swimmer is blood tested , he said pursley also indicated that the percentage of american swimmers who were administered urine tests during the competition was the same as in 1996 we were expecting to see a lot more , he said it does bother us we would like to see a lot more aggressive effort our big fear is there is going to be some complacency because we do n't see the big mass use by a whole team of swimmers as we did with the chinese and east germany if people sit back and think we 've got it beat , we 're going to be right back to where we were , if not worse , and we may be already no better off , pursley said it may just be spread out i do n't

hartford , march 2 ten months after the new england patriots backed out of a 375 million deal that would have made hartford a star in the national football league s constellation of football cities , connecticut finally got some payback today exactly 2 , 399 , 06066 that is the amount the league wired to connecticut this afternoon to settle an embarrassing episode for the state and gov john g rowland , the foremost champion of the deal that evaporated almost overnight last april it called for the state to finance a new stadium for the patriots in exchange for a 30year lease the money compensates the state for costs incurred during the preliminary stages of negotiations with robert k kraft , the team s owner , mr rowland said the amount includes 667 , 000 that the state paid to study the environmental impact of a new stadium on a slice of downtown envisioned as the site of a sweeping redevelopment known as adriaen s landing there s finality to this the check has even been sent directly to us , mr rowland told reporters during a news conference outside the governor s mansion today as far as i'm concerned , this chapter of all of our lives is concluded and none too soon for the governor , who suffered one of the worst defeats of his career last april after mr kraft decided to try to keep his team in massachusetts after all but promising to relocate to hartford mr kraft made his decision just three days after massachusetts legislators offered him a 70 million subsidy to help build a new stadium at the team s home in foxboro , south of boston i think we made the best of a situation that perhaps many of us wished might have been different , but i think it does bring closure , said the state attorney general , richard blumenthal , one of three connecticut officials to sign the agreement with the nfl in the 10 months since the deal collapsed , mr blumenthal had been looking into the possibility of suing the team or the league for essentially using hartford as leverage in massachusetts but any legal action , mr blumenthal said , would have been very costly , timeconsuming , difficult and uncertain , and today s agreement prevents the state from seeking any further remedy in court calls today to the patriots organization were referred to the league , which declined to discuss details of the settlement we appreciate the state s participation in the goodfaith negotiations that achieved a fair compromise of the interests of all concerned , paul tagliabue , the league s commissioner , said in a twoparagraph printed statement today one of the sticking points in the months of negotiations between the state and the nfl was whether mr kraft would be responsible for paying any part of a settlement cost today s agreement makes no reference to any amount the team might pay , though mr blumenthal said some of the 24 million settlement would probably be paid back to the league by the team mr rowland noted the coincidental nature of today s announcement , coming one day before he is to introduce the state s plans to turn the adriaen s landing site , still occupied by an aging steam plant , into a shopping and entertainment mall but mr rowland played down the betrayal he and many state lawmakers felt in the weeks after their bid for the patriots collapsed it was a risk worth taking , he said we knew from day one that maybe we 're being played against other states asked if he was still angry , mr rowland shrugged no , he responded , and i never really was photo gov john g rowland of connecticut , left , with state attorney general richard blumenthal , announced a settlement yesterday with the nfl \( associated press \)
montauk , ny bang ! the fishing went off at montauk one recent afternoon overnight , the coast teemed with feeding fish blues , albacore and stripers my guide , as she had been for most of the summer , was amanda switzer of three mile harbor amanda is a born angler she has that sense that there will be fish here and not there , that a cast in the next second but not five seconds later will catch a fish , and that she may ease upon a school of feeding stripers if she cuts the engine now and glides toward shore i have been fishing much longer than she has i have fished many more places occasionally , i can cast farther still , time after time , so many times that i know it s not an accident , she has taken three fish to my one , four fish to my none we puttputted out of montauk harbor the sleepy summer port showed signs of energizing for the fall commercial fishermen in boats large and small made their way out of the harbor amanda waved to a friend who towed his rusty but reliable old trawler to the boatyard outside the jetty , two fishing boats , draggers' nets hanging from their sides , made their way from three mile harbor obviously , they had heard of the goings on at montauk as well we headed for the point the remnants of a tropical storm were bearing in from the south , and we hoped for a two or threehour window of fishing before the seas built too much for her flats skiff in the distance , we saw a few boats in the tidal rip that had formed past the lighthouse when we rounded the point , there was a flotilla of boats of all sizes extended as far as i could see a picket line of surfcasters ranged along the shore mobile homes crouched on the cliff tops like a row of pillboxes guarding the coast bunker , or perhaps snapper blues , leapt from the rip , desperate to escape predators amanda cut her engines she took up her rod she is a lefty who learned her flyfishing on saltwater , so her cast has none of the frantic to and fro that betrays trout fishermen who take up saltwater flyfishing after years on the stream a pod of albacore came up in back of us in unison , we wheeled and fired , like grouse hunters pointing and shooting at the sound of flushing birds amanda was quicker than i was she connected as the fish swirled with operatic enthusiasm i tried another cast but had no time to fish it out as amanda pointed her rod toward the front of the boat and , looking for all the world like a neophyte water skier holding on for dear life , she ran forward , around the bow and then back to the rear as the albie dashed for safety , and amanda tried to keep it from doubling over and breaking her rod the school of albacore , as is their habit , moved up and down the beach , returning every 15 minutes , a halfmile circuit we chased them for an hour good , but not amazing , amanda said let s head east and see what s happening we moved out at full throttle the warm southern wind felt soft the air shimmered with the frosted glass look that dekooning and his painter friends called long island light one of the last tshirt days , amanda added as we approached the cliffs just west of the point , we saw paul dixon , amanda s mentor , and the dean of east end flyrodding somehow he always knows where the fish are he gestured to us we looked ahead of him there in the rocks next to the shore the black forms of bass en masse churned the water surrounding them , large bluefish picked off bait that had escaped the mayhem of the stripers i cast into the school i was a little short a bluefish struck five minutes later all 8 pounds of him went into the cooler on the next pass , i took the helm and amanda picked up her rod bang ! a 34inch bass slammed her fly i backed us out , and she fought the fish to the boat we crept in on the school again , and again , and again every approach produced a good bass then other boats started to show up the only way to fish this small pod of big fish was for one boat to move in , hook up and back out it became a bit of a circle dance we waited back from the pack a huge school of large bass came up in back of us we circled and drifted into them and within two or three casts we were both into keeper fish we landed them amanda stood on the stern , spread her arms and cracked a grin as wide as a pie plate you can have a whole month of crummy fishing , and then this , she said we fished until we had our fill , and when we left the bass were still working that night , i panroasted the bass in a corn meal crust and topped it with a salad of diced tomato , watermelon , celery leaves and chili oil a cold riesling went down perfectly on this first perfect striper day of the season
st john s accepted a bid yesterday to play football in the division iaa northeast conference , clearing the way for the school to offer scholarships in that sport for the first time st john s began football as a club sport in 1972 under coach bob ricca , went to division iii in 1979 and then moved to division iaa in 1993 st john s played last year as a nonscholarship independent after five years in the metro atlantic athletic conference the northeast conference voted last october to allow its members to give a limited amount of needbased aid to football players schools can offer up to 10 partial or full scholarships a year depending on financial hardship , and up to 30 players can be on scholarship in the program it s certainly going to have an impact , said ricca , the only football coach st john s has ever had how much , we do n't know st john s signed a oneyear commitment to the nec and begins conference play sept 9 against st francis \( pa \) the red storm has the option to sign for three more years by dec 1 the other conference members are the fourtime defending champion robert morris , wagner , monmouth , central connecticut , sacred heart , albany and stony brook last season , the red storm posted a 74 record , leading division iaa in scoring defense by allowing just 129 points a game ricca said that while he doubted the team would now dominate defensively the way it had as an independent , he and the players were elated to be competing for a conference championship ricca , who has a 141851 record , said he was not using all 10 scholarships this season , and that none were a full package , which would include 15 , 000 tuition ricca said he planned to use seven or eight scholarships a year this will enable us to draw some of the best young talent in the country , rocca said however , st john s is not aspiring to be a fullscholarship division iaa program like hofstra we 're at where we 're at , said ed manetta jr , the athletic director we 're happy playing at this level this is good competition
st john s opened the omar cook era at madison square garden last night , and the freshman point guard showed how valuable he could be cook designed the play that would stun no 12 kentucky , 6261 , in the coaches for cancer ikon classic then he had to persuade coach mike jarvis to use his idea coach almost did n't let me run it , cook said jarvis called his freshman coach for a day kentucky led by 6159 when tayshaun prince let marvin stone s inbounds pass go off his hands and out of bounds under the st john s basket with 64 seconds left the red storm freshman willie shaw was draped over prince on the play but officials did not call a foul , allowing the game to be decided on the floor on the sideline , cook described his plan as the teams traded timeouts he spotted kentucky leaning to one side on st john s inbound plays and wanted to take advantage so anthony glover faked and cut back to the basket , receiving cook s pass on the right side glover rose for a layup over freshman jason parker to make it 6161 and parker was called for a foul glover made the free throw to give st john s a 1point lead it was a good play , glover said simply st john s secured the victory when the kentucky freshman cliff hawkins , a littleused reserve , lost the ball while trying to get off a shot as the buzzer sounded glover followed with a spring around the court as cook sought out his family st john s will play kansas in tonight s championship game kansas , ranked seventh in the associated press s preseason poll , held on for a 9998 victory over no 17 ucla in the first game cook was still limping 20 minutes after the game eight minutes into the second half , he drove the lane to try a layup but collided with kentucky s 6foot9inch sophomore marquis estill under the basket cook fell onto his back on the baseline , cringing and clutching his right leg as reggie jessie and glover carried him to the bench cook sustained a cramp in his right calf and later wore an ice pack cook returned two and a half minutes later , still limping but with the score unchanged he scored only 1 point in the final 9 31 and clanked a long 3point attempt off the front of the rim in the final minute with st john s trailing , 6057 i saw everyone walking out of the gym and i started to get a little frustrated , cook said the game ai n't over yet kentucky ate the clock before prince hit the second of two foul shots for a 4point advantage with 226 seconds left glover s putback dunk with 82 seconds left pulled st john s within 6159 and set up kentucky s turnover cook finished his college debut with 18 points and hit 5 of 11 3point attempts he recorded five assists but made six turnovers when the team is down , it s my job to pick us up , cook said i was there giving people the ball , playing defense i shot the ball well tonight and the team started to pick up along the way glover led st john s with 21 points and six rebounds st john s was outrebounded , 4232 , and kentucky big men marvin stone and marquis estill combined for 29 points jarvis s stellar recruiting class included several talented big men , but none stood out last night they allowed kentucky repeated second chances and could n't finish cook s brilliant passes often , they seemed in competition to see who could collect fouls quicker kansas and ucla had already given fans a glimpse of what this season promises the flight of many players to the national basketball association has created a college game of youth and unpredictability with a new push by officials to limit rough play , the offenses dominated the first game kansas seemed almost embarrassed in explaining how it allowed ucla to hit 542 percent \( 13 of 24 \) of its threepointers but the bruins could n't make a 15footer when it mattered they had a chance to take the lead in the final minute when kansas senior eric chenowith s offensive foul away from the ball brought ucla s matt barnes to the foul line with his team down , 9392 but barnes missed both free throws and kansas guard kirk hinrich made a pair of foul shots on the other end for a 9592 jayhawks lead with 233 seconds left barnes had another chance at the line but made only the second of two shots kansas added 2 points and eventually an openingnight victory earl watson hit a 3point shot at the buzzer to bring ucla within one we feel very fortunate to get this one , kansas coach roy williams said after his first game since turning down a chance to coach at north carolina last summer it s a heck of a basketball game to start the year after kansas opened with a 162 run , ucla s allamerican candidate , jason kapono , a sophomore , led the rally unlike other underclassmen , kapono withdrew his name 12 days before the nba draft in june kapono scored 22 points and hit 6 of 9 3pointers the freshman tj cummings led ucla with 24 points kenny gregory , a 6foot5 swingman , led six kansas scorers in double digits with 24 points hinrich added 21 , and when he hit a 3pointer in front of the kansas bench to give the jayhawks an 8170 lead with under 10 minutes left , he ran up court while pointing to the garden ceiling photos anthony glover dunking a rebound with 82 seconds left he won the game with a 3point play with five seconds left \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) kirk hinrich scored 21 points to help kansas defeat ucla and reach the final of the

it is n't every day that you get to talk about legal negotiations in which the silent partner is the angel of death that may seem like a melodramatic way to begin , but the description is accurate all the same officially , the ones at the table are lawyers , representing swiss commercial banks and holocaust victims their task is to get all the jots and tittles straight on a 1998 agreement by the banks to pay 125 billion in restitution for their how to put it politely \? dubious behavior during and after world war ii the reason this becomes a new york story is that the agreement needs the blessing of the courts , and that assignment happens to fall to a federal judge in brooklyn , edward r korman it is up to judge kor man not only to say that the 1998 deal is fair but also to approve a plan for distributing the money to many tens of thousands of holocaust survivors with claims against the swiss expectations early on were that the cash would have been flowing by now but it is n't , and it may not until the end of the year , at the earliest the judge has been unable to get the ball rolling because the lawyers have yet to settle all the details leaving aside for a moment the question of who s to blame , the delay means a good deal more than losing a few months this is where the hovering presence of the angel of death is felt with every month that is frittered away , hundreds of people who are supposed to benefit from the agreement die , maybe even a couple of thousand the world jewish congress puts the number of survivors at roughly 500 , 000 worldwide , including 40 , 000 in the new york region the congress also estimates that 10 percent of them are now dying every year you do the grim math the high cost of delay is evident at self help community services , a new york agency that assists people who were persecuted by the nazis in the 1930 s and 40 s selfhelp says that 58 percent of those knocking on its doors are 80 or older , women and men painfully aware that the clock is running y ou 're faced with this horrible dilemma , which says that if we do n't do it quickly , what s the point \? said gideon taylor , executive vice president of the claims conference , which represents jewish holocaust survivors in seeking restitution not only from the swiss but also from germany and austria mind you , jews were not the nazis' only victims gypsies , jehovah s witnesses , homosexuals and people with physical or mental disabilities were among those who suffered they , too , are covered by the swiss deal the claims against the banks are based on powerful evidence that they behaved dishonorably , despite switzerland s professed neutrality during the war money and valuables deposited with them for safekeeping against the marauding nazis disappeared into the maw of the swiss system , with bankers saying later that they did n't know a thing when the restitution issue built up steam a few years ago , the swiss bankers' association said it could find fewer than 800 accounts belonging to jews and others who were persecuted the batteries on their calculators must have been low last december , a commission led by paul a volcker , a former chairman of the federal reserve board , uncovered 54 , 000 accounts linked to victims of the nazis that figure was later revised to 46 , 000 since december , there have been tough negotiations over whether the banks would also allow access to even more information , through databases on several million accounts from the nazi era disagreements arose as well on issues affecting others entitled to compensation refugees who were turned away at the swiss border , for example , and slave laborers for companies that may have banked in switzerland each step of the way has been tortured , and lawyers for survivors put full blame on the swiss it s been immensely frustrating negotiating with them , said burt neu borne , the survivors' lead lawyer it was like plunging your fist into a bowl of jello you punch it and make a hole , but as soon as you withdraw your fist the hole fills up again roger m witten , a washingtonbased lawyer for the banks , denies trying to keep the pace slow everybody is really trying to get this right so that it s not challenged later , he said judge korman is understood to be greatly frustrated , too but it now seems that the negotiations are far enough along that his approval of the agreement could come in a few days it would be none too soon the angel of death is not known for patience
thirtyone years ago today , an upstart team from an upstart league in a relatively new event called the super bowl shook the sports world with one of the great upsets in pro football history the new york jets of the american football league upset the heavily favored baltimore colts , 167 , in super bowl iii at the orange bowl in miami frank ramos was the jets' 30yearold public relations director he was in shock like everyone else over the dramatic events of jan 12 , 1969 he was hired as the pr director in 1963 , the same year leon hess became one of the owners of the team three decades later , the orange bowl is a relic , the colts are in indianapolis , baltimore has the ravens , the super bowl is an orgy and as of yesterday , the hess family no longer owns the new york jets ramos was at national football league headquarters in manhattan yesterday , effectively presiding over the final hours of the hess legacy as the league s finance committee announced who had won the bidding for the jets robert wood johnson iv ramos , noting this departure from 36 years with the hess family , described the day as bittersweet i miss him on a regular basis , ramos said of hess , who died last may his presence was always felt and his direction was always felt hess was a benevolent owner , a man who often made the wrong choice for head coach and kept bad coaches too long he saw the jets as family on a day when the business community was still buzzing about america online s billiondollar acquisition of time warner , the national football league owners voted overwhelmingly to stay true to the league s founding roots they selected the philanthropist johnson over the media mogul charles f dolan , whose several media holdings and teams made conglomeratewary owners wary for all the complexities of the sale , longsuffering jets fans simply want to know who will coach their team will the jets' journey toward the promised land continue \? is this chaos no defensive coordinator , a franchise held hostage by its former head coach a temporary interlude \? in many ways , the new owner is like a man who buys a dream house what sold him on it , though , was the tiffany chandelier in the dining room as he is moving in , he discovers that the chandelier is not included in the price that it costs an extra million parcells is the chandelier in the short run , he is the only coach who can keep the jets headed in a championship direction he knows it johnson should know it the jets went from a 115 nightmare in 1996 under rich kotite to the american conference championship game in 1998 under parcells progress comes at a price , and it is not a pretty sight pro football is a barracuda s life for all of hess s benevolence , only when he turned the reins over to the bullying , aggressive parcells did the program kick into gear the price paid , of course , has been the cloakanddagger escapades of parcells and bill belichick , the wheeling and dealing , betrayals and counterbetrayals bluster and team hijacking now you hear al groh s name being floated out as the only logical successor to parcells in the event that parcells really does retire groh is the jets' linebacker coach and was with parcells when the giants won the super bowl in 1990 the new owner has to know that groh is not the name that jets fans , intoxicated by a taste of honey , want to hear groh is fine , i'm sure but the jets' fans have seen this before with rich kotite and pete carroll and joe walton if parcells is really tired and this is not merely the bow before an encore , the jets' new owner had better start fresh none of this puppetpuppeteer business with groh and parcells the era of experiments is over if minnesota reaches the super bowl , pursue denny green and complete the jets' transition into an offensive juggernaut if tampa bay wins , hire tony dungy and make the jets into a defensive rock of gibraltar if tennessee wins , hire jeff fisher perhaps consider tom coughlin at jacksonville or should johnson talk parcells out of retiring and beg him to coach \? we want to emphasize that we are totally dedicated to bringing a winning and a championship team to this area , johnson said in a statement after it was announced he had won the bidding but you wonder does robert wood johnson really know what he s gotten himself into \? photo robert w johnson \( chang w lee \)
los angeles , aug 14 the democratic convention program was running behind by 20 minutes tonight , which happened to be just long enough to ensure that hillary rodham clinton s speech to the delegates was broadcast live in prime time on all three of the major broadcast networks nbc news was not even scheduled to carry mrs clinton s speech , having planned to go on the air at 10 30 pm eastern time to pick up the first words of president clinton s address a few minutes later but because the first lady did not begin speaking until 10 24 pm , nbc joined cbs and abc in running most of the 18minute talk the democratic coup did not go unnoticed by the nbc anchor , tom brokaw , who seemed to be letting viewers in on the democrats' move when he declared that with the democrats' schedule slipping so much , she was able to get on prime time \( before breaking in at 10 30 , nbc carried the convention on its cable channel , msnbc \) like the republicans , the democrats have a minutebyminute master schedule , so that they know at any moment whether they are not keeping to the plan the 10 pm to 11 pm slot is the only time in which all three broadcast networks which by far capture the bulk of convention watchers are on the air at the gatherings and getting on all three is the most coveted media hat trick asked just before mrs clinton s speech whether the democrats were indeed running behind , peter ragone , a convention spokesman , said , we might be , just a little asked later for comment about the delays , mr ragone said that those in charge of the program told him , it was not intentional though the convention is intended as a crowning television moment for vice president al gore , it was the president who weighed most heavily on the minds of editors and producers today and after mrs clinton finished her remarks , mr clinton made his grand entrance in a manner reserved in american television culture for the best and the brightest , namely , latenight talk show hosts , movie stars and football heroes as cspan and other networks recorded the moment , a camera followed the president as he made his way through the backstage maze at the staples center , the lens trained on him as he strolled confidently emerging into the hall , the camera at his back , it was unclear whether he looked more like a guest host on saturday night live or the star of a sequel to gladiator with mr clinton starting to speak at only shortly before 11 , it was clear that the networks were being boxed into devoting a lot more time to the gathering than planned he finished speaking at just after 11 30 pm last week the chairman of the republican national committee , jim nicholson , had admonished the networks that it would be unfair to give mr clinton more air time than had been allotted to gen colin l powell , the featured speaker on the first night of the republican convention all three networks said mr clinton s speech would be more newsworthy than general powell s and probably worth staying with \( none ran all of the general s speech \) in all respect to colin powell , i do n't think they 're equal in that one is the president and has been president for eight years , said marc burstein , executive producer of special events for abc news like its network morningshow rivals , cbs s early show with bryant gumbel was set to kick off its week in los angeles today with an extensive interview with mr clinton and a talk with mrs clinton but on friday , lyne pitts , the program s executive producer , got the news that the president and first lady were backing out they also pulled out of an agreement with nbc s today , and mr clinton decided not to do abc s good morning america either it was all set , ms pitts said bryant was supposed to interview him saturday afternoon it had been booked for quite some time i got the calls at a little bit after 9 in the morning saying that , sorry , the president s schedule would not accommodate the interview it is not unknown for soughtafter newsmakers to bump a news show or two from their itineraries but such a wholesale withdrawal , at a time when the news media were fixated on the clintons , raised eyebrows we knew thursday night how upset the gore folks were with clinton s confessional on thursday and that would be the talk of our interview , ms pitts said , adding that it was more than an assumption that the clintons had dropped out to try to turn down the heat on them mrs clinton , however , did interviews tonight with anchors on all of the major broadcast and cable networks the hoopla surrounding mr clinton s appearance seemed to reflect a sense in the press corps here that los angeles might generate more interesting and entertaining tidbits than did philadelphia

four years after it led the nation into a sweeping deregulation of the electric industry , california is at the brink of a breakdown in its power supply yesterday , as a heat wave caused electric demand to soar across the west , the nation s most populous state nearly ran out of power for the third straight day to reduce the strain on california s electric grid , regulators ordered utilities to curtail supplies to big commercial users that have agreed to cut their electric consumption in times of shortage still , the state was on the verge of imposing rolling blackouts of homes and businesses that step has been taken only eight times around the country in the last 17 years , usually because of extreme weather or power plant failures , says the north american electric reliability council , which supervises the canadian and american power grid what disturbs california utility executives and regulators is that this week s crisis has come even though none of the state s power plants or transmission lines have failed and temperatures around the state have been high but hardly extraordinary in the last decade , demand for power surged along with the california economy but utilities , fearing they would be unable to recover their costs as the state moved away from regulations that guaranteed them profits , stopped building power plants , leaving the state s power supply simply no longer able to keep up with peak demand california s electric industry has reached the ragged edge of failure , said robert d glynn jr , the chairman and chief executive of the pge corporation , whose pacific gas electric unit delivers electricity to more than 13 million people in northern california there s just barely enough supply to go around so far this summer , the california independent system operator , a nonprofit statechartered agency that manages the electric grid , has scrounged enough power each day to meet demand so the lights have stayed on , except for a blackout in san francisco in june related more to local transmission problems than the statewide shortage but with supplies exceptionally tight , the wholesale price of power has soared in the state that has caused electric bills in san diego , where the retail price of power now fluctuates directly with the wholesale market , to more than double , stirring consumer anger and calls for the industry to be reregulated the supply of electricity is also tight in new york state and new england , which have had spot shortages this year nationally , power reserves have steadily decreased since 1992 , with the electric industry in the midst of a transition from a network of local monopolies with fixed prices and guaranteed profits to a competitive marketplace with prices set by supply and demand but a surge in plant construction in response to soaring market prices and projections of growing demand seems likely to ensure that supplies and reserves will begin to increase next year in most of the nation the system is tight around the country , but there s been an enormous supply response , said jeffrey k skilling , president of enron , the houston company that is the world s leading trader of electricity and natural gas in the next year or two , in most parts of the country , there will be surplus capacity mr skilling said he believed the market would provide the reliable power supply once assured by regulatory fiat , with higher prices encouraging both construction of plants and conservation by users in the early 1990 s , with deregulation looming and southern california stuck in a recession , utilities stopped building new plants none have been built in the state for more than a decade california s economy has surged in the last five years , a boom led by internet and hightechnology companies , which are voracious power users and growth is even more vigorous in the pacific northwest , arizona and nevada , making it harder for california to import the power on which it has relied the california energy commission , a state agency that licenses new power plants and predicts the state s energy demand , says california has a 10 percent reserve margin for this summer s expected peak electric demand , assuming all plants and transmission lines are working perfectly but plants and transmission lines often run at less than their theoretical capacity as a result , the state s reserve power margin has already fallen below 5 percent a halfdozen times on hot days this summer , prompting the independent system operator to declare a stage 2 alert and begin cutting power to big customers like the state s big aerospace companies , that agree in advance in exchange for lower rates on tuesday , the tightest day this summer , the reserve margin fell to 3 percent at 3 30 pm the state s reserve has remained above the critical 15 percent margin that would trigger a stage 3 alert , in which the independent system operator orders utilities to begin rotating blackouts how long the blackouts last would depend on how much demand needed to be curtailed , said ron low , a spokesman for pge
cilcain , wales the rolling clwydian hills present a serene landscape of sheep pastures , signposts in the consonantthick welsh language and hamlets of stone cottages with smoke curling idly from chimney tops it s hardly the place you would expect to find the leader of a popular uprising that brought an entire country to a halt follow a hedged lane past the white horse pub , step across a cattle grating , knock on the door of a yellow farmhouse with boots and saddles in the hall and prize ribbons from pony shows in the parlor , and brynle williams appears i'm not very eloquent with words , and what you see is what you get , he said he glanced down at his belly protruding from his shirt and it s not pretty , he added last month , mr williams , 51 , led a fuel price protest at a nearby refinery that rapidly swept across britain , emptying 90 percent of the country s gas stations , gaining overwhelming support from the very motorists it was inconveniencing and turning the british public against a government that had been enjoying broad approval mr williams filled blue plastic buckets with feed grain as he recalled september s standoff with prime minister tony blair i'm absolutely flabbergasted , he said i still ca n't comprehend that us local boys confronted an elected government it just does n't happen to a simple old farmer s boy it s like something you see come out of hollywood the only people more surprised than mr williams at the mousethatroared consequences were mr blair and members of his government who saw their selfproclaimed ability to read the public mind blindsided by the nationwide disaffection that coalesced around the picketing farmers and truckers at 10 downing street , government press officers denounced the movement as a rightwing show of force and asserted , on scant evidence , that drivers and their families were being intimidated by picketers mr blair demonized the protesters and labeled their actions an affront to the nation it was a tonedeaf response from a political leader famed for having perfect pitch that the british public would turn its back on the most popular prime minister in british history , give the marginalized opposition conservatives their first lead in the polls in eight years and shift its regard from a stylish world leader to a rumpled welsh farmer exposed the weakening of traditional bonds of party allegiance that nonideological politics have brought about and pointed up the volatility of voters six months before a likely election it was a very british protest , with no confrontations and not a single arrest french fishermen and drivers , who had staged similar fuel price demonstrations the week before , had been denounced as ruffians by the same people now holding up the british protesters as foot soldiers of democracy mr williams unexpectedly succeeded in uniting various strands of antigovernment discontent over such things as waiting lines in national health service hospitals , paltry pension increases , falling farm prices , lengthening commercial red tape and rising taxes they were n't backing me , mr williams theorized they were backing themselves while mr blair came across as arrogant and distant , mr williams sounded authentic and grounded his 200acre plot is the same one his grandfather and father farmed , and his 26yearold son wants to continue the family tradition people have asked if there is any political motivation behind this , and i tell them it is one thing and one thing only to keep my son on this land , he said the protest began with oil , but it also reflected notions of community , family and the countryside way of life versus a government accused of being captive to an urban elite mr williams looked out across his green hills and said that 42 farms had disappeared from the threemilelong valley in the past 20 years we are a forgotten nation , he said complaints about gasoline and diesel costs were a significant flash point by themselves at 460 a gallon , britain s pump price is the highest in europe , and 73 percent of it is tax added to that was the leverage that the practice of justintime inventorying gave to a small group of truck drivers they were able to dry up filling stations in days the government was shocked at its powerlessness mr blair pulled all the usual levers he summoned the major oil company chairmen , sent in the police , threatened to call out the military and promised resumption of normal supplies in 24 hours none of them worked the protest , hatched early on the morning of sept 7 in a farmers' gripe session at the cattle market in st asaph , swiftly became national , coordinated loosely by mobile telephones even though mr williams is unable to operate one i have three of them here in the house , but i do n't know how to drive them , he said i'm not technically minded it s a bloody curse what i 'd do is i 'd ask a fellow with one to call someone he knew and i 'd say 'hello , how far are you from such and such \? do you know somebody \? right see what you can do' and that s exactly how it happened we 're not that clever but we 're all in business around the country , and between us we know a lot of people by the sixth day of blockades around the fuel storage depots and refineries , supermarkets began the first rationing of bread since world war ii , one car manufacturer reported it was 12 hours away from closing its european production sites , and the health service faced postponing critical operations with the kind of deft timing that had once been the forte of mr blair , mr williams called off the protests at a critical moment the next day , sept 14 , asserting in a 5 am statement that the demonstrators had gained the high moral ground he said they would give the government 60 days a knowing date since a prebudget statement is due by then to come up with ways to give the truckers and farmers fuel price relief what brought about his opportune decision \? if we 'd have let it go on , i'm more than certain there would have been some unpleasant incident somewhere that would be associated with us , he said i reckoned that by lunchtime the government would have found someone somewhere who died peacefully in his sleep in a nursing home , and it would have been attributed to us both mr blair and his treasury secretary , gordon brown , have insisted they cannot give in to the specific demands that they cut the fuel tax but they have hinted strongly that they will find other ways to address the truckers' and farmers' complaint last friday mr brown held an unpublicized meeting in leeds with freight transport representatives mr williams is now so well known in britain that letters addressed simply bw , wales , and brynle , petrol reach him he has made so few enemies that he can laugh about them my face is sure to be on many dartboards around the country , he said and i heard a better one last week someone said they 're putting my picture above fireplaces now to keep children away from the flames he says he is happy to retreat to his hillside farm and have consumer groups and elected officials take up his cause i do n't speak in behalf of the nation , he said , and i would appreciate that quote , 'brynle williams does n't speak in behalf of the nation' but for one remarkable week , he did photo brynle williams , the farmer who led a fuel price protest that swept across britain , says he is flabbergasted that us local boys confronted an elected government it s like something you see come out of hollywood \( carlos lopezbarillas for the new york times \) map of wales shows location of the cilcain area the government was shaken by a protest ignited in the cilcain area
more than 50 years after their high school graduation , a group of men huddled around a television set showing old technicolor footage of the streets where they grew up the jubes ! cried joseph elder

anywhere else those are the alborz mountains in the background , another man said they were 13 , 000 feet high the reunion was in new york over the weekend , but the city in the film was tehran in an often emotional threeday reunion at the roosevelt hotel , more than 500 alumni and teachers remembered two americanrun international schools as idyllic cultural crossroads where children from any race , religion or ethnicity felt at home the community school of tehran , started by american presbyterian missionaries in 1935 , weathered a world war , a coup and a revolution before it and its counterpart , iranzamin , closed in 1980 , a year after iran s islamic revolution alumni from north america , europe , australia and the middle east who attended the schools between 1935 and 1980 extolled the academic standards , saying that when they moved elsewhere , they were often years ahead of their peers but the highest praise was reserved for the schools' multinationalism , with the children of ambassadors , businessmen , teachers and exiles representing more than 50 countries like similar international schools around the world , the community school reflected global political tides as war and then communism spread across europe and the far east , and antisemitism surfaced in nearby arab countries , refugees spilled into iran with its westernlooking shah and growing international community , it was considered a haven , and the englishlanguage school was a magnet for new arrivals there were professors from the sorbonne teaching us french and latin , refugees from world war ii , said kamel bahary , a 1949 graduate he also recalled swimming at the home of h norman schwarzkopf , who attended the school while his father was helping to train the iranian police force there were people from norway , sweden , romania , iraq , he said we had chinese , japanese in 1953 , community s headmaster , a missionary named richard irvine , limited the number of americans to preserve the cultural balance a separate american school opened and other international schools followed iranzamin , which means the ground of iran , was founded by mr irvine in 1967 to prepare students for a university education in any country , not just the united states and britain , as community school did the iranian government had once discouraged iranians from attending foreign schools , but by the 1960 s many families of the upper middle class were enrolling their sons and daughters in hopes that a western education would afford greater opportunities each era had its own political and social flavor in the 1940 s , american soldiers taught students to squaredance in the 1950 s , as americans and soviets competed for influence and the shah of iran was overthrown and then reinstated , students peered over garden gates at the street fighting yearbooks from the 1970 s show longhaired teenagers in flarelegged jeans skiing , playing guitar , and wandering through the ruins of persepolis , the ancient persian capital but by the end of that decade , those students were crouching in their school buses to avoid stray bullets as revolutionaries burned down banks and cinemas by then , the bicultural experience had grown complicated ronnie rabbie , a 1975 community school graduate , described himself and his fellow iranian classmates as a lost generation of imperialism , who liked pizza and were more fluent in english than in farsi but after the revolution that deposed the shah in 1979 , mr rabbie said , he was kicked out of the iranian army for being foreign educated , and iranian children he had known all his life turned against him they told me 'it s time to go , ronnie , it s time to go it s not your country any more , ' he recalled in 1980 , amid mounting restrictions on curriculum and student activities , the two schools closed revolutionaries made a bonfire out of iranzamin s library , but negotiated a bizarre compromise over community s they said , 'ok , we get half the books , ' recalled bardia askari , a student at the time so they took the a through m encyclopedias and we got the n through z as foreigners and many middleclass iranians left the country , the iranian students who stayed on were eventually sent to farsilanguage schools we were all good students , said niloo momtazi but we felt like total idiots trying to decipher the textbooks today , iran has a few foreign schools , but iranians must attend iranian schools on saturday night , after dining on pomegranate and walnut stew , kebab and rosewater ice cream , alumni danced to prerevolutionary iranian and american favorites and pored over old yearbooks paul kooros , a community alumnus who is half iranian and half american , was in ninth grade when his family left for the united states in 1979 everyone was expecting to come back and pick up where they left off , he said so none of us traded addresses , not that we had any to trade but on this night
