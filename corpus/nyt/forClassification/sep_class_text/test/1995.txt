detroit , jan 8 there was a time when auto executives bragged like race car drivers about horsepower and torque , acceleration and braking distance these days , however , they are frequently boasting about a somewhat less macho subject surprise and delight features , as some companies refer to the cup holders and colossal coat hooks , pommel grips , hisandhers climate controls and other gizmos that are proliferating inside cars and light trucks we 'll continue producing vehicles that not only give the customers what they want , but things they do n't even know they want , the chairman and chief executive of the chrysler corporation , robert j eaton , said last week take for example that peculiar little hook on the glove compartment of the new ford contour compact sedan it is there to hold a purse out of the way and that is just one variation on a theme trumpeted by all auto makers , foreign and domestic it s one of our sort of corporate mantras , chrysler s chief of interior design , trevor creed , said of surprise and delight paying attention to the little things , he said , shows there is a human soul behind the corporation judging by the new cars and trucks on display here this week at the north american international auto show , detroit is experiencing an excess of soul the industry s armchair anthropologists which is to say , its marketing executives have numerous theories as to why in general , people are demanding more conveniences in their lives , because their lives are getting more complicated , said michael j o'malley , general marketing manager for the buick division of the general motors corporation mr o'malley appears to lead quite a complicated life , at least behind the wheel i'm working in my car i 've got a note pad and a car phone i'm drinking coffee i'm eating lunch , he said i'm frustrated because i do n't have a fax to the suggestion that a commuter train might remove at least one big distraction driving mr o'malley argued that people preferred the personal liberty provided by cars other theories for the rise in conveniences include increased commuting time a growing compulsion to work even while driving heightened sensitivity among auto companies to customers' needs , and , yes , an urge to make some money when everybody gets better and better , you 've got to do something to differentiate yourself from your competitors , an automotive stock analyst for lehman brothers , joseph s phillippi , said so you 've got to come up with some of these gimmicks and toys none of it really adds cost , by the way to look at some of the cars of the future displayed here , the automobile has barely begun to surprise or delight a futuristic buick xp2000 , understandably promoted by mr o'malley , offers eight air bags , a detection system for dodging obstacles , a navigation system , and a remote device to position the car s seats , steering column , mirrors , climate controls and entertainment system to a driver s taste one chrysler concept car features a seat that folds over to form a desk mr eaton of chrysler made his vow in an annual state of the company speech to journalists here , after a troupe of comedians had offered a mock version the company this year leads the industry in auxiliary cup holders , one comic deadpanned our engineers have come up with 35 cup holders per passenger actually , gm is believed to be the cup holder champion , with a whopping 14 in each minivan minivans generally carry up to seven passengers \( and since most of the holders can be used only when the van s rear seats are folded down , the number of usable cup holders varies inversely with the number of people with cups \) that industry fetish , the cup holder , is credited with starting the convenience boom while gm equipped a fullsize van with a cup holder in the fall of 1975 , not until chrysler built them into its minivans 10 years ago did the big three try to outcupholder each other the cup holder became sort of the icon of convenience , said jack collins , director of marketing and product strategy for the nissan motor corporation usa because the japanese spend less time commuting , japan s auto makers initially missed the cup holder craze , giving the big three a competitive advantage , mr collins said but , he hastily added , the japanese designed superior coin holders because of the many toll roads at home you see the local influence wash through the products , he said cars and trucks introduced at the auto show demonstrate the zeal with which auto makers are trying to sell in the mass market the kind of attention to detail once reserved for luxury brands the ford motor company , for example , is calling attention to numerous small conveniences in its new ford taurus and mercury sable sedans , to be available in the fall these include a central unlocking system that allows the driver to unlock only the driver sside door \( in the old days , this was accomplished by simply pulling up the lock \) there is also a delay to allow the use of the power windows after the ignition is turned off , the glove box door is engineered to open slowly to avoid banging a passenger s knees , and there is a shoulder harness for the passenger who sits in the middle of the back seat ford is particularly proud of its patented , firstinindustry console an armrest that opens to offer cup holders , space for cassette tapes , a coin holder and a spot for a cellular telephone the pontiac division of gm is displaying an early version of its nextgeneration grand prix model , scheduled to go on sale next year the car features bucket seats in the rear between the seats is a console surmounted by a plastic loop , which pontiac calls a pommel grip , for passengers to steady themselves it s just different , said pontiac s general manager , john g middlebrook , when asked about the virtues of the grip the console also offers headphone jacks and a separate rear radio , so rearseat passengers can pursue their own tastes and chrysler has confected a new minivan stuffed with conveniences electric windshield wiper deicers to free up frozen wipers rollers on the rear seats to make them easier to remove an optional lefthand sliding door , and coat hooks that hold up to four garments the days of just providing a coat hanger to hang your coat on those days are over , mr creed , the interior designer , said and chrysler has upgraded what it calls its best in class cup holders , so they will hold a coffee mug with a handle or a regular cup the size of a jumbo 7eleven big gulp if they ever go above the big gulp , we 're doomed , mr creed said that s when we get asked to put in a porta potti photos what sells a car \? detroit is betting on convenience features like the pommel grip between the rear seats of a pontiac grand prix , above instrument readings projected on the windshield of a prototype buick , top right , and the armrest in a mercury sable that opens to offer cup and coin holders and room for cassette tapes and a cellular phone , right \( peter yates for the new york times general motors \)
toronto like my fellow inhabitants of the roc , or rest of canada , i sat glued to the tv on monday night , gnawing my cuticles and watching an election that would decide the future of my country but in which i had no vote the result was a close squeaker , and we 've all been squeaking ever since the morning after , the roc had no cuticles , and quebec had a deeply split society the proseparation side was also divided within itself thanks to the bitter speech of then premier jacques parizeau , who blamed the the no victory on the ethnic vote and promised revenge this was a heartbreaking blow to those who believe the inclusive campaign rhetoric kindly uncle jacques was revealed as the chauvinistic spirit of the quebec of the 1930 s , supposed long buried the separatists must now sort out what their cause is really endorsing , while others in the province nervously wonder exactly what sort of brave new country they almost ended up in in the roc there were handwringings and puzzled cries of what do they want \? the question , like freud s about women , wrongly assumes a homogeneous they there is a diversity of desires , as the vote showed the issue of survival is always present can an island of french , especially one with negative population growth , survive in an enormous sea of english \? but the quebecois are not exotic monsters at heart , they want what most people want jobs , food on the table , a secure future for the children , respect , social justice and cultural continuity , which for quebec includes the preservation of their language the roc so far has uneasily supported quebec s right to choose , while reserving its own options should the relationship prove unsalvageable would we end up paying for something we did n't want \? who would get to keep the kids , the dog and the car , not to mention the national debt and the huge territories within quebec of the cree and the inuit , who voted overwhelmingly in their own referendums to stay within canada \? if canada is separable , the native people argued , so is quebec but native separatism based on land , history and distinctive languages was dismissed out of hand by the separatists , who were basing their own claims on the same things in the roc , there were anxieties about a possible civil war prime minister jean chretien , having survived a neardeath experience , has uttered words of reconciliation in the roc , his stock has plummeted after winning the last election a snap , since more people in canada believed elvis was alive than liked the tories he shut himself up in castle ottawa and stuck wax in his ears from time to time he emerged to tell us the sky was blue , although , mind you , we were not to say a word which might upset quebec we roc'ers are well trained for 30 years we 've been told that quebec is none of our business we 've elected one prime minister after another from quebec in the belief that this would keep things civil , only to watch them squabble with other quebecois meanwhile , our provincial politicians have , by and large , denied that quebec has special needs and insisted that all provinces should get exactly the same cookies one finds similar idiocies congregating around the issue of unisex washrooms surely by now we know that equal does not always mean the same it s a debate from which the roc citizens have largely been excluded this time , however , when we discovered that we were being lied about the roc , separatist leaders said , did not care about quebec and would be glad to see it go hundreds of thousands of us wrote letters , spoke out and attended huge spontaneous rallies to show that we did indeed care but as one separatist said , it is not enough to love us , you have to recognize us what next \? the nine roc provincial premiers are descending on a weakened ottawa like vultures sighting a kill we roc'ers , having narrowly avoided decapitation , now face the death of a thousand cuts canada is already the most decentralized country in the world , but some provincial leaders intend to destroy anything national that s left health and environment standards , arts institutions , the canadian broadcasting corporation to get more power for themselves but they have n't been listening to the ordinary roc'er , who wants to feel part of a country , not only of a province a lot of quebec institutions should be separate but their counterparts in the roc should be national that s what makes sense my plan \? each roc premier should be made to write an essay on the subject of what canada means to me we citizens will grade them , and those who fail to demonstrate anything but parochial greed are out
detroit auto companies from around the world covet a share of the united states market because of its size and importance make it here , they believe , and you will have the quality , efficiency and savvy to make it everywhere many , like yugo and , most recently , alfa romeo , do n't make it one of the latest to try is the kia motor corporation , a south korean auto maker that for the last year has been working its way across the united states , slowly , steadily and wryly kia s strategy is captured by two campaigns created by goldberg moser o'neill in san francisco one , scheduled to begin appearing in western states on monday , promotes kia s new sportage sportutility vehicle , and the other , which started last month , promotes kia s redesigned sephia subcompact without being predictable , the new ads are still consistent with last year s campaign , casting kia as a determined upstart with a sense of fun to make sure our sedan was the toughest around , we gave our cars to a group of specialized engineers , says the narrator in one sephia \( pronounced sepheeuh \) commercial pizza delivery engineers the commercials try to defuse buyers' suspicion that an unfamiliar car will prove unreliable , and they push the relatively low price of kia s products with the populist tag line it s about time everyone had a wellmade car after a year , kia is selling in 13 western states , having signed up 103 dealers the company plans to have up to 170 dealers by the end of the year as it moves into the southeast it aims to enter the northeast in 1996 , and then to circle back to attack the big three s stronghold , the midwest , in 1997 the sportage should give the company a sexier image than the sephia , a conventionally styled subcompact it also provides the company with an entrylevel offering in the industry s fastestgrowing market segment \( kia also makes a subcompact , the aspire , for the ford motor company \) greg warner , executive vice president and chief operating officer of kia motors america , based in irvine , calif , said that in 1995 the average purchase price for a sportutility vehicle could reach 27 , 000 , adding , that effectively takes a lot of consumers right out of the market the sportage campaign , which tracks the adventures of two hapless but earnest drivers as they undertake the grueling parisdakar road rally , highlights the vehicle s starting price of less than 15 , 000 \( the topoftheline version costs more than 20 , 000 \) as in previous ads for the sephia , the vehicle is shown in fast motion , creating an antic atmosphere nicely complemented by jaunty guitar and banjo music in one commercial , the drivers repeatedly get lost , driving in circles and stopping to ask directions or to consult upsidedown maps at last , waving ecstatically out the windows , they cross beneath a banner market arrivee , observed by a lone arab and his camel no , we did n't finish first , the narrator said but we were the only one to come in under 15 , 000 in another commercial , the drivers repeatedly stop to answer questions from exotic characters speaking assorted languages , none of which the drivers understand each question , rendered in subtitles , is about the vehicle s price each time , the drivers answer an entirely different question of their own imagining in one shot , from ground level , a pair of shapely ankles appears in the foreground , the eiffel tower visible in the distance the sportage brakes to an abrupt halt beside the ankles , and a woman speaks rather plaintively in french how much for the car \? the subtitles translate far more goofy than suave , the helmeted driver leans out the window and pats the door yeah , it s very comfortable , he cheerfully replies smooth ride then , in fast motion , the sportage zips away by centering the campaign on the road rally , mr warner said , kia was trying to address the chief concern that focus groups had about the vehicle they tended to think the sportage was cute , but wondered whether it was as rugged as competitive vehicles like the jeep cherokee the issue is credentials , he added the sportage went on sale in january , but kia delayed the advertising until the south korean plant that makes the vehicle was closer to full capacity by late spring , kia hopes to be selling about 1 , 500 sportages a month
to the editor re eduard shevardnadze s passion \( editorial , sept 3 \) you point out that as soviet foreign minister mr shevardnadze eased decades of tension with the united states and opened the way for eastern europe to be free but that was not all the basic policy of bringing the soviet union into conformity with international human rights standards was undoubtedly decided on by the collective leadership but it was mr shevardnadze , using the powers vested in him both as foreign minister and as a politburo member , who saw to it that many reluctant soviet agencies were made to toe the line as united states assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs from 1985 to 1992 , i was witness to the role played by mr shevardnadze and his ministry in seeing to it that political prisoners were set free , that the laws restricting freedom of expression were repealed , that freedom of religion was respected , that soviet citizens wishing to emigrate were allowed to do so , and that abuse of psychiatry was ended none of these tasks were normally the responsibility of a foreign ministry but mr shevardnadze made the point that the soviet union had years earlier entered into international agreements to respect human rights and that it was his ministry s task to see to it that the country lived up to these agreements it is fortunate that mr shevardnadze survived the assassination attempt it was good news for all those who admire him for his contributions to international peace and human rights but , as you observe , mr shevardnadze ought to get more credit and support for his labors than he has at home and abroad richard schifter bethesda , md , sept 6 , 1995
lincoln , neb kate mcewen missed classes again today after the physical punishment she endured early on sunday morning , it remains unclear whether she will ever return as athletic department officials at the university of nebraska attempt to assure mcewen s family that she can live safely here again , the member of the women s basketball team remains the school s most visible absentee it is painful to have to write her name but her picture has already appeared here on television and in newspapers , and her name has been transmitted from coast to coast this is why according to a police report and the word of witnesses , she was thrown to the floor of a bathroom and dragged down three flights of stairs to the entry of an apartment complex by lawrence phillips , her former boyfriend and a gifted but troubled running back for the nebraska football team phillips s plea of innocence to misdemeanor assault charges has been his only public comment he has not explained how he snapped , or why , in what has become the most dangerous in a series of flashpoints that preceded his arrival in nebraska with a heisman trophy not far from his grasp and the riches of the national football league as close as one season away , he still could not help himself which is why lawrence phillips cannot play football here anymore if the outcome of a trial is consistent with the evidence , and none of it has been disputed , phillips will have transformed what should have been the most inspiring of achievements the hardearned rise from a fractured adolescence that landed him in a group home into a university s embarrassing mistake at the end of a summer in which the simpson trial has continued to link the word heisman with the phrase domestic violence each day , it has become chillingly clear that phillips did not buy into the system as much as the system bought into him several weeks ago , when phillips quietly discussed the progress he felt he had made , he appeared thoughtful , perceptive and revealing be able to walk away from your instincts , he said the sincere hope was that a survivor had found a new way to survive his former girlfriend has reason to believe he still does n't get it his presence represents the inherent conflict of majorcollege athletics universities exist to provide opportunities , but coaches forfeit any credibility in that discussion because they are paid to find players , and superior talent becomes the rationalization for too great a risk nebraska s mistake does not have to become a failure the university should take responsibility for phillips because it long ago committed to the risk , as it has since johnny rodgers won the 1972 heisman despite an earlier involvement in a gas station robbery nebraska can allow him to stay in school without sending him across the country to represent the university the process leading to his eventual return may have begun when his dismissal from the team was subtly altered to an indefinite suspension tom osborne , the husker coach , was right the first time a return of phillips would be one reverse the coach cannot afford to call a path to the nfl is what brought phillips here in the first place osborne , who fears for phillips if the motivation of football is removed , can make him understand that the school could still endorse him to the league by reporting his progress in counseling sessions he can be reminded , by people who care about his future , that the arrest of the 315pound cincinnati bengal dan wilkinson on charges of hitting his fourmonthpregnant girlfriend in the stomach is the latest evidence that a need for control continues long after the money starts rolling in the university can make every student realize that its commitment to zero tolerance can even mean the dismissal of a potential heisman winner from the team there are women who feel that finally there are some consequences that are going out publicly , said judith kriss , director of the university s women s center we may well have students who are in abusive relationships come forward and say 'i do n't want to put up with it anymore what do i do \? ' if the price of that abuse is made clear , if this public case serves to break the barriers of isolation that victims often feel , kate mcewen s undeserved role would have a far greater lasting effect on the university of nebraska than anything lawrence phillips ever accomplished on a saturday afternoon photo lawrence phillips \( associated press \)
chicago , april 2 major league baseball owners , faced with no viable alternative , today accepted the players' offer to return to work , ending the longest work stoppage in professional sports history on the day the 1995 season was supposed to open the owners' decision , announced after a fourandahalfhour meeting , ended the players' strike after 234 days , or 9 days short of eight months the longest previous work stoppage was the 50day baseball strike in 1981 the national hockey league locked out its players for 103 days at the start of this season players can begin reporting to spring training on wednesday on a voluntary basis , with the mandatory date for reporting to camps in florida or arizona coming friday the season , which had been scheduled to begin tonight with a game between the mets and the marlins in florida , will start april 26 each team will have a 144game schedule , reduced from the regular 162 games after april 26 , some teams will have games canceled or added , mostly added , to enable them to conform to the 144 total katy feeney , the national league s schedule maker , said opening day games have not been determined , but added that it will feature a closetofull schedule officials hoped to complete the schedule by the end of the week the players , whose strike last aug 12 wiped out the last 52 days of the season and the world series for the first time in 90 years , will go back to work without a new collective bargaining agreement but with the protection of an injunction forcing the owners to reinstate elements of the expired agreement it was the owners' unilateral decision to eliminate those elements salary arbitration , individual bargaining between clubs and players and the anticollusion provision of the freeagency rules that prompted the national labor relations board to find that the owners had not bargained in good faith , issue a complaint and seek an injunction the players are back , the game is back and we are very happy about that , bud selig , the acting commissioner , said in announcing the owners' acceptance of the players' offer to end their strike he added , we hope to resolve our dispute so that we and our fans never have to go through the heartache we 've endured for the past eight months from his comments , it was clear that selig had decided to treat the development in an upbeat manner missing were the agonized and sometimes acrimonious comments about the union and its negotiating style he tried to deflect questions about the continuing dispute over the owners' efforts to change the game s economic system donald fehr , the union leader , was not at home , but gene orza , the associate general counsel , said , i'm obviously gratified that those were their decisions , both with respect to the lockout , but more important with respect to the replacement players , which would have been a telling blow to the future relationship of the parties he added none of that detracts from the continuing priority of getting a collective bargaining agreement the players are committed to that objective and this development does n't diminish that objective the owners' lawyers will go before a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit on tuesday to seek a stay of the injunction while they appeal it , but even management people gave the stay effort little chance of success some owners had portrayed the meeting at the o'hare hilton today as a session at which they would vote on a lockout or , failing that , the use of replacement players in regularseason games until the regular players were ready to play but , as developments showed , their characterization turned out to be erroneous no votes were even taken no vote was necessary , said peter angelos of the baltimore orioles , who was the only owner who had refused to field a replacement team and had faced sanctions from the american league for his stance the matter was discussed and it was unanimously decided there would be no lockout and there would be no replacement players playing between now and april 26 angelos said the owners discussed the pros and the cons and the inbetweens , and he said he believed everyone in the end was united there were no real decisions to be made , a management official said there was no appetite for a lockout people realized for a number of reasons they did n't want to do it it just was n't the thing to do some owners had talked about securing a nostrike pledge from the players before allowing them to return , but management lawyers never asked the union to provide that pledge at a meeting on saturday with lawyers for the players , the owners' lawyers asked about the idea of a nostrike , nolockout agreement but did not request a pledge they did n't want to condition the players' return on such a pledge , labor lawyers explained , because it could be illegal for the owners to place such a condition on an acceptance of an unconditional offer to return to work basically , a person familiar with the meeting said , the owners' lawyers asked what the union s intentions were in regard to a strike and the union people replied that the players would comply with their obligations under the law addressing the nostrike issue , angelos said i think there s a commitment , but an unwritten one , on the side of the players , as well as the owners , that we will not have this kind of work stoppage in the future and we 'll finish the '95 season and the world series when selig was asked about such a pledge he said it s important we have a season without interruption those are things we 'll have to work out in reality , the owners' course had been set in a conference call last friday after judge sonia sotomayor issued the injunction in federal district court on the call were members of the executive council , the eightowner body that rules the major leagues in the absence of a commissioner the player relations committee , the owners' labor arm , and the negotiating committee hanging up from that call , the owners knew they would not lock out the players and they knew they would not begin the season with replacement players the labor committee issued a directive to clubs saturday telling them to release their replacement players from major league rosters , but to assign them to minor league teams the labor strategists wanted to keep the replacements as a precautionary measure in the event the players would walk out again , after a negative result on the injunction appeal , for example asked about the possible future use of replacements , selig said replacement baseball , as of this time , is gone if you 're asking ever , i ca n't give you that selig also thanked the replacement players , who interrupted their lives to help us out the prc directive went out while the lawyers were discussing backtowork issues after two sessions , management lawyers prepared a document outlining such matters as spring training dates and length and the start of the season and the schedule , and delivered it to the union late saturday night union officials reviewed the document and offered their reaction to it yesterday in a series of telephone conversations the return to work brings with it a unique circumstance in baseball history more than 800 players of the 1 , 069 on major league rosters are unsigned , and another 200 or so are free agents without jobs clubs and players most likely will begin negotiating contracts immediately , and the two sides will have to work out a procedure for salary arbitration for eligible players the union plans to establish a training camp for free agents in homestead , fla , so that they can work out while their agents seek jobs for them photo dreams die hard kris quillin , a reds replacement pitcher , leaving the field after a final workout yesterday at cincinnati s riverfront stadium \( associated press \)
bangkok , thailand , july 29 with france only weeks away from resuming nuclear tests in the pacific , governments across asia and the south pacific are demanding that the french reconsider , and there are warnings of an economic boycott that could damage the french economy the most potent threat may come from japan , where the government has bitterly criticized the decision by president jacques chirac to resume nuclear testing in french polynesia this fall after a threeyear moratorium mr chirac says his decision is irrevocable last week 47 japanese lawmakers , many of them prominent members of parties in the coalition government , called for a boycott of french luxury goods , a threat that carries weight given the affection of millions of japanese consumers for brandname french fashion , perfumes and liquor the japanese market accounts for as much as half of the profits for some french makers of luxury goods , and shares of several of those companies have been tumbling in the french stock markets as a result of the protests in japan nations that possess nuclear weapons must show their wisdom and set an example to countries that do not have nuclear weapons , the japanese science and technology minister , makiko tanaka , said in a letter to mr chirac prime minister tomiichi murayama has accused france of betraying nonnuclear countries with the resumption of nuclear tests mr chirac announced in june , shortly after his election , that france would carry out eight underground explosions in two tiny polynesian atolls mururoa and fangatauta from september through may after that , he has promised , france will sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and end nuclear testing forever the french government has said it needs to carry out the tests to check the reliability and safety of its existing nuclear arsenal but that has not satisfied foreign leaders and environmental campaigners who say computer simulations would offer much the same information there is debate among scientists about the environmental impact of the tests , with french geologists insisting that none of the radiation from the test sites can leak from the hard basalt bedrock of the atolls scientists elsewhere are not so sure , concerned that radiation could reach the ocean through a porous layer of limestone the decision to resume the tests has been criticized by the united states , britain and russia nuclear powers that have all halted testing last week , the lower house of the russian parliament condemned the french tests , describing as dangerous such testing in the fragile systems of coral reefs only china , which has continued to conduct underground nuclear experiments at lop nor in the western province of xianjiang , has continued to test although they can threaten nothing like the economic wallop of a japanese boycott , the governments of australia and new zealand have offered far stronger words against the french an arrogant action of a european colonial power , prime minister jim bolger of new zealand has said of the french tests the australian prime minister , paul keating , described the tests as deplorable we are determined to maintain the pressure on france to modify its program to desist from testing weapons and also to encourage further international focus on france , mr keating said last week in melbourne after meeting with mr bolger

by the time the 25yearold somali woman reached the united states last august , her young life was already in shreds the clan warfare that has plagued her homeland for years had destroyed her family gunmen from a rival clan had killed her father and two brothers in their home she was imprisoned and tortured , her ear lobes badly torn when her earrings were ripped off she and her mother escaped to a refugee camp in kenya , and then her mother died when her uncle provided her an airline ticket to the united states , she went seeking asylum instead , she found herself crowded with about 300 other asylum seekers in a jail that exploded over the weekend in a riot of resentment behind the anonymous , concrete facade of the esmor detention center in new jersey , there was an international cast of refugees with enough compelling stories to chronicle the world s turmoils from the young somali woman to a cuban diplomat , they had fled ethnic hatred , religious persecution and political repression across several continents only to find themselves locked away in elizabeth , dressed in identical jumpsuits and some at the mercy of abusive guards at the time of the uprising , esmor held christians from algeria and the sudan fleeing radical muslim fundamentalists nigerians fleeing a military strongman kurds fleeing iraqi repression , and a former television and radio anchorman from afghanistan the anchorman , ahmed farid zadran , had been arrested first by the communistdominated government , which disliked his appeals for the restoration of an afghan king , then by the anticommunist regime , which did not like his criticism of factionalism in the government , his lawyer , rohit turkhud , said he was between a hard rock and a deep sea , mr turkhud said the detention center also held many cubans disenchanted with castro , foremost among them manuel valdes , the diplomat , who had spent several years in moscow buying sovietmade commercial jetliners for cuba only to anger the castro government by trying to export some perestroika to havana and there were a dozen aliens from sri lanka , who had been hounded by their government as sympathizers of the tamil tigers , separatists fighting for an independent state in northern sri lanka all the detainees were apprehended at new yorkarea airports attempting to enter the country without documents or with false documents most said they sought political asylum , and some among them are likely to be using asylum as a means to gain legal entry to this country many of their stories are heartwrenching , and some are heroic the young somalian s stay at esmor has been hard , her lawyer , gloria alfonso of catholic community services in newark , said the deaths of her parents and brothers have left her depressed her asylum request has been denied and is being appealed some of esmor s guards were cruel to her , the somali woman told her lawyer frail and easily chilled , she asked one night for a second blanket the guard said that there were no extras then he told her to make the request in writing she asked for a pencil the guard said none was available she s got nothing to live for , ms alfonso said it s just a horrible , horrible story and she s done nothing wrong a 26yearold kurd whose lawyer would identify him only as alan came to esmor with a tale of torture in an iraqi prison soldiers tried to force him to identify other members of a prokurdish front they tied his hands behind his back , bent his legs backward and bound them to the rope around his hands , and then suspended him from a wire passed through the knots and poked his genitals with an electric prod , the lawyer , joyce phipps , a professor at seton hall , said kurds eventually freed him he fled over mountains in northern iraq to turkey , made his way to istanbul , and flew to paris and new york on tickets bought after his mother pawned her jewelry , ms phipps said some of esmor s detainees took circuitous routes ireland has become a stopover for cubans seeking asylum in the united states an anticastro pamphleteer in cuba , angela chaviano , 28 , fled last year and stayed in ireland for seven months before flying to new york last march , her lawyer , carlos ferrer , said he also represents two cuban medical technicians who fled from a cuba jetliner in ireland during a stopover on a flight to a medical conference in moscow then they made their way through denmark and norway before flying to new york in april , mr ferrer said the 12 sri lankans fleeing government persecution traveled on flights arranged by asians , their lawyer , visuvanathan rudrakumaran , said some went through thailand and south korea , others through south africa , he said the charge for each between 10 , 000 and 25 , 000 , he said
if tokyo does not bend , say goodbye to all those sleek japanese luxury cars but look on the bright side you can always buy a bicycle do n't bet on it in what may be interpreted as an effort to cover all bases on the transportation front , the commerce department is investigating charges by the american bicycle industry that china is dumping bicycles in the united states if the domestic makers prevail and precedent suggests they will the prices of all bicycles are likely to go up in time for christmas worse , there will be serious shortages of the highend bicycles that are the lifeblood of thousands of specialized bike shops three american manufacturers \( huffy , murray and roadmaster \) dominate the domestic industry and three giant retailers \( kmart , walmart and sears , roebuck \) , which sell more than a quarter of all bicycles in this country , stock only americanmade bikes but the two other big chains \( toys r us and the target unit of dayton hudson \) sell imported bicycles as well as domestic brands imports sometimes cost the retailers less than competitive domestic models in spite of tariffs ranging from 5 to 14 percent much of the incentive for selling imports , however , is variety toys r us , for example , stocks five times as many models as the price leaders all lowprice imports come from asia , which until a few years ago meant taiwan and south korea rising wages along the industrial asian rim , however , have led producers to relocate their factories to the chinese mainland , where the large bicycle industry is fast becoming both a cost and technology leader imports have held a fairly steady 40 percent share of the american market because china s export gains have largely come at taiwan s expense indeed , the indirect cause of the new war on imports is apparently the intense , profitsapping struggle for market share among the american makers in the wake of roadmaster s decision to expand production capacity but the legal threshold for establishing a reasonable indication of material injury from imports is , as a matter of precedent , very low hence no jaws dropped last week when the united states international trade commission , a federal agency with close ties to congress , forwarded the domestic bicycle makers' complaint to the commerce department to measure the degree of dumping dumping is legally defined as selling below fair market value , which is usually interpreted as less than cost just why private companies would invest in new factories in china in order to sell below cost is a bit of a mystery jim pollock , the bicycle buyer for toys r us , states flatly that suppliers are in business to make money but judging from previous dumping cases , such logic carries no weight at commerce when foreign producers in capitalist countries are accused of dumping , the commerce department reconstructs their costs from internal accounting data but in earlier cases , the department decided , china is a nonmarket economy , and it is thus likely to use the method of measuring cost preferred by the domestic bicycle makers namely , the cost of making similar products in a third country to make the government s job easier , domestic producers have already calculated what it would cost to make chinese bikes in indonesia and no surprise they find that merely to break even , the chinese would have to raise prices by 51 to 98 percent , depending on the model mass market retailers are not about to say how they would respond to the imposition of steep punitive tariffs but industry analysts expect a combination of higher prices , limited selection and spot shortages by christmas the fate of independent bike stores and their customers would be far worse specialty stores sell 95 percent of the 200plus bicycles , most of which are now made in china thus , while virtually none of the bikes sold by independents compete with huffy , murray and roadmaster , punitive tariffs would be devastating to a good number of the 6 , 500 independent dealers , said jay townley , a consultant to manufacturers and retailers of highend bicycles the commerce department could still surprise everyone by deciding that chinese bicycle makers operate in what the law defines as a bubble of capitalism , and are thus not subject to the most biased methods of calculating punitive tariffs and even if the department sets very high tariffs , the international trade commission could carve out a sanctuary for highend bicycle makers and their independent retailers , who cannot possibly be injuring the domestic massmarket manufacturers but even if chinese bicycles slip through the cracks in the protectionist wall , the antidumping law will remain an inviting alternative to just about any domestic manufacturer who would rather hire lawyers than cut costs america s trade laws are written for the benefit of producers and consumers stay tuned you have nothing to lose but your living standard drawing
to the editor re oliver s world \( editorial notebook , dec 24 \) i applaud howell raines s attempt to point out the overt paranoia in oliver stone s films jfk and nixon he is correct to criticize the naive conspiracy theories involving the central intelligence agency and the federal bureau of investigation , and he is especially insightful on the inner psychology behind the films , revealing john f kennedy as the fallen hero of both i still feel , however , that something has been missed behind mr stone s films is a paranoia not unique in american history our revolution was fought by patriots who felt their liberty was being systematically destroyed by the acts of a correct british parliament demanding higher taxes historians tell us no such conspiracy was afoot the revenue was needed to pay off debts from costly european wars the real belief in a conspiracy , however , had a profound effect on the rest of our history at many critical points , americans have been more than willing to see a conspiracy where none existed this paranoia has afflicted both the left and the right it can be traced in bitter battles between hamilton and jefferson , the outsider mentality of andrew jackson , the hostility between north and south in the civil war and the rhetoric of the populists in the late 19th century mr raines correctly points out that if mr stone lived in the 18th century , he would have been convinced that the masons were in charge what he fails to mention is that many influential people thought the masons were in charge , and used the fact that the first six presidents were members of this mysterious society to elect andrew jackson , the first nonmason president i found it ironic that while mr raines was debunking mr stone s conspiracy theory , he was only too willing to find one of his own involving the mafia his theory is filled with as many historical holes as mr stone s both theories , however , reveal that a radically free people vigilant over their own liberties with a historical mistrust of government often pay the price for their freedom in paranoia robert jackman hamden , conn , dec 24 , 1995
responding to a federal grand jury s charge that the city s largest and bestknown street fair is controlled by the mafia , the giuliani administration said last night that the feast of san gennaro will be canceled this year unless organizers allow an outside monitor to oversee the festival s finances at stake is an annual city ritual that brings millions of people to little italy s narrow mulberry street , where the smoky air smacks of grilled sausage , vendors lure passersby with games of chance , and the faithful demonstrate their devotion by pinning dollars to a silverandbronze bust of the festival s namesake representatives from the society for the feast of san gennaro met with city officials on thursday and yesterday in a lastminute attempt to salvage their 11day festival , which , in the tradition of 68 septembers , is scheduled to begin next thursday but cristyne f lategano , the chief spokeswoman for mayor rudolph w giuliani , said last night that city hall was holding up the permit for the event the mayor is taking an inflexible position regarding the san gennaro festival , she said there will not be a san gennaro festival unless an independent monitor oversees the financial transactions regarding the festival ms lategano offered no details on how the monitoring process would work , but said the mayor would discuss the issue at a news conference today she added that the mayor s demand was prompted by the grand jury investigation and other concerns the issue is a delicate one for mayor giuliani , who fought the mafia passionately as a federal prosecutor but who also counts many of the festival s participants among his faithful supporters mr giuliani has not attended the festival for more than 20 years because he does not like the way it is run , ms lategano said still , canceling the festival would be a major blow to little italy s economy and pride along mulberry street this week , few people have wanted to talk about allegations that a neighborhood tradition could be in the clutches of the mob and those who did had no kind words for the government i think that the federal government is about 25 years behind the times , said the rev fabian grifone , pastor of most precious blood church maybe 25 years ago it was controlled by mob families today it is not last week , the federal grand jury charged that the genovese crime family has controlled the festival in recent years by skimming the rent money paid by vendors to the organizers it alleged that the san gennaro society s records considerably understated the actual cash rent paid by certain vendors the grand jury said that a reputed genovese soldier , thomas cestaro , 73 , oversaw the operation of the 1994 feast from a mulberry street social club , and that he helped choose which vendors got certain locations along the event s halfmile route it said that he and two associates anthony \( tony waterguns \) pisapia and louis zacchia , an officer of the san gennaro society also controlled other street fairs in the city although mr cestaro and his associates were not charged , the grand jury handed down perjury indictments against two festival vendors vito vivona , of brooklyn , who operated a sausage stand at last year s feast , was accused of lying about his role in collecting rent money and keeping track of vendors dorothy sapienza , of woodside , queens , who ran a photo booth , was charged with lying about whether she had kept mr cestaro abreast of her contact with investigators that mr cestaro was not arrested seemed to fuel the neighborhood s doubt about the merits of the government s case against the festival in other words , they say this man is running the feast illegally , but they do n't arrest him , said anne compoccia , president of the little italy chamber of commerce give me a break a spokesman for the united states attorney s office said only that the investigation by federal agents and the new york police is continuing even before last week s indictments , word had spread through little italy s brick tenements and neonlit storefronts that their cherished feast was under investigation various vendors from the 1994 feast had been called to testify before the grand jury , and people in the neighborhood knew that investigators had seen the san gennaro society s books what may not have been public knowledge , however , is that courtauthorized listening devices had been installed inside the social club at 171 mulberry street frequented by mr cestaro as well as on the club s telephone line mr cestaro could not be reached for comment , and the club was gated shut thursday night the festival began in the mid1920 s with the simplest of intentions to pay homage to san gennaro , a roman catholic martyr and patron saint of naples some roman catholics believe that his blood was preserved at his death in ad 305 , and that it liquefies twice a year a phenomenon that father grifone says he has witnessed , and which he describes as a miracle
dayton , ohio , oct 27 when news broke that the bosnia peace talks would be held at a military base outside this sturdy midwestern factory town , elinor sluzas , 67 , who is famous around here for her mouthwatering dumplings , promptly called the state department to invite the delegations over for dinner they could relax , get in a good frame of mind , said mrs sluzas , a lithuanianamerican whose restaurant , amber rose , specializes in east european fare i would make their comfort food dayton is about halfway around the world from bosnia , the land torn by fighting among rival muslim , serbian and croatian factions so when officials selected wrightpatterson air force base here as the place where the warring sides would come together next wednesday for talks , the choice struck some people , including the serbian president , slobodan milosevic , as a bit remote what , are you going to keep me locked up in dayton , ohio \? he said i'm not a priest , you know most people here shrugged off the wisecrack a few even said they would have reacted the same way you can pick anywhere in the world , and you take dayton \? said mark booker , a 31yearold auto parts worker makes you wonder in fact , a state department official said the selection had nothing to do with the amenities or special advantages of this industrial town of nearly 200 , 000 people , but rather centered on the accommodations and security at wrightpatterson , one of the nation s largest military installations its runways and facilities sprawl over more than 8 , 000 acres of westcentral ohio we wanted a press blackout , said the official , who spoke on the condition that his name not be used we did n't want the work to be interrupted by opportunities for posturing before the cameras in addition , the state department wanted to choose a base that would be within an hour s flight time of washington , so that secretary of state warren christopher and other toplevel officials could get there easily if the parties reach an accord , the formal signing would move to paris , a place that mr milosevic would presumably find more fitting for a lavish celebration but the heavy lifting must first be done here in the industrial miami river valley with the peace talks on their way to ohio , people like miriam mendenhall , a 72yearold waitress at the airport coffee shop , are even sounding like practiced foreign policy observers , mixing hope with nervous pessimism am i glad they 're talking \? she asked of course but i'm afraid it s futile i do n't see how we can tell people who have fought for centuries to make peace and i'm afraid we might be bringing trouble home to dayton by having it here some are more bluntly skeptical about dayton s sudden moment in the spotlight gary hanson , a 24yearold investor wearing a black suit and wingtips , said the peace efforts must surely be costing the american taxpayers a lot of money and he said he resented the clinton administration s cooperation with the united nations , which has often taken an antiamerican stand nobody out in those countries ever supports us , said mr hanson , who lives in the sprawling , increasingly republican suburbs that in the last decade have slowly recast dayton s traditional democratic image so just let them go , do it on their own hank sokolnicki , 45 , a transit worker , was wary , too , reflecting a view that any united states involvement with bosnia was a bad idea , particularly now that the clinton administration has pledged to send american troops to help police any peace arrangement that comes out of the negotiations it s a european affair , said mr sokolnicki as he walked briskly toward his bus under a sky that promised rain let them handle it why should americans risk their lives \? it s just none of our business in piecing together the diplomatic puzzle to end the hostilities , negotiators could use some of this region s heritage of innovative thinking the wright brothers designed their airplane in a bicycle shop on the west side here the cash register was invented here , along with the selfstarting engine so was the poptop beverage can civic boosters say dayton has produced more patents per capita than anyplace else in the country harvey bond , 45 , an employee in the city s human resources department , is one of those who thinks there is more than meets the eye in the decision to pick dayton what can they accomplish at an air force base that they ca n't accomplish in meeting rooms in some hotel \? asked mr bond , who then flashed a conspiratorial smile , and instantly answered his own question maybe there s a little show of force going on here , he said i mean , they take these bosnians around the base , let them look at some of the us firepower , and tell them 'all right , now you 've seen what some real force looks like shall we sit down and talk some peace now \? ' mrs sluzas , who is still waiting to hear whether the delegations from the balkans will be coming to her restaurant for dinner , said she saw some hope in the peace talks there is something good about them gathering here , said mrs sluzas , who can remember the days when four languages were spoken in her neighborhood hungarian , lithuanian , polish and german but never english we all came to middle america from different parts of the world and goodness knows , we all brought our prejudices but we learned to live together so can they photos everyone in dayton , ohio , it seems , has an opinion now that thebosnia peace talks are coming to town miriam mendenhall , left , said she thought the effort was probably a futile one elinor sluzas offered dumplings to the delegations , and mark booker said the choice of his city makes you wonder \( photographs by mark lyons for the new york times \)
in the two and a half years since the bombing of the world trade center , eyad ismail had led a seemingly mundane existence at his family s stone house in northern jordan , where he was glued to american situation comedies on television , adopted stray cats and talked about parlaying a future computer degree into the good life the family had lost relatives depict him as placid and apolitical , displaying a temper only when he lashed out at anyone who disturbed the calm with a yell or other loud noise he would always say to us , 'you have to be quiet , do n't be speaking in a loud voice , ' his sister feryal said federal law enforcement officials paint a more sinister portrait they say that on feb 26 , 1993 , mr ismail began a life as a fugitive , fleeing the united states on the day he drove a van laden with explosives into the garage beneath the world trade center the explosion killed six and wounded 1 , 000 , and prompted a manhunt that ended last week when the 24yearold mr ismail was extradited from jordan he pleaded not guilty on thursday to charges of bombing and conspiracy his arrest brought the number of men linked directly to the attack to seven investigators say that his involvement in the bombing stretches to kuwait , where he was born and where he befriended an older schoolmate named ramzi ahmed yousef , the man prosecutors have said was the mastermind of the bombing mr ismail had expressed some bitterness over the expulsion of palestinians from kuwait , which pushed him into an itinerant life through kansas , new york city and texas but he apparently exhibited little interest in the political or religious groups that vilify the united states for its mideast policies mr yousef s name draws blanks from family members the family idealizes the steady years spent in the gulf emirate of kuwait mahmoud hussain ismail , eyad s father , fled the west bank city of nablus during the 1967 arabisraeli war , arriving in kuwait a year later and going to work as a lathe operator in a kuwait national petroleum company machine shop the family lived in fahaheel , a neighborhood just south of kuwait city filled with imported workers , most of whom were palestinian i was a simple worker there , said mr ismail , 54 , speaking by telephone from jerash , the jordanian town 30 miles north of amman where the family now lives i was happy there it was an easy , orderly life eyad was the second son , one of five boys and three girls , all born in kuwait \( federal court documents list the family name alternatively as ismoil or ismail his student records and the family spell it ismail , the usual transliteration from arabic \) mr ismail had wanted eyad to enter a university in the middle east , but the son convinced his mother to let him enroll in an intensive englishlanguage program at wichita state university in kansas eyad ismail entered the united states on oct 9 , 1989 mr ismail sent his son about 1 , 000 every month , and eyad reported back that he liked his classes and had bought a secondhand car in wichita , university officials said no one there remembers him in august 1990 , his family s world collapsed when iraq invaded kuwait everything we had built over 23 years was gone , mr ismail said our jobs , our livelihood , our money all went the family was already back in jordan for the summer he fled kuwait on a bus about a week before the americanled forces began the air campaign against iraq on jan 16 , 1991 he left behind everything , assuming they could return eventually the mass expulsions after the war , because palestinian leaders failed to condemn the invasion , deepened a sense among palestinians that the world did not care about their rootlessness when eyad called to ask about money , mr ismail told his son he would have to go to work he got a dishwashing job but could n't earn enough for tuition i told him to just work and send us what he could , mr ismail said an uncle and cousin were then driving cabs in brooklyn , so eyad ismail left kansas for new york city in 1991 , living at 322 fifth street in park slope , brooklyn he lasted two months he said it was too tiring and he was afraid of all the murders in new york , mr ismail said he said taxi drivers got shot , the family said that at some time in the transition from kansas to new york city he married a woman named christina , who they say was a tall blond american beauty they do n't know much else about her , and friends in dallas , his next stop , said he told them the couple had split up his bosses and acquaintances there recall him as not particularly bright he was like a regular teenage kid , said his manager at the sonic drivein in east dallas he was n't smart the manager , who would identify himself only as mohammed , said eyad usually came clattering into work late in a dilapidated 1976 or 1977 monte carlo mohammed never heard mr ismail talk about politics or religion but friends said he attended friday mosque prayers regularly his other job was stocking shelves at casa view grocery , a small shop in a strip mall , where a coworker and sometime roommate , eyad zubidat , said his friend would either lift weights after work or just go home he did n't read nothing , mr zubidat said he just worked he was kind of shy too mr zubidat expressed surprise that such a retiring person could have been involved in violence
smithfield , ri it was well after lunch on a recent afternoon when david meggett wandered out of the dining hall at bryant college and sat down under a tent for a chat the patriots' allpurpose , alleverything back said he could use a nap and the season had n't even started yet when you 're david meggett , there s no time for sleeping there are new pass patterns to learn you have to get accustomed to the velocity and spin of the ball coming from a new quarterback you have to get the timing down with the new offensive linemen you have to figure out how the fullbacks block and if you 're david meggett , you must work on those elusive moves that serve a punt returner so well busy , busy , busy when patriots coach bill parcells persuaded the team s owner , robert kraft , to open the vault for meggett giving him a 25 million signing bonus to come to new england , the coach did n't envision the running back leading the life of the maytag repairman parcells said he wanted meggett , whom he drafted in the seventh round in 1989 for the giants , to touch the football 15 to 20 times a game that s smart , because in his sixyear career meggett has averaged 45 yards a carry , 95 yards a reception , 109 yards a punt return and 206 yards a kickoff return he has scored a touchdown on a punt return in five of his six seasons \( none in 1992 \) the giants had this thing that i was a parttime player , meggett said but i was a parttime player getting fulltime results i accounted for six touchdowns last season and rodney hampton had six touchdowns i was part time he was full time imagine what would have happened if i was a fulltime player the label of me being a parttime player was a bunch of junk when i was in there i did n't make any mistakes no fumbles , no turnovers , no dropped passes i did nothing to hurt that team i felt i should have been rewarded for that with more playing time i did n't get that they came up with excuses if they wanted to be more creative , both me and rodney could have gotten our share of balls meggett trusts that parcells and the patriots' offensive coordinator , ray perkins , can come up with some ingenious ways to get him fulltime work he 'll handle the rest in last saturday night s preseason game against minnesota at foxboro stadium , meggett turned in a brief , but crowdpleasing , performance meggett produced in vintage meggetttype situations in the second quarter , on a thirdand11 from the patriots' 23 , he lined up as the lone back , sprinted out of the backfield , snared a pass and picked up 12 yards for the first down the patriots' fans roared later in the game , working from a split backfield , meggett picked up 36 yards on a screen pass on secondand21 from the patriots' 15 the crowd cheered two plays , 48 yards that was dave meggett as advertised , patriots quarterback drew bledsoe said that s the kind of play we expect him to make from time to time take that pass 5 yards down the field , make somebody miss and then take off parcells wants meggett to be a second and thirddown back and handle punt returns parcells said he will limit the number of kickoff returns meggett gets , because , well , because there have to be some limits on just how much one man can do if meggett had his way , he would return the punts and kickoffs and play first , second , third and fourth downs a light workload was one of the main reasons meggett left the giants as an unrestricted free agent and signed with the patriots from the time i started the negotiations , no one in the giants' organization called to say , 'david , your role will be expanded if you come back , ' meggett said they might have had plans to use me more , but they did n't say it i could n't go back to the same thing meggett said he found his football life with the giants becoming boring last season with the giants there were flashes of the kind of excitement that meggett craves he played almost three games in place of hampton , who was injured early in the second game of the season against arizona in the third game of the season , against washington , meggett had career highs in carries \( 26 \) and rushing yards \( 82 \) , scored 2 touchdowns rushing and caught 4 passes for 52 yards but there were whispers that the 5foot7inch , 195pound meggett was too slight to take the kind of constant pounding that hampton endured from week to week when he averaged around 20 carries a game the next week against new orleans , with hampton still out of the lineup , meggett had 16 carries for 40 yards and 5 receptions for 35 yards but over the next 12 games , meggett never had more than six carries or four receptions in a game that s why i left , meggett said it was getting old david was only going to play if something detrimental happened to rodney i do n't want anything to happen to rodney , because we 're tight that s not the way i want to get into the game meggett should see a lot of action , at least early on , for the patriots he and corey croom are the only veteran halfbacks on the roster the other halfbacks are the rookies curtis martin , a thirdround pick from pittsburgh , dino philyaw , a sixthround pick from oregon , and david green , a free agent from boston college meggett is happy with his whole new environment he even thinks the change will give him a competitive advantage , because new england s american football conference east opponents have n't seen that much of him meggett said he has just one goal this season i want to help the team win the division , get homefield advantage in the playoffs and get a home game at foxboro , meggett said i do n't think i 've ever done anything like that photo the former giant david meggett , shown here stretching last week , is happy to be a big part of the patriots' offense \( associated press \)
los angeles , march 21 both sides in the o j simpson murder trial battled today over one of the central mysteries of the case why the bloody righthand glove found behind mr simpson s house shortly after nicole brown simpson and ronald l goldman were killed had no blood around it and what that says about mr simpson s guilt or innocence lawyers for mr simpson , trying to neutralize one of the potentially most incriminating exhibits of the case , sought to show that if mr simpson had dropped the glove there and had been bleeding at the time , as the police said , drops of his blood would have been nearby how much blood was found \? one of mr simpson s defense lawyers , robert l shapiro , asked philip vannatter , a lead detective in the case none , none that i'm aware of , mr vannatter replied nor , the detective said , was there any blood on the wire fence nearby or on the adjacent property prosecutors have never explained how or when , if drops of mr simpson s blood led from the ford bronco outside his home at 360 north rockingham avenue to the foyer inside , mr simpson could have been along the walkway to the rear , where the glove was found that leather glove , extralarge , matched the lefthanded glove found near the bodies of ms simpson and mr goldman at 875 south bundy drive nor have they explained the presence of blood in one place and not in the other in a series of questions , deputy district attorney christopher a darden tried to fill that void one explanation he offered was that the area was so overgrown that blood could not necessarily be spotted did you pick up each and every leaf and examine it \? the prosecutor asked mr vannatter the detective said he had not mr darden then asked whether it was possible that the person carrying the glove had put his bleeding finger in his pocket to cover his trail mr shapiro s objection was sustained , but the point had been made peter arenella , a law professor at the university of california at los angeles , said mr darden s explanation immediately raised questions about why someone so careful to stanch the blood flow in one place could have let himself drip so freely at another but quite apart from unsubstantiated defense accusations that the rockingham glove was planted , mr arenella said , its location poses problems for the prosecution there are often unresolved questions , things that do n't completely add up , but they do n't necessarily create a reasonable doubt of guilt , mr arenella said but realistically speaking , before the jury is willing to convict o j simpson , they might demand that questions like this inconsistent blood trail be answered mr vannatter concluded his testimony today , after four days on the stand he then gave way to mr simpson s former house guest , brian \( kato \) kaelin , who has said he told detective mark fuhrman that he had heard several thumps on the rear wall of his room on the night of the killings it was then that detective fuhrman went outside and found the glove on the walkway with prosecutors having amassed an arsenal of incriminating dna evidence against mr simpson , the conduct of the police is a crucial issue for the defense and more than perhaps any other policeman , detective vannatter has become the defense s cushiest punching bag because he was in charge of the investigation , because he carries the most documented baggage and has the prickliest personality last fall , judge ito chastised mr vannatter for misrepresentations in the application he made for a search warrant , a reprimand that judge ito today called severe mr vannatter has also acknowledged that rather than booking a vial of mr simpson s blood immediately , he carried it from police headquarters to mr simpson s home , 20 miles away over objections from the prosecution , judge ito allowed mr shapiro to ask the detective about the misrepresentations in the warrant application , which mr shapiro argued went to the essence of what our case is about , which is credibility one misrepresentation was a statement that the blood found on the bronco had been determined to be from a human , when it in fact had not yet been another was that mr simpson had taken an unexpected trip to chicago , when in fact the trip had been planned long before and mr vannatter knew it after mr shapiro reminded him at least five times that he had sought the warrant under penalty of perjury , mr vannatter conceded that he had misstated the nature of the blood evidence , but he said that events had borne him out he also conceded inaccuracies about mr simpson s trip to chicago , but said that when he had initially interviewed mr simpson s daughter , arnelle , and mr kaelin , they said they had not known where mr simpson was seeking to depict that the defendant had nothing to hide , mr shapiro stressed how mr simpson had returned voluntarily from chicago to be questioned by the police and submitted to various tests he was as cooperative as anyone can be , was n't he \? mr shapiro asked if being truthful is being cooperative , then that s very subjective , mr vannatter replied his demeanor was cooperative , but i do n't believe the information was truthful
newark , feb 27 last week , in a display of resistance and faith , 23 newark residents signed up to run for the board of education even as the state intensified its efforts to seize the district and abolish the board charles bell , a board member for 25 years , said he could not recall such a large field and he thinks it says a lot about the newark district s response to state efforts to take it over i love it , said mr bell , the only one of three incumbents with expiring terms who is seeking reelection in april it shows that newark is an activist community paterson rolled over jersey city was handed over but the people in newark believe in selfdetermination newark is new jersey s largest school district , with 48 , 000 students if taken over , it would be the third public system under state control , joining paterson and jersey city among the candidates are disgruntled parents , community activists , district gadflies and frustrated teachers some are highly critical of the district leadership others are more forgiving but none of those interviewed supports takeover i'm not in favor of state takeover at all , because for years the state has known what the board has been doing , said maryam bey , a secretary who has been active in several parentteacher organizations and community groups and is making her second bid for a board seat as far as i'm concerned , they 've been working hand in hand at the same time , candidates were gearing up last week for the election , the state was intensifying its campaign to seize the schools the state education department asked a judge to forgo a scheduled hearing on the case and rule in favor of the takeover bid the hearing is required under state takeover law , which is designed to protect districts against unreasonable seizure but the state contends that it has already proved its case against newark in the petition filed last week , and in a mountain of reports leading up to this point , the state has consistently portrayed newark as a mismanaged district in which children struggle and fail while pampered officials sit idly by some of the facts are shocking , said richard dipatri , the deputy education commissioner we 're saying , let s get on with this for the sake of the children in its petition , the state cited newark s abysmal standardized test scores as an example of its failure in march 1994 , for example , more than half the district s middle schools failed to produce a single student who could pass all three sections of the state s early warning test among 38 schools , only in four did 10 percent or more of the students pass the reading , writing and math tests the blame lies squarely with the board of education , the state said by contrast , the state said , board members do not scrimp when it comes to travel , fine dining and free cars for themselves given their privileged life style and their detachment from the world which the newark children must endure , it is hardly surprising that the board has failed or is unable to effectively deal with the overriding problems of the students in the district , the petition said in 1994 , in the midst of the state investigation of the district , the district bought five new chevrolet caprices and gave them to board members , the state said as for dining , in 199192 , mr bell charged four meals that cost more than 100 and six meals that cost more than 70 to the district , the petition said another board member , guillermina cruz , charged a meal that cost 273 and one that cost 227 and mr bell attended conferences in st thomas , honolulu and san francisco in 1992 and 1993 the honolulu conference , counseling and treating people of colour , promised a rare opportunity to be directly exposed to the native hawaiian , micronesian , polynesian and asian cultures , the state said , adding , the state is unaware of any appreciable hawaiian , asian or polynesian population in the district mr bell defended his expenses , saying the state deliberately left out information as part of an effort to disgrace the board he said state officials unfairly focused on the one day of the conference that was dedicated to the culture of the host city and ignored the other days that included workshops on substance abuse , aids , violence and mental health issues all as they pertain to black and hispanic students mr bell said the dining figures were misleading because the state did not make clear that five , six or more people were present at each meal in one case , the money was used to buy refreshments for a parentteacher conference , he said throughout the contentious takeover process , newark school officials have accused the state of racism in moving to take over large , urban districts led by black officials while ignoring smaller , rural systems where students are also struggling to succeed and they say that in paterson and jersey city , the state has yet to prove it can run an urban district better than local officials the state needs to stop this adversarial , racist attitude that says , 'only we can do it right , ' mr bell said we 're supposed to be in a partnership but the state s whole attitude is , 'gotcha' ms bey , though she opposes takeover , is a persistent critic of the current school board , saying its policies have been disastrous for newark s children those who are on the school board are not committed to the children , she said if they were , we would n't be in the mess we 're in now she said moving the board elections to the general elections in november would increase voter turnout , and that that might shake up a stagnant board whose members easily win reelection year after year she said most of the current board should be routed but by the parents and voters , not the state putting the state in charge of newark s schools also takes parents off the hook , said james young jr , a candidate and father of two children about to enter the schools people talk about state takeover and it s like they are waiting for someone else to come in and solve our problems , he said whether or not the state comes in , these are still our children , and we will be held accountable mr young , 37 , is a housing manager for the newark housing authority he said he believes newark officials have failed the children , but he is more concerned about turning the schools around than pointing fingers he said he does not care if board members went to hawaii people bring these issues to sidetrack from what the real issues are , he said the focus should be on the children
in his memoir , new york days , willie morris , nostalgic for the heady manhattan of the 1960 s when he was harper s editor , cites a letter from robert kotlowitz about modernday new york there is no literary world , no music world , none of that , really , mr kotlowitz wrote just a lot of clashing social activity , mainly built on money and celebrity or access to both while not as rambunctious as it once was , new york s literary landscape is undergoing some subtle but provocative changes in fact , some people point to the surge in readings , book discussion groups , literary magazines and new fiction titles and say the city s literary life may be flirting with a renaissance ultimately , the real literary life is what goes on between a book and a person or a person and what they are writing , said james linville , an editor at the paris review , who recently began a weekly reading series readings , in fact , are becoming more and more popular but things feel healthier now younger writers feel like what they are doing has some connection to their surroundings that was not true so much in the late 80 s among the changes are important shifts at the new yorker and the new york times , two of the city s most prominent publishing and reviewing vehicles at the new yorker , one of a few national magazines still publishing fiction , tina brown has cut the number of fiction pieces each issue from two to one , furthering criticism that the new yorker has abandoned its literary past but she has also begun a summer fiction issue and this year hired bill buford , former editor of granta , as the new fiction editor , a change intended to bring some new , more adventurous writers to the magazine although mr buford said that he was not going to increase the number of new fiction pieces in the magazine , he added that he hoped to run longerthanusual stories from time to time his comment , or editorial introduction , for the new yorker s fiction issue of july 3 , is telling , especially when compared with its predecessor last year s unsigned comment read like an apology , or at least explanation , for the magazine s efforts toward fiction that issue ran six pieces of new fiction and some work already published this year , mr buford eulogizes fiction writers as the slightly unstable , wonderfully confused people who make up the stories that we in fact like to read very much some writers , he concludes , are downright heroic in this issue , there are seven pieces of fiction , \( including stories by ian mcewan , paul theroux , seamus deane and philip roth \) , six of nonfiction and four poems the fiction issue was mostly assembled by mr buford , who arrived at the new yorker in the spring , and it is made up largely of wellestablished writers , some of whom have been in the new yorker before and some of whom had been edited by mr buford two of the seven fiction writers are being published by random house and one by knopf , both of which are owned by advance publications , which also owns the magazine \( some of the nonfiction articles in the issue were also by random house and knopf writers \) still , mr buford insists he is dedicated to attracting new adventurous writers this country is full of great writers who are not exploiting this magazine , says mr buford , 40 my task is to go to those writers and get them to bring their stories back to the new yorker meanwhile , at the new york times , charles mcgrath , the former deputy editor at the new yorker , has become the new editor of the times book review under mr mcgrath , the book review is being redesigned and refocused with new reviewers , longer reviews and special attention to fiction and poetry , two of mr mcgrath s passions i'm trying to make it better , he said my main notion is that the reviews themselves need to be informative and entertaining i'm impatient with the kind of review in which one expert picks at another writer s work without giving the reader the big picture of what the book is about and i want reviews that stand on their own the daily paper has seen a change as well , as margo jefferson , who reviewed mostly fiction but now is a times drama critic , was recently succeeded by richard bernstein , who has focused largely on nonfiction mr bernstein , who has written several books , has been both a domestic reporter and a foreign correspondent at the times the new york review of books marches on , steadily searching out new writing , including literary books , or books whose primary objective is artistic rather than commercial appeal and grand street , a quarterly founded in the 1980 s , still concentrates on new fiction but other new yorkbased magazines and newspapers are rethinking their literary operations , a move that affects which books are featured , excerpted or reviewed , all of which can have an impact on which titles and authors find an audience , and ultimately , which books will be published harper s , for example , having abandoned book reviewing more than a decade ago , will begin running reviews again in july the paris review , which has been redesigned , will now be distributed by random house , giving it a potentially much wider audience and the wall street journal , which recently began running its own bestseller list , has a new books editor , erich eichman , who was an assistant features editor at the journal before replacing manuela hoelterhoff , the former book editor , who is now on leave to write a book

jaime kleinman , 16 , took another look at the american revolution and surprised herself by arguing that the british were right they did everything for the colonists , she said they did n't deserve to be turned on many of her classmates at a long island high school , however , argued just as strongly that the british were wrong in a brooklyn high school , a history class examined a drawing of the boston massacre by paul revere where s the black man \? one student asked absent , along with the snow that historians say was on the ground that day , was the revolution s first american casualty , crispus attucks , a former slave the class pondered this , along with the use of the word massacre for five deaths the schools are miles apart geographically and far apart economically yet both share new approaches to teaching american history similar to those recommended in voluntary standards proposed last fall by a task force at the national center for history in the schools at the university of california at los angeles , for which revisions are now under consideration the standards , which have been criticized by conservatives , suggest additions to course content to include the lives and contributions of americans who have been underemphasized in the past students might be asked to assess the contributions of prince hall and absalom jones , former slaves who helped newly freed slaves in the 18th century students are encouraged to bring a historical perspective to bear on the present , through debate and the use of the socratic method , approaches long used by some of the best teachers to challenge students they might be asked to describe the effects of the declaration of independence and the french declaration of the rights of man on 20thcentury revolutions in mexico , russia , china , cuba and vietnam marshall smith , an undersecretary of education , said the proposed standards should be seen as the starting point of a reasonable and disciplined dialogue instead , they came under a heavy attack from conservatives led by lynne v cheney , the former chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities , which originally commissioned the standards she and others argued that the new standards strayed too far from the subject matter of traditional american history , emphasized obscure figures in the name of political correctness and lacked the affirmative tone they say american history deserves the authors responded that mrs cheney mischaracterized the content , but the united states senate voted 99 to 1 in january not to endorse the standards yet far from the glare of the political debate , visits to six high schools in the new york metropolitan area found that history teachers in the classroom are already embracing the spirit of the standards not always with success in one city high school , a class divided into groups to analyze the new deal but did not seem to know much about it in a suburban school , a teacher asked students to pretend to be workers and managers in a late 19thcentury factory but none of the students knew the meanings of the words ostentatious , appalling , barter , or scab , much less about how 19thcentury workers or managers might have approached labor negotiations for the most part , though , the new approaches to american history seemed to have a profound impact when i teach american history , said diana javis , assistant principal at the john f kennedy high school in the bronx , and a fan of the new methods , i ask them 'what will your grandchildren ask you about \? history is a living story it s your story' she even asks students to interview their parents parents love it , she said as one young lady was questioning her mother , the phone rang , and the girl got up to answer it her mother was very upset she said , 'i'm talking about my life !

washington , oct 8 the 30second television commercial opens with a bleak scene of a lonely senator bob dole trudging through the snows of new hampshire in 1988 a pointed reminder of how he lost the crucial primary there after refusing to sign a pledge against new taxes as haunting music plays , an announcer warns new hampshire rejected bob dole because we did n't trust him on taxes we were right then come examples intended to tag mr dole as a big taxer this attack advertisement was not produced by any of mr dole s rivals for the republican presidential nomination but by his own campaign as mr dole braces for the inevitable televised onslaught from his opponents , his campaign decided the best way to prepare itself was by creating the roughest advertisements imaginable against the senator so mr dole s media advisers dreamed up slick sample ads complete with slogans , background music and narration like those they expect from senator phil gramm of texas , former gov lamar alexander of tennessee and patrick j buchanan , the conservative commentator two weeks ago , the campaign showed these test commercials which , of course , will never actually make it on television to four small groups of republicans in manchester , nh , and in nashua , nh , who said they will vote in the state s primary the aim was to gauge potential voters' responses and use them to create more test advertisements answering the attacks it has been nearly two decades since political operatives learned that focus groups of voters can be as effective in determining how to peddle candidates as they are in peddling bars of soap they played an integral role in helping bill clinton in 1992 as he wended his way through accusations of womanizing and draft dodging , and his advisers have consulted them ever since his advisers are already using them for the 1996 campaign but most striking this year is that the major republican campaigns are assembling focus groups much earlier than in the past some have become so reliant on them that they say they do not dare broadcast a commercial without testing it first these groups' discussions can run from policy minutiae to , well , mammals the dole campaign recently asked focus groups to name the animals the candidates reminded them of according to an internal dole campaign memorandum , the most popular descriptions of mr gramm were weasels , foxes , hyenas , ferrets , though some gave him positive points for being tenacious by calling him bulldog and tortoise the memorandum , which was made available by the dole campaign , said mr buchanan was likened to mostly tough , smaller and combative animals like pit bulls , badgers , wolverines it found that mr dole was described at times as a tenacious and even a bit plodding survivor like a mule , draft horse , tortoise , german shephard some participants offered elephant , given mr dole s long service to republicans others , saying he was too quick to compromise , suggested chameleon , kangaroo , zebra these groups do not always provide a rosy picture of how a candidate comes across in an internal memorandum , linda divall , mr gramm s pollster , noted that the senator did not make a good first impression with some voters in new hampshire who looked at a sample gramm commercial and video thank god for the mute button , one man said one woman observed , has a voice you do n't want to listen to there also were positive remarks , of course , like the man who said , if anyone can accomplish balanced budget goal , he can for republicans this year , the obvious target is mr dole since he is far ahead in the polls , his competitors are asking focus groups to dissect his public appearances they are hoping for unexpected insights that might help them topple the senator all the while , the campaigns are seeking ways to finetune their own messages mr dole s aides , for example , said they learned through focus groups how best to cut the legislative jargon from the majority leader s speeches the way we have used focus groups is to explore reactions that you ca n't measure in surveys , such as reactions to the tone and style of a candidate s delivery , said whit ayres , mr alexander s pollster he said mr alexander presents himself as an outsider versus an insider more often than governor versus senator because that contrast did not test as well in focus groups but mr ayres and other pollsters say it would be a mistake to be guided too much by the sometimes scattered observations from focus groups focus groups are useful but are frequently overused , said mark penn , one of mr clinton s chief pollsters they 're too easily pointed in one direction or another and should be used for base exploratory work , not for drawing as many conclusions as i see people using them for according to ms divall s memorandum , mr gramm s focus groups underscored some of the senator s weaknesses in new hampshire , where the first primary is tentatively set for feb 20
des moines for all the tough talk around the country about cutting the gordian knot of welfare dependency , iowa is the only state that has cut off cash benefits to families because a parent refused to go to work or take other steps to get off welfare even here , the state started removing parents and their children from the rolls only six months ago iowa has been unable to determine what became of most of the 881 families who have lost benefits so far some recipients say the new rules have prodded them to work , while others seem to have been pushed off a precipice kathy brundidge , 29 , and a mother of three , was jolted from an 11year reliance on welfare by the fear of losing her benefits she now has a job checking people s eyes and fitting them for glasses if i did n't go to work , i was going to lose everything i was living off of , she explained but another woman , who got a job in a factory making boxes , was fired when she had to stay home with her sick 5yearold then , when her benefits were reduced , she was evicted and fled to ohio to avoid losing her children to foster care several churches went together to buy her bus fare , said sharon baker , director of cross ministries in des moines , who declined to name the mother to protect her privacy republicans in congress acknowledge that there is as yet no reliable evidence from iowa or elsewhere about how drastic changes like time limits and cutoffs will affect the 45 million adults and 94 million children receiving cash payments nationally through aid to families with dependent children , the main federal welfare program but they say the time has come to transform a system that many in both parties feel has sapped people of their will to work and trapped generations of children in poverty as a centerpiece of its sweeping overhaul of social welfare laws , the republicancontrolled house of representatives last month passed a bill going well beyond what is being tried in iowa iowa now denies cash welfare benefits to families if parents refuse to sign or comply with agreements that specify what they will do to get off welfare and how long they have to do it some are given years to attend college , while others agree to find a job within months the state sets no absolute limit on how long a family can receive welfare in contrast , the house bill decrees that , with few exceptions , families that received welfare for a lifetime total of five years would never again be eligible for federal welfare payments republican legislators predict that most recipients will become breadwinners if they have no alternative welfare is always there as a crutch , said senator rick santorum of pennsylvania sometimes you knock the crutches out , and people will fall down but they 'll learn to walk but democrats say an arbitrary time limit is too risky we do n't know enough to say 'five years and you 're out , ' said senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york it s possible you 'll do intense damage to children advocates for the poor fear that millions of families could wind up homeless , while destitute children flood already overwhelmed fostercare programs and in iowa , where a single parent must participate in welfaretowork programs once her youngest child is 6 months old , some recipients worry that their children will be worse off i do n't see where working at minimum wage or barely above is going to help us , said brenda aldrich , a former bartender and mother of gabriel , 6 , and blake , 2 ms aldrich lost all her cash benefits because she did not cooperate with the state she thought it was more important to go to her older son s ball games and tend to her little one , who is afraid of strangers the house welfare bill will be taken up soon in the senate , probably in may key republican senators have said that they agree with the basic thrust of the bill , which is to give states neartotal control of most welfare programs and relieve them of the obligation to match federal welfare spending ten states other than iowa have begun their own experiments with time limits on welfare , but those limits have not yet run out this year , virginia and massachusetts passed laws to limit ablebodied welfare recipients to two years of benefits in any fiveyear period both states will have to win federal approval before carrying out their plans under the current system , about half of all afdc recipients at any given time have spent more than five years on welfare , according to studies by ladonna a pavetti , a researcher at the urban institute in washington seven in 10 recipients have spent more than two years on welfare a profile of longterm recipients suggests just how hard it will be for many to find and keep jobs , especially ones that pay enough to support a family a large share of chronic welfare mothers , surveys show , bore children while they were in their teens , never graduated from high school , have never been married and have had little or no work experience contrary to the stereotype of the welfare mother who goes on the dole for years , recent research shows that many women cycle between welfare and lowwage jobs they quickly quit or lose the reasons include conflicts with bosses , loss of child care , layoffs , and boyfriends jealous of the women s newfound financial independence the iowa experiment trying to adjust to a new system as part of a broader effort to give states leeway to experiment with welfare , in 1993 the clinton administration gave iowa permission to begin a statewide test of a new approach
los angeles , aug 23 lawyers for o j simpson focused today on a series of faint parallel lines on the walkway outside nicole brown simpson s house , on an envelope , on a piece of paper found nearby and on ronald l goldman s bloody blue jeans in their effort to prove the existence of a second killer mr simpson s star expert witness , dr henry c lee of the connecticut state police , would say only that one of the marks could be a shoe print but the defense lawyer questioning him , barry l scheck , extrapolated from that , suggesting that a second assailant walked through the crime scene and kicked mr goldman during a prolonged struggle in three places on mr goldman s jeans , dr lee said , he saw the same parallel lines , none of which were mentioned by the prosecutors he conspicuously stopped short of calling them shoe prints , describing them instead as imprints in one place , they appeared in layers had the marks come from a shoe , dr lee told mr scheck , it was consistent with kicking , but not by the bruno magli shoes that prosecutors say mr simpson was wearing that night dr lee , the head of the connecticut state police crime laboratory , did not dispute prosecution testimony that shoe prints from the expensive , italianmade magli shoes were found at the crime scene nor would the presence of other prints exonerate mr simpson but by raising doubts about the prosecution s singlekiller theory , dr lee s meticulous but accessible testimony could place the prosecution s entire case in jeopardy the scientist said the parallel lines could not have come from the magli shoes , or from mr goldman s boot , or from someone s lip or ear or nose would that mean that , assuming it s a shoe print , it came from another person \? mr scheck asked in your experience at crime scenes , have you ever seen a single assailant wear two pairs of shoes \? the witness said he had not dr lee spent most of the day interpreting the blood found on mr goldman s shirt and boot and the constellation of bloody drops , spatters and smears on the envelope of eyeglasses that mr goldman took to mrs simpson s home on june 12 , 1994 the witness said that several factors the dirt caked on top or in the cracks of mr goldman s boots , the dugout area of dirt at the crime scene , the profusion of smeared blood and distance between drops led him to conclude that these were not blitzkrieg killings also supporting the notion of struggle , he said , was what looked like a knife cut in mr goldman s boot , suggesting that mr goldman had kicked back two buttons that had been ripped from his shirt , and a pattern of blood on the envelope that indicated movement while the blood was still wet asked how long the struggle lasted , dr lee replied , i cannot tell you exactly how long it s not a short struggle his conclusion shores up a crucial defense plank that mr simpson did not have time to commit the killings and return home in time to meet a limousine to the airport dr lee told the tale of the blood evidence only after giving the jury one of his famous primers on blood spatter analysis with the simplest of props an eyedropper , some cotton bond paper , some tissue , the palm of his hand and a bottle of red ink he began his familiar routine of dripping , flicking , smearing , rubbing and banging seeking to demonstrate impact spatter , for instance , he placed several drops onto a piece of paper , then banged his hand into it , prompting several jurors to jump or flinch from blots of various shapes and sizes , he defined terms like satellite spatter and differentiated between dynamic and stationery contacts , wipes and swipes , arterial gushing and venous rushing he then held out the exhibits before the jury , spatters on platters by the end of his demonstration , the jury had before it a smorgasbord of ersatz gore , and dr lee had another stained white shirt dr lee also supported testimony from a prior defense expert that blood on the inside of the sock retrieved from mr simpson s bedroom blood that matched mrs simpson s had been rubbed on it had not seeped through that would support another defense contention that the police framed mr simpson dr lee recalled that when he inspected the sock , he found it packed in the same envelope as its mate , contaminating them both , he said prosecutors had earlier faulted him for not wearing a lab coat or hair net during that inspection today , he struck back after i look this , both socks already put in one envelope , does n't matter what i wear , he said space suit , body armor still contaminated dr lee exudes exactitude he was all the more persuasive for being occasionally tentative and his criticism of the police was all the more powerful because it was uttered gently , not in the manner of a knowitall dr lee testified in english that was heavily accented and choppy yet highly understandable and , often , entertaining he spoke in simple equations when it comes to blood , compression plus movement equals a smear he spoke in axioms the greater the force in an impact spatter , the smaller the spots and he sprinkled his testimony with readily understandable images having learned what he wanted from a photograph of mr simpson s sock , he said , there was no more need to take additional pictures than there is to inspect a bowl of spaghetti for additional cockroaches after having found one he used another colloquialism to show how , while vertical spatters grow in proportion to the distance from the source , the phenomenon is not infinite otherwise , if i climbed up a tall building , such as empire state building , drop a drop of ink , it will cover the whole manhattan , he said as testimony continued , demand intensified for former detective mark fuhrman s taped conversations with a north carolina screenwriter , laura hart mckinny those tapes are ostensibly filled with an inflammatory racial epithet and damning admissions of misconduct for the last two days , representatives of the city attorney s office , the los angeles police commission and the police department have huddled in the office of ms mckinny s lawyer , matthew schwartz , listening to the tapes today , lawyers for those groups , along with a lawyer for mr fuhrman , asked judge lance a ito for their own copies mr schwartz balked , but at judge ito s urging said he would ask his client mr fuhrman s lawyer , darryl mounger , said he needed the tapes in part to determine whether his client should take the fifth amendment when he returns to testify
washington , sept 20 regional conflicts over the distribution of federal medicaid money flared today as members of congress scrutinized republican proposals to limit the growth of the program , and democrats complained that republicans were trying to ram the changes through congress without adequate debate but the protests seemed unlikely to thwart the effort by house republican leaders to eliminate the federal guarantee of health insurance for millions of poor people and let states decide who receives what health benefits gov christine todd whitman of new jersey , a republican , and the eight republican house members from new jersey complained that the republican medicaid bill would shortchange their state , shifting money from the northeast to the south and the west in a letter to speaker newt gingrich , mrs whitman said the proposed new medicaid formula was clearly inequitable in a separate letter to mr gingrich , the eight republican lawmakers , led by representatives marge roukema and christopher h smith , said the formula would unfairly benefit a number of southern and western states at the direct expense of northeastern states like new jersey and in an interview , representative michael p forbes , a new york republican who said he had been a loyal lieutenant in mr gingrich s campaign to reduce the role of the federal government , described the proposed medicaid formula as absolutely unacceptable he said it would force some hospitals on long island to shut specialized burn units and cardiaccare units barnstorming in colorado today , president clinton also denounced the republican medicaid plan we estimate the congressional proposal could keep , within the next seven years , 300 , 000 people who are now eligible out of nursing homes and a million people who are now eligible from getting home health services , mr clinton said in denver at the home for the aged of the little sisters of the poor but in washington , representative thomas j bliley jr , a virginia republican who is supervising work on medicaid legislation as chairman of the commerce committee , replied mr president , on medicaid , we are doing exactly what you proposed more money for the states , fewer bureaucrats to tell them what to do with it now call off your attack dogs mr bliley noted that mr clinton , as governor of arkansas , had often complained of costly federal medicaid requirements house members today offered a brief taste of the bitterness that the debate on medicaid and medicare , the federal health program for the elderly , is expected to cause discussion of a highway bill was delayed for most of the morning by a partisan floor fight over the unrelated medicare issue we can have six days of hearings on the national highway system , and one on medicare and none on medicaid , said representative robert e wise jr , democrat of west virginia in protest , democrats tried to block all house committees from meeting today referring to the medicare proposal , representative sam m gibbons , democrat of florida , said you 're trying to sneak it past us they are going to take 270 billion out of the pockets of medicare recipients the majority leader , representative dick armey , republican of texas , then forced a rollcall vote on letting committees meet such motions are debatable for up to an hour , but he took only 30 seconds and gave the democrats one minute , before the vote that ended debate mr wise said we have been stonewalled now we 're being gagged the senate is also working on similar legislation to replace the requirement for medicaid benefits to all eligible individuals with lump sum payments , or block grants , to the states the senate , where the finance committee is responsible for medicaid , will almost surely be more attentive to the concerns of small states the committee s new chairman , william v roth jr , is from delaware , and a senior member of the committee , john h chafee , is from another small state , rhode island under the house republican proposal , each state s medicaid grant would increase each year , but the increases would be very small just 2 percent a year after 1996 for connecticut , delaware , maine , massachusetts , new hampshire , new jersey , new york , rhode island and vermont by contrast , california , florida , mississippi , oklahoma and several other states would get increases of 9 percent in 1997 and 6 percent in each of the next five years but lawmakers from the south and west say that under the proposed formula , their states would be shortchanged , compared with new york the proposed medicaid grants start from the current levels of federal medicaid spending , which are higher in states like new york that have historically had more generous medicaid programs under the republican proposal , new york would still receive more medicaid money for each poor person than most states in the year 2002 , for example , new york would be given 4 , 982 in federal medicaid money for each poor person in the state , whereas california would receive 2 , 433 , florida would obtain 2 , 273 and texas would take in 2 , 834 over the years , new york has spent more of its own money on medicaid , so it received larger sums of federal money than other states the new york senators , both members of the finance committee , can be expected to fight to preserve new york s share of the federal medicaid pot but the politics will be byzantine mr bliley said the commerce committee would approve the medicaid legislation this week but representative henry a waxman , a california democrat who is the architect of much of the current medicaid program , said most committee members do n't even know what s in the bill he said he saw little chance of making significant changes in the bill in committee , but hoped to alter it on the house floor and representative bart stupak , democrat of michigan , complained that the republicans were not holding hearings on the bill but mr bliley said the committee held seven hearings on various aspects of medicaid in june and august photos in denver yesterday , president clinton attacked the republican plan to change medicaid , saying it would put 300 , 000 people out of nursing homes over seven years mr clinton was joined by sister patricia friel of the little sisters of the poor and a resident of the order s home for the aged , helen cooper , 94 \( reuters \) democrats yesterday attacked republican plans to change medicare the house minority leader , richard a gephardt of missouri , called it a travesty that failed to address the problems of rural americans , who have little access to health maintenance organizations \( david scull the new york times \)
washington , feb 23 unlike his republican rivals , bill clinton has not yet trekked to the coffee shops and hotel ballrooms of new hampshire this winter but in the warrens of the west wing , the corridors of capitol hill and the suites of democratic consultants and pollsters , his 1996 reelection campaign is showing its first springlike stirrings bit by bit since the disastrous midterm elections , the president has begun assembling a team some old , some new , some borrowed and none , he hopes , blue to help him through the complex and potentially contradictory challenge at hand how to shore up his base among traditional democratic liberals while wooing back the moderates who helped elect him in the first place personifying that dual task are harold m ickes , the deputy white house chief of staff , who has emerged as the president s political majordomo , electoral tactician and liaison to oldline liberals , and james carville , the strategist prized in 1992 for picking up on the patchwork concerns of average americans and quilting them into a coherent campaign mr ickes s preeminence was underscored this month with the longexpected appointment of douglas b sosnick as white house political director mr sosnick , who had been a congressional liaison at the white house , is close to mr ickes and is a former top aide to senator christopher j dodd of connecticut , whose installation as general chairman of the democratic national committee mr ickes helped engineer last month for his part , mr carville has pledged to scale back the demands of celebrity authorship , speechmaking and impending fatherhood to take a more active role again in white house political deliberations at the sufferance of the chief of staff , leon e panetta , who has limited the role of other consultants in a recent meeting , several top democrats said , mr carville suggested in typically colorful language that mr clinton was not likely to unearth any advice he had not already heard or advisers he had not already heard from the president responded by asking mr carville , his old friend , to start planning for next year harold heads the daytoday effort , one senior white house aide said of mr ickes , the new york labor lawyer who ran mr clinton s new york primary campaign , then managed the democratic national convention in 1992 and james is clearly involved terry mcauliffe , the finance director of the democratic national committee , is expected to shift into the same task for mr clinton s campaign , and donald l fowler , a veteran party worker from south carolina and an old friend of mr ickes , is in place as the daytoday national chairman of the party , mr inside to senator dodd s mr outside as one top presidential adviser put it we 've got a pretty tight little team but since the election , mr clinton has also been determined to widen his circle , and many democrats in and out of the white house warn that the group could quickly grow unwieldy for example , although stanley greenberg remains the president s chief pollster , aides said , his work is now supplemented by that of two other top democratic pollsters , geoffrey garin and mark mellman not everyone is happy mandy grunwald , the president s former chief media adviser , whose television advertisements for the democrats on health care were widely criticized as ineffective last year , is now described by senior white house aides as solely an adviser to the president s wife , hillary rodham clinton , called in for lowlevel efforts like a campaign against teenage violence other media consultants , chief among them david doak and robert shrum , who have been associated with past or potential presidential rivals like representative richard a gephardt of missouri and senator bob kerrey of nebraska , have been asked to help out privately , several consultants complain that they are under pressure from prospective candidates for other offices to say whether they will face the competing demands of a presidential candidate , and they are eager to nail down contracts but the white house does not mind keeping many firms on the string , in part because that may make them reluctant to sign up with potential democratic challengers we 're in a political situation where it is manifestly obvious that we need every smart person in the democratic party to be helping us , said the white house spokesman , michael d mccurry mr carville said he stood ready to do whatever the president says , short of jumping off a cliff then i might say , 'i 've got a new baby on the way , can i wait awhile \? ' but much remains unclear , chiefly the choice of a chairman of the reelection campaign , given the justice department investigation into the finances of commerce secretary ronald h brown mr brown , the former chairman of the democratic party , had been favored for that post , but white house aides acknowledge that the inquiries into his financial dealings now make his selection impossible other names mentioned include mr ickes himself mickey kantor , the united states trade representative , who was campaign chairman in 1992 eli j segal , the head of the president s national service program , who was chief of staff in the last campaign , and thomas e donilon , the assistant secretary of state for public affairs , who forged a warm friendship with mr ickes after tangling with him in the 1980 presidential campaign when mr donilon worked for jimmy carter and mr ickes for senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts but if they left government to run a campaign , mr ickes , mr kantor and perhaps mr segal could run afoul of the law that bars top officials from having contact with their former agencies to influence official action for a year after leaving office in other words , as campaign chief , mr ickes could not directly talk to his old boss , the president , about the interests of his new boss , the presidential candidate though he might ask a subordinate to do so white house lawyers acknowledge that one effect of the prohibition could be to have senior officials essentially running the campaign from the white house , as james a baker 3d nominally did in 1992 for mr clinton s predecessor , george bush if that were the case , however , the white house would have to determine the percentage of time , equipment and supplies such aides devoted to political work so the costs could be allocated appropriately , and republicans would doubtless criticize the arrangement
the new york city marathon comes around again today it has become so much a part of people s lives here that the other day it finally seemed time to take up the challenge but that is not an easy proposition for someone whose attitude toward physical exertion was largely shaped by calvin coolidge i do not choose to run , coolidge said back in 1927 , and seven decades later his wisdom endures so that left but one reasonable alternative drive the marathon , all 26 miles , 385 yards in preparation , there was the obligatory carboloading \( fusilli with pine nuts , black olives and sundried tomatoes did nicely , washed down with a glass of montepulciano to ease the tension \) then it was off to staten island the next morning in a rented car , to begin exactly as the thousands will today , at the fort wadsworth end of the verrazanonarrows bridge so the event could be fully savored , the men s starting point was chosen over the women s , which is set 458 feet closer to brooklyn let s now cut to the chase if speed is your goal , forget the car , buy a good pair of running shoes and join the crowd bobbing across the bridge and through the four other boroughs driving the marathon route to the finish line at tavern on the green took 2 hours and 51 minutes compare that with the winning time of 2 11 21 registered in the men s race last year by german silva of mexico , or the 2 27 37 of tegla loroupe , the kenyan who led the women if they thought it might take nearly three hours on foot , they probably would contemplate a leap off the verrazano at the start , to spare themselves the waste of time following in their footsteps behind the wheel meant lumbering through rutted streets at an average speed of barely 9 miles an hour and that was on a bright morning with clear sailing most of the way there was no horrendous accident , no unbearable construction mess , no ecosupremacist on a bicycle asserting his right to cut you off , no wayward rollerblader , no worldclass traffic jam until near the end in short , none of the familiar hurdles that make driving in new york a test of your sanity it was , quite simply , a normal drive that was the depressing part of it nine miles an hour is hardly a dizzying clip , even if it is breathtaking compared with the average of less than 6 miles an hour that passes for speed on crosstown routes in midmanhattan the journey began promisingly from the start at 8 06 am , it took an hour and a quarter to reach the halfway point , by the long island expressway in queens not great , but a pace worthy of the better runners the ride across the queensboro bridge into manhattan was smooth the willis avenue bridge into the bronx was a piece of cake but construction at the madison avenue bridge slowed the return into manhattan and then it was agonizing on stretches of fifth avenue because the police had closed the central park drives , clogging nearby streets and forcing a slight detour from the official race course the car hit the wall just south of east 89th street , now also called fred lebow place in honor of the marathon maestro who died last year east 86th street was crossed at 10 22 it took until 10 36 to reach 74th street , and until 10 45 to gasp to 66th street that s a pace of 3 miles an hour healthy adults can walk faster fortunately , frustrated drivers handled the ordeal with grace no more than half of them leaned on their horns , a new york ritual born of the conviction that any bad situation must be made worse still , even in a car , the marathon route is a pleasant lope though town from the verrazano , lower manhattan glistens in the distance while the morning sun dances upon the narrows the route goes past the sturdy homes of bay ridge , the gritty sidewalks of sunset park , the faded grandeur of fort greene , the jewish orthodoxy of williamsburg , the polish immigrant ways of greenpoint , the industrial muscle of long island city , the towers of the east side of manhattan , the revival struggle of the south bronx , the lost housing of harlem and , finally , the enduring glory of central park maybe the marathoners have it right running , not driving , is the way to take it all in it is something to think about thank goodness , there s a full year to get over the urge marathon volunteers compete , too page 43
londonderry , northern ire land , nov 20 john hegarty , a 19yearold roman catholic , was at a friend s house in a town south of here one night this month when five masked men burst through the door , surrounded him and beat him over the head with hammers and iron bars he said they tied his hands and legs , threw a hood over his bloodied head , dragged him outside and put him in the trunk of a stolen taxi after driving him into dense woods , they tied him to a tree and threatened him for the next 24 hours before abandoning him , still bound , in the freezing cold mr hegarty , who finally wriggled free , was a victim of a growing terror campaign in northern ireland but with paramilitary forces on both sides observing ceasefires in the long conflict over whether the province should become part of ireland or remain with britain , it is not a campaign pitting catholic against protestant instead , it is one in which the irish republican army , which is assumed to have abducted mr hegarty , is increasingly using violence to intimidate and control people within its strongholds , the catholic ghettos where it has long functioned as a combination mafia and vigilante force much the same thing is happening in poor protestant communities , where loyalist paramilitary forces often dispense their own rough justice , although there has not been the sharp rise in the number of attacks seen in catholic areas sometimes the attacks are against people believed by the terrorist groups to be criminals that is apparently what happened with mr hegarty or police informers sometimes they are carried out to settle local disputes , or simply to silence someone judged by the groups not to respect and fear them in addition to the increase in the number of attacks , one other thing about the socalled punishment attacks has changed since the ira called a ceasefire in its struggle against british rule on sept 1 , 1994 instead of using guns to inflict the traditional punishment of kneecapping putting a bullet or two through the legs of the victim the terrorist groups have turned to using baseball bats studded with nails , axes , hammers and other objects to inflict beatings , apparently being careful that no one misinterpret their actions as a violation of the ceasefire with president clinton scheduled to visit northern ireland on nov 30 in an effort to speed up the peace efforts , people here said the attacks illustrated just how deeply rooted violence has become in a society that has embraced the lull in terrorist bombings and shootings but still suffers from widespread poverty and longterm unemployment it s all about power and control , said nancy gracey , the founder of families against intimidation and terror , a belfastbased group set up to help victims and their families the paramilitaries are starting to lose control of the ghettos and they want people to toe the line , she said the result is that you ca n't talk about peace here , because there s been such an upsurge in violence since the ceasefire since the ira ceasefire nearly 15 months ago , there have been 244 attacks , 158 by the ira and 86 by loyalist forces , according to the royal ulster constabulary , the province s police force four people have died as a result of the attacks in the 14 months before the ceasefire , there were 63 attacks by the ira and 82 by loyalist forces , for a total of 145 mr hegarty s abduction was typical mr hegarty , clearly rattled by his experience although recovering well physically , said he was reluctant to give many details , fearing retribution but he appears to have been the victim of an attempt by the ira to find out who stole 25 , 000 raised by a catholic church in his hometown , strabane , about 10 miles south of londonderry mr hegarty had been questioned about the robbery by the police and released without being charged , and he denied any involvement they were trying to put the fear in me , mr hegarty said i ca n't understand it it gets nobody nowhere victims typically refuse to provide the police with much , if any , help in identifying their attackers , few of whom are ever arrested and almost none of whom are ever convicted but some victims are increasingly willing to speak out about their ordeals in the hopes of putting public pressure on the paramilitary groups one of them is brendan gallagher , 37 , a catholic from londonderry his problems started three years ago , he said , when one of his daughters , then 4 , had a fight with a neighbor s child the child s father threatened mr gallagher s wife , and mr gallagher threatened him back the dispute went on and on , until the neighbor , by mr gallagher s account , called friends in the ira to help on may 9 , 1994 , while mr gallagher dozed in his living room , nine masked men kicked down the door and came after him with iron bars and axes after beating him and smashing his stereo and television on his back and head , the attackers dragged mr gallagher out the front door one attacker pulled out a pistol , held it to mr gallagher s right leg and fired then he aimed at his left leg , but the gun jammed the gunman then aimed at mr gallagher s stomach and pulled the trigger , but the gun jammed again the attackers then fled , leaving mr gallagher with a shattered leg , a broken elbow , a ruptured spleen , deep wounds in his head and back and bruises all over his body two months later , after mr gallagher encountered an ira member and pushed him down a flight of stairs , an ira delegation visited mr gallagher s mother and his parish priest and told them that mr gallagher was being exiled he would have to leave londonderry or face being killed he did so , moving his wife and eight children into a homeless shelter in another town , but then got fed up with being bullied , and a year ago returned to londonderry , although not to his old neighborhood these people want to rule the catholic ghettos with an iron fist , mr gallagher said at the end of the day , people have to make a stand against them mr gallagher said that his defiance of the exile order and his willingness to name the ira as his assailants meant that he might always live in fear of his life but he said standing up for his rights was a matter of personal principle and perhaps the only way to help bring real peace to northern ireland s poorest neighborhoods i was born here , i was raised here and i will die here , mr gallagher said , sitting warily in a local pub , keeping an eye on the front door and flashing a handgun he said he is licensed to carry if it s the ira that buries me , so be it photos john hegarty , 19 , a roman catholic , was beaten with metal bars and hammers and left for dead in a wooded area , presumably by the ira , which is

washington , aug 11 the killers silently entered the secret hideaway of vincent w foster jr , the deputy white house counsel , on july 20 , 1993 their target knew too much he could blow the white house skyhigh he had to die they broke his neck , jammed a gun down his throat and pulled the trigger they wrapped his corpse in a carpet , stuffed it in a van and drove to a park outside washington there he lay , his fingers curled around the gun killed on orders of his oldest friend , the president of the united states three government investigations and two congressional reviews have determined that none of that is true but if talk radio and the internet are any sign , some americans find it more credible than the official versions of mr foster s suicide and its aftermath the theory of a murder and a coverup has been promoted by a handful of foundations and publications united by a common denominator the money of richard mellon scaife the death of vincent foster i think that s the rosetta stone to the whole clinton administration , said mr scaife , a genial , rotund , whitehaired newspaper publisher with skyblue eyes and half a billion dollars in the bank there are just too many questions that have no answers mr scaife has financed a variety of organizations raising questions some pointed , some pointless about the foster and whitewater cases these include the western journalism center , which has taken out fullpage newspaper advertisements questioning the official versions of the cases based in part on the work of christopher ruddy , who was dismissed by the new york post for pursuing his intricate coverup theories mr ruddy s work now appears in mr scaife s own greensburg \( pa \) tribunereview the only daily newspaper in the nation trying to prove that mr foster might have been murdered , it runs mr ruddy s work under headlines like experts doubt foster suicide finding the publisher expresses bemusement at the idea that he is some kind of crusading citizen kane on a conspiracy kick it s mindboggling , he said in a rare interview , his first , he said , in more than 10 years he said he poured money into outlets providing alternative points of view on the foster case because he thought it had the potential to be the political story of the century he saw much of the mainstream coverage of whitewater as a whitewash according to a timecnn poll during the first days of the recent senate hearings into the aftermath of mr foster s death , only 35 percent of the 1 , 000 adults surveyed were convinced that he had committed suicide twenty percent said they thought he was murdered mr scaife , whose political philanthropy first gained public attention when he gave 1 million to the committee to reelect the president in 1972 , controls private trusts that have given away more than 300 million over the past 30 years much of it goes to groups like the heritage foundation , the center for strategic and international studies and other conservative thinktanks and foundations mr scaife , a fourthgeneration heir to the mellon banking fortune , one of the nation s greatest , has a reputation as a firebreather but time has mellowed him he cites the conclusion of a bitter eightyear divorce , a good second marriage and a successful course of treatment for alcoholism as sources of inner peace he holds few political views that could not be expressed on the editorial page of the wall street journal , supports planned parenthood , backs gov pete wilson of california for president and bears no apparent animus toward president clinton , whom he calls a likable fellow during a twohour interview , mr scaife often turned to the president of the scaife foundations , richard m larry , a 60yearold exmarine who answered succinctly the ineptness of this administration , mr larry said , which is so profound that they even use their ineptness as an excuse 'we were inexperienced , we did n't know' these people ca n't handle a twocar funeral on a oneway street whitewater is not only the ineptness , it is more an indicator of the corrupt nature , the immense corruptness of the clinton people mr scaife nodded in agreement , though he expressed himself in softer tones those tones rose only when he turned to the larger political landscape the politics of the democratic party are class warfare based on the demonization of public figures , he said it was ever thus , from herbert hoover in the 1930 s to newt gingrich today they have to maintain a symbol of hatred , he said
there really are people who are perfect for the new match uptown unfortunately , it took me a long time to find one that s a drawback when dining at a restaurant that is as much about ambiance as it is about food the moment you call the restaurant , you get the sense that you are in for more than dinner what other restaurant gives you a confirmation number when you reserve a table \? then you arrive to discover red velvet ropes across the door and a man with a clipboard checking names on the sidewalk we have a sort of bar scene , he will tell you , that interferes with the diners so we try to keep it down i had a terrific view of that bar scene from the lounge area where i was seated the first time i ate at match uptown my guests , a group of artists who rarely venture above 14th street , were pleased they were treating the meal as a visit to a foreign land , and they wanted to watch the natives i was less pleased the slouchy beige sofas are too low for the tables and our backrest was a pillow not quite as long as the banquette , so my neighbor and i spent the entire evening tugging at it , each trying to get comfortable the artists stopped studying the fabulously coifed couple across from us long enough to note the clever burlap bags that held the bread , and to examine the menu , which contained a number of unlikely combinations like calamari with sesameapricot sauce and halibut with cinnamon braised leeks , mushrooms and blood orange sauce they were charmed they ordered a strangesounding assortment of dim sum and a platter of sushi and sashimi they also wanted the vegetable bento the more outrageous the combination , the happier they were at least until the food came we all liked the vegetable dumplings in red currycoconut sauce , but the the crab summer roll seemed to be filled entirely with clear noodles and the spring roll , an outlandish concoction of barbecued duck and goat cheese , left even the artists speechless but when the expensive platter of sushi and sashimi arrived , they sniffed , pretty pedestrian the platter held an assortment of tuna , yellowtail , cooked shrimp , eel , salmon roe and a pair of pretty rolls featuring shrimp , avocado , eel and cucumber i thought the fish was nice enough , but the seaweed wrappers were damp instead of crisp , which takes the pleasure out of eating sushi the vegetable bento was n't much of a hit either , despite its fancy presentation in a traditional japanese box fifteen dollars and 50 cents for this \? cried the artists , picking at an ear of corn , some grilled eggplant , pepper , zucchini and fennel , a few rounds of beets and an assortment of starches like polenta , rice , barley and lentils in the end , the evening produced three definite hits the decor was beautiful sakesteamed cockles , a special , were sweet , tender and tasty and the artists were fascinated by the couple with the beautiful hair , who spent half the evening gazing at each other and picking at their food still , they said as we were leaving downtown , a man in love would not spend half the night hollering into his portable phone for my next meal , i invited an uptown crowd , lawyers who live nearby we were immediately ushered into the cozier , more comfortable back dining room , which was a decided improvement but after the rigamarole of velvet ropes and checked names , it was a letdown to find the room halfempty they get a late crowd , i said hopefully to my guests this group wanted nothing to do with sushi , but we ordered all the other appetizers the best was tuna tartar , the diced raw fish stacked with avocado , cucumbers , creme fraiche and caviar it was pretty and delicious i liked a parfait of goat cheese and golden beets , too but a chilled corn chowder had very little flavor , and a salad of tomatoes , asiago and curly endive starred totally tasteless tomatoes seared scallops were set on a rich but oddly bland oxtail risotto surrounded by a bright green pea stock too creative , mused the lawyers , politely passing on it the entrees were better peppered tuna , seared rare , was served with stirfried asian greens and topped with a tangle of crisply fried noodles rounds of salmon came wrapped in bacon in an artful vertical presentation with spinach , roasted peppers and cardamomlobster stock duck breast was grilled , paired with duck sausage , fried plantains and dandelion greens in a staranise redwine sauce i liked the food , but there was so much activity on each of the plates that eating was exhausting you know , said one of the lawyers , this food is more fun to talk about than it is to eat and talking , by then , had become a problem because the crowd did get thicker as the hour got later , and the sound rose until we were surrounded by the din of disco music we rushed through dessert , noting a delicious strawberry financier made of poundcake , berries and almonds , and a richly overwrought chocolate banana creation it took a few more visits to find the perfect person to take to match uptown and the perfect time to do it but finally , when i invited a successful man with no interest in food to lunch , we had a terrific time in the daytime , sunlight pours through the skylight to illuminate the huge flower arrangements in the back room and the service is so solicitous that at one point my friend leaned across to the women next to us and said , how many times have they asked you if everything is all right \? dozens , one replied the food \? well , salt cod cakes were surrounded by black beans and topped with a seaweed salad i thought they tasted faintly of banana but the businessman ate them without comment then he had orecchiette with peas , cherry tomatoes , roast fennel and spinach in a pesto broth do n't you think it s awfully fussy \? i asked tastes ok to me , he said , spooning the pasta into his mouth this is certainly a pretty room and while i thought spicy duck pizza , with black beans , smoked mozzarella and black mushrooms was sort of strange and salty , he ate it very happily it s relaxing here , he said , looking around so i seem to know the perfect person to take to match uptown on the other hand , a man like that you can take anywhere match uptown  33 east 60th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 9069173 ambiance the bar is hot , the lounge is cool with the requisite sushi bar , and the dining room is filled with flowers but forget all that the beautiful people are the only decor that really matters service generally professional and pleasant recommended dishes tuna tartar , seared pepper tuna , grilled spiced duck breast , panroasted salmon , spitroasted poussin , strawberry financier , chocolate banana torte wine list the list is small , well selected and slightly pricey hours lunch 11 30 am to 3 30 pm mondays through fridays dinner 6 pm to 2 am daily price range lunch appetizers 550 to 850 , entrees 1050 to 1675 , desserts 650 dinner appetizers 650 to 1050 , entrees 15 to 24 , desserts 650 credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility the bar is at street level but there are two steps down to the restaurant what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews hundreds of times restaurant reviews are available on line from times , an arts and entertainment guide on america online software and information 18005485201
washington , dec 7 hoping to get budget negotiations with congress off the ground , president clinton today offered a new plan that he said would balance the budget in seven years , but it was immediately assailed by republican leaders following a 90minute negotiating session in the capitol this afternoon , leon e panetta , the white house chief of staff , said of the president s new proposal we think it works we think it s credible we think it s defensible but senator pete v domenici of new mexico , chairman of the senate budget committee , declared i am as disappointed as i can be they do not in any way bridge the gap and his counterpart in the house , representative john r kasich of ohio , said that the democrats were not just a day and a dollar short they 're 17 days late and 400 billion short it was impossible to tell how much of this reaction was political theater and how much was genuine disgust with the president s position whatever the case , the negotiators from both sides agreed to resume meeting on friday participants said today s session had few of the angry exchanges and sharp recriminations that had characterized previous negotiations for the first time in five meetings , said senator byron l dorgan , democrat of north dakota , we actually started turning pages and talking about policy we were n't shouting at each other , and that had n't happened before today s proposal amounts to the third budget president clinton has offered this year it differs only on the margins from the one he put forth last june that was supposed to balance the budget in nine years the main change was the president s offer to make cuts averaging 5 percent in some domestic programs , which he did not specify he said highpriority programs would not be trimmed one new proposal today , trivial in budget terms but important on wall street , would crack down on various aggressive or innovative financial practices that turn on stretching the tax law farther than the administration believes is acceptable article , page d1 what is important is that both sides now have their opening offers on the table neither offer today s proposal by the white house and the mammoth budget legislation approved by congress last month and vetoed by the president on wednesday will ever become law , but they mark the starting points for the negotiations under the agreement that ended last month s partial shutdown of the government , funds will run out again on dec 15 unless all the spending bills are approved or a new temporary extension of spending authority is adopted mr clinton suggested today that congress allow more breathing room by approving a temporary spending bill that would run through january mr kasich assessed the chances of congress s accepting that as between slim and none the biggest hurdle to be overcome is that the two sides are operating from different economic assumptions the administration s forecast , prepared by the office of management and budget , is slightly more optimistic than the one congress uses , which was done by the congressional budget office but the slight differences mushroom when they are stretched to cover seven years the result is that congress , using its figures , had to find 812 billion in savings over seven years to have the budget in balance by 2002 , while the administration needed only 465 billion to make its figures balance the congressional budget office plans to provide a recalculated forecast next week that is expected to narrow the difference somewhat , but the two sides will still be hundreds of billions of dollars apart mr panetta suggested that these differences would become moot if the negotiators could agree to some kind of enforcement mechanism that would lock in a balanced budget whatever the state of the economy turned out to be but though he repeated the term over and over , mr panetta did not describe what such a mechanism might look like still , the main obstacle in the way of compromise seems to be not so much the dollars as the principles the republicans are determined to shrink the size of the federal government and reduce its place in the lives of americans , while the democrats in most instances want to keep the government s influence and control the new proposal does not fundamentally change the extent to which the president wants to preserve federal assistance to poor people and the republicans want to diminish it this basic dispute flared briefly in today s closeddoor negotiations , participants said white house officials insisted that medicaid , the health insurance program for the poor , must remain a federal program that would serve everyone who met federal eligibility requirements republicans said that was out of the question and demanded that the program be turned over to the states to administer as they want mr clinton s new plan suggests spending about 140 billion less over the next seven years than did the plan he put forward in june about a quarter of that would come from adopting the bureau of labor statistics' new method of calculating inflation the new calculation would lead to smaller annual costofliving increases in social security and other benefit programs and to higher tax revenue another sizable chunk would come from selling government assets , including governors island in new york harbor , and from a new auction of space on the broadcast spectrum but the biggest single share , 64 billion , would result from unspecified savings in domestic programs
the metronorth commuter railroad reached tentative contract agreements with five more of its unions early this morning , but talks with the teamsters union were still under way and officials would not rule out a possible strike this morning the unions that reached the agreements , announced at 2 20 am , represent several trades , including the railroad s electricians , machinists , firemen and sheet metal workers negotiators for both sides continued to talk past 12 01 am , when the unions would have legally been allowed to strike the teamsters are considered by both sides to be the most crucial among the 10 remaining holdout unions yesterday , chris silvera , secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 808 , said , the talks are just standing still it s not progressing , he said yesterday after hours of intense talks at the new york sheraton in manhattan i 'd tell commuters to wake up early mr silvera said the sticking points were work rules and a new management insistence on a fiveyear contract , rather than four years a spokesman for the metropolitan transportation authority , john cunningham , said he could not confirm that these were the remaining issues of disagreement the railroad planned to have 400 buses standing by today to carry rushhour riders to subway stations in the bronx in case of a strike and even if the railroad is running , metronorth officials are bracing for mass confusion people should listen to the radio when they get up and take their cues from that , said marjorie anders , a metronorth spokeswoman new york city officials prepared for an expected flood of vehicles , suspending parking restrictions for street cleaning in the bronx and adjusting signal timing on major northsouth streets in that borough to speed traffic metronorth has more than 100 , 000 roundtrip passengers each weekday , including about 70 , 000 rushhour commuters , and many of those people viewed today s commuting with foreboding charles turner , an electrician from poughkeepsie who works in the city , planned to drive in if there was a strike they 're providing buses , but i have no idea how long it will take , he said yesterday at grand central terminal tomorrow will be a zoo metronorth officials warned that the alternative bus service would be able to carry only 50 to 60 percent of the normal rushhour load those buses will depart from only 21 suburban stations , leaving more than 50 stations upstate and in connecticut unserved the railroad has arranged for motorists to park free at several major lots , including those at yonkers raceway , rye playland , orchard beach and yankee and shea stadiums , with bus service from there to subway stations in the bronx ms anders said preparations for the strike had cost 400 , 000 , and the bus service would cost 200 , 000 a day to operate , though it might take in as much as 75 , 000 a day in fares elliot g sander , the city transportation commissioner , urged people who drive not to use the major deegan and bruckner expressways , which are expected to be overloaded in june and july , the threat of a strike by a coalition of 17 unions caused widespread anxiety and led riders to stay away by the thousands the mta responded by invoking a provision of federal law that put negotiations on hold and made a strike illegal for four months a tactic that it cannot resort to again that waiting period ended at 12 01 am today , when the unions became free to walk out last week , the mta reached tentative accords with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and the united transportation union , which represents conductors two unions that , along with the teamsters , had led the labor coalition railroad officials hope the other unions will follow the lead of the engineers and conductors , who negotiators said had agreed to a 103 percent wage increase over four years officials of the remaining unions yesterday said that they were prepared to accept an identical wage package more difficult , they said , will be accepting management s insistence on changes in work rules that would make the railroad more efficient but could cost workers substantial overtime pay the teamsters , who represent track workers , welders , machine operators and some other trades , are viewed as the crucial union , in part because of their prominent role all year in the labor coalition they have also been the most militant of the 17 unions and , with 700 members , are one of the largest mr silvera said the mta had agreed to provide paid sick leave to workers who now had none , and to increase vacation time for some workers mr cunningham , the mta spokesman , said earlier that a continued sticking point was the scheduling of track workers under the old contract , track workers earn overtime pay 50 percent above their base wages whenever they work nights or weekends , even if they work no more than 40 hours in a week
london , aug 18 rhonepoulenc rorer , the frenchamerican pharmaceuticals company , made an unsolicited 26 billion bid today for the british drug company fisons plc , which quickly rejected the offer as too low rhonepoulenc rorer , which is based in collegeville , pa , said it had offered 240 in cash , or about 367 , for each fisons share , a total of 17 billion the fisons shares surged after the offer they closed at 2645 , or 405 , on the london stock exchange , up 715 pence , or 109 , from their close on thursday of 193 the closing price of the fisons shares , more than rorer s offer , indicated that investors were betting that fisons would eventually agree to a higher offer , either from rorer or from another bidder on the new york stock exchange , rhonepoulenc rorer closed today at 42125 , down 125 the proposed deal continues the consolidation trend that has swept the pharmaceutical industry in recent years with the business increasingly dominated by giants like glaxo wellcome and merck company , which can afford the heavy investments needed to develop and market new drugs , smaller companies are increasingly being squeezed into niches or left scrambling to find partners fisons had spent much of this year seeking to acquire another british drug company , medeva plc , but that deal broke down last month when fisons refused to raise its offer enough to suit medeva s board fisons has remade itself during the last year , selling its nonpharmaceuticals businesses and its drug research and development arm its chief executive , stuart wallis , has adopted what many analysts consider a risky strategy concentrating on marketing wellestablished drugs , rather than competing to invent new ones themain products at fisons are two asthma treatments , intal and tilade the company s sales last year were 19 billion rhonepoulenc rorer is 68 percent owned by the french chemicals company rhonepoulenc , with the remaining shares publicly traded it had sales last year of 45 billion , and has been investing heavily in respiratory treatments , including asthma products until last year it had a joint venture with fisons to market the fisons asthma drugs in the united states the acquisition of fisons would provide rhonepoulenc rorer with a strong global position for the further development of its asthmaallergy business , michel de rosen , rhonepoulenc rorer s chief executive , said in a statement rorer said the combined companies would rank fourth in the worldwide asthma and allergy drug market , behind glaxo wellcome , scheringplough and astra of sweden we believe that the offer represents a significant opportunity for fisons s shareholders to realize full value today for their investment in a company with a very uncertain future , mr de rosen said fisons s strategy as an independent marketing entity with no research capability will not produce sustainable growth fisons said it had told rorer in a series of previous meetings that its offering price was too low the bid from rhonepoulenc rorer is not welcome , and the price offered will not command the board s support , mr wallis said in a statement at a news conference in paris , rhonepoulenc s managing director , igor landau , said rorer would still press ahead this affair is going to take a long time , 60 days , and will only be decisive at the end , mr landau said it is unclear how much interest any other bidders might have in fisons analysts said zeneca , another british drug company , could be a possible buyer , and that any number of other european and american companies might take a look but they said that fisons had been vulnerable to a takeover bid for a long time and that none had materialized until rorer came along , suggesting that few other companies were seriously interested graphs profiles of the companies lists employee , financial and sales statistics for rhonepoulenc rorer and fison \( source bloomberg business news \) \( pg 32 \)

chicago one of the latest stark examples of volatility in the hightechnology sector is not a biotech company or an offspring of the internet , but illinois superconductor , one of a handful of publicly traded companies striving to exploit the strange physical phenomenon known as superconductivity the sixyearold company , based in mount prospect , ill , is racing to demonstrate before it runs out of money the commercial value of its highefficiency device for filtering radio waves at cellular telephone stations the filter is intended to allow phone companies to provide clearer reception for more cellular customers and , because it is much smaller than existing equipment , give the phone companies more flexibility in where they build cell sites illinois superconductor s shares have been on a roller coaster this year in the nasdaq market they lost a third of their value from january to march , falling to 6 each they shot up to 1050 in april , fell back below 7 during the summer , jumped to 11 in early september and then soared this month to a close of 1625 on monday on reports that the first field tests by an unidentified cellular operator were going well on tuesday , the stock jumped 5 higher in advance of an announcement that the company had raised 39 million in a private placement , then settled at 1850 on wednesday , the stock closed at 1925 the company cannot cite a fundamental reason for the sharpness of the stock s recent runup i ca n't see anything except momentum that is driving it this far , said stephen wasko , the company s chief financial officer the few analysts watching illinois superconductor and similar stocks recommend buying them , but they warn that they are only for investors ready to make longterm bets and investors should also realize that the brokers most likely to be pushing these stocks are often affiliated with the firms that took the companies public investors playing hunches are not much different from the physicists leading the charge in superconductivity research the scientists are reduced to guesses in explaining the phenomenon , which causes certain materials to generate powerful magnetic fields and lose all resistance to electricity when chilled , making the transport of electricity much more efficient superconductivity has been known for decades , but it had been confined to metals cooled to such low temperatures that few practical applications were conceivable the current excitement is based on the unexpected nobel prizewinning discovery in 1986 of families of ceramics that become superconductors at temperatures achievable with liquid nitrogenbased refrigeration , which is relatively inexpensive suddenly , a wide range of highly efficient , miniaturized , or supersensitive electrical and electronic products became plausible , from levitated highspeed trains to faster computers to medical imaging equipment that is safer , cheaper and more precise than xray machines the technology s realistic market potential should finally start coming into focus for investors in the next year as the first telecommunications and medical diagnostic products start to reach the market , said theodore o'neill , an analyst at h c wainwright company in boston this could put illinois superconductor and a host of other superconductor stocks on more investors' radar screens the wireless industry alone could buy 1 billion in equipment annually once superconducting products are accepted , based on some industry estimates until then , mr o'neill said , it will probably be hard to generate much institutional interest or research by brokerage firms conductus , superconductor technologies inc , and american superconductor , in addition to illinois superconductor , are all thinly traded stocks with small capitalizations they are prone to price jumps when good test results or strategic alliances are announced , and to dips when shortterm profit seekers head for the exits and intermagnetics general , the only company with a significant stake in the technology along with established businesses , is hardly a giant and superconductivity s just so hard to understand , said mr o'neill , whose firm makes a market in american superconductor , superconductor technologies and conductus , but not in illinois superconductor i feel sort of like the maytag repairman i have all the information , but there has been little call for it but he added i 'd buy anything in the group but none are for people with time horizons of less than a year and i 'd buy any of the others before illinois

the same lament is implicit in margaret andrews s black and white photographs of children a boy and girl stand behind a chainlink fence as if in jail a young boy , squeaky clean in a white shirt , peers mournfully out from under the protective arm of a crossing guard the artists seem to be saying that despite the civil rights movement , things have changed little if at all in cities like bridgeport they may have grown worse , ayubu ben johnson implies in hitech blues this image , impressionistically painted in hot pinks , features men defined by their legs as they hang around on a street , waiting as the artist notes sarcastically in his caption , the dictionary definition of the technology that has put his subjects out of work is a system whereby a society provides its members with those things they need or desire though it illustrates the point well enough , the picture cannot compare with others by the same artist , notably the allgray image of prison bars grasped by human hands that , repeated in rows , has the look of a print different but no less impressive is mr johnson s portrait of john coltrane , the sum of many bright colors applied as if by stencils representation comes in many styles but none so exact as in the figure paintings of barkley l hendricks the artist has long been known for his portraits of extravagantly dressed models , usually women , who seem oblivious to the impression they give or are too weighed down with anomie to care thus the young redhead called ma petite kumquat faces front wearing a black coatdress with a green tasseled cord slung over one shoulder like a bandolier and furry leg warmers in another work , a young black woman wears a white gown , gold earrings , glasses and unconcernedly presents views as if for a wanted poster but there is a young man , also portrayed three times , who obviously exults in his costume of widebrimmed green hat , shiny green coat with white fur and multiple zippers and platform shoes contrasting with these lifesize oils are very large watercolors of apparently more recent vintage that pay homage to those produced in the bahamas by winslow homer but mr hendricks , ever offbeat , devotes most of his space to pale sky , adding along the bottom a horizon defined by shrubbery , palms and in one case a tiny gray lighthouse mr hendricks may be the star of the show but he gets competition , notably from the sculptor james l buxton jr , whose large gate stands by the entrance to the show within a frame made of sharpened saplings are rows of sticks , spheres and wood elements resembling bottles in outline because it is painted black , the piece automatically evokes louise nevelson , which is a pity because mr buxton has little but the use of black in common with his predecessor , being less a manipulator of found wood objects than a carver of the raw material his unpainted relief consisting of a shield shape stuffed with twigs also repays attention befitting its title , roots and reality includes items that refer to the black american past part of colleen l coleman s altar assemblage cargo of the spirit is papered with a reproduction of the seating plan on a slave ship yohuru ralph williams contributes a portrait of his grandmother with a carved coconut husk for a head , a sarong made from a banner imprinted with the words american revolution , and other tropical items found in the bridgeport neighborhood with this figure , mr williams acknowledges the medicinal and probably magical powers of his grandmother but with his smaller assemblages small silhouettes compiled of plastic wiring , toy guns , beer caps , crack vials and other urban detritus the artist could be saying something quite different curlee raven holton takes note of western customs impinging on african life by contrasting color photographs of young africans in their habitat with oil paint applied as impasto phillip fortune celebrates the beauty of blackness in photographs of a woman , manipulated and tinted as one of connecticut s struggling urban musuems , the discovery seems exactly the right place for these issues the show is hardly agitprop but it leaves a viewer wondering if black american aspirations can survive , given the present climate in which everyone , everywhere seems to be getting theirs roots and reality remains on view through may 28 at the discovery museum , 4450 park avenue , bridgeport photos boxed life , colleen l coleman october s gone , goodnight , barkley l hendricks alma , yohuru ralph williams roots , james l buxton jr john coltrane , ayubu ben johnson \( george ruhe for the new york times \)
the apartment she grew up in was overflowing with family , and she never lacked someone to talk to but when shavon glover became pregnant at 14 , she did not tell a single relative , for fear they would stop loving her later , when her son was 2 , her aunts assigned her the task of chaperoning her younger sister and cousins around their harlem neighborhood the point , she said , was to make sure they did not end up like her at 16 , ms glover escorted her sister and cousin to a nightly dance class at the dunlevy milbank center in harlem , which is run by the children s aid society while they danced , she would wait alone in a hallway i would get the nasty looks and hear the nasty comments , she said i already had a kid , so people acted like it was too late for me but one night in 1985 , someone decided it was not the children s aid society was starting its teen pregnancy prevention program , and the director , dr michael carrera , spotted ms glover s son at the community center he tripped over kevin and asked , 'whose kid is this \? ' she said , laughing at the memory that s when he asked me to join dr carrera , a former hunter college professor , wanted to offer harlem teenagers a pregnancy prevention program that reached beyond anatomy lessons the key , he believed , was to spend several years nurturing their talents and encouraging them to contemplate their futures opening up possibilities for teenagers who thought they had none has a contraceptive effect , dr carrera said our goal is to view these kids as pure potential instead of accidents waiting to happen since it began , the program has provided more than 200 city children with tutoring , summer jobs , counseling and sexeducation classes its staff of teachers , doctors , social workers and volunteers work in three community centers around the city teenagers who successfully complete the program , which costs the children s aid society about 415 , 000 a year , are guaranteed acceptance to hunter college in manhattan as part of the program , ms glover took a course in sexuality , learning about sex roles and responsibilities as well as birth control and aids but she also received tutoring , learned business skills in a job club , opened a bank account and played squash and basketball counselors at the center offered the emotional support she lacked at home , and ms glover grew determined to make something of her life i saw what public assistance did to my mother and aunts , and i promised myself it would not be an option for me , she said once i got involved in the program , i knew i would never , ever have to go that route the children s aid society is one of seven charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund , which is conducting its 83d appeal for donations since the times pays the administrative costs of the appeal , all contributions go directly to the charities , which use it for programs like teen pregnancy prevention with dr carrera s support , ms glover finished high school , holding several parttime jobs to support her son she enrolled at hunter college in 1987 and has been working toward a degree in physical education ever since with a son to support , the going has been slow but she is determined to graduate this year and become a physical education teacher life has been hectic , and a few times i came close to giving up , but my son tells me that quitters never get anywhere , she said how can i respond to that \? ms glover s son is already enrolled in the pregnancy prevention program at 12 , he is more interested in the sports component than the sexuality classes but she has already broached the subject with him more than once i really stress that if he has questions about sex , he should come to me , she said , because what he s going to hear on the street is n't going to be the right information last fall , ms glover returned to dunlevy milbank center as a sex education teacher in the program she works with girls who range in age from 11 to 18 , answering their questions and gently trying to boost their selfesteem when i was their age , the only thing i heard about sex was , 'you 'd better not get pregnant , ' she said i want these girls to feel like they can ask me everything previously recorded 3 , 445 , 73900 recorded friday \( last business day \) 19 , 36100 total 3 , 465 , 10000 photo the children s aid society s teen pregnancy prevention program has aided more than 200 children shavon glover , third from left , counsels , from left , lynette sullivan , tiffany fitzgerald and meleen riddick \( lenore victoria davis for the new york times \)
it was an incredible performance , even by michael jordan s standards it was a game that 100 , 000 people will probably swear they saw at madison square garden and in the end it was jordan who made one final remarkable play that gave the chicago bulls a victory jordan s pass to bill wennington for an uncontested dunk with 31 seconds to play last night lifted the bulls to a sensational 113111 victory over the knicks jordan scored 55 points the highest total this season in the national basketball association and the most by a knick opponent at the new garden on 21 for 37 shooting but it was a jordan pass that won the game with the score tied , 111111 , and the final 10 seconds ticking away , jordan drove into the lane against john starks , drew new york s defense to him , then spotted wennington standing alone underneath the basket wennington caught the bullet pass and dunked as patrick ewing rushed back too late my first notion was to score , jordan said of the play i was able to still maintain the focus to get the ball over to the open man , and that was bill wennington i would be lying if i said i was going to pass the ball i was going to make them stop me , but i was able to get the ball to the open man said wennington , i kind of knew patrick would leave me he had been leaving me the whole game i knew where i was supposed to go m j told me exactly where to go the knicks still had a chance to answer , but it literally slipped away anthony mason , playing his first game at the garden since his fivegame suspension , inbounded the ball at midcourt to starks when starks tried to spin around jordan , he slipped and lost control of the ball it trickled beyond midcourt and when starks retrieved it , he was called for a backcourt violation with 13 seconds to play when jordan leaped into the air at midcourt to accept the ensuing inbounds pass , the final buzzer sounded , and the bulls began to celebrate a victory that had to do wonders for them psychologically asked if the bulls had renewed confidence with jordan back , steve kerr said , we have a lot of confidence we have superman on our team and the knicks were out of kryptonite it was almost as if the two teams picked up where they left off during the 1993 playoffs , the last time the knicks had faced jordan the electric atmosphere was like game 7 of the finals , opening night and the allstar game wrapped up in one but jordan blocked it all out and did what he does better than anyone else in only his fifth game since returning to the bulls once i step onto the court , that other stuff does n't matter to me , jordan said i'm at my own peace the knicks were at his mercy ewing \( 36 points \) carried the knicks in the fourth quarter and he almost carried them to victory but as he has done so many times , jordan found a way to win does any team want to play the bulls in the first round of the playoffs \? unless the bulls pass the cleveland cavaliers , whom chicago \( 3733 \) trails by two games , the knicks will likely see the bulls in the opening round they are 04 in playoff series against bulls teams led by jordan all the knicks \( 4424 \) could do afterward was shake their heads and regroup none of them was surprised by jordan s heroics no , i'm not surprised , said coach pat riley , looking out at the hundreds of media members during his postgame news conference that s why all of you are here some players simply transcend every aspect of the game no one in the history of this game has had the impact that he has had he got it started the other night against atlanta , sort of building up to new york the final moments were pressurepacked a jordan jumper with 258 seconds left gave chicago a 111109 lead the knicks needed a basket , and starks stepped forward , driving to the basket where he was fouled by will perdue with 146 seconds to play starks made both free throws to tie the game , setting up the final sequence the knicks did not doubleteam jordan most of the night , feeling they could withstand his shooting barrage and still win guess again scottie pippen also had a strong allround game with 10 points , 9 rebounds and 8 assists one of the great things that can happen is that he could 've had 55 and we could 've won , said riley their spacing and their shooters are so good that they just get everything if you start to run around that s all hindsight the fourth quarter was like two heavyweights slugging it out in the middle of the ring the bulls got the first knockdown with a critical 100 run early in the quarter with jordan on the bench that gave chicago a 9990 lead with 7 minutes 25 seconds left but ewing , rising to the occasion with 14 points in the final quarter , scored the next 8 points to pull the knicks to within 1 the only place where ewing fell short was at the foul line , missing four foul shots in the fourth quarter those misses were costly ewing was 16 for 23 from the line , and the knicks were 31 for 44 no matter what michael did , we would have won if we had made our free throws , ewing said i missed seven myself no question if we had made our foul shots , the game would have been ours chicago s lead grew to 10598 with 3 30 left , before the knicks stormed back ewing pulled the knicks to within 5 with a baseline jumper after an offensive foul by jordan , two free throws by mason cut chicago s lead to 3 then after a jordan jumper , starks made two free throws to make the score 107104 with 2 06 left ewing then made a sensational block on perdue , sending the knicks downcourt for a controversial play ewing wheeled into the lane and was fouled by pippen just as he began his shooting motion ewing continued and made the basket , and he wanted it to count for a possible 3point play but the referees ruled that the foul occurred before ewing s shot , and waved off the basket ewing made just one of two foul shots to make the score 105107 but ewing made another big block against jordan on a jumepr in the lane , sending starks to a breakaway layup for a 107107 tie with 1 02 left a 12foot bank shot by pippen gave chicago a 2point lead , but ewing tied the game with two free throws with 39 second to play , setting up the finish when jordan walked onto the garden floor , it was as if he had never left his 35point first half was worth the price of admission , perhaps even at scalpers' rates it was vintage jordan exactly what people had come to see , and exactly what jordan s opponents have come to dread jordan shot 14 for 19 in the first half , and the rusty jumper he displayed in his first outing had become welloiled most of his points came on jumpers , and some of them never even hit the rim starks was helpless trying to defend jordan it almost seemed as if jordan had gotten taller since he had been away , and that starks had gotten shorter with his height advantage and leaping ability , jordan was n't even bothered by starks when he released his shots the fans were in awe , reacting to every shot who could blame them \?

ganim , west bank , nov 15 the unthinkable became reality last week for the 33 jewish families of ganim when armed palestinians took charge of nearby jenin what if the palestinian police tried to stop them , as they were allowed to do under the peace agreement that brought the police to jenin \? something akin to a groan passed through the clutch of residents gathered outside the administration office of the small , armed israeli settlement in the north of the west bank it s a creepy feeling , confessed mihal bronstein , a nurse who has lived in ganim for 14 years , including the seven when the palestinian uprising made traveling outside the enclave dangerous and just living there tense they 're terrorists , not police they were trained in terror camps , and now the government has decided to call them police ! the people of ganim are hardly the bellicose settlers of hebron who speak of palestinians as foreigners and spew the violent religious ideology that fired yigal amir , the confessed assassin of prime minister yitzhak rabin secular for the most part , most of them came as much to take advantage of inexpensive housing in a striking hilltop setting within commuting distance of the israeli city of afula as to fulfill the romantic zionist dream of building pioneering settlements in the promised land united in opposing peace agreements but secular or religious , the 147 , 000 israeli jews who people the archipelago of 145 settlements across the west bank have become united in a sense of betrayal by the labor government and in opposition to the peace agreements with the palestinians though the peace agreements reached so far leave the settlements intact and in fact improve their lot somewhat by bringing them new bypass roads that connect them more safely with israel the fears and passions of the settlers are at the heart of the bitter dispute that has severed the nation , and that cost mr rabin his life we have to be careful of using words like 'betrayal' these days , but there s a clear divide today in israeli society between those looking for a new israel of israelis and those looking for a jewish israel , between 'yisraeli' and 'yehudi' israeli and jew , said yechiel leiter , 36 , a settler originally from scranton , pa , who serves as a spokesman for the yesha council , which represents settlers in the west bank and gaza the distinction he drew was between a vision of israel as the modern , prosperous , secular state of which tel aviv is the spiritual capital the vision with which the left wing is associated and a jewish state in the biblical land of israel of which religious nationalists dream , including the west bank regions of judea and samaria , with jerusalem as its heart the debate is over the national character of the country , not where the final borderline is drawn , mr leiter said the horns are locked over much , much broader issues than drawing a line in the sand or oslo 1 and 2 , he said , using israeli shorthand for the two israelipalestinian agreements reached so far the debate is over the very core of our existence that is not what they had in mind when they came out here , mihal bronstein and her husband , alan , acknowledged mr bronstein regarded himself as a liberal when he left los angeles 25 years earlier to cast his lot with israel , and he met his wife in a leftwing kibbutz 'ideology comes with being here' now mr bronstein carries a gun when driving to israel , and would not dream of voting for the labor party the ideology comes with being here , he explained living here grows on you the bronsteins moved to the young settlement of ganim in 1981 , when moving to the west bank was the thing to do housing was cheap , mortgages were easy , the palestinians were relatively peaceable and , most important , settling in the historic jewish lands of judea and samaria carried the romantic aura of pioneering zionism and the blessing of the government and the nation then in 1987 , the intifada , as the palestinian uprising against israel is known , turned benign neighbors into dangerous enemies a ganim settler named motti biton was killed by palestinians when he stopped at an arab store , and many others found their cars stoned wire fences were thrown up around settlements , and both men and women learned to use and carry guns new bypass roads were built for millions of dollars today , ganim children are bused to grade school in another settlement under military escort , an hour each way in 1992 a labor government came to power under prime minister rabin and began treating the settlers not as a national vanguard , but as a nuisance a drain on the army and an obstacle to peace with palestinians mr rabin called the settlers crybabies , and he declared that their settlements add nothing , absolutely nothing , to israel s security he called the west bank the territories , not judea and samaria , and he drew a line between security settlements , like those in the jordan valley and around jerusalem , and political settlements , which were built under the ideology of his predecessor , yitzhak shamir , who promised to settle israelis to the horizon s edge mr rabin froze housing construction , and political settlements lost special benefits like tax and mortgage incentives
it had been two years since the big man from new orleans sold jorge washington guevera a steel fence , security door and window guards to protect the first home his family ever owned , on caldwell avenue in mott haven , the bronx since then , the gueveras , ecuadorean immigrants , had built a patio , a basement guest room and more you all got a palace here ! brian s falgoust , boomed , his cajun accent as smooth as a fine bourbon the home s entrance , guarded by two snarling cement lions , befits a palace mr guevera , a custodian , also bought the lions from mr falgoust , at 95 each , a bargain as far as the proud extenant is concerned the lions \?

washington , nov 3 of all the republican underclassmen in the house of representatives who have crusaded this year to turn decades of liberal rule on their ear , few have been as ardent as representative ernest jim istook jr mr istook , a 45yearold lawyer from oklahoma , is one of the most conservative members of the house legislation he proposed to limit abortions has slowed action on at least three of the 1996 spending bills he is chief sponsor of a constitutional amendment on school prayer , and he is among a cadre of members who succeeded in winning a house vote to deny money for the health care of partners of unmarried district of columbia employees but none of those measures have generated as fervid a response as the amendment that bears his name the istook amendment would restrict government lobbying by certain nonprofit groups that receive federal grants it would legislate a virtual end to what mr istook calls welfare for lobbyists his effort to stop such groups from engaging in what he terms political advocacy has created a longrunning drama on capitol hill that is building to a climax not only has it snarled for more than a month a spending bill that finances the white house and the treasury department , but it has also driven a wedge between house and senate republicans , spawned a constitutional debate and roiled organizations from the american red cross to international business machines and for the moment , it looms as an obstacle to a budget deal between congress and the white house it s a matter of principle , said mr istook , a secondterm representative from oklahoma city congress is not required to subsidize lobbying activity for anybody , and that s what we 're talking about it s wrong for people to think that they have the right to get an automatic check from the us treasury to further their political agenda opponents of the measure among them influential republicans in the senate like mark o hatfield of oregon , the chairman of the appropriations committee see it differently they say the bill is aimed at groups that dissent from the republicans' own agenda , like the national council of senior citizens , which has led the fight against the republicans' plan for holding down the growth in spending on medicaid and medicare representative david e skaggs , a colorado democrat who is one of the measure s most strident critics , said this has nothing to do with lobbying with federal taxpayers' dollars that s a misdescription and a mischaracterization this is 22 pages of legislation having to do with the control of political expression in america while mr istook is the driving force behind the bill , his effort is supported by speaker newt gingrich and a sometimes rambunctious class of republican freshmen there are few things more important to the freshmen than this issue , representative robert l ehrlich jr of maryland said in an interview with the capitol hill newspaper congress daily he and another republican freshman , representative david m mcintosh of indiana , are cosponsors of the measure current law prohibits nonprofit groups from using federal money to lobby congress mr istook argues that his bill would merely extend and strengthen that law it would restrict nonprofit organizations with budgets of more than 3 million from using even their own money to engage in political advocacy that definition takes in not only lobbying , but also virtually any contact with federal , state or local legislators or regulators the bill would make it unlawful for any organization covered by the legislation to spend more than 5 to 20 percent of its own money , depending on the group s size , up to a maximum of 1 million , on political advocacy without risking the loss of its eligibility for federal grants for five years also affected would be groups that do not receive direct federal grants but that hire or buy anything from another organization that spends more than 15 percent of its money on political advocacy about 225 , 000 groups and individuals receive a share of the 40 billion in federal grants each year mr istook said his legislation would apply to about 4 percent of the grant recipients , or 3 , 000 groups mr istook s drive against spending government money on lobbying began during his days as a legislator in the oklahoma house , where he served from 1987 to 1993 his proposals were never enacted , however in washington , the national council of senior citizens is a group that mr istook frequently singles out he said in an interview , when you get 96 percent of your funding , 73 million , from taxpayers and still brag about spending millions of dollars for political commercials , getting hundreds of thousands of people to contact the president

to the editor your oct 2 news article on the dozens of american students who were beguiled into enrolling in warnborough college , thinking that it was part of oxford university , underscores the way we treat higher education as a commodity , with greater emphasis and interest in the prestige value of particular colleges than in the value of education itself that these youngsters and their parents would send the first year s tuition , 21 , 000 , to warnborough college without knowing anything about the school , other than what they learned through its literature , demonstrates not only the prevailing commodity principle but another unpleasant fact about how we view higher education in america as a means to an end , rather than as an end in itself the very idea of going to oxford was enough for these students and their families none of the students seem to have looked into the type of education they thought they were about to receive at oxford , which would have revealed the fallacy of their assumptions why not \? if your primary goal is to get an oxford degree , the nature of an oxford education is secondary at best our attitude toward higher education leads most american colleges to practice their own brands of artifice and selfpromotion when it comes to admissions practices , as demonstrated last year in wellknown stories about a number of schools that misrepresented information about themselves to achieve higher rankings in us news world report s america s best colleges it is hard to feel too sorry for the students taken in by warnborough s deceitful advertising when you treat education as a commodity , market principles replace loftier ones caveat emptor let the buyer beware howard g schneiderman prof of sociology , lafayette college easton , pa , oct 2 , 1995
elizabeth , nj , oct 12 six union county corrections officers were arrested before dawn today on charges of beating and taunting illegal immigrants brought to their jail last june the 25 immigrants were being transferred to the union county jail after an uprising at a privately run detention center nearby as their van arrived , prosecutors said , jail guards formed a gantlet to punch and kick them over the next four hours , the prosecutors said , the guards broke one detainee s collarbone , shoved other detainees' heads in toilets , used pliers to pull out one man s pubic hair and forced a line of men to kneel naked on the jail floor and chant , america is no 1 prosecutors said that at least two dozen officers participated in the beatings and that more arrests were likely an attorney for the arrested officers denied the charges , saying the detainees had fabricated their accounts joyce antila phipps , a lawyer for six of the immigrants , said the men were shocked and appalled by the guards' actions in america , she said , they never expected the type of treatment they received from the police in their home countries the 25 detainees sent to the union county jail were among 315 people awaiting immigration hearings who had been held at the immigration and naturalization service center in elizabeth after the june 18 disturbance , which caused considerable property damage but no serious injuries to guards , an ins investigation concluded that the detainees acted because of abusive and inhumane conditions at the center , which has been closed the prosecutors said there was no clear motive for the guards to torment the immigrants union county corrections officers were not involved in controlling the disturbance at the center , which was administered by a private contractor , the esmor correctional services corporation , based in melville , li some people are arrogant and believe they are above the law , said edward m neafsey , acting union county prosecutor others do n't really care about the law because this is how they get their kicks first assistant prosecutor michael j lapolla speculated that the guards may have been trying to intimidate a new group of inmates in the belief they had just been involved in an uprising in fact , prosecutors said , none of the men sent to the union county jail had participated in the disturbance at the center ms phipps , the immigrants' lawyer , said that none of the 25 detainees were criminals or posed any danger to the guards she said most were professionals or students who had spoken out against repressive governments and then fled to the united states she declined to identify the men by name , but said one was a chemical engineer from ghana , another was a jehovah s witness fleeing romania for religious reasons and a third was an algerian student whose father had been murdered by religious fundamentalists the officers charged include lieut joseph salay , who was in command when the detainees arrived , two sergeants and three corrections officers they face charges of official misconduct , which carry penalties of 5 to 10 years in prison , prosecutors said anthony pope , the officers' lawyer , described them as professionals and family men , and said the account of the beatings had been fabricated by the detainees he suggested the injuries reported by the immigrants had been inflicted during the disturbance at the ins center wherever the injuries may have occurred , certainly it was not at the hands of these officers , mr pope said mr lapolla said the detainees sent to the elizabeth jail had received brief medical checks before being taken away from the ins center he said that if any had been injured , they would not have been sent to the union county jail mr neafsey said he was confident that the detainees had not concocted a story because they spoke several different languages also , the detainees were held in small groups in different cells before being transferred to federal custody in pennsylvania , so they would not have been able to meet and fabricate a story mr neafsey said prosecutors had obtained videotaped statements from 24 detainees the 25th was deported before the investigation of the beatings began in early july officer michael sica , president of the corrections officers' union , said all the guards were expected to be free on bail by yesterday evening he criticized prosecutors for arresting the officers at 5 am , rather than allowing them to surrender he said it was part of an effort by prosecutors to intimidate other officers and persuade them to testify but mr neafsey , the acting prosecutor , said the officers should not expect special treatment from his office we moved in early for safety reasons , he said these defendants should not expect any treatment that is different than that accorded to defendants in any other criminal matter immigrants' rights advocates hailed the union county prosecutor s response to the detainees' allegations of mistreatment by guards they said such accusations often go unheard i do n't doubt that the things we saw happen there go on all over the country , said judy rabinovitz , senior staff counsel for the aclu rights project but i do n't think there are many prosecutors who pursue them in the same way my concern is that this is a widespread problem and that the norm is that this thing goes on and there is no accountability for it
of all the politicians disappointed when gen colin l powell renounced presidential politics yesterday , few had more at stake than mayor rudolph w giuliani , the most prominent elected official in america to have urged general powell to run last week the mayor radiantly described general powell as a leader who can rise above politics and described him as a powerful weapon for breaking open the closed new york state republican primary controlled by his party rivals at a broader level , he was also the mayor s best hope for ending a virtually unbroken streak of endorsements for losing politicians from mario m cuomo last year to guy v molinari tuesday night , none of the politicians for whom the mayor has campaigned seriously have actually won a race call it bad luck , call it miscalculation , but after two years and five failed endorsements , mr giuliani has yet to support a winner to reinstate himself in the party hierarchy as a force to be reckoned with his endorsements are a little like confederate money , said fernando ferrer , the borough president of the bronx and a probable rival in the 1997 mayor s race although actually , confederate money is a collector s item as a republican trying to succeed in a democratic city , mr giuliani has struggled for two years to carve out a political identity apart from the increasingly conservative mainstream of his party he crossed party lines to support mr cuomo , and fought the state party apparatus in backing two county republican leaders in queens and brooklyn though all three attempts failed , he often mentions that his approval rating soared after the cuomo endorsement he s trying to define himself as a moderate independent , which i think is some of what the cuomo and powell things were all about , said lee miringoff , director of the institute for public opinion at marist college he wants to run on the idea that you may disagree with me sometimes but i'm my own man , and i do n't think that hurts him he does occasionally support party regulars , such as mr molinari in his bid to become district attorney in staten island , or councilman charles millard in his race against representative carolyn b maloney but both candidates lost , and mr giuliani even said jokingly tuesday night that perhaps he could better have assisted mr molinari by endorsing his opponent the mayor seemed closer to his element when he discovered a likeminded brand of republican independence in general powell though he never formally endorsed mr powell , the mayor praised his moderation and his support of abortion rights as precisely the proper counterbalance to the new dominance of the republican right i thought it would be good for the republican party and for the country to have him in the race , because i think he could have opened debates on issues that are important , mr giuliani said again yesterday afternoon so i was disappointed that he is n't going to run as a presidential candidate while every other major republican in the state joined the lock step march behind senator bob dole , mr giuliani held out , hoping that mr powell s popularity would force the party to allow him on the ballot i do n't know of any other candidate who could make a breakthrough to bring about a healthy debate among the state republicans , said raymond b harding , a political adviser to the mayor and the leader of the liberal party no one else could have broken it open mr giuliani was stoic about the announcement yesterday , saying he hoped general powell might still consider being a vicepresidential candidate , though general powell later ruled that out but the mayor provided no hint of whom he now would like to see at the top of the ticket by pinning his hopes on general powell , the mayor now finds himself with few options in the presidential race backing mr dole would mean giving in to his political archrival , senator alfonse m d'amato and most of the other party candidates are more conservative than mr dole , the senate majority leader yesterday the mayor offered a rare positive observation about him i think senator dole s career is a career that indicates that he is a person of flexibility and moderation , he said but if the mayor eventually gives into party reality and backs mr dole , some analysts doubt it would do him much good i do n't think rudy can expect good seats at a dole convention , said mr miringoff do n't look for a keynote speech from him
washington , dec 20 just over a week after ending her neutrality and endorsing senator bob dole for president , gov christine todd whitman of new jersey has come out with her first public advice for the republican frontrunner pick colin l powell to run for vice president the governor , who expects to take a leadership position in the dole campaign , made her proposal public in an interview published today in the starledger of newark , in which she cast the dolepowell ticket as a natural outgrowth of mr dole s understanding of american politics bob dole knows the country so well , she said he knows what it will take to win mrs whitman s spokeswoman , becky taylor , said the governor could not be reached to elaborate mr dole acknowledged on sunday that general powell would make a strong running mate , even though he has already rejected the idea of being a candidate for the nation s no 2 job mr dole , the senate majority leader , said in response to a question on nbc s meet the press program that national public opinion polls showed that his standing with the public would rise with general powell on the ticket he would do a lot to broaden the base of our party , mr dole said but today , the dole campaign seemed to emphasize the remoteness of any decision on a vice president , not mr powell s attractiveness as a partner on the ticket nelson warfield , the dole campaign spokesman , said that the senator and mrs whitman had not , to his knowledge , discussed mr powell senator dole has consistently said that it is too early to be talking about the vice presidency , mr warfield added general powell , for his part , spurned any interest in the vicepresidential nomination on nov 8 , when he announced his decision not to run for the presidency yet , when mr dole spoke about his potential running mate on sunday , he seemed to hold out the prospect that a former soldier like general powell could be enticed back into the race when he said he thought that the general would answer the call of duty again if summoned it was not so long ago that mrs whitman was herself frequently mentioned as a potential vicepresidential candidate , despite her insistence that she wished to run for a second term in 1997 mrs whitman has never , in any case , taken herself out of the vicepresidential sweepstakes as flatly as general powell did in november , when he said , i have ruled it out there could be little doubt , however , that in touting general powell as a vicepresidential candidate , mrs whitman was continuing her own campaign to wrench the republican campaign closer to the ideological center , where she and the general both stand like mrs whitman , general powell favors abortion rights , and like the governor , he supports affirmative action mr dole opposes affirmative action , and until recently , he has supported a constitutional ban on abortion governor whitman offered a handful of other republicans as potential vicepresidential possibilities if general powell continued to decline , including gov tommy g thompson of wisconsin , gov john engler of michigan , and gov george v voinovich of ohio all are moderates in mrs whitman s probusiness , taxcutting mold , but none have the charisma of the general could it be that the governor brought up these hardworking but essentially unexciting alternatives to suggest that mr dole has few other choices to benefit his campaign , mr warfield , the dole spokesman , was asked \? i think it was just mrs whitman expressing her point of view about the campaign , mr warfield replied and although senator dole appreciates mrs whitman s point of view , he thinks it is much too early to be talking about the vicepresidential nomination , before the convention or the nomination has even taken place photo gov christine todd whitman of new jersey is suggesting colin lpowell run for vice president \( david scull the new york times \)
it takes ingenuity to make the kennedy center honors more mortifying with each passing year in a jawdropping low during the 1993 show , two honorees , georg solti and stephen sondheim , were serenaded by a band playing what sounded like a tijuana brass rendition of america from west side story in blissful ignorance of the facts that mr solti conducted beethoven and mahler for the chicago symphony orchestra , not show tunes for the boston pops , and that mr sondheim wrote the lyrics of america , not the music but such gaffes seem trifling next to the dim 1994 kennedy center gala seen by official washington early last month and disseminated to the masses on television on wednesday night among the more exciting honorees , at least potentially , was harold prince , a director whose nightmarish visions of dickensian london \( in sweeney todd \) and weimar germany \( in cabaret \) remade the american stage but at the kennedy center he was saluted with tepid snippets of his current broadway hits none of them showing off mr prince s contributions to the productions another honoree , the composer morton gould , might have prompted a delightful performance of interplay , the ballet choreographed to his jazzy music by jerome robbins but no instead a bombastic military band pumped out mr gould s arrangement of civil war melodies he did n't write perhaps the kennedy center honors should just be laughed off as washington s own philistine answer to hollywood s golden globes , and let it go at that but in a country that honors culture so rarely , this annual presentation of lifetime achievement awards is by default a big deal it s the only national event celebrating the performing arts as distinct from show business yet it has fallen so far in esteem even within the arts community that alist performers are more likely to show up on the honors' various committee lists than on stage or even in the audience at the gala when the kennedy center opened , the critic ada louise huxtable described it as a marble sarcophagus in which the art of architecture lies buried architecture is no longer alone not that this year s show was bereft of recognizable faces a viewer may not soon forget the sight of michael york singing along to if i had a hammer during the pete seeger tribute or tom skerritt s dramatic reading of kirk douglas s memoirs but these moments belong to the annals of camp , not culture such was the defection of top talent that a show saluting american artists was reduced to padding the bill with stomp , a british percussion ensemble as the kennedy center show has sunk to the low cbs standard familiar from the tony awards , so the selection of the honorees looks increasingly suspect granted , this country , like any other , has a limited supply of balanchines and grahams and astaires and sinatras to name past recipients but who believes that excellence is now the primary criterion in choosing from the many fine artists who remain to be honored \? the problem is not the inclusion of the pop arts vaudeville , a collage of the high and low , is the essence of american culture only a snob would dispute that cary grant and johnny carson are as deserving as aaron copland and paul taylor but why did john cage and orson welles never make the elect \? why have kirk douglas and perry como been chosen over giants like marlon brando and bob dylan \? the answer ca n't be seniority aretha franklin , honored this year , is 52 more likely , the cultural bureaucrats running the show would rather not risk roiling their patrons with artists most likely to sting those patrons include corporate donors and the washington officials who sit in the 5 , 000 seats the corporations buy though the gala s pontificators often speak of arts education , no one seems to notice that the gala itself is a wasted opportunity to open children s eyes to wonder the way omnibus and leonard bernstein s young people s concerts did during the kennedy era the honors supposedly memorialize camelot aside , president kennedy did n't care much more for culture than today s politicians do but his first lady did in 1994 of all years , could n't someone at the kennedy center honors have thought to emulate those fabled evenings when pablo casals played in the east room , inviting a nation to dream \?
dallas the timing of the oklahoma city bombing , two years to the day after the federal raid on david koresh s followers outside waco , tex , raised the question of a connection and , indeed , there is apparently a link between the two april 19 tragedies but it does not run both ways the raid on the compound at mount carmel has led to a political crusade , albeit one that the survivors have n't joined and do n't even approve of on april 19 , about 200 people gathered for a memorial at mount carmel , which today bears little resemblance to the site of the 51day standoff of 1993 all that s left is a single pile , about 10 feet high , of boards , concrete chunks , rags , twisted bicycles and gocarts about 40 of those attending survived the siege and assault or lost a family member in it most , however , came not only to remember the dead but to celebrate the burgeoning movements for which mount carmel is a battle cry they called themselves constitutionalists or patriots or militiamen some were wearing camouflage and carrying rifles a dozen speakers were scheduled , including clive doyle and david thibodeau , who had come out of the 1993 inferno alive but the key speeches were given by others ramsey clark , the attorney general under president lyndon b johnson , was the bestknown though he s a dyedinthewool liberal in favor of the abolition of all guns , he filed suit against the government last month , alleging that it was responsible for the deaths at mount carmel mr clark arched his back against the rain and cited justice louis d brandeis the right to be let alone is the most comprehensive of all rights and the right most cherished by civilized men the favorite for much of the crowd was an unscheduled speaker , the survivalist james bo gritz , a highly decorated vietnam veteran and a hero to the many militias of the right mr gritz told the crowd that on april 18 , 1993 , while in a las vegas bar , he had laid plans to foil the government s barricades and steal into mount carmel , hoping to negotiate friends , he said , the government has turned from protector into predator , and they are plundering the people and their property the patriots cheered , but the former residents of mount carmel who never called themselves branch davidians were perplexed , and even offended ofelia santoyo , who lost her daughter and five grandchildren in the raid , tugged my sleeve who are those men in uniform \? she whispered i sensed her fear the last time she saw guntoting men in military garb , she was surrendering to federal agents they are member of the texas constitutional militia , i told her the who \? she said i replied , do n't worry , they 're not from the government before the service was concluded , as news of the oklahoma city bombing spread through the crowd , the media were already speculating that the bomb had been planted by david koresh s faithful no charge could have been more unlikely only a dozen ablebodied male followers lived through the siege seven are in prison , three were at the memorial service when the bomb went off and the others were overseas more important , there s a matter of doctrine for theological reasons , none of the survivors can take revenge they believe that the fifth seal from the book of revelation governed the waco events and has not closed yet revelation 6 911 reads and when he had opened the fifth seal , i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god the survivors think that the verse refers to the dead at mount carmel on the subject of revenge , the scripture advises they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were they interpret these words as saying that their own deaths must precede any vengeance yes , sometimes the survivors do shed tears for their loss they did when clive doyle read the names of the dead but they regard the government as lost , not as evil the harsher criticisms that their sympathizers hurl at the federal agencies do n't always sit well with them i had originally said that i did n't want any governmentbashing , complained mr doyle , the chief organizer of the event sheila martin , who lost her husband and four children in the blaze , agreed certain people i speak to in this situation want us to be angrier than we are , she told me it s as if what happened was their problem and not ours after the names of the dead were recited , members of the texas constitutional militia fired a 21gun salute then the survivors placed 82 small white crosses beneath 82 newly planted crape myrtle trees , one for each of those who died when the service was over , the former residents of mount carmel resumed their search for biblical consolation , while the rest of the crowd presumably looked for meaning in the newborn infamy of april 19

little fanfare attends the efforts this week of united states marines helping to evacuate the last united nations forces from somalia two years ago and one beach away , 26 , 000 americans troops waded ashore in a televised spectacular meant to symbolize a new humanitarian vocation for the united states military after the end of the cold war nobody wants to talk about that symbolism now somalia , including the death of 30 americans , has become a cautionary example of a mercy mission gone wrong , cited mainly by those who would keep americans out of future peacekeeping the story of international intervention in somalia is not as negative as conventional wisdom holds yes , with the departure of the last un troops , anarchy and civil war are quickly returning idealistic assumptions , illconceived expansion of the mission and fatal confusions over command and control marred military operations they cost the lives of 100 peacekeepers and several hundred somalis as the focus shifted from delivering food to hunting down gen mohammed farah aidid but this time the fighting has not engulfed the food supply , so it is unlikely the deadly starvation that inspired international action will soon return some 350 , 000 somalis died of hunger before president bush sent the first american troops in december 1992 perhaps 250 , 000 more were saved by the americans and the un forces that followed lessons need to be learned from the many mistakes made by washington and the united nations but the painful somalia experience warrants tempered pride , not shame the appropriate conclusion is to proceed with greater caution in future humanitarian emergencies americans want to help when they see people starving it is a human impulse sometimes soldiers can and should provide the help but the need for soldiers instead of relief workers usually means the humanitarian crisis cannot be solved without subduing military conflict first before political leaders send troops into these situations , they need to analyze the risks , define a mission that can be accomplished at acceptable costs and then honestly explain the decision to the american people and seek congressional approval none of that ground was adequately covered for the somalia operation by the bush administration , which launched it , or the clinton administration , which expanded it american mistakes were compounded by un secretary general boutros ghali , who allowed the un to become embroiled in local clan feuds , compromising its neutrality the worst errors were made by the un security council with the enthusiastic participation of the united states , it hastily converted a food delivery operation into an ambitious and ultimately futile exercise in nationbuilding , coupled with a searchanddestroy war against general aidid blame for the mistakes of somalia can be widely shared but so can credit for the larger good that was done , and now seems all but forgotten
the briefest lives sometimes leave behind the strongest vibrations without mozart or rimbaud or james dean , there is no guarantee that the sustained echo of classical music , symbolist poetry and method acting would still ring so clearly through the decades but a premature death can also bring an automatic note of tragedy to a life , distorting its features and fueling the martyrdom machine we will never know if kurt cobain could have been as gifted a songwriter as bob dylan the grieving of his young fans made it hard to hear the full range and lasting dimensions of his voice the career of david wojnarowicz painter , writer , photographer , film maker and performance artist is another case in point dead three years now of aids at the age of 37 , he was an angry , east village misfit who mined his own troubled life as an abused child , a young street hustler and a gay man with aids for his work especially in his last year , he boldly explored his outcast state , brimming with rage against political or religious power that would brand him a pariah that rage , and the defiant sexual energy that permeates his collages and books , still speaks to audiences because his fearless confessions have n't dated but also because of the timing of his death and the art politics of aids , wojnarowicz \( pronounced vohnahrohvitch \) has never been more respectable or recognized he has become the source for a veritable fountain of projects , a few of which were under way but unfinished at his death there has been a concrted effort on the part of his friends to make sure that his name and work remain visible his reputation among art critics and historians , however , remains up for grabs , although strong positions are being staked out on both sides i think he s a very fine artist , says donald kuspit , author of the cult of the avantgarde artist , but he s been hyped there are too many ideological issues surrounding him that obscure a good view of his work if you die young , there s an assumption that you must be a major artist or , if you die of aids , or from some other illness mental illness in the case of sylvia plath then you must be a major artist these sorts of things shortcircuit artistic evaluation i think he did some very good work , particularly some of his performances and collages , mr kuspit adds but he answers too many needs the search for heroes , for one that do n't necessarily have anything to do with his place in art history speaking for the defense , jonathan fineberg , a professor of art history at the university of illinois in normal , has canonized him in his idiosyncratic onevolume tome art after 1940 , recently published by abrams , the collages of wojnarowicz rate nearly two pages of text and three fullcolor illustrations measured in column inches alone , such visibility in a worldwide survey of art s last 50 years is impressive none of wojnarowicz s higherprofile 80 s colleagues \( keith haring , ross bleckner , david salle , jeff koons , barbara kruger , jeanmichel basquiat , julian schnabel , eric fischl or cindy sherman \) receive so much notation in the book s crowded index a slew of publications by and about him is or soon will be available the fall 1994 issue of aperture was devoted to wojnarowicz , the first time in nearly 30 years that the venerable photography magazine has turned over its pages entirely to the work of a young contemporary figure \( it is doubly surprising because he was not a photographer per se but primarily a mixedmedia artist who used photographs as only one pictorial element in his collages \) wojnarowicz s autobiographical writings , which candidly describe his brutal childhood and teenage years as a destitute male hustler , inspired the film postcards from america , which was shown in the new york film festival last fall his life story is also the basis for seven miles a second , a graphic novel from dc comics vertigo due at christmas , featuring his words with drawings by james romberger grove atlantic has two books by wojnarowicz on its schedule waterfront journals a book of monologues , gritty tales of his sexual sorties on and around the piers of new york city , and a collection of his travelogues from the 70 s and 80 s and gears are turning to produce a fullscale retrospective before the year 2000 born in red bank , nj , in 1954 , wojnarowicz seems to have spent much of his adolescence in agony that his homosexuality and his dysfunctional family did not square with the ideals of the 50 s his parents divorced when he was 2 he and his two sisters lived with their mother until their father , a violent alcoholic as well as a wife and child abuser , kidnapped them when child care proved irksome , they were sent back to their mother in new york sexually precocious , wojnarowicz was 9 when he turned his first trick in central park by 13 he was routinely picking up strangers in the movie theaters around times square encouraged by his mother to draw and paint he earned lunch money by sketching the carnal fantasies of his friends he entered the high school of music and art but dropped out at 16 and became a thief and a prostitute
washington , feb 21 the united states and mexico reached agreement today on a broaderthanexpected rescue plan that will include the use of american funds to keep mexico s private banks from collapsing , while effectively giving washington veto power over much of mexico s economic policy for the next decade the 20 billion aid program , the centerpiece of an international loan package for mexico worth about 50 billion , is intended to restore the confidence of international investors in the mexican economy and gradually pull the country out of its financial crisis the accord was signed this afternoon by treasury secretary robert e rubin and mexico s finance minister , guillermo ortiz but the harsh austerity required to carry out the deal will impose a tremendous immediate burden on the oncebooming mexican economy reflected in a sharp drop of almost 5 percent in the mexican stock market today the new regimen will also be a setback to the hopes of those american companies that had been counting on mexico to continue to grow into a larger and larger market for american exports included in the agreement are stringent financial requirements , including provisions that mexico run a budget surplus this year and clamp down on credit by charging interest rates above the soaring rate of inflation the bank of mexico increased its shortterm lending rate to nearly 50 percent on monday mexican officials said that the provisions would cause considerable pain to the mexican people and acknowledged that the country could be forced into a recession that , in turn , could fuel the country s social unrest , deepen the challenges to the weakened government of president ernesto zedillo , and perhaps greatly increase the flow of illegal immigrants into texas and california but mr ortiz and his aides said that all the alternatives to such austerity were far worse , risking greater political and financial chaos and the possibility of even larger flows of illegal aliens obviously this is not easy , a senior mexican official told reporters today the conditions mexico is facing are very difficult but there is no other way out at the white house today , president clinton praised mexico s leaders for taking some very courageous steps and said that the deal was not a bailout we have very good collateral on this deal , he said , a reference to american requirements that all of mexico s export earnings on oil be available to back the loans so we have done the right thing by the american taxpayers and the american people as well while most of the details of the agreement have been described by treasury officials during the last few weeks , today s accord also included new language that specifically permits mexico s central bank to use american funds to support mexico s banking system and keep its depositors including many wealthy americans from losing billions of pesos in an interview this evening , mr rubin said that the new provision was not intended to be a bailout of the banks and their owners but rather an effort to keep the underpinnings of the mexican economy from crumbling as time went on and the situation deteriorated in recent weeks , mr rubin said , the conditions of the banks became worse and there has been more focus on the banks among all those concerned while congress does not have any direct role in the rescue package , american officials are clearly worried that this provision could generate opposition to the deal the administration s plan to use 20 billion in treasury funds to aid mexico does not require legislative approval it was developed only after it became clear that a 40 billion americanonly package would be tied up in congress for months , and might be doomed to defeat the ultimate success of this program depends on mexico , mr rubin said at the signing ceremony today , appropriately held in the cash room of the treasury , where clerks once disbursed the government s funds from a roomsized vault the agreement includes none of the political concessions from mexico including policing of the mexican side of the border to prevent illegal crossings that many in congress demanded last month , before president clinton decided to bypass congress but in a statement this afternoon , secretary of state warren christopher said that there was already evidence that mexico was acting to make bridges and border crossings more secure and would step up pressure on drug cartels with the signing of this agreement , we are bringing this crisis to a close , mr christopher said , showing considerably more optimism than many others in the administration that the problems were over the tougher financial conditions appeared intended to allay criticism that the administration was cutting a deal for mexico

jersey city the no 1 spot in the jersey city museum is the wall facing visitors as they enter the largest gallery in the present exhibition , a drawing invitational organized by the museum s curator , alejandro anreus , the space is occupied by a grid of flashing black and white images that measures 9 1 2 feet by 12 1 2 feet robert birmelin is the artist and , notwithstanding a long record of shows in manhattan as well as new jersey , it is as if he had been waiting for the opportunity to the extent that each image portrays a jittery moment on the streets of new york city figures jostling , a face blurred by the gesture of an arm , hands that clutch each other or , as in the picture reproduced , money mr birmelin s work has changed little over the last decade but by combining into a mural incidents that previously had whole canvases to themselves , the painter achieves a summation of city life in addition , he reveals a gift for monumental composition with a basically cubist structure that seamlessness prevails in the show is partly because most of the 11 artists are figural with expressionistic tendencies but mostly it is a matter of their extrapolating from nature rather than documenting it though none aspired to photographic realism , kate dodd and jim goss , however , stand out from the crowd by reason of their precision using a thick charcoal line that looks more stitched than drawn and is usually echoed by parallel lines , ms dodd defines shapes resembling a peacock , a tree , even a pile of unraveled knitting sometimes , the impression is of a design awaiting embroidery at other times there is a suggestion of a structure vibrating either way , the result is perfectly balanced on the page and pleasing to the eye despite their pop connotations , mr goss s charcoalandgouache symbols are serious and quite mysterious they included large x s patterned with daisies , the word men spelled backward and forward and other conundrums whether they have ulterior motives or not , janet taylor pickett s lush pastelandchalk drawings nests containing eggs , one monitored by a bluebird , come across as celebrations of nature the artist is also represented by an assemblage of twigs from which dangles the back of an old wooden chair the oilandpastel automatism of stuart shedletsky evokes foliage but seems inspired as much by the process of growth as by its outcome brush lines dart across the paper , turn corners , stop to enclose patches of bright color and then move on equally spontaneous are the drawings of christine hiebert and cicely cottingham like mr shedletsky , ms hiebert seems to move to a beat , delivering her lines and smudges , then erasing and replacing them until she achieves a shadowy vista some elements in ms cotting ham s triptychs are lightly sketched , others rubbed , scored and scribbled with a vengeance hints of interior space are confirmed by furniture , awindow giving on to landscape and the occasional silhouette of a nude there is a new uneasiness in this artist s work jonathan weinberg s subjects are billboardsize signs and outdoor clocks , enclosing them in a chiaroscuro of dense graphite hatching , which invests the subject matter with an unlikely grandeur at the other end of the technical spectrum are the figures etched black or sepia by fred yee on roughly 3inchby2inch rectangles of clay , which are pieced together in irregular grids the result is a tantalizing checkerboard of torsos , limbs , organs , something that could be a flea enlarged and miscellaneous objects that leaves the show s heavyweights , miriam beerman and james andrew brown , whose expressionism , painted and drawn on large sheets of paper , reveals unexpected affinities ms beerman s pigment , however , is more impacted than mr brown s and more likely to include collage specifically details like cutouts of hands drawn in magic marker one of her most spectacular works features a nude done on tracing paper that is taped over another painted surface the grotesqueness of the figure is transformed by touches of metalic paint among the ordinary colors and by the sheen of the tracing paper where ms beerman , whose art is sometimes resembles george mcneil s , agonizes , mr brown all but explodes with rage and scorn all his images are dramatic , but none more so than that of a humanoid walking like a dog the body is washed in brown , the face , in vivid pink , has eyes and large moist lips clipped from color photographs above is a solid red object that whould suggest a hand grenade where it not flying like a balloon this meaty show continues through may 20 the museum is on the top floor of the jersey city public library , at 472 jersey avenue it is open from 10 30 am to 5 pm tuesday through saturday and from 10 30 am to 8 pm wednesday photo detail from men and women series , by robert birmelin , at the jersey city museum \( jersey city museum \)
cairo , june 5 egyptian belly dancers , condemned by islamic militants as licentious and scorned by the general public as disreputable , face a new onslaught from russian rivals , who have invaded the nightclubs that line the road to the pyramids and crowd the banks of the nile the russian dancers began to appear in the clubs shortly after the breakup of the soviet union now , about 100 professional russian belly dancers are working in cairo , about a third of all those registered with the moral police , who oversee the shows to make sure they do not become too bawdy egyptian belly dancers , famous for their skill throughout the arab world , say they are increasingly having trouble finding work before the collapse of the soviet union we used to get the odd foreigner here who tried to belly dance , said nagwa fouad , one of egypt s bestknown belly dancers but they never stayed now these russians are everywhere then she added a few , who actually studied dance , have good technique , but none of them dance with real feeling most come for the money and work in the lowerclass clubs , where customers go not for the quality of the dancing , but the quality of the bodies russian dancers are edging out the egyptians , in part , because they accept lower pay , often half of the fee egyptians charge for a night s work they are also allowed to gyrate in a more suggestive manner and wear more revealing costumes than the egyptians as foreigners they are not bound by the restrictions imposed by the moral police , who require egyptian belly dancers to wear mesh coverings over their bellies many egyptians say the russian dancers , by taking jobs from egyptians , are damaging egypt s ancient tradition of belly dancing , usually passed down from mother to daughter the walls of many pharaonic tombs show scantily clad dancing girls whirling to the songs played by drummers and musicians egypt has many belly dancers one for each 5 , 000 residents by some estimates but most of them are not professionals and perform only at weddings or small parties one professional egyptian belly dancer , her eyes ringed with black swaths of mascara , her fingers covered with gold rings and her lips smothered in dull , maroon lipstick , sat smoking a cigarette shortly before heading into a ballroom to perform at a wedding the dancer , who refused to give her real name , said she had an average of five shows an evening before the arrival of the russians she now has one or two they do things we egyptian dancers would never do , like perform in a bikini , she said they twist and move in vulgar ways and call it belly dancing , degrading our art and the owners of the clubs like them because they can introduce them to the customers the russians pour just as much invective on the egyptians yelena ramazonova , a 27yearold dancer from siberia and former ballerina , sat with her manager in the coffee shop of the shehrazad hotel at 4 a m on a recent day , after her performance in the king s night club miss ramazonova , who dances under the name lena , is one of the best russian belly dancers in cairo she performs each night with the egyptian singer kamal alshahawi and his 13piece band the egyptian belly dancers are heavier , and at first i tried to gain weight , she said but a dancer has to be lithe and agile the egyptians are often jealous of us because we have studied dance we are really dancers mr shahawi added that top egyptian belly dancers , who can earn up to 5 , 000 for a performance , often expect to overshadow both the band and the singer the egyptian stars will get up on stage and signal for me to be quiet so they can shake to the drums and the noise , he said but this never happens with lena ali youssef , one of the managers of the lotus nightclub , just off pyramids road , said many managers also liked the russians because they come on time and are not too demanding the egyptian belly dancers cause us problems , he said when the saudis throw money at the egyptians they do n't want to leave the stage we have to drag them off the majority of the russians sign sixmonth contracts with agencies in moscow and pick up belly dancing once they come to egypt the russian women interviewed said they had trouble finding employment in russia and hoped to make money in the cairo clubs before returning home katya balashova , a 21yearold dancer , arrived last year and performed in as many as five clubs every evening , putting on a 45minute show in each she recently left her troupe to live with her boyfriend the first night they just pushed us out on stage and i had to look around to see what everyone else was doing , she said it was hard to take the way the men stared at us we were made to dance on top of the tables and make unethical movements the men threw money at us , or tucked it into our brassieres many of the russian dancers said they were under pressure to work as prostitutes the arrival of russians has been especially hard on egyptian belly dancers who are just starting out the young belly dancers , who want to be professionals , used to get a start in these lowerclass clubs , said the belly dancer suzy , who would not give her real name , as she sat backstage in the nefertiti night club now they ca n't because of the russians this is making it hard to build a new generation of good belly dancers photo yelena ramazonova , 27 , from siberia , is one of about 100 russian belly dancers working in cairo many of the egyptian dancers worry that their art , handed from mother to daughter , is being demeaned \( thomas hartwell saba , for the new york times \)

one evening last december , i found myself sitting on the floor of the west side montessori school gymnasium with 50 other mothers and fathers , gathering survival tips for one of the most notorious passages of manhattan parenthood we were deep into the annual nurseryschool hunting season \( september through march \) the school s director was offering advice on getting through the preschool admissions process with our selfrespect intact you are the consumers , she insisted , as we sat there like 3yearolds , twitching and squirming and rearranging our legs i know you probably do n't feel like it , but you are in charge of making the match yes , indeed in charge was not exactly what we were feeling nor is consumer the first word that comes to mind when one contemplates the role of parent in the arcane process of landing a child in certain manhattan nursery schools the very mention of the exercise evokes exaggerated shudders people roll their eyes in hyperbolic disgust and launch into the kind of horror stories normally inspired by terms like coop board , jury duty and dmv in the popular imagination , the preschool sweepstakes has come to embody almost everything uptight and irritating about manhattan snobbery , competition , money , pathological ambition , misplaced notions of status for here you can find hundreds of families scrambling for scarce spots in schools where their children may spend no more than 15 hours a week but that charge as much as 9 , 600 , a figure that will go up the next year the standard advice is to apply to a halfdozen schools but finding those schools may require investigating 8 or 10 that takes time and money some schools want an application fee of as much as 50 before you set foot in the door and in the end , it is the schools that do the bulk of the choosing their decisions arrive in the mail on the same fateful march day the drill is sickeningly familiar fat envelope , good skinny envelope , bad the entire business is all the more painful because children are involved they are being judged or are being judged through their parents parents stumble through , wondering , if we fall short , will our child pay the price \? it s the most humiliating part of living in manhattan , a friend assured me matteroffactly as i embarked upon the search last fall i 'd been in new york long enough to know that she was saying a lot now that it s over , i have learned a few things some would have been nice to know in advance maybe then i would have felt a little more like a smart shopper \( in charge \? dream on \) i have learned that nursery schools differ in distinct ways they come in all shapes , sizes and philosophical stripes some left me dazzled , some depressed the longer i looked , the clearer the differences became i believe it can matter where a child goes not all schools are equally suited to all children maybe some children flourish anywhere , but others may be happier and more stimulated in one environment than in another but i 've also learned it may be impossible to make wellinformed decisions reliable , unbiased information is scarce you get only a glimpse of most schools you rarely meet the person who would teach your child and of course , the decision will probably not be yours have you chosen a school \? people kept asking me but i was n't the chooser , i kept thinking i was just vying to become one of the chosen i did find the process less appalling than people had said it seemed more rational , less of a freeforall the hysteria seemed to emanate less from school administrators than from parents plotting to win them over i also know that the nurseryschool frenzy is not exclusive to new york in los angeles , some people sign their children up at birth here , there are many good schools to consider some cities have two or three but in the end , i am left feeling that the outcomes are unfathomable after six months of applications , interviews and comparing notes , i remain mystified about how new york city preschools really decide whom they 're going to admit administrators say they look for a balance of sexes , ages , skills and backgrounds in short , a sympathetic mix of pupils and families but how do they measure skills and compatibility with so little exposure to parent or child \? skeptics say the schools go by the parents where they went to college , whom they know , what they do , how much they make but few of the many schools that i looked at ever tried to explore most of those things when it was over , i heard of children being rejected by schools that their parents had considered fallbacks , welcomed by ones assumed impossible to get into , turned down where their families had pull and accepted where they had none so why go through it \? a toe in the water the initial briefing in my case , my daughter will soon turn 3 she seemed , to my husband and me , to be ready to graduate from her current routine classes and play dates with nanny in tow to something more challenging like , say , school
los angeles , nov 18 a sergeant with the los angeles county sheriff s department has formed a group whose goals are to protect the rights of white male lawenforcement officers , and is defending his right to do so why ca n't you condone this organization when you condone the black peace officers' association , the women s peace officers' association and the asian peace officers' association \? the organizer , sgt ed kirste , told reporters on friday sergeant kirste , who has been with the sheriff s department for 26 years , spoke to the reporters in a brief conversation after leaving work earlier , when reached at work by telephone , he declined to discuss details of the group s founding or disclose how many officers were members , saying he had been directly prohibited from doing so while on duty but he did confirm the authenticity of a written statement sent to news organizations announcing the creation of his group , the association of white male peace officers in a separate statement , the sheriff s department said that it did not sanction the group or understand the reason for its formation but that the department could not legally prevent officers from joining carol watson , a board member of the community group police watch , which logs complaints against police officers and sheriff s deputies , said she had never heard of sergeant kirste or his association but , she said , forming such a group sends a wrong message , particularly at a time when los angeles is still dealing with the effects of racist and sexist remarks made to an interviewer by detective mark fuhrman of the los angeles police department and recently disclosed in connection with the o j simpson trial the police department is investigating the possibility of misconduct discussed in those audiotaped remarks by mr fuhrman , who has since retired , and the justice department is considering federal charges against him sergeant kirste s statement to news organizations described his association as a registered nonprofit corporation whose members are distinctly averse to the proposal that , as a class , we be punished or penalized for any real or purported transgressions of our forbears no member of this organization ever bought , owned , sold or traded a slave , the statement said none of us worked at treblinka or manzanar a camp in the california desert where japaneseamericans were detained during world war ii nor sailed under pizarro , nor rode to wounded knee we just come to work every day and strive to do what is asked of us , seeking only to be recognized and rewarded according to our accomplishments the statement said the group had been founded on the principle that no person in the lawenforcement profession be discriminated against , nor favored for , any hiring , promotion or assignment on the basis of race , creed , color , gender , ethnicity , sexual orientation or national origin

new york s buses are chronically unreliable because of an aging fleet that has not been replaced fast enough and because transit officials repeatedly glossed over serious design flaws and failed to enforce maintenance standards , according to a report released yesterday the report , issued by henry p flinter , inspector general of the metropolitan transportation authority , focuses on the oldest buses in the system , built from 1981 to 1983 , and accuses the transit authority of failing for years to address problems with those buses even after structural defects were identified , unsafe older vehicles were kept in service because inspection standards were too vague or were not enforced , the report said we also found a disturbing pattern of incompetent management at the most senior levels of the department of buses contributed to the ineffective inspection of older buses charles monheim , senior vice president for buses at the transit authority , said he did not disagree with the findings , though he added that it may overdramatize the condition of the buses mr monheim , who joined the bus department in mid1993 , said that many of the problems the investigation found had been or are being corrected mr flinter agreed the report was released a day after the transit authority , an arm of the mta , announced plans to overhaul hundreds of its oldest buses to keep them in service for several more years in an interview yesterday , mr flinter applauded the rebuilding effort , but he said that it should have started three to four years ago because older buses break down more often , the transit authority has a policy of using buses for no more than 12 years unless they are rebuilt but 37 percent of the 3 , 600bus fleet is past that age , and the figure will be well over 40 percent by the end of this year the inspector general s report is the latest indication of how far the city s bus fleet has deteriorated in the last decade , a time when billions of dollars were spent to fix the subway system last december , transit officials completed a threemonth study that found that fewer than half of the buses ran on time mr monheim s predecessor , velva edwards , resigned under pressure in addition , the inspector general found underlying problems that had not been previously publicized the oldest buses operated by the transit authority are the nearly 1 , 500 coaches built by the general motors corporation from 1981 to 1983 over their first decade of operation , many developed corrosion problems in the undercarriages , which can lead to a host of mechanical failures , and the inspector general s office found that the problem was made worse by poor maintenance corrosion was found to be a chronic problem in the engine bulkhead , the steel wall separating the engine from the passenger compartment the report attributed three potentially disastrous breakdowns to corroded bulkheads , including the crash of a bus in february 1994 after its brakes failed in another instance , a corroded bulkhead caused an engine to fall off its mountings in another corrosionrelated accident , this one involving a crack in a bus s rear axle , four people were injured in the mid1980 s , general motors anticipated the corrosion problem and offered to give the transit authority free replacement bulkheads made of stainless steel , but transit officials declined the offer , choosing instead to replace them only as problems arose a 1991 inspection found serious bulkhead corrosion in 407 buses , yet three years later , the bulkheads had still not been replaced on 191 of them the department s former chief maintenance officer ignored reports of bus corrosion and kept defective vehicles in service in violation of department safety policies , the report says that official , jack zammardo , retired in 1992 , and transit officials said they did not know where he could be reached mr monheim said he did not know why the authority turned down general motors' offer a decade ago , but he said the agency did not intend to replace all of the old bulkheads , which are still in more than 40 percent of the older buses it takes the bus out of commission and it diverts labor from something else , he said the problem , he said , was not so much the bulkheads , but lackadaisical maintenance there are no buses in service with bulkheads that are corroded , he said we 've established standards for inspection of buses , and all the older buses have been inspected to that standard those buses that had structural problems have been repaired the report also criticized the mta for failing to buy any buses in 1991 or 1992 mr monheim said officials believed at the time that the buses could be used several years past the 12year standard , an assessment that transit officials now admit was hopelessly optimistic gene russianoff , staff attorney for the straphangers campaign , a riders' advocacy group , said , the bus operation has been the longneglected orphan of the transit authority an assertion that many transit officials agree was true , until recently transit officials say that ideally they would buy about 300 new buses a year and retire 300 old ones but in practice it has not worked out that way because of the fiscal crisis , no new buses were bought in the late 1970 s but as the city s financial situation eased , more than 2 , 000 were bought in the early 80 s , almost 1 , 500 of which remain in operation in 1984 , the transit authority scrapped 850 relatively new but badly flawed buses made by the grumman corporation , and partly filled the gap by overhauling 350 older buses , adding 8 to 10 years to their lives in 1991 , all of the buses were less than 12 years old but between the new buses bought in the early 80 s and those rebuilt in the mid80 s , more than half the transit authority s buses will have reached retirement age by the end of this year another result of the grumman problems was that the transit authority set higher standards for its buses , prompting most large makers to stop trying to get new york s bus business only two manufacturers , bus industries of america and transportation manufacturing corporation , met the new standards , but tmc s buses had persistent defects , and bia has had serious financial problems as a result , none of the 719 buses ordered in 1993 and 1994

on its surface , the proposal seems barely capable of causing a ripple administrators of the community school district on the upper west side of manhattan hope next fall to move a kindergarten class for gifted and talented students from an elementary school on west 84th street to another one five blocks away to the district superintendent , james mazza , the rationale is simple public school 9 , where the gifted program is now housed , is not accessible to the handicapped public school 166 , where all five grades of the gifted program would eventually move , will be soon but parents at ps 9 , one of several dozen magnet schools credited with keeping middleclass families from abandoning the public schools , are deeply suspicious that mr mazza is trying to improve another school at their school s expense thanks to its magnet program , whose special courses draw students from around the city , ps 9 is now considered one of the city s best elementary schools a decade ago , it was in much the same shape as ps 166 , which is ranked in the lower half of the city s elementary schools several hundred ps 9 parents voiced their anger wednesday night at a candlelight protest and public hearing and the five teachers who work with the gifted program signed a petition saying they would refuse to move , including maria shapiro , the kindergarten teacher whose resistance to the plan has made her the focal point of the dispute that a quartermile move would provoke such vocal opposition underscores how attached parents and teachers can become to a good public school , especially one for which parents raise nearly 50 , 000 a year in private donations the dispute also highlights how difficult it can be for administrators to make even the smallest of changes , particularly when questions of race and access are involved ps 9 s student body is more than onethird white ps 166 s has a much larger proportion of black and hispanic students nobody ever likes change , said michael weinberg , the acting principal at ps 166 , a centuryold gothicstyle building on 89th street between amsterdam and columbus avenues i think that s what s really happening you could move them to any building and they would resist the problem is moving , not where they are going many of the parents and teachers at ps 9 contend that mr mazza is being less than honest in explaining his motivation , and that an effort to improve test scores at the weaker school is as much a factor as the issue of handicapped access ps 9 , helped in part by the gifted program , was ranked 49th in reading last spring out of 633 elementary schools citywide ps 166 , however , was ranked 362d , a number sure to go up if nearly 150 gifted students , most testing above the 90th percentile in intelligence , join the pool at the same time , parents predict , ps 9 s scores would likely go down parents at ps 9 see the move as potentially destroying an excellent school in a city where so many things do n't work , why tear up a school that is working \? said rik kirkland , an assistant managing editor at fortune magazine whose 5yearold daughter , allegra , is in the gifted program but several teachers and parents at ps 166 said it was the parents at ps 9 who were being disingenuous , and that their resistance to moving was rooted in racism ps 9 , again bolstered by the gifted program , to which students from all over the city apply , is 36 percent white , nearly double the systemwide average ps 166 where many students are bused in from an overcrowded district at the northern tip of manhattan is only 4 percent white they have the uninformed presumption that just because it s a predominantly africanamerican school , these africanamerican children are lesser or inferior as compared to their own , said maria chale , a kindergarten teacher at ps 166 , who is black it s not true these children are very smart as a compromise , some ps 9 parents are urging mr mazza to create a new gifted program at ps 166 and leave ps 9 s in place but mr mazza said that the district , which has three other such elementaryschool programs , cannot support a fifth and he bristled at the suggestion that he was being anything but forthcoming in justifying the move of the four elementary schools in his district with programs for gifted students , none is housed in a building accessible to children in wheelchairs or on crutches therefore , the district violates the federal americans with disabilities act and the terms of the settlement of a classaction suit brought by a parent against the board , said jay hecht , a board official mr mazza said that since ps 166 would become , in september , the first in the district to receive an elevator and ramps , it was a logical destination for the gifted program , in which no handicapped student is enrolled and the board of education backs him up i certainly support him , mr hecht said i believe he is trying to do the right thing , the morally correct thing , and comply with federal obligations ps 9 , which has about 660 students , actually comprises four programs under a single roof a schooladministered accelerated program for students who score above the 97th percentile on standardized intelligence tests the lesserpaced , but still enriched , gifted program , which is run by the district a standard elementary program , and a specialeducation program in the accelerated program , which is known as anderson and has about 280 children , a second grader may do fifthgrade work in the gifted program , which has 136 students , a secondgrade class might engage in an intensive special project like creating a replica of the fulton fish market to learn more about the city but still follow the curriculum at its grade level under mr mazza s plan , which still must be approved by the district board , the anderson program would remain at ps 9 but the gifted program would be dismantled , a grade each year , to allow all students currently participating to graduate from ps 9 since students at ps 9 routinely move among the different programs , depending on how well they succeed , stephanie lebowitz , the school art teacher , lamented the prospect of losing a very vital option ms shapiro , who has taught gifted kindergartners at the school for five years , said she had decided to remain at ps 9 next year and take on a standard elementary school class rather than follow the program elsewhere i feel safe here , she said , i feel happy referring to the program s ethnic composition 34 percent white , 38 percent black , 19 percent hispanic and 9 percent asian she added , i love the diversity ms chale , the kindergarten teacher at ps 166 , said she empathized with those teachers and parents reluctant to make a change , but hoped they would keep their minds open they 're very welcome here , she said come and take a look at the classrooms sit in that s very important before they make a judgment photos several hundred parents and students held a candlelight vigilat public school 9 on wednesday to protest a proposal to move its program for gifted and talented students to ps 166 , five blocks away maria shapiro , one of five teachers in ps 9 s gifted program who signed a petition opposing the move , reading to her kindergarten class \( photographs by michelle v agins the new york times \)
to the editor your jan 19 news article on the national transportation safety board s report on the edison , nj , natural gas pipeline blast last march tells only part of the story about sloppy and dangerous regulation of 17 million miles of natural gas and oil pipelines the public should feel no confidence that the recommended measures will be adopted or their safety will be protected consider the safety board s excellent recommendations are not binding the industry , the federal office of pipeline safety and state regulators are free to ignore them , as they have in the past , repeatedly rejecting automatic and remotecontrolled shutoff valves as too expensive all have ignored the 1988 national research council report pipelines and public safety , which recommended changes in building permit procedures , landuse restrictions near pipelines , and better public notification and emergency preparedness plans incredibly , many state and local governments have no uptodate maps of pipeline routes the pipeline safety office in 1990 rejected proposals to improve safety by requiring oil pipeline companies to furnish maps of pipelines to state and local governments , to improve route markings and notify adjacent property owners the office stated that to implement the proposals would alarm people while natural gas pipeline regulation is lax , regulation of oil pipelines is virtually nonexistent only 10 states have any programs at all \( new jersey and new york have none \) since 1970 oil pipelines have spilled more than 280 million gallons in the united states with the republicans bent on even less regulation , the public can expect only more pipeline accidents only the states can seize the initiative , if the public demands improved pipeline safetyrobert b rackleff tallahassee , fla , jan 19 , 1995 the writer , a former speechwriter for president carter , is a member of a citizens group opposing pipeline construction in northern florida
to the editor it is a pity that albert camus s rehabilitation from the effects of an old political correctness should be pursued in complicity with a new one in his review of the first man \( aug 27 \) , victor brombert duly appeals to current shibboleths camus opposed extremism and violence on both sides and favored a multicultural algeria but it must be said that this multicultural vision presupposed french rule over algeria i believe in justice , camus said , but i shall defend my mother above justice this meant seeking solutions well short of majority rule and selfdetermination for algerian muslims , including bizarre schemes evocative of later afrikaner designs to retain power in south africa certainly we must appreciate why this algerian frenchman who truly sympathized with algerian muslims stopped short of accepting their right to selfdetermination the fact remains that he had effective citizenship in two countries , algeria and france , while they had none at all today there is little point in blaming camus for not envisioning a form of majority rule that would have genuinely protected the cultural and political rights of minorities , but even less in celebrating a multiculturalism based on minority rule rather than providing new ammunition for fighting such old battles , the longdelayed publication of camus s unfinished last novel should provoke a rethinking of the intellectual climate of the cold war rather than simply turning the tables , we might ask why various people acted as they did , noting both their strengths and their weaknesses ronald aronson detroit
frenetic and unsympathetic as ever , the united states open got under way yesterday in typically dramatic fashion shuzo matsuoka of japan wound up screaming in agony after cramping and collapsing on the hot , hard grandstand court comfort has never been an open staple , but only matsuoka , whose breakdown mandated his being defaulted from his match with petr korda , was targeted for unduly harsh treatment with the exception of the 10thseeded wayne ferreira , who confessed to having no excuse for his feeble performance in a 75 , 76 \( 75 \) , 61 loss to 109thranked jerome golmard of dijon ,

locked in a 67 \( 47 \) , 76 \( 74 \) , 76 \( 108 \) , 55 struggle with the erratic korda , a former top 10 player who has never had a respectable result at the open , when the cramps that began in his left thigh at the start of the fourth set finally crippled him altogether matsuoka and korda appeared destined for a fourth consecutive tie breaker when the japanese player , up two sets and a break , fell with a thud and a yelp to the hardcourt after serving the opening point of the 11th game that game , and the match , was eventually awarded to korda after matsuoka , looking more like a casualty of the boxing ring than the tennis court , was defaulted for failing to get up and get on with match if i bent my leg , i knew the cramp was coming , and then every time i hit the ball it came , and it was scary , but this is the us open , and i'm winning , and i have to keep going , said the 27year old matsuoka , who has spent the last few years finetuning his mental toughness only to be nagged this year by chronic cramping due to what korda later called a rather ruthless rule in the tennis playbook , matsuoka initially had to be left untouched as he screamed in pain since cramping is considered as a loss of conditioning and not an actual injury , the player would have been instantly defaulted if a trainer , or his alarmed opponent , had touched him as the fans booed and korda paced back and forth on his side of the court , matsuoka lay immobile for two minutes , transforming the grandstand into a tableau of suffering i knew i was not going to be able to play anymore , said

moscow , sept 22 as annoying as the american government may find the process , russia is learning that whining , too , has its uses after harsh attacks on nato and the united states from president boris n yeltsin and the russian parliament for bombing the bosnian serbs against russian advice , washington and its allies have shown unexpected willingness to manipulate a 1990 treaty on limiting conventional weapons in europe to meet moscow s objections nato has also tried to reassure russia , in the outline of a proposed eastern expansion of nato adopted on wednesday , that expansion to formerly communist countries of europe will be slow and gradual , diplomats said in a strategic concession , nato says no foreign troops or nuclear weapons will be stationed on the territory of new members in peacetime , according to diplomats who have seen the document , which will not be released until next week western diplomats deny that there is any direct connection between their new flexibility and recent russian complaints but they stress that washington does not want the whole relationship to fall down or collapse over the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , which the russian military has been loudly threatening to ignore when new limits come into force on nov 17 nor , given the potential alternatives , does washington want to undermine mr yeltsin and his government when russia s parliamentary elections are less than three months away the shift on the treaty is significant in may , at a summit meeting in moscow , president clinton explicitly said that while he was sympathetic toward russia s concerns , moscow should come into compliance with the treaty first , and then use the existing appeal procedure to seek changes to the terms now the idea is to agree on changes beforehand but it is clear , at least to russian officials , that washington did not want another noisy fight with moscow as nato was about to make public its plan for adding members if russia were to flout the conventional forces treaty , it would open a whole set of arguments in washington with a coldwar flavor about whether moscow can be trusted , whether american aid should be curtailed or cut off and whether nato should be expanded more quickly because warsaw , supported by many polishamerican voters , will claim to feel even more threatened by russia russian officials , too , want to deny any connection or tradeoff involving a compromise on the conventional forces treaty and the nato expansion , which is regarded as anathema by the yeltsin administration the eternally embattled russian foreign minister , andrei v kozyrev , who was recently chastised by mr yeltsin , said on thursday , we oppose nato expansion , and there can be no horsetrading on this question originally negotiated when the soviet union existed , the conventional forces treaty sets limits on military equipment like tanks and artillery in the regions bordering europe russia says the weapons limits are too strict in light of its new borders and circumstances , particularly with unrest in chechnya and throughout the caucasus the point is not to change the treaty , but to look for wiggle room , a senior western diplomat said , apparently suggesting redrawing the maps to allow russia to deploy more arms on its flanks north of st petersburg and in the caucasus the treaty proposals were formally made today in vienna but 30 countries have signed the treaty , not merely the nato 16 , and the americansuggested compromise has left turkey and ukraine particularly upset , diplomats say , and norway is none too happy either russian officials say they are pleased with the new offer from the west , especially because it may save them from the consequences of breaking an international treaty the proposals signal that the west now has come to realize the necessity of taking into consideration russia s security interests , said a foreign ministry spokesman , mikhail demurin but we would like to hope that they are not the final option given that only two weeks ago , mr yeltsin was fulminating about war in europe because russia s security interests were allegedly being ignored by an americandominated nato , the calmer tone will be welcome in washington last week , the deputy secretary of state , strobe talbott , came to moscow to try to take the new heat out of the relationship but mr talbott s visit was viewed as tardy by the russians with mr yeltsin and his entourage on vacation in sochi , mr talbott made do with mr kozyrev western diplomats said efforts had been made to talk to those closer to mr yeltsin , like his bodyguard and adviser , aleksandr korzhakov , and his national security council secretary , oleg i lobov , but a lot of those people thought it more politic to be in sochi , one said but he stressed that the american embassy had been trying to talk to those not as receptive to our message as kozyrev is the americans see their central task as managing russian weakness and hurt pride on nato expansion , a senior diplomat said , the trick is that you need to show motion , but not so much as to push the russians into doing something they should n't do moscow s isolation on bosnia and its demand to be consulted is part of the country s main question , the diplomat continued , which is will they be a core player in europe at a time , quite frankly , when they do n't have a lot to bring to the table \? but deep into the domestic election cycle of both countries , there is more trouble ahead the russians are insisting on going ahead with the sale to iran of lightwater nuclear reactors , against all american entreaties there is talk of a new or renovated russian nuclear reactor for cuba , which also infuriates congress , officials say they say the threat from republicans to cut off american development aid 260 million requested for the 1996 fiscal year is real , even though it will have no obvious impact on russian policy most of the aid is intended for ordinary russians in the provinces , in any case so before mr yeltsin and mr clinton meet in america in october , the americans have tried to emphasize to the russians that they 'd be better off screaming less and working with people more , a diplomat said on the evidence of the last two weeks , however , the russians may not be convinced
many high school coaches endure complaints from players and their parents , from students and fans , and from sports commentators but until recently , it is believed , matters did not wind up in court that is , not until john ceneri , the former girls varsity basketball coach at hamden high school , was hit with a lawsuit alleging that he caused severe emotional distress to three players in what is believed to have been an unprecedented action , the three players recently were awarded 13 , 500 in an outofcourt settlement what this means is that if you cut a kid from now on , they have a way of getting back at you , said jim bombaci , a girls basketball coach at daniel hand high school in madison the case , in superior court in new haven , never went to trial a lawyer for the insurance company that represents the board of education in hamden agreed to the settlement mr ceneri , a 37yearold gym teacher at the hamden middle school , says he is unhappy with the settlement , and that he feels it reflects unfavorably on him as a coach and many coaches in the state believe that the settlement , along with the lawsuit itself , sets a dangerous precedent it s kind of scary , said michael savage , the executive director of the connecticut interscholastic athletic conference , the governing body for high school sports in the state it could encourage other situations of a similar nature in the future mr savage , like mr ceneri , said he would prefer to have seen the case settled in a trial what bothers me is that it was settled for monetary reasons and not adjudicated i would have liked to have seen the matter resolved once and for all a similar suit involving players and coaches , either in connecticut or elsewhere could not be recalled it s unique , said mr savage it s got to be very upsetting to coaches everywhere jim eagen , who has been coaching girls basketball teams in the state for 15 years , agreed that groan you heard the day after the settlement was from coaches all over connecticut , said mr eagen , who now works at sacred heart academy in hamden from now on , coaches are going to realize that every time they cut a kid they may be facing a lawsuit from a coach s point of view , this lawsuit and the settlement were terrible the suit was filed in august of 1992 mr ceneri had cut the three players during the previous season but was then ordered by hamden school officials to reinstate them , which he did but after he did , mr ceneri used the players sparingly , prompting two of them melissa crockett and jennifer brenner , both seniors to quit late in the season both ms crockett and ms brenner had played on the varsity during the previous season , when ms crockett led the team in scoring for the second straight year the third player , marissa rondini , a sophomore , was a starter on the junior varsity during the 199091 season and had also played briefly with the varsity they did not fit into the chemistry of the team , mr ceneri said and melissa and jen had quit the team late in the previous season i certainly felt that , as a coach , i had the right to keep who i wanted to but in the suit , the lawyer for the three young women , john r williams of new haven , contended that mr ceneri had cut the players in retaliation for complaints made by their parents at the end of the previous season beginning in september of 1990 and continuing through the spring of 1992 the defendant cruelly and without any legitimate purpose subjected the three plaintiffs intentionally to severe emotional distress and turned what should have been a lifeenriching experience into a nightmare , the complaint said after the suit was filed , mr ceneri , whose contract as the girls varsity coach was not renewed at the end of the 199192 season , sought the advice of a lawyer the union \( the hamden education association \) contacted me but never did anything , said mr ceneri , who had been the girls coach for five seasons , and who said that he had also been contacted by the connecticut education association , which represents most public school teachers in the state but wanda williams mccormick , who is the association s representative for hamden , said that under state law , the town of hamden was obligated to represent mr ceneri as a result of a contract between the hamden board of education and its insurance company , itt hartford , a lawyer for the company , ruth beardsley , represented mr cenari shortly before the case was scheduled to go to trial in new haven , ms beardsley agreed to the settlement under which each of the three women received about 4 , 000 after legal fees had been paid ms beardsley did not return phone calls made to her about the settlement , and jane glynn , a spokeswoman for the hamden superintendent of schools , said that school officials would have no comment on the case i'm very upset that they settled , mr ceneri said i found out about it when ruth beardsley called me and told me i said to her , 'how could you possibly settle \? ' it makes it look like i'm guilty , and i'm not guilty of anything

to the editor i fear that lydia bronte \( letters , oct 29 \) has not read my book the brontes , or she would have known that i discuss and dismiss as myths the stories relating to the irish ancestry of the brontes the one she tells about hugh brunty and his adopted child , welsh , does indeed have strong similarities to that of heathcliff the reason being that it was first recorded nearly 50 years after wuthering heights was written the man responsible for inventing the tale of welsh was william wright , the author of the brontes in ireland , who also tried to prove that hugh brunty was the originator of irish tenantrights theories and that patrick bronte owed his early career to presbyterian patronage his fabrications were effectively exposed and demolished by scholars at the time , and it defies belief that they should still be given credence today even wright himself admitted that his main source , alice bronte , mixed up different events in a way sometimes that made it difficult to disentangle them and , more crucially , that none of the irish brontes knew anything of the early history of the family the information they had to communicate was merely an echo from the english biographies your correspondent also claims that patrick remained close to her ancestor , his brother william , even after patrick moved to england this is demonstrably untrue in 1843 patrick did not even know where william lived , having to write to another brother , who still lived in the family home , to ask for his address the extremely rare extant letters between patrick and his family in ireland all indicate that there was little or no contact between them , and it is , i think , significant that charlotte , the only one of patrick s children who even went to ireland , made no effort to visit her irish relations while there the brontes' irish roots were indisputably important to them the fact that patrick and his brothers were caught up in the irish rebellion of 1798 , for instance , was of seminal importance in influencing the character , views and future career of the father of the brontes one can only regret that such genuinely important matters of fact are overlooked while discredited stories continue to circulate juliet barker hebden bridge , england
beginning a process that could take weeks , police department investigators yesterday interviewed five captains and other supervisors who were among an estimated 800 officers in washington during the drunken rampage through several hotels earlier this month senior police officials refused to discuss what they had learned in the interviews , but they suggested that they were narrowing the list of officers who they suspected were involved in the misconduct its been very interesting , peter laporte , commissioner william j bratton s chief of staff , said progress is getting through these interviews , one step at a time the strategy of the internal affairs bureau , which is conducting the investigation , is first to question the 7 captains , 15 lieutenants and 30 sergeants who were among the new york officers who were in washington on may 14 and 15 for a national memorial for fallen police officers so far , officials say , none of the officers have come forward to identify the people who pranced around nude , harassed women and discharged fire extinguishers at the washington hotels in addition , officials at the marriottfairfax in suburban virginia said yesterday that rowdy new york officers had disturbed guests and set off fire extinguishers there although the fairfax county police were called to the hotel in the early hours of may 16 , no arrests were made the police in washington also made no arrests at the hotels in the city did they take a course in this stuff , like how to take a fire extinguisher down off the wall \? emily vetter , president of the hotel association of washington , said they all did the same thing in different hotels , she said ms vetter also said that there was little damage in any of the hotels , beyond the walls and carpets sprayed with the extinguishers the 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 in damages being quoted by hotel officials , she said , is mostly the cost of reimbursing guests who complained about the police officers in addition to the reluctance of the new york officers to turn themselves in or inform on others , officials said the investigation was complicated because no videotape is known to exist of the wild sprees and , apparently , few photographs were taken in fact , police officials said yesterday that the officers who were depicted in one widely distributed photo were from cranston , ri new york officials said that those officers would be questioned to see if they could identify any new york officers involved in misconduct chief patrick e kelleher , head of the internal affairs bureau , has pledged that the investigation will prove that the department can police itself he said he would recommend the firing of any officer who was not truthful in his testimony , and prohibited the option of invoking fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination we have some pretty good ideas who was where , he said the administrative hearings yesterday , which took place in a conference room at one police plaza , were closed to the public police officials said that all 800 officers who were in washington would be interviewed if necessary also yesterday , the new york civil liberties union sent a letter to mr bratton expressing concern about the department s statement that officers could not invoke the fifth amendment in the hearings that , the letter said , would jeopardize any potential prosecutions of the officers in criminal court in the future referring to a 1967 case , garrity v new jersey , the organization noted that the supreme court held that the fifth amendment protection against coerced confessions prohibits the use , in subsequent criminal proceedings , of confessions obtained from police officers under threat of removal from office asked about the letter , tom kelly , the police department s deputy commissioner for public affairs , said we have n't received the letter i have no comment the police unions have not complained about the hearings so far , although they have offered to provide lawyers to any officer who wants to be accompanied into the interrogation session
athens , july 2 midway through the european basketball championships , vlade divac had said , sports and politics should not go together divac was hardly the only player to make such a comment during the last , relatively tranquil week of competition , but on the night the championships came to an end with a 9690 yugoslav victory over the lithuanians , there was simply no escaping politics first the lithuanians threatened to walk off the court for good with two minutes to play because of suspicions about the refereeing , then the thirdplace croats did walk off the medal stand and out of the arena just before their former countrymen , the yugoslavs , were about to receive their gold medals as the flags rose and a small marching band attempted to play the yugoslav national anthem , the rambunctious greek crowd booed the winners , as they had booed them for much of the game the boos drowned out the anthem , just as politics ended up drowning out the basketball i'm disappointed about everything , said divac , the yugoslav center and los angeles laker the victory was the sixth for a team called yugoslavia in the european championships , but this team is , of course , radically different than its predecessors the first five titles were won by players from a unified nation this title was won by players only from serbia and montenegro , and it came in their first major tournament since returning from a threeyear ban from international competition i'm very proud , in fact i'm more proud this time , said yugoslavia coach dusan ivkovic , who coached the unified yugoslav team to european titles in 1989 and 1991 before the nation was broken apart by separatism and war under different circumstances , postgame discussion would have centered on the overall quality of tonight s final \( both teams shot better than 60 percent from 2point range \) and on several remarkable performances the most remarkable was that of the yugoslav point guard aleksandr djordjevic , who finished with a tournamenthigh 41 points and shot 9 for 12 from 3point range the yugoslavs also got 23 points from their shooting guard , predrag danilovic , a future member of the miami heat the lithuanians were led again by guard sarunas marciulionis , who scored 32 points on 11of14 shooting and was later named the most valuable player of the championships center arvidas sabonis added 20 points and 8 rebounds , although he would foul out with five minutes remaining and it was in those last five minutes that the trouble began already unhappy with the officiating , particularly with the american referee george toliver , the lithuanian players became enraged after toliver called an offensive foul on forward saulius stombergas with two minutes remaining and the yugoslavs leading , 8783 according to people near the bench , sabonis then made a lewd gesture in the direction of toliver and the lithuanians were hit with a second technical foul that was enough to bring the entire team back to the bench their initial intention was to walk out of the arena and not return sabonis even indicated that he would be willing to pay any fine incurred out of his own pocket but the lithuanians , including a stilllivid marciulionis , eventually returned the three free throws gave the yugoslavs a 7point lead we were n't brave enough , said coach vladas garastas we should not have come back on but garastas and marciulionis were certainly bold in the postmatch news conference , insinuating that borislav stankovic , a yugoslav who is secretarygeneral of basketball s world governing body fiba , had influenced the tournament schedule and officiating in favor of his fellow citizens we are n't puppets , we are basketball players , marciulionis said it s a shame we could n't change our own destiny out there basketball in europe hit the bottom tonight , he added this was n't basketball anymore the problems are much , much deeper despite marciulionis s comments , the evidence did not point to blatant bias the officials called 31 fouls against lithuania and 27 against the yugoslavs , whose star center divac was the first important player to foul out , with 12 24 remaining we also played against the referees , ivkovic said the greek fans , certainly not pleased that the yugoslavs had eliminated their team in the semifinals , clearly sided with the underdogs throughout the second half , they rained disdain on fiba , and when the game ended they changed their chant to lithuania is the champion the yugoslavs , six of whom were on the 1991 european championship team , were left to celebrate in a largely hostile environment , and not all of them behaved magnanimously danilovic ran behind one of the baskets , faced a group of jeering supporters and grabbed his crotch i think it was not a good thing he did , ivkovic said later shortly thereafter , with their bronze medals still around their necks , the croats stepped down from the podium and left the arena the blatantly political gesture was in stark contrast to the tenor of the croats' largely apolitical comments throughout the tournament it was pretty sad , said florian wanninger , a fiba spokesman we had some hints that there might be some problems , and we will react because what they did is against regulations i ca n't tell you how , but we will react none of the croats stayed around afterward to discuss it , but the yugoslavs certainly made their feelings known it was stupid , danilovic said my team would never have done that photo yugoslav national team players displaying

roger karlin and his wife , helene , have not seen the movie lorenzo s oil , hollywood s account of the reallife efforts of a washington , dc , couple to find treatment for the rare disease that is ravaging their child they know the 1992 film well enough to discuss its plot , refer to specific scenes , even quote characters but they have been unable to bring themselves to watch it it s funny , says dr helene karlin , a psychologist and the mother of three girls we have n't wanted to see it i do n't think we could handle it even though we 're living it the karlins , of new fairfield , are too preoccupied working to save their 15monthold daughter from a rare form of leukodystrophy to spare even the brief emotional investment in a story so similar to their own lindsay karlin has canavan s disease , a hereditary disorder named for dr ruth canavan , who identified it in the 1930 s , in which the normal functioning and development of the brain are impaired roger karlin , an internist with practices in danbury and new fairfield , and helene have devoted their time and resources to organize and fund research to develop a cure their efforts have led to new hope for their daughter a team of gene therapists at yale university now is working to develop a treatment to be attempted on lindsay and 20monthold alyssa mushin , the daughter of mark and eileen mushin of derby if this attempt , to deliver healthy genes directly to the brain , is successful , it will revolutionize the treatment not only of canavan s , but also of alzheimer s disease , parkinson s disease and other genetic neurological disorders , the researchers say this has been the most incredibly lifechallenging experience we 've ever had to face , helene karlin said we 're going into it with faith the name we gave our daughter lindsay faith karlin was born in july 1994 molly karlin , 13 and a confessed worrier , says her new baby sister was so beautiful , she cried it was not until lindsay was seven weeks old that helene karlin began to notice subtle abnormalities in her development the baby had not yet begun to track objects visually when she tried , her eyes would roll back into her head a trip to the ophthalmologist confirmed helene s suspicion lindsay is legally blind he prescribed glasses he said would correct her vision to 20 20 and get her back on the path of normal development i remember saying to the doctor 'tell me that s all it is , ' helene says 'tell me i do n't have to worry about anything else' he said , 'yes , that s all i did n't believe it there s nothing i could pinpoint call it a mother s intuition but i did n't think it was over with her babysized glasses , lindsay s vision appeared to improve but she still was not developing at the pace set by her sisters , molly and 9yearold samantha the karlins' pediatrician referred them to a pediatric neurologist after a battery of tests , the neurologist identified the problem canavan s disease , a form of leukodystrophy , is caused by a genetic mutation believed to have originated centuries ago among the ashkenazi jews of eastern europe today , as many as 1 in 33 of ashkenazi heritage may carry the gene two carriers have a 25 percent chance of producing a baby with the disease a few hundred cases of canavan s have been diagnosed in the united states , but it is believed there are many more , as yet undiagnosed the mutation prevents production of an enzyme , aspartoacylase , needed to metabolize an acid , nacetylaspartic acid , or naa , found in the brain scientists believe the unmetabolized acid destroys myelin , the insulation that allows nerves in the brain to function properly children with canavan s do not have normal motor coordination they have poor vision and abnormally high or abnormally low muscle tone they will not learn to crawl , to feed themselves , to walk or to talk , but remain as infants , unable to support themselves canavan s is degenerative and fatal usually within the first decade of life there is no cure on hearing the diagnosis , roger karlin , who had not heard of the disease in 15 years of practice , burst into tears we were absolutely devastated , he said when they tell you your daughter is n't going to live past 3 or 4 , all you can think of is your baby is going to die helene karlin went into mourning , staying in bed for weeks while her mother cared for her children her husband exhausted the medical literature on the disease a dozen articles on diagnosis , none on treatment and hit the telephone as a physician , i felt hopeless , he said the way i reacted was to call everyone under the sun who had anything to do with genetics most of those he called were discouraging there has been little funding for research on canavan s some of those with whom roger karlin spoke repeated the old saw the only thing worse than no hope is false hope one was more blunt canavan s \? he asked forget it finally , dr karlin found hope practically in his backyard roscoe brady , head of genetic neurological disorders at the national institutes of health , told him of a researcher at yale studying whether gene therapy could be used to treat diseases like alzheimer s and parkinson s matthew j during , director of the laboratory of molecular pharmacology and neurogenetics at the yale school of medecine , agreed to meet with roger karlin , who took lindsay along
there is a gentle rocking as virginia parker sits talking , in her white socks , very white , her feet dancing we are wedged rather comfortably between two very old pianos , the player piano from her girlhood in this farmhouse where virginia parker was born , and at right angles to it , not very many feet away , an almost equally old upright of very dark wood from the windows the light comes in dappled , dotting the abundance of very old lamps , unlit now in the daytime , the ones on thin poles of wrought iron , sporting wires , and the ones on glass bases , seeming to abound upon every conceivable surface and also , very old and worn looking , and everywhere abounding , the books there are , as my eye wanders , among the antiquities many pigs of all varieties , some cut out and some made of china , in all positions of sleeping and waking and snorting in the yard , later on , i will have a chance to visit lucy and leftover , two very old pigs who have bodies the size of horses they are remarkably clean , with stiff pinkishwhite bristles it is only a year and half since virginia s retirement from new york city s renowned city and country school , one of the first progressive schools , founded by caroline pratt in 1920 to combine john dewey s idea of educating the whole child and some of maria montessori s techniques for 47 years of the school s lifetime she taught the 8 and 9yearolds , fixed in a world of early childhood magic shifting with each year , for most of those years the school s only black teacher and often there were not even black children her tale meanders , as one day turns into two most of a lifetime in which she was shy with the parents and teachers although she did take in boarders in her east hampton house , to have some people her own age in her life , she is only now beginning to find out what it is like to live in the society of her peers it is not only virginia s own story , but also the story of one of the first black families to spring up in east hampton , as i see in my mind when she talks , three very carefully brought up children , a boy and two girls , roller skating along route 27 to piano lessons , children who were so carefully watched that they were never allowed to walk to school alone , or to visit friends' houses , a childhood spent among magazines on egyptology and african cultural heritage it is the story of the intermingling of cultural groups in the east hampton area in the early 1900 s , at a time when family animals were driven in droves every day to montauk to pasture , then returned to their owners each night , a time when jacqueline bouvier used to hunt the foxes who roamed in the fields nearby , with all those hounds and the master blowing loudly on his horn and the child virginia used to feel sorry for the foxes , imagining ways to hide them so that nobody could catch them and they would all be riding just for fun her father was discovered by the east hampton painter dickey newton , who , traveling south to virginia , encountered a talented young boy who was painting and doing photography he offered to take him north as his apprentice , to teach him everything he knew only by the time virginia s father came here , he was kept so busy he was not taught a thing her mother , a few years later in 1905 , was brought north by an older woman who needed a practical nurse it is with pride that virginia tells how her mother was working for a white woman near bull run , near the hospital where the union soldiers were nursed during the civil war , and the white woman said to her if you stay with me , i will see that you are well fed forever and that you always have a place to sleep virginia s mother had happened to notice that the white woman s daughter was going off to boarding school , so she got herself a work study situation in a twoyear college of nursing , saying to herself , i do n't need to be anybody s servant to have a place to sleep at the time she only had one blouse to wear , but she made sure that it was in perfect condition by washing it in the sink each night after she had finished her studying and working , and waking up every morning to iron it there was only one other black family in east hampton at the time virginia s mother and father left their respective employers and set up housekeeping together , acquiring the land on green hollow road where virginia still lives at first her father continued to do some photography and landscaping when he and my mother first came i ca n't think of another word , so i 'll use oddities , virginia says , explaining how he came to be offered a job teaching in east hampton s community center if you find a globe of something that s glowing and beautiful , and you have n't seen it before , but you know it s very special , well , that s the way they felt about him and as she speaks i see the teacher who could see the glow in every child , who even when she was a young child herself , and was pretty much isolated from all other children , nonetheless had an image , a picture of what was needed by a human , first given to a child

pebble beach , calif , feb 3 he can , without any warning at all , slip into one of his many comedic personae walking down the fairway , bill murray suddenly becomes todd , the geeky saturday night live guy who was gilda radner s comic foil in the lupner living room he is n't wearing a plastic pocket protector for his ballpoint pens , but he is about to deliver a noogie to that bald guy over by the gallery ropes then he is dr peter venkman in ghostbusters , sidling up to an attractive woman as he did to sigourney weaver in the movie , stretching his rubbery features into a puppy dog gaze pointing to her black leather jacket , he says , are you in a gang \? murray is gliding through the att pebble beach national proam this year it has again become his stage , his set this is a tournament that was founded on celebrity , by a celebrity , and throughout its colorful history it has always been a show biz happening when this was the crosby , and bing and all his pals strutted across this magnificent setting on the monterey penisula , it was just a big party with golf as a backdrop it will never quite be that again , but at least some of the charm of the clambake remains murray , who threatened to quit coming to the tournament after the former pga tour commissioner deane beman criticized his antics last year and sent him into obscurity by relegating him to a tee time well out of tv range is cracking tee shots and jokes and drawing the biggest galleries of the week thanks to the intervention of the new commissioner , tim finchem , who invited him back , murray s part of the show is going on again most people out here think this is a good thing sure , tom watson has n't changed his mind he does n't like murray s humor but he is in the distinct minority in this one perhaps the most vivid illustration of that came when watson was playing two groups ahead of murray on thursday at poppy hills tom is a stanford graduate and a local favorite , and had a very large following murray s gallery was probably twice as large i think it s great that he s here , said davis love 3d , whose seriousminded approach to golf has never been called into question i think he s hysterical he s hilarious he s learned what he can and ca n't do , and he s really funny the people love him murray is an 18handicapper , but he knows the game he was a caddie , worked for two years as an assistant greens superintendent where he no doubt got some material for carl the greenskeeper in caddyshack and he can definitely play some shots it is because of him that simpson will be around for the final round murray helped his team 25 shots , and they not only made the cut , they stand at 24 under par , just four strokes behind the leading team of gil morgan and michael franz although murray seems to be on constantly , he does have a serious side he was genuinely stung by the criticism last year it hurt to have people say that not only was i bad for golf but bad for america and that i was a symbol of what s wrong with this country , he says it was a very disturbing thing that happened just even talking about it gets me sick to my stomach that was before the tournament once things got started , once he could begin feeding off all the positive vibes , murray again metamorphosed into the comic genius who can people laugh without saying anything he tromped around the celebrity shootout in a pair of shorts with black socks and black shoes , wearing a necktie during thursday s first round i'm going to a wake right after this , he said danced with gallery members , pulled one man s feet out from under him and signed autograph after autograph this is a lot of fun , said jeff sluman , who volunteered to play with murray and simpson we have 30 other weeks where we can put on our straight faces this week we can have fun that really is the bottom punch line with murray he realizes none of this would play at the masters or united states open but that s not what this is this is about galleries , celebrities and pros interacting in a party setting when things get heated during the final round sunday , that s a different story for now , that s entertainment so is this a couple of years ago , two women in the gallery were shouting at murray , bill , give us something to remember you by ! murray ignored them while he was teeing off , but afterward he walked over to them , took a wad of chewing gum out of his mouth and stuck in the middle of one woman s forehead sometimes slapstick , sometimes sophomoric , sometimes silly , always show biz , bill murray is back at pebble beach the show goes on photo the actor bill murray , always good for some comic relief , reacting after sinking a birdie putt on the sixth hole in the first round at pebble beach \( associated press \)
after presenting more than 120 witnesses and more than 100 hours of secretly recorded conversations , federal prosecutors rested their case yesterday against a militant muslim cleric and 10 other men charged with waging a bombing and assassination conspiracy in and around new york for the last five months , in a heavily guarded courtroom in lower manhattan , the prosecutors have presented extensive evidence to support their contention that the men plotted to blow up several local landmarks and to kill such figures as president hosni mubarak of egypt but their evidence also raises serious questions that lawyers for sheik omar abdel rahman and his 10 codefendants are certain to exploit when they begin presenting their case in federal district court next week among those questions are how much of the plotting was spurred by the government s chief informer , whether the plots charged were truly part of a single overarching conspiracy and whether the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that all the defendants were criminally involved according to the prosecution , the conspiracy included a lethal bombing that did occur the february 1993 attack at the world trade center in manhattan that killed six people and plots for subsequent , even deadlier , bombings that were not carried out those plots , the prosecution said , had as targets the united nations headquarters , the federal building at 26 federal plaza in lower manhattan , the holland and lincoln tunnels and the george washington bridge none of the defendants is charged with carrying out the trade center bombing four other followers of mr abdel rahman were convicted in an earlier trial but the prosecution says the trade center attack was nevertheless part of the overall seditious conspiracy late yesterday judge michael b mukasey , at the request of the prosecutors , dropped a portion of the seditious conspiracy charge that accuses the defendants of plotting to forcibly prevent and hinder the execution of united states laws defense lawyers later said that elimination of that section was not significant because the 11 men still face the two other portions of the charge that were always more central to the case that they had conspired to levy a war of urban terrorism against the united states and to oppose by force the authority of the united states also at the prosecution s request , judge mukasey dismissed three charges , including bomb possession , against some defendants but reserved a decision on defense motions to dismiss many of the remaining 25 charges the major evidence presented against mr abdel rahman , a blind fundamentalist cleric who has long agitated for the overthrow of the egyptian government , illustrates both the promise and the pitfalls of the prosecution effort perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence against him is a may 1993 conversation taped by the government s informer , emad salem , in which mr abdel rahman advises him not to bomb the united nations but to find a plan to inflict damage on the american army mr abdel rahman also advises mr salem to put off plans to attack the federal building in manhattan one of the prosecutors , robert khuzami , told the jury that this shows that mr abdel rahman was the leader of the conspiracy , a figure who was consulted about which targets were permissible but because mr salem was the one doing the consulting he had asked mr abdel rahman whether the two buildings should be bombed defense lawyers will be able to argue that mr salem engineered the conversation in an attempt to set up mr abdel rahman the cleric s chief lawyer , lynne f stewart , has maintained that the american government made a target of her client in such an attempt to help its ally , egypt she has argued that by prosecuting mr abdel rahman and keeping him in jail , the united states was preventing him from continuing to inspire his followers in egypt in their efforts to topple mr mubarak ms stewart has also argued that mr salem , a former egyptian military officer who infiltrated mr abdel rahman s circle , is an admitted liar who cannot be believed and whom the government has paid more than 1 million for his work on the case but prosecutors say it is the defendants' own words , captured in the recorded conversations , that support mr salem s five weeks of testimony
northampton , mass with two days to go until spring training , and with the republican leadership in congress apparently unwilling to lift a finger to settle baseball s paralyzing sixmonth labor dispute , fans must be in a state beyond despair but the situation is not hopeless at least not yet to get real baseball in 1995 , congress needs to get involved now it wo n't do to wait until june , when some have said they plan to revisit the issue , to see if the players and owners come together the current negotiations were opened by the owners in december 1992 , and the sides are little closer today than they were then the most significant movement has been toward ever greater rancor and distrust speaker newt gingrich and his republican colleagues have offered several arguments for staying out of the baseball dispute none hold water perhaps the silliest is that congress has better things to do with its time president clinton proposed to submit the baseball dispute to a panel of arbitrators whose decision would be binding passing such a bill would establish a fair factfinding process and get real baseball back on the field , and it would take congress half of an afternoon to pass it far less time than mr gingrich spent saying he did n't want to get involved republicans say congress does not belong in the baseball industry , but that argument comes more than 70 years too late congress has repeatedly sanctioned baseball s anachronistic exemption from the antitrust laws , and rather than setting a clear and consistent policy , it threatens baseball with lifting the exemption every time a new senator wants an expansion franchise in his or her state last june , the players association said it would n't strike during the season if the owners promised not to impose a salary cap unilaterally after the season , but the owners said no deal the players then told congress that if the antitrust exemption was lifted \( even only the part related to collective bargaining \) , they would not strike because they would be able to defend themselves in court the bill died in committee , and the players went on strike so congress is not only involved it is complicitous there is precedent , too , for imposing binding arbitration in labor disputes congress did so as recently as 1992 , ending a dispute between the international association of machinists and aerospace workers and a freight rail company no , baseball is not crucial to the economy but it is the only unregulated , legal monopoly we have in this country if the republicans really care about free markets , why do they have nothing to say about the baseball owners' attempts at price fixing through salary caps and intraindustry salary taxes , which directly affront the idea of free labor markets \? binding arbitration is a shortterm solution lifting baseball s antitrust exemption as proposed in limited form last week by senators daniel patrick moynihan and orrin g hatch would help in the long run , especially if it is a comprehensive measure that puts baseball on an equal footing with the other sports \( it would not , however , settle the labor dispute the players association would lift the strike , but the owners would almost certainly impose a lockout and go ahead with their plan for temporary replacement players \) so to get real baseball back on the field in april , congress must quickly revisit the issue of binding arbitration and though the leadership s refusal to do so may have seemed final a week ago , perhaps the sight of overweight and undertalented athletes on exhibition fields in florida and arizona this week will give mr gingrich company an icewater bath of common sense as long as baseball faces neither competition nor regulation , the industry will remain in turmoil if newt gingrich truly understood the teachings of adam smith , he would know this
virginia beach , va , aug 16 hurricane felix hovered more than 150 miles off the atlantic coast this evening , its ponderous progress toward the shore nearly stalled as it churned a vast sweep of the ocean like a giant eggbeater but in seaside communities from florida to new england , mountainous surf from the distant storm was already wracking up a growing toll of damage in sandbridge , an affluent seafront community here , clawing surf since sunday has shredded sections of the metal sea wall built seven years ago to hold back the tide , leaving steel ribbing twisted like a kite that had been battered by the wind in several places , the surging seas have already breached coastal defenses , tearing wooden decks from oceanview homes and flooding roads by most estimates , the storm , whose winds slowed to 75 miles an hour , or barely hurricane strength , will not make landfall until sometime thursday officials said the storm was nearly stationary for six hours this evening for many here , the greater fear is not when or where felix will storm ashore , but rather how long it will continue to meander somewhere off the coast , relentlessly grinding away at beaches and shorefront resorts along more than 1 , 000 miles of coastline david basco , a professor of civil engineering who has studied beach erosion in sandbridge for five years , said he was stunned by the force of the water at high tide today for this early in the storm , and for a storm that far away , there was a lot of water over the wall , said mr basco , director of the coastal engineering center at old dominion university in norfolk , va with the water surge expected to reach as high as five feet when the storm peaks , a record level for the virginia beach area , he also said he was not sure how many homes on the ocean with or without a sea wall and in the lowlying areas beyond could withstand relentless pounding this one will be quite devastating on the dunes , he said , and most of the people without walls will get a pretty good hit they are not designed for such a big storm his assessment echoed a survey this week by the virginia beach fire department , which predicted that at least 40 houses along the ocean in sandbridge could fall like a zipper opening up from the weak and missing sections of the sea wall this one will not do the spectacular damage to buildings that andrew did , said orrin h pilkey , a professor of geology at duke university who studies shoreline erosion , referring to the devastating hurricane of 1992 that caused a record 30 billion in damages mostly in south florida but this is hitting early in the hurricane season , he said , and that is going to set up many beaches for more damage from storms through the rest of the season , leaving them naked and unprotected as a category 1 hurricane , the tamest rank given by the national hurricane center in miami , felix is far weaker than most of the hurricanes that have battered the east coast in recent years , including andrew , emily in 1993 and gloria in 1985 but experts say felix is covering a staggering amount of territory , almost 107 , 000 square miles these circumstances make it distinctive in its own right , working like an oceanic eggbeater to churn wind and waters toward shorelines for a longer period of time than most hurricanes the effects of felix are expected to linger over some beach areas for as long as 30 hours most other hurricanes have traveled straighter , swifter paths this one is not crossing the shoreline quickly , the way hugo did in 1989 , mr pilkey said it s just standing out there , pounding , pounding , pounding , pounding i expect replenished beaches to take a big hit they are more unstable than other beaches replenished beaches are those where sand has been added to fortify an eroding coast line mr pilkey cited monmouth , nj , ocean city nj , ocean city , md , virginia beach and wrightsville beach , nc among areas that could expect significant beach erosion as a result of felix s loitering not to mention the economic losses of vacationers evacuating for safer ground john s bone , the executive director of the outer banks chamber of commerce in north carolina , said local businesses were losing 45 million a day this week in rent , lodging and retail sales it s devastating economically already , he said , and it has n't even hit yet for residents of sandbridge , at the south end of virginia beach , if problems of beach erosion are decreasing it is only because there is not much beach left to erode some of the homes are still protected by metal sea wall bulkheads , which are illegal in some states , like north carolina , south carolina and maine but the surf has ripped away sea walls in many spots and eaten away much of the beach in front of homes , whether the sea walls stand or not janet peterson , a 49yearold high school english teacher , was planning to evacuate this afternoon , to join friends inland she said when she bought her house in 1985 , it faced 100 yards of beach almost none of it remains , and noting the unusually ferocity of the surf today , she said she would not be surprised if felix claims her part of the wall when i bought this house , i had a beautiful freestanding deck over the back that washed away in '87 , she said now , we 've got less buffer than ever before dr steven w lyons , a meteorologist with the national hurricane center in miami predicted the possibility of a long scouring of the beach area but that much force could jeopardize much more than oceanfront properties , he said , threatening many inland areas so well this is n't the catastrophic type , where a large number of people drown from a huge storm surge or a huge number of buildings are leveled , dr lyons said but it s still going to be nasty the wind will have more time to loose and break things , and flooding can be a major disaster with storms that stall photo joe dowdy , owner of the dowdy amusement

this week s cover story in new york magazine is an egregious exercise in stereotyping and willful blindness this is the typical new yorker , the headline says that s followed by a subhead actually , there is no one typical new yorker there are four , all living very different lives in four very different new yorks which are you \? turn to the table of contents and you get the four categories stable , affluent white couples , frantic white singles , disenchanted minorities and the old that s it those are the typical new yorkers everybody else is an aberration among those quoted in the article is jennifer , a 27yearold frantic white single , who moans i have trouble making ends meet , but that s because living the high life here is so costly just paying for clothes and going out costs me 1 , 000 a month a 19yearold named tamar , also typical , is quoted there is no better city going to a club or a rave and getting expletive up on drugs that s as good as it gets the article was based on a telephone poll of 581 new yorkers by penn schoen associates somebody should have hung up the phone and walked to a window and looked out they might have seen the waves of hardworking but far from affluent new yorkers who head for the subways each morning and evening they might have seen the puerto rican or dominican or west indian parents who are enchanted not disenchanted , enchanted as they watch their baby take those first two shaky steps , and then fall down with a grin they might have seen the white guy , or the asian woman , on the way to that second job that is absolutely essential if a son or daughter is to go off to college in the fall those are among the typical new yorkers i see every day , and you ca n't easily group them according to racial or ethnic categories the article was written by the pollsters , mark penn and douglas schoen it was full of inanities like the following as a rule , it s better to have money in new york , it s advisable , and if you want to fully enjoy the city , it s necessary what is much worse , though , is the rampant and thoroughly delusional racial chauvinism that permeates the piece example it s no wonder that 3 million new yorkers watch either seinfeld or friends every week they are seinfeld and friends white , young , single manhattanites hanging around their glamorous apartments they have to be kidding , right \? they ca n't believe that thirty percent of the young , white single adults in new york \( that s five boroughs , not one \) earn less than 10 , 000 per year 46 percent less than 20 , 000 , and 70 percent less than 35 , 000 twentyseven percent still live with their parents ! the reality is that new york is a poor city , said dr andrew beveridge , a sociologist at queens college the vast majority of people in new york are struggling , not just minorities except for the old , the article s only category for any new yorker who is not white is the catchall category disenchanted minorities , an insulting classification that has to cover blacks , latinos , asians , whomever for the record , it s not true that everybody who is not white is disenchanted i know some of my best friends are happy mark penn knows this , too during an interview in which he defended his polling data , he mentioned in passing that not all the disenchanted minorities are disenchanted oh the problem , of course , is that the magazine and the pollsters started from the premise that whites are typical that comes from spending too much time in front of a mirror with the typical category taken , a conceptual place had to be found for everybody else for those who have n't noticed , typical new yorkers come in a breathtaking variety ride the trains where the business suits meet the bandannas , and the hornrim glasses meet the nose rings listen to the music of the streets , which might be classical guitar on one block and steel drums on the next there s a lot that is special about new york , the greatest of all cities none of it can be found by looking in a mirror
pat riley s return to new york turned into a bizarre day , even by his secret agent standards it began with a morning shootaround , in which none of the miami heat players were told where they were going until they jumped onto the team bus outside the four seasons hotel it picked up steam when he confided in several of the heat s reporters during unsolicited phone calls to their hotel rooms , and it ended when he closed the locker room to all reporters before last night s game at madison square garden at least that s the word from a person familiar with the situation riley telephoned several miami reporters in their hotel rooms and took aim at several of his old foes the new york news media , madison square garden s president , dave checketts , and orlando magic center shaquille o'neal calling much of what was reported this week rhetoric , riley did not meet with anyone from the new york news media before the game fearing his wrath , none of the miami reporters would say what he had said the heat ended up practicing at the reebok club near lincoln center the team bus was followed by a reporter from hard copy who was hired by madison square garden network to trail riley with a camera riley s decision to close the locker room could result in a fine by the league , whose standing rule is to allow the news media access up to 45 minutes before the start of the game who carried whose bags \? riley had his favorite knicks , and many resented him for it patrick ewing , john starks and derek harper were among his favorites , all of them company men who refused to stray from riley s grand plan charles oakley and anthony mason were more freespirited and , at times , had trouble adapting to his winorexpire philosophy when oakley said during the preseason , some people carried his bags on this team , he never elaborated , but then , after four years , he did not have to knicks to help coat drive before saturday s game against the toronto raptors at the garden , the knicks will help to stage the new york cares coat drive fans are asked to bring either new or used coats to the garden lobby they will be collected and distributed among new york s needy miami activated stacey king for last night s game the knicks are 161 against the heat at the garden just a business decision just a business decision kevin willis on the crowd s response to pat riley it was bad but he can deal with it that s new york pat had to do what he had to do from a business standpoint charles oakley on the news media s crush inside the knicks' locker room after the game have the playoffs started already \? when asked whether all the hoopla surrounding riley may have been a factor in the knicks missing their first nine shots , derek harper said i guess it did but it s happened before and it will happen again and coach riley will not be anywhere in sight harper on the fans' response to riley that s just mixed emotions there was some cheering my wife cheered kevin willis on the crowd s response to pat riley it was bad but he can deal with it that s new york pat had to do what he had to do from a business standpoint charles oakley on the news media s crush inside the knicks' locker room after the game have the playoffs started already \? when asked whether all the hoopla surrounding riley may have been a factor in the knicks missing their first nine shots , derek harper said i guess it did but it s happened before and it will happen again and coach riley will not be anywhere in sight harper on the fans' response to riley that s just mixed emotions there was some cheering my wife cheered
a federal judge ruled yesterday that the brooklyn teenager indicted on civil rights charges in the killing of a hasidic student in crown heights in 1991 must be tried as a juvenile if convicted , the defendant , lemrick nelson jr , will now face a maximum sentence of five years in prison , rather than the possibility of a life term in making his ruling , judge david g trager of federal district court in brooklyn rejected the argument of federal prosecutors that mr nelson , who was 16 at the time of the killing , had committed premeditated murder the judge also ruled that the government had failed to establish that mr nelson was either beyond rehabilitation or someone whose personality would indicate a clear tendency toward future violence mr nelson , who is now 19 , could have faced a mandatory life term if tried as an adult and convicted of the most serious charges in the slaying of yankel rosenbaum , 29 , during the first of four nights of racial unrest in crown heights federal prosecutors said they were disappointed with the judge s ruling , but refused to say if they would appeal yesterday , mr nelson smiled broadly after the decision , and his lawyers called the ruling a tremendous victory trevor headley , one of the lawyers representing mr nelson , said he would soon file motions accusing the united states attorney of vindictive prosecution and seek to have the entire case dismissed mr nelson , who was arrested the night of mr rosenbaum s killing and charged with having made the fatal stab wounds , was acquitted of state murder charges in 1992 after a jury trial the verdict provoked an angry outcry among the city s jewish residents , and prosecutors and politicians spent more than two years trying to persuade the united states attorney general to undertake a federal civil rights prosecution of mr nelson last year , at the direction of attorney general janet reno , federal prosecutors in brooklyn convened a grand jury and obtained a civil rights indictment of mr nelson yesterday , norman rosenbaum , the victim s brother , who has long criticized the justice department s handling of the case , assailed the decision on trying mr nelson as a juvenile it belittles the enormity of the crime and sends a very alarming message , mr rosenbaum said in a telephone interview from australia but it also is the result of a lack of dedication and commitment on the part of the justice department to prosecute the case competently and vigorously in seeking to try mr nelson as an adult even though he was under 18 at the time of the crime , federal prosecutors had to try to establish one or more of the following that mr nelson had a significant past record of violent crime that previous attempts to rehabilitate him had failed that he suffered from a pathology that rendered him a threat for future violence that his psychological development had not been impaired by limited intelligence or unstable social environment , or that the crime was so serious that , in the interests of justice , he could not be prosecuted as a juvenile judge trager in effect decided that the prosecution had met none of the requirements citing psychological reports by doctors for the prosecution and mr nelson , the judge found mr nelson had a lower than normal iq , had come from an unstable family and social environment , had only received the most informal counseling , and had no prior record of serious delinquent behavior and while he considered the seriousness of the crime as a factor in his decision , judge trager said the prosecution itself had conceded that there was great uncertainty as to what precisely happened at the moment of confrontation thus , the judge did not deem it likely that mr nelson would be found guilty of the most serious possible offense in a federal civil rights case , the judge or jury must first decide whether the defendant violated the victim s civil rights , and then must determine the nature of the underlying crime involved in the violation in this case , judge trager said he was unlikely to determine at trial that mr nelson s actions constituted premeditated murder , leaving possible findings of seconddegree murder or voluntary manslaughter federal prosecutors had sought to have judge trager consider mr nelson s recent convictions in georgia for aggravated assault and carrying a concealed weapon in making his decision but judge trager said crimes committed after the 1991 killing of mr rosenbaum could not be factored in his evaluation the nonjury trial before judge trager is scheduled to begin on july 18 the judge has proven to be someone with an open mind , said mr headley , who had sought to have judge trager removed from the case because of what the lawyer contended were his close ties to jewish organizations in the city our hope all along has been to have an impartial trial it looks like we may get it later , mayor rudolph w giuliani , a former federal prosecutor , said that he thought the judge s decision was a mistake and that mr nelson should have been tried as an adult yesterday s ruling produced the same division of emotions that have split much of the city since the unrest in crown heights , which erupted after a black child was killed by a car in the entourage of the grand rabbi of the lubavitch hasidim lemrick nelson sr stood with his son outside the courtroom and said he was gratified an hour later , jewish leaders and elected officials held a news conference on the street condemning the ruling the most justice that can now be got is a sentence that would be a farce , said assemblyman dov hikind , who has monitored the case for nearly four years it s proven impossible to squeeze any justice out of the system photo lemrick nelson \(

united nations , may 17 the clinton administration cast its first security council veto today , killing a resolution that called on israel to reverse a decision to expropriate land in largely palestinian areas of jerusalem the united states was alone in opposing the resolution , which was supported by all 14 other council members it was the first american veto in five years a lastminute effort to replace the resolution with a security council presidential statement , which carries less weight , failed this morning after russia proposed a draft that was still too strong for washington and too weak for the palestinians , who wanted a formal vote diplomats said russia had introduced the alternative with the encouragement of washington , though it was clear a majority members would back the original resolution , which had been debated and watered down since last week the resolution , introduced on behalf of the palestinians by oman , with the joint sponsorship of botswana , honduras , indonesia , nigeria and rwanda , declared the expropriation of about 131 acres of land in jerusalem in late april illegal under earlier united nations resolutions , a statement the united states delegation called legally questionable this council is not able and should not seek to try to resolve sensitive issues in the middle east peace process , madeleine k albright , the chief united states representative , said in a statement to the council that is for the parties , who must live with the outcome of those negotiations the united states has expressed the view that the israeli notice to expropriate land in jerusalem is unhelpful clearly , this israeli decision does not move the peace process in the right direction but by injecting the council into this issue , this resolution would merely compound the problem europeans backed the resolution out of concern that any tampering with the status in jerusalem at this delicate point in relations between israel and the palestine liberation organization could further endanger the peace effort , diplomats said the resolution , which carried no sanctions or other punitive consequences , asked israel to rescind the expropriation and to refrain from such action in the future the clinton administration says its veto will protect the issue of jerusalem from interference by the security council , an american official said the official also described the resolution as politically stupid because it could cause israel to become even more hardline on the issue of land rights one diplomat said today that ms albright had warned other council members at the start of the debate that the united states was not going to allow any such document to pass but the americans continued the discussion in the hope of changing a few minds , and left the impression that there might be some flexibility , the diplomat said prime minister yitzhak rabin said on sunday that the israeli government would not seize any more property in jerusalem without palestinian consent but the israeli government ruled out reversing the decision to confiscate the plots already seized for housing and the construction of a police station no compensation has been offered , but none would be accepted , palestinians say they consider the expropriated land in beit safara , on jerusalem s southern edge , and beit hanina , to the north and mainly in the west bank part of their homeland the status of jerusalem is to be decided in the last phase of talks between israel and the plo under the terms of their 1993 peace pact palestinians and others opposed to the land seizures have said an american veto would prove that washington is not even handed in its effort to act as a mediator in the region

fargo , nd , march 2 out here on the windwhipped prairies , north dakota is accustomed to obscurity once , the state was even mistakenly omitted from an atlas of america but north dakota loomed large on the political map today , and its two united states senators looked like a pair of davids who had felled the goliaths in washington after tantalizing capitol hill for days , the senators kent conrad and byron l dorgan , both democrats voted against the balancedbudget amendment , sealing , at least for now , its defeat the outcome was the culmination of a drama that had focused national attention on north dakota and its senators , one of whom republicans had hoped would provide the single vote needed for passage both said the republicans' version would leave the social security trust fund vulnerable to government looting , and they stood their ground in the face of enormous pressure in turn , people here stood by their senators and they relished the sudden prominence of north dakota and a rare flexing of muscle by the state that ranks 47th in population nobody pays any attention to our little state , 62yearold harvey greuel said with a satisfied harumph , pausing briefly on his brisk morning walk through the west acres mall here well , they 're paying attention now whatever their stands on amending the constitution , north dakotans applauded their senators for getting the state s name on network television and radio hometown heroes , declared a headline in the fargo forum the north dakota duo , trumpeted the grand forks herald even rush limbaugh s snarls of disgust with north dakota seemed to delight people here future elections , of course , will determine the political prudence of the votes cast by mr conrad and mr dorgan and by north dakota s lone member of the house of representatives , earl pomeroy , also a democrat , who voted against the amendment in that chamber last month but the evidence is that none of them need fear punishment national polls show an overwhelming majority of americans favoring a balancedbudget amendment , but north dakota s demographics and political heritage differ markedly from those of the country as a whole this largely democratic state has never been a place where people snarl about government spending , not with nearly 20 percent of its residents old enough to collect social security benefits and onequarter of them living on farms , which often depend on federal aid these balancedbudget people just want to take away my social security check , said evelyn sandberg , an 80yearold retired farmer this thing goes through , and they 'll start monkeydiddling with social security oh , sure , they promise they wo n't touch it what kind of idiots do they think we are \? north dakotans' support for government programs dates from the socialist agenda of the nonpartisan league , founded in 1915 largely by scandinavian and german settlers who had a deep distrust of powerful new york banks and chicago s volatile commodities markets today as well , political experts here say , north dakotans tend to favor a prairie populism and reward leaders who talk about standing up for the little guy against the vagaries of the market i'm glad our guys are sticking to their guns , said dean ludwig , a 44yearold department store manager , who scoffed at the argument of the amendment s advocates that because american families must balance their own books , government should be required to do the same sometimes families get in a crisis and need to borrow , you know i 've got a mortgage do n't you \? i like my credit cards do n't you \? to be sure , not every north dakotan is extolling the senators they 're interested in getting on network television , said lyle reul , a 53yearold business executive we 've got to balance the budget , and there does n't seem to be any other way to do it and gov edward t schafer , a republican , whose sister was once married to mr conrad , sharply criticized both senators for raising the specter of cuts in social security i'm embarrassed , he said , that they would use the politics of fear but gail wischmann , a 36yearold deputy sheriff , accused the republicans of playing loose with the facts , especially on social security they want to cut some fat from washington \?

washington , jan 8 the top republicans in congress and vice president al gore will stake out competing positions on monday about the best way to rewrite the nation s 60yearold telecommunications laws the republicans and the clinton administration have made the issue a top priority this year , in part because they came within a whisker last autumn of passing a bipartisan bill intended to promote greater competition and encourage private investment in the socalled information superhighway while both sides agree in principle on many ideas , like allowing local telephone and cable television companies to attack each other s markets , on other issues the two parties are pulling in different directions the newly dominant republican lawmakers are pushing for a stronger attempt at broad deregulation , while mr gore will emphasize the continuing need to protect consumers and make advanced communications available to schools and people who are not affluent republican leaders will lay out their general approach at a hearing before the senate commerce committee and its chairman , senator larry pressler of south dakota the majority leader , bob dole of kansas , who opposed the bill last year and demanded much stronger deregulation , will testify so will representative jack fields of texas , a republican and a coauthor of last year s bill he is chairman of the house commerce subcommittee on telecommunications senator pressler has said publicly that he will start from scratch , so none of the compromises reached last year can be assumed to hold now senator pressler has told associates that he does not intend to introduce a bill on monday , but will rather try to assemble the outlines of a general republican position that position is likely to support greater freedom for the regional bell telephone companies , who are fighting for permission to enter the longdistance and cable television industries senator pressler has also said he favors relaxing rate regulations imposed two years ago on the cable television industry the administration , meanwhile , has scheduled what it has called a telecommunications summit meeting , and has lined up support from state and local government officials for a broad set of principles of telecommunications reform those principles include promoting competition among industries and encouraging private investment in the national information infrastructure goals that republicans would accept but mr gore , accompanied by secretary of commerce ronald h brown and anne k bingaman , the assistant attorney general for antitrust issues , will also emphasize the need to expand universal service and prevent attempts by one industry or another to stifle competition administration officials said today that they had lined up support for those principles from the national governors association , the national conference of state legislatures and associations representing state and local utility regulators we think we are being more inclusive , said greg simon , chief domestic policy adviser to mr gore the republicans , he said , are holding a caucus between people who already agree with each other senator pressler and representative fields have been meeting with the vice president , however , and have emphasized their desire to work in cooperation with the administration still , the issues pit so many entrenched industry groups against each other that scores of disputes could derail a bill even amid consensus about the broader issues that happened last year , when the regional bell companies ultimately decided that the bill moving through the senate imposed too many restrictions on them without enough freedom in exchange that prompted mr dole to demand big revisions , and supporters of the measure finally conceded defeat in late september
to the editor re brent staples s thomas jefferson and 'dashing sally' \( editorial notebook , april 18 \) it is one thing to say that as a slaveholding man , jefferson may have had sexual contact with slave women , as many did it is quite another to claim , as fawn brodie did in her psychobiography , that there is convincing evidence he had a serious passion about a specific teenager , the slave sally hemings , resulting in several children and lasting for nearly 40 years , in spite of his being in the public eye as a politician , whom mudslinging journalists for political reasons had accused of miscegenation historians have rejected ms brodie s book not because they are jefferson protectors , or shocked by the idea of jefferson s sexual crossing of color lines , as mr staples implies , but because her arguments \( which were widely and enthusiastically accepted outside the historical profession \) are speculative , farfetched , unhistorical and sentimental in a 20thcentury way ms brodie assumes that jefferson s vital sexuality depends on our believing in her romanticized notion of a tragic love affair that defied the laws , her version of popular gothic romance \( i was given her book to review at the time as someone who was also sympathetic to using erik erikson s ego psychology in biographical work , but i found that ms brodie had none of his caution about the tenuous evidence \) mr staples asks insinuatingly what of her trip with jefferson to paris , her french tutor and the lavish clothes \? well , what of them \? jefferson took sally s older brother along as well both had a tutor and were paid the same wages as a companion to jefferson s daughter , on whom her father had spent much more for clothes , the slave girl needed to be dressed for paris society what s the big deal \? mr staples suggests as the conclusion of the movie jefferson in paris , advising jefferson specialists to take some deep breaths he fails to see that the colorizing of history , by focusing on dubious anecdotes about a public man s private life , stands in the way of genuine historical understanding \( always in short supply \) of jefferson s troubling conflicts about slavery , to which mr staples rightly and sensibly refers colorizing becomes more of a big deal in a world in which , as mr staples points out , historical adjudications are becoming largely the territory of screenwriters cushing strout ithaca , ny , april 19 , 1995 the writer retired as professor of american studies and humane letters at cornell university
gerald ryan envisioned a life doubly cloistered he entered the priesthood in 1945 , following the path of his strict irish catholic boyhood then he hoped his love of literature would land him on a teaching faculty the neat lines of his vision pleased him , as much for what they excluded as for what they included i was n't too interested in change or where society was going that would have been a distraction to me , father ryan said i was naive , inexperienced , jejune now , he is none of those the teaching assignment never came through , but much else has father ryan , who turns 75 this week and is marking his 50th year as a priest in the south bronx , has unexpectedly spent a lifetime ministering to the pain and triumph , fear and hope of an everchanging flock his first parish , largely irish and italian when he arrived , turned mostly black by the late 1950 s , following the flight of whites from the south bronx father ryan marched to the beat of his new parishioners in washington in 1963 where he heard martin luther king s i have a dream speech , and in selma in 1965 his second parish , st luke s church in mott haven , where he has been since 1966 , turned from white to hispanic during the 1960 s , and father ryan became fluent in spanish he now says mass in two languages he has worked in jails and organized programs for drug addicts and the homeless it recently fell to father ryan to comfort a former altar boy who was wounded when gunfire erupted during a wedding reception in the church meeting room if you 're going to stay around , you have to roll with the punches , he said you have to allow circumstances to change you i really feel that the south bronx has done more for me than i have done for the south bronx father ryan grew up in the middleclass pelham bay neighborhood of the bronx in a world that was comfortably staid , from his father s job as a motorman on the narrow rails of the irt to his family s conservative religious devotion we were irish democrats , catholics , he said we played it by the rules , and we were very nervous with people who wanted change during the era of joseph mccarthy and the red scare , i was n't outraged by mccarthy and the far right , father ryan said but the threat of communism paled against the tides of racism , poverty , drugs and crime that swelled around him he said the experience that began his personal metamorphosis was at his first parish , st anthony of padua , where he said he came to understood the struggle of blacks in america father ryan said he was humbled by the courage of his parishioners they revealed to him a world more complex than his middleclass existence , and he grew more accepting of those changes in the world that he once considered distractions i like being an open person , he said during a recent interview at the st luke s rectory i like not having the answers before i have the questions he said he feels his work in the south bronx is particularly meaningful because the struggle of his largely poor parishioners makes people who are religious more religious , more dependent , closer to god the need for reassurance that god gives is greater if everything is going along ok and there s no trouble , the need is not so great even so , working in the south bronx and similarly tattered neighborhoods can be taxing we do n't exactly have people beating down the doors to come here , said father paul leblanc of the st pius v roman catholic church , whose parish borders father ryan s father ryan s long tenure is unusual , especially since the rules of the archdiocese of new york changed in 1968 to restrict a priest s term in a parish to two sixyear stints , except in special circumstances father ryan was appointed before the rules were changed and plans to remain on past his scheduled retirement this year , as long as his health permits \( he is skiing his week \) father ryan s hair is white now , but he is a spry , engaging man with blue eyes that are clear and lively he begins each day before dawn with a halfhour of yoga exercises and meditation on the floor of his bedroom before saying mass in the church s cavernous chapel shortly after 7 am he shares those duties with the rev william harder , the church s associate pastor the mott haven neighborhood is one of the poorest in the city , and the church remains one of its focal points as many as 700 people attend the four sunday masses about 150 people are fed at the friday soup kitchen and at a recent mass celebrating father ryan s 50th anniversary as a priest , almost 1 , 000 people filled the pews of the chapel , which was hung with banners that read in spanish and english fr ryan our priest prophet pastor both his perseverance and his ability to guide his parishioners through crises from drug wars to homelessness in the neighborhoods have made him a local hero among other priests he s the oldest priest around here , and in some ways he s the youngest in thought , said the rev john grange of st jerome s church , also in the south bronx i 've talked to gerry a few times about what i should do and where i should go , father grange said and he said the only journey is the inner journey i think gerry s had an inner journey his parishioners cannot fathom that father ryan was once a rigid , unbending man madelyn feliciano , who has been active in the church for 17 years , said father ryan is unusually approachable , has made strides at heightening the role of women in the church and has also fully integrated spanishspeaking parishioners who once prayed in the church basement into services when we have a parish mass , he s very conscious of saying this has to be bilingual , ms feliciano said he is so loved by the spanish community the little old ladies come around and hug him his personal gestures , too , are unforgettable ms feliciano said that when she arrived at church on the sunday after her father died two and a half years ago , father ryan announced madelyn has arrived into the bosom of her loving family he signaled to me to come up , stopped the mass and gave me the biggest hug , she said father ryan said his greatest challenge has been to help his parishioners survive the tragedy that is a constant subplot in the south bronx he is well equipped for the task of eight siblings , he is the only one surviving , and st luke s survived the fires of the 1970 s that consumed much of the south bronx he said the tragedies become just a part of life , not life itself to explain , he recalls the flannery o'connor short story a good man is hard to find , in which members of a family are systematically executed by an escaped convict , even as the reader remains focused on the mindless chatter of an elderly woman she can take the violence and tragedy and tell it in such a way that it does n't paralyze you , like it s part of the human experience she can do it in a way that step by step you can accept that the inevitable happens , father ryan said that s like the south bronx step by step the inevitable happens and you accept it photos entering the priesthood 50 years ago , i was n't too interested in change or where society was going , said the rev gerald ryan a banner noted his anniversary \( linda rosier for the new york times \) \( pg23 \) the rev gerald ryan preparing for sunday

robbie curry went to work at coney island hospital in brooklyn yesterday with a sense of dread even greater than usual mayor rudolph w giuliani , after all , had already put the municipal hospital and two others up for sale but then , late friday night , came the news that her union local would not be covered by a nolayoff pledge the mayor had promised other unions after 12 years as a security guard at the hospital , ms curry realized that the future of her job seemed uncertain you try to put it out of your mind , but it s still there , she said , shepherding visitors and employees into the hospital you just do n't know you do n't know if you 're going to work today or tomorrow you might come in and find a pink slip to thousands of hospital workers like ms curry guards , clerical workers , nurse s aides , janitors the labor settlement announced on friday night with a coalition of 17 unions representing 140 , 000 civilian workers drove home mr giuliani s commitment to sell at least 3 of the city s 11 municipal hospitals in negotiations that intensified over the last few weeks , the mayor s aides had insisted that the written pledge not to lay off anyone for three years exclude employees from various unions who work in the city s health and hospitals corporation , which operates the hospitals , as well as clinics and the emergency medical service the mayor s aides said the hospital workers could not be given the job security that the other unions have because doing so could seriously complicate the sale or lease of the hospitals moreover , deep cuts in federal aid being debated in washington could force the city to eliminate thousands of jobs in the hospitals corporation mr giuliani hailed the deal yesterday as a historic one that should be a model for other cities it increases wages and benefits by 13 percent over an unusually long five years and extracts modest concessions from the unions that trim overtime , eliminate extra pay for working nights and lincoln s birthday and give new employees one less sick day than in the past even the union leaders called the tentative settlement the best they could hope for in these tough fiscal times , protecting workers' benefits and winning modest pay increases after the first two years in fact , they said , the city s commitment not to lay off workers for three years made it easier to swallow the twoyear freeze on benefits for the hospital workers , however , there was no balm to soothe the sting , a disparity that drew cries of betrayal from leaders of unions representing nearly 20 , 000 of the 38 , 000 hospitals corporation employees , and caused rifts within the unions james butler , the president of local 420 , which represents 4 , 000 workers , denounced the settlement , which he voted against when the union delegates gathered on friday afternoon to approve the city s offer sometimes , behind the closed doors , deals are made to save others , mr butler said yesterday sacrifices are made and our union was sacrificed last month , the mayor officially offered to turn over the three hospitals coney island , queens hospital center and elmhurst hospital center to private companies in detailed documents , the city suggested it would allow new operators to significantly rework contracts with existing unions first deputy mayor peter j powers said yesterday that the workers' fate would be in the hands of the new owners he said the buyers would have to outline plans for the workers , including whether they would be employed and remained unionized the city , he added , would consider those factors when it evaluates offers stanley hill , the executive director of district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , which led the negotiations with the city , defended the contract yesterday the unions , he said , had simply deferred a decision on layoffs on the hospital workers and would work out language in a side agreement that would assure job security we 're not going to let them die on the vine , he said but a draft of that agreement , obtained by the new york times , offers only a series of promises to try , for example , to reassign some workers who might lose their jobs it makes no guarantees protecting jobs , and the mayor s aides said there would be none there are still legal and political obstacles to a sale and mr butler said his union was considering its own lawsuit and would lobby the city council and the state legislature to block any sale at the headquarters of local 420 on 125th street in harlem yesterday , mr butler fielded calls from nervous workers he tried his best to reassure them we might not be engineers , but we 're damned good workers , mr butler said we 're good floor moppers we 're good launderers we take care of the patients and we 're very sad we 're moaning
memphis , dec 5 federal express has been good to bill satterlee now mr satterlee , a pilot with the overnight delivery company for 16 years who earns as much as 200 , 000 a year , intends to return the favor after mr satterlee , 51 , had triplebypass heart surgery last year , federal express , instead of putting him on disability , gave him a job training other pilots until he was well enough to return to the cockpit the company also picked up the tab for about 10 , 000 in expenses for tests to recertify him for flying so when the leaders of the air line pilots association organized a job action late last month intended to disrupt delivery of packages and letters in the midst of the busy christmas season , mr satterlee like hundreds of other pilots at federal express who are not union members did not just refuse to join in instead , he volunteered to fly extra overtime the pilots union s slowdown , aimed at forcing management to sign a contract offering higher pay , better retirement benefits and improved job security , could backfire rather than winning converts to labor s cause in this metropolitan area of roughly a million people where unions have rarely made significant inroads , it has led most employees to embrace the company even more tightly last week , several thousand employees rallied in downtown memphis to express their support for the company , which employs 24 , 000 people at its headquarters and primary hub here and a group saying it represented a vast majority of the 110 , 000 federal express employees worldwide took out fullpage advertisements in several newspapers to tell customers that the pilots union did not enjoy widespread backing alpa is misjudging the culture here , said david sanders , the chairman of a rival group that is seeking to replace the national union with a local independent union they have really dug themselves in a hole a third group of pilots wants no union at all the pilots union s action highlights the quandary facing the american labor movement these days as it seeks to recover from years of retreat by adopting a more militant edge even as john sweeney , the new president of the aflcio , vowed recently to make inroads outside of labor s traditional bastions of strength in heavy industry and among public employees , leaders of the united automobile workers conceded on dec 3 that their 18month strike against caterpillar inc , based in peoria , ill , had failed and sent the remaining strikers back to work and the pilots union , which has represented federal express s 2 , 900 pilots since 1993 but receives dues from just over half of them , faces even more daunting challenges federal express s other workers are not organized , and there appears to be little sympathy for the affluent pilots , who earn an average of 128 , 000 a year many employees are part time and have relatively low pay , and lots of others started that way this is a homegrown company , said doris waller , who has risen in her 12 years with federal express from a parttime package sorter to a fulltime crew travel auditor , and it s disheartening when you 've always been a team and a family , and you have a group who s trying to wreck it still , there is an outside chance that the organized pilots will disrupt operations enough during the christmas rush , when the number of packages exceeds three million a day , to persuade federal express to present a better offer that the union could hold up as a breakthrough federal express , which was founded 22 years ago by fred smith probably memphis s secondfavorite son after elvis presley is by far the largest private employer in town let me put it this way , said john threadgill , a spokesman for the local chamber of commerce when fedex sneezes , memphis gets a cold indeed , federal express is so closely identified with the city and its thriving local economy that few employees can imagine supporting anything that might damage the company s reputation for reliable service i do n't see how my future is being secured by scaring business away , said fred olmstead , a pilot who joined the carrier in 1989 after he lost his job at eastern air lines and mr satterlee warned that the air line pilots association was threatening to wreck the confidence of the customer he said , that s the core of the company those types of views underscore the risk for the union , which enjoys most of its strength outside federal express s home base here if it escalates its confrontation with the company in hopes of putting a serious dent in the company s business , it might alienate so many pilots that it could lose the right to bargain at all with federal express but if it backs away from the fight without gaining much , it would be yet another setback for labor in its bid to overcome the stagnant wages and shrinking benefits that have hit most workers in recent years union leaders said they recognized they were walking a fine line we 're trying to take a stand in a measured and calculated way to get the attention of management , said david webb , a member of the union s strategic preparedness committee
it is a world blissfully ignorant of cyberspace , telecommuters , pentiums and infotainment it is a realm apparently so technologically indifferent that it concedes the existence of neither technophobes nor technophiles this is no postindustrial commune we 're talking about , but the vocabulary of the two leading wordprocessing programs the microsoft corporation s word and novell inc s wordperfect a test of the spellcheckers offered by these two hightech companies shows an occasionally lowtech lexicon that includes none of the italicized words in the preceding paragraph many other common computerage terms can baffle these programs the spellchecker in microsoft word version 60 , for example , will advise changing trackball to traceable , downgrading gigabytes to mere gigabits and demoting an infonaut to an infant and internet \? microsoft word suggests trying interment but that is partly because word 60 has been around since october 1993 , before the internet became a household word wordperfect version 61 , released in november , has not only heard of the internet it even knows to capitalize it yet wordperfect , too , can seem behind the technological times its spellchecker treats interactivity as a misbegotten form of underactivity and insists that digerati be either daggered or dogeared and while wordperfect knows its megabytes and gigabytes , it seems so overwhelmed by the trillions and trillions in terabytes that it suggests thereabouts will do by historic standards , today s spellcheckers have only minor peccadilloes , like the treatment of peccadilloes word recommends that it include the second e wordperfect accepts it with or without in their earliest incarnations , in the late 1970 s , spellcheckers barely worked at all and were available only as an option for wordprocessing software because the computer disks of the day were too small to hold dictionaries , these early programs basically did what anyone without a dictionary does when it comes to spelling guessed by the early 1980 s , spellcheckers began to consult their own dictionaries and by 1985 , they had become an integral part of wordprocessing programs even today , as technology and terminology race forward , keeping on top of technospeak remains a delicate blend of science and art according to alan hansen , manager of what novell calls its linguistic integration group , the company has been working to make the process less anecdotal and more scientific in search of new terms , novell s linguists have always relied on suggestions from customers but now they also use computers to analyze the frequency of words appearing in a broad variety of texts novell updates its dictionary every year or so , and as mr hansen pointed out in our society , a year is a long time terms come and go in a year current spellcheckers handle faxes , motherboards and hypertext with aplomb an edition of wordperfect from late 1990 had never heard of them for people who want to increase the word power of the current versions , the vocabularies of both word and wordperfect are easy to customize and expand in computer argot , that makes the programs scalable a term that both spellcheckers recognize word , however , recommends that it be spelled scaleable chart digital , but not computer literate lists some terms and the interpretation or misinterpretation of the two leading programs' spell checkers
ussuri reserve , russia fueled by economic chaos and wideopen borders , a new generation of poachers has chased the siberian tiger and many less renowned animals nearly to extinction in the lush cedar forests here russians in this pacific coast region 6 , 000 miles from moscow where unemployment is high and the minimum monthly wage is little more than 20 have in the last three years begun to flood nearby asian markets with animal parts sought by hundreds of millions of chinese , japanese and koreans for use in traditional medicines and the parts are used in some untraditional ways , too four sex glands of the male kabarga , a type of gazelle , will trade in seoul these days evenly for a new jeep cherokee twenty years ago , local conservation experts say , they fetched two bottles of vodka although many animals are valuable , none are more coveted than the world s largest cat , the siberian tiger , whose skin , bones , eyes , whiskers , teeth and internal and sexual organs are in continual demand for everything from skin cures to tooth medicine the poaching , often by hunters using automatic weapons and nightvision devices , has begun to alter the fragile balance of nature in the forests of the russian far east not just the tiger , but a whole range of wildlife has fallen prey to the insatiable demands of the asian medical market , from ginseng , which grows here , to the rare japanese crane and musk deer , both of which are rapidly disappearing black marketeers peddle the gallbladders of endangered asiatic black bears in the lobby of the hotel vladivostok for 10 a gram it is possible to buy a healing plaster containing tiger bones at the airport on the way out of town you ca n't look at the tiger alone , said aleksandr s gruzdyev , an inspector who heads a new antipoaching task force set up in vladivostok by the russian government but paid for by international conservation organizations the area where he lives is shrinking every year and that s due to development , and hunting of other animals and pollution all these things interact , and none of them can be easily separated from any other under communism , russia s borders were emphatically shut , guns were forbidden and international commerce was almost impossible all that has changed with a vengeance since 1991 with open borders , russians are now well aware of how eager many asians are to get hold of ingredients they consider essential to maintaining and improving health amur , or siberian , tigers once roamed broadly from the pacific to the edge of lake baikal but as development and human habitation pushed east , the number of tigers shrank steadily now they live only in the forests north of vladivostok ten years ago , scientists say , there were about 500 siberian tigers in the pacific coast regions of primorsky and khabarovsk now , with a dead tiger worth as much as 25 , 000 on the open market , most think there are fewer than half that number much of the poaching of other animals does not even have anything to do with making money wild boar , deer and reindeer are all hunted avidly and usually illegally by people who know that a few such animals can keep their families fed through the long winter but those animals are what tigers eat , too , and the fewer there are of them the farther each animal has to roam for its prey sometimes hundreds of miles the plenitude of wildlife here makes it hard for some hunters to take warnings seriously russia has more brown bears and endangered black bears than the rest of the world , and 8 of the world s 12 crane species it is a vital habitat for not just for the siberian tiger and amur leopard , but also for the musk deer and the saiga antelope , whose horns are ground into a powder to reduce fevers the russian government , with enormous aid from international groups like the world wildlife fund , the tiger trust in britain and the hornocker wildlife research institute in idaho , has established 22 tiger preservation sites in this area here , in the 110 , 000acre ussuri reserve , officials have forbidden further road building , construction of houses and logging they have even dismantled a small town that sat in the middle of territory that was favored by tigers but none of that prevented poachers from killing at least 65 tigers in this area last year a quarter of all those believed to be alive scientists and environmentalists here say that if the pace does not slow quickly , the tiger could disappear from the wild within a couple of years poaching has always been a way of life in russia , said vladimir k abramov , the scientific director of the ussuri reserve it s not easy to explain to people who have lived here their whole lives why it s bad or what the consequences might be laws alone will not be enough to stop the poaching timber and other goods including those smuggled illegally are now shipped from private docks directly to korea middlemen hire hunters and arrange for the parts to be spirited out of the country perhaps most important , guns are now easy to buy at stores like one called sniper , which sell all the necessities to the eager hunter in vladivostok punishments for those people who are caught are still minimal so far this year , according to official statistics , 119 people have been caught hunting illegally in primorsky , 46 caught fishing illegally and 30 caught cutting timber where they were not allowed nobody was sentenced to jail , and the total of all fines for all those caught , 40 million rubles or about 9 , 000 , is less than the cost of a few endangered black bears , which are often killed and left in the wild with only their gallbladders missing the laws , even new ones intended to curb poaching , are so weak that rangers rarely have cars and are not even permitted to carry weapons to protect themselves last winter mr gruzdyev , the task force leader , was hospitalized when a poacher he caught ran him down with a truck he considered himself lucky to have survived now the region is packed with wolves , which the tigers had always kept at bay they have picked the area clean of deer , reindeer and many of the boar , and because they are now without prey , they are spreading out to seek new territory thanks to heavy lobbying and millions of dollars from western governments and environmental groups , thousands of miles of the pacific territories may soon be designated as offlimits to development but the pressure to cut the timber and mine the fields has never been fiercer any conservation effort like this is always really about people management , said dale g miquelle , an american tiger researcher who has spent more than three years here and managing people is tough you can win a whole series of victories and one vital setback will ruin you but we have not been defeated yet and if i thought we could n't win i would n't be here photo russian antipoaching officers , holding a seized siberian tiger pelt , are

jon s corzine , the chairman and senior partner of goldman , sachs company , buoyed by his investment banking firm s sharply rebounding profit , is preparing wall street s most famous partnership for the possibility of a sale in 1996 in a joint interview , mr corzine and henry m paulson jr , the firm s vice chairman and chief operating officer , stepped delicately around the question of whether goldman would put itself up for sale but showing increasing attention to the firm s public image , they acknowledged that recent actions had been intended to broaden the 127yearold firm s room for maneuver they said the actions should make it significantly easier to build a consensus within goldman , sachs for any prospective sale , which , while complicated to arrange , would presumably provide a windfall to the partners the two executives particularly cited their work to reorganize , and enlarge , the firm s top management committees to include as many as 37 partners , from 9 previously we want , and believe we needed , greater participation by a broader number of people , mr corzine said he also spoke of a need to create better dialogue between top management and the firm s 174 partners and more than 7 , 000 staff members goldman s strong 1995 profit would certainly help any prospective sale goldman officials generally confirmed that as a partnership , the firm earned 437 million before taxes in its fiscal fourth quarter , which ended on nov 30 , and 137 billion before taxes for the full year the year s results were on target with wall street analysts' expectations the results were much better than in the 1994 fiscal year , when the firm had a loss of 41 million for the fourth quarter , and an annual profit before taxes of 508 million the most exciting thing about 1995 was the discipline and character of the firm after a difficult 1994 , mr corzine said , adding that it had the chance to work on a number of privatizations , including pechiney , the french industrial group those transactions including a recent public offering for the indonesian state telecommunications company , as well a huge list of deals on behalf of american companies give a flavor of how broadbased goldman , sachs s business had become , mr corzine said mr paulson also drew attention to goldman s strong showing in advising on mergers and acquisitions , adding that for him the highlight is how the trading businesses have bounced back , particularly in the second half , in fixedincome and foreignexchange trading , and of course in equity trading the company has also increased its assetmanagement business , he said , citing as an example its recent agreement to manage money for nenpuku , a japanese public pension fund while the partnership debates the benefit of a prospective sale , both mr corzine and mr paulson said goldman had always had access to the capital it needed none of us can find a time when we were precluded from what we wanted to do because of capital , he added roy c smith , a retired goldman , sachs partner who is now a professor of finance at the stern school of business of new york university , said going public is something that the firm does consider periodically because it must now when market conditions are good , it has a duty to look at the question if goldman does decide to put itself up for sale , it is likely to seek a significant premium over its book value , which analysts estimate close to 5 billion donaldson , lufkin jenrette , another wall street brokerage and a subsidiary of equitable life assurance , recently sold 20 percent of its shares at about 15 times book value , and analysts speculated yesterday that goldman , should it sell , would seek a price closer to twice its book value it is nine years since goldman last debated the issue of putting itself on the block mr corzine , who took over the running of the firm with mr paulson in september 1994 , was a member of the firm s management committee in 1986 , when that committee voted to take the firm public but because of dissent among the partners , the proposals never left the drawing board photo jon s corzine , the chairman and senior partner of goldman , sachs \( ed quinn for the new york times \)
from seedy motel to seedy motel , a muscular man in his 30 s and a lanky teenager toting a stuffed tiger have crossed the country in the last two months , running through their money at amusement parks and always staying just one step ahead of the police while their disparate ages raised eyebrows among hotel clerks , the police had a further reason for tracking them to mississippi and california and onward he was a gym teacher at a manhattan junior high school , she was his ninthgrade student and he has been charged with kidnapping her although school authorities had known of their relationship since january and had been searching in vain for the couple for two months , they and the police finally went public with the case yesterday after losing their trail in las vegas late last month they asked for help from anyone who had seen the 33yearold teacher , glenn harris , and his 15yearold companion , whom they identified only as christina the girl , who had been a student at the creative learning community , an alternative junior high school on madison avenue at east 106th street , apparently went off with her teacher voluntarily , but mr harris nonetheless faces a felony charge of kidnapping because of the girl s age this is a crime , and wherever we feel there s a danger to a child , we 're going to react aggressively , said edward f stancik , the special commissioner of investigation for new york s schools only a parent can give consent to an adult removing a 15yearold child sometimes , it works out ok in the movies , but in real life it s a pretty dangerous situation , said mr stancik , who is overseeing the search what if her attitude toward the relationship changes somewhere along the line \? here s a guy who gave up his job , who s on the run you do n't know how he s going to react to that in the meantime , the girl s mother and grandmother were left in upper manhattan to wait for word from her that so far has not come and at the school , some teachers complained that the school administration was lax in dealing with the budding relationship the administration has a responsibility for the safety of the students , said one teacher there , who spoke on the condition of anonymity appropriate measures were not taken the police said that word of the lolitalike relationship between mr harris , a firstyear teacher and former police officer , and the girl first surfaced among teachers and students as early as october but no formal complaint was lodged by the school until january , and even then , school investigators could obtain no proof of an illicit romance mr harris , meanwhile , transferred to a different school , the landmark high school , for unrelated reasons , mr stancik said , and he continued to teach evidence of the romance came on march 7 , when the girl s mother intercepted a letter that her daughter had sent to mr harris the letter , which officials said showed clearly that the two were lovers , had been returned for insufficient postage but by the time investigators arrived , the couple had fled following a paper trail that included bank withdrawals and mr harris s driver s license renewal , investigators tracked the two to washington , then alabama , georgia , texas , california and finally nevada along the way , the pair tried to obtain a bogus identification and social security number for the girl to allow them to marry , the police said on april 10 , they spent the day at the great america amusement park in santa clara , calif , where they impressed leeann ableidinger , the desk clerk at the nearby casa clara 3285 a night for a clean room as a happy couple despite their age difference they looked like they were good people , she said she had shoulderlength , curly hair he was short but wellbuilt , muscular i do n't blame her for falling in love with him they paid cash with a 100 bill ms ableidinger s mother , sylvia , said , maybe they 're just meant for each other mr stancik said that mr harris had drained his bank account to the last penny when the two were in las vegas , having gone through thousands of dollars in savings since fleeing new york the police said the man and girl are both 5 feet 6 inches tall mr harris weighs about 155 pounds and the girl 105 in recent weeks , the police have distributed pictures of the girl around the school and near mr harris s home in brooklyn her picture has also been broadcast on local television stations and has been distributed by the associated press in addition , the police have established a special telephone line \( 212 \) 5101500 for anyone with knowledge of their whereabouts it was in santa clara that their pursuers came closest to catching mr harris and the girl they arrived at the casa clara motel just three hours after the two had left , and mr stancik said that his officers missed them at great america by only an hour it was heartbreaking , he said sometimes you get them , sometimes you do n't it s hard especially for this little office this is the farthest we 've ever had to go to bring a school official to justice the federal bureau of investigation and local police departments around the country have also been helping in the search , but since midapril the trail appears to have gone cold we 're hoping anyone who cares about either one of them should want to see this resolved quickly and safely , mr stancik said the girl s friends , however , did not sound especially worried about her wellbeing , although they said they missed her a lot of people in the class just think they ran away together , said takiyah tinsley , 14 they thought they were going out delia nieves , a neighbor of the girl s grandmother , said , she used to talk about him , saying , 'he s so nice' the next thing i know , she left with him it s very unfair what she did the mother is suffering a lot attempts to reach the girl s mother yesterday were unsuccessful the girl was thinking 'i'm young , i'm 15 and i'm trapped in my home' i 'd think any man that could get me out would be attractive , ms nieves said the creative learning community , an alternative school for underperforming or highrisk children , encourages friendships between teachers and students , teachers said , but it was clear to many of them that mr harris , who was fresh out of graduate school , was crossing the bounds of propriety a teacher , who spoke on condition of anonymity yesterday , said the staff had noticed mr harris s inappropriate behavior toward the girl and other students from the beginning of the school year he roughhoused with the boys , they said , and was seen talking alone with the girl with the classroom door closed , strolling with her in central park and taking her out for a birthday dinner before coming to the school to teach english , social studies and physical education , mr harris worked as a correction officer and served for less than a year with the new york city police department he resigned in 1988 because of what officials said were attitude problems as a new teacher he was fingerprinted and checked for a criminal record , but school officials said he had none after transferring to landmark high school for the spring semester , mr harris began missing more and more classes , officials said he was dismissed after disappearing on march 9 schools chancellor ramon c cortines said that studentteacher romances invariably are inappropriate , unacceptable and destructive they undermine the fundamental trust needed between students and teachers although mr harris s actions toward students raised some suspicions , other colleagues and students describe him as attractive and trustworthy he was not a guy you 'd watch out for , a school official said this is a guy everybody trusted a neighbor of mr harris , desire core , said mr harris had told her he enjoyed his job but was a little scared about the younger girls' having a crush on him she added , we talked about that being normal for young girls with him being a goodlooking older man and a teacher photo glenn harris \( pg b1 \) chronology map itinerary crosscountry flight the path of

republicans could have a lot of fun with last saturday s democratic fundraiser at steven spielberg s home , where hollywood couples paid 50 , 000 each to dine with bill and hillary clinton , listen to robin williams s shtick and chow down on populist vittles like fried chicken what more perverse weekend to schedule such an event than the one in which the president ended his 100day silence to reemerge as the champion of the middle class \? awkward as this symbolism was , even more embarrassing is how little the democrats have to show for their ostentatious synergy with the most powerful and imaginative minds in the popculture industry bill clinton may draw campaign checks from the dreamworks moguls , but it is the gop that cannily milks the machinery of the mass media to pound out its message we 're tin cans and string by comparison , said senator christopher dodd in a conversation last month shortly after he and some democratic colleagues emerged shellshocked from a private multimedia presentation of the gop s communications prowess when the republican party wants to speak , it not only exploits the electronic megaphones of blast faxes , the internet and the many limbaugh dittoheads of talk radio , but also its own weekly tv series , rising tide , its own daily today show \( pat robertson s allegedly nonpartisan 700 club \) and its own unofficial 24houraday tv network , net do n't snicker at gop tv slick and well financed , it will outlast cbs s primetime schedule rising tide , which is now seen on the wor superstation and has a potential of 55 million viewers , is a fauxnews talk show that is less irritating than some of its sunday morning counterparts the anchor and managing editor is none other than the republican chairman , ol' haley barbour , whose unflappable folksiness suggests dan rather on prozac the easylistening guests include the house s new budget czar , john kasich , who jokes that elvis is in fact a republican , and majority whip tom delay , who raises questions like what is chelsea going to ask president clinton when she ca n't buy a house because she s spending 84 percent of her income to pay off his joyride \? net which now refers to itself as the political news talk network , not national empowerment television is more polished than cspan and is pitched to the same newsjunkie audience its propaganda is subtle in one recent news segment , the only democratic congressmen seen complaining about the contract with america were minorities presumably representing special interests in an episode of the progress report , cohost newt gingrich bantered about the internet with the librarian of congress , james billington since their conversation was both informative and nonideological and since the professorial mr billington paid tribute to the speaker the show made the most partisan of politicians look presidentially above the fray the democrats' inability to match such republican theatrics in the video arena has been obvious since the healthcare fiasco , when harry and louise ruled even though the influential hollywood agent michael ovitz offered to lend top executives to create a counterattack , the white house never got its act together jay rockefeller , the west virginia senator whose frustration mounted during the healthcare wars , is now in charge of the democrats' effort to catch up in an interview , he noted that tom daschle , the minority leader , who gave him the assignment , recognized that we were 8 to 1 behind the republicans in message delivery as mr rockefeller talked of methodical longrange plans involving hollywood and silicon valley input , he could point to one early success the schoollunch media event that threw the republicans on the defensive for the last three weeks of the first 100 days but as congress went into recess and the president headed toward his fatcat dinner last weekend , the democrats were still flogging schoollunch cutbacks in the televised response that senator daschle and the house minority leader , richard gephardt , delivered on friday \( from a classroom no less \) after mr gingrich s address the medium may not be the entire message in politics , but how far can the democrats get as long as they have a shortage of both \?
the field for the 500 , 000 woodward stakes , which had already lost thunder gulch , the winner of the kentucky derby , was further reduced yesterday when concern was withdrawn and the number of starters shrank to the favorite cigar plus maybe four other horses concern , who won the breeders' cup classic last year , was withdrawn by his trainer , dick small , after a dull workout at his home base in maryland he had a kind of hohum work , small said it was ok , but it was n't sparkling he went half a mile in 50 seconds , but then came up empty the second half we got him in 1 44 , maybe 1 45 for any other horse , it would have been all right but going up to belmont park with anything less than his best to face those horses , it would n't be right small said that after the workout , concern underwent tests for pulmonary bleeding , but showed none we 're trying to puzzle out what the problem is , he said

washington , oct 31 with one clean swipe just before midnight friday , the democratic minority in the senate knocked out of the big budget bill many of the harshest policies involving welfare no longer would the bill force families off welfare after they had been on relief for five years no longer would it allow states to deny welfare benefits to unwed mothers younger than 18 or to children born into families already on welfare no longer would the bill provide a bonus to states if their rate of outofwedlock births fell the democrats did not succeed because they mustered a majority vote for their position the 46 democratic senators voted to delete the provisions in question , while the 53 republicans voted to retain them but because of an arcane procedure known as the byrd rule the senate s use of the rule raises some question about whether comprehensive welfare legislation , approved by both houses and favored in some form by president clinton , can become law this year under this senate rule , named for its author , senator robert c byrd , democrat of west virginia , provisions in budget bill can be successfully challenged on a point of order if they produce no change in revenue or spending or if such changes are merely incidental to the fiscal items it takes a threefifths majority , or 60 votes if all senators are present , to waive the rule the rule does not apply directly to the house , whose budget bill clamps down more on the poor than does the senate s but it will apply to any matter approved by a conference committee before the senate so the rule is likely to complicate the work of the conference committee that this week is beginning to try to work out the differences between budget bills approved last week by the senate and the house these are among the elements of the house bill , but not the senate bill , that may not meet the test of the byrd rule abolition of the commerce department merger of the agency for international development , the united states information agency and the arms control and disarmament agency into the state department repeal of federal nursing home standards overturning new government regulations on livestock grazing on federal land tightening of the united states embargo on cuba revision of the endangered species act none of these go to the heart of the budget measure , which is supposed to balance the budget in seven years , cut the taxes of middle and upperincome taxpayers and shift control of most social programs from the federal government to the states but many are important to conservative republicans in the house , where freshmen have no experience with the strange ways of the senate the party leaders may have to twist a good many arms to get these conservatives to vote for the compromise measure that comes out of the conference without these provisions the rule also complicates the politics of welfare legislation , which is going through congress along two separate tracks the senate and house have passed separate welfare bills almost identical to the welfare provisions in the budget bills the notion of overhauling welfare is popular politically , and president clinton has said he would sign a bill with welfare measures like those in the senate bill the republicans who control congress decided to include the welfare provisions in the budget bill so they could blame mr clinton for vetoing the popular legislation if , as is almost certain to happen , he vetoes the budget bill senator bob dole of kansas , the republican leader , said he was reluctant , as a political matter , to give the president the opportunity to sign the former and veto the latter then there is the question of a senate filibuster under the rules , budget bills cannot be filibustered but a separate welfare bill could be the welfare bill was approved in the senate last month by an overwhelming 87to12 vote but many democrats who voted for it might jump ship if they thought they could sustain a filibuster senator daniel patrick moynihan , democrat of new york , the leading opponent of the welfare measure in the senate , said tonight that he thought most democrats who voted for the measure last month would join a filibuster if president clinton drops the word senator byrd , who was the democratic leader from 1977 until 1989 and who sees himself as the guardian of the prerogatives of the senate , first got his budget rule approved by the senate in 1985 it cannot be changed without a threefifths majority in the senate the rule was meant to counter the fact that under law only 20 hours of debate are permitted on the huge budget measures known as reconciliation bills before the byrd rule was imposed , dozens of extraneous elements often managed to sneak into such bills without debate or the knowledge of many senators
four stars are easier to get than to keep imagine the pressure everyone wants a reservation everyone expects perfection the smallest error is rarely overlooked given the situation , it must be tempting to play it safe and avoid change but this would never work an establishment that does not develop should not retain its starry status very long fortunately for them , most restaurants grow into their stars not le bernardin at the ripe old age of three months , it had all four stars bestowed upon it the restaurant has been in the spotlight ever since in 1986 , the brotherandsister team of gilbert and maguy le coze moved from paris to new york , and mr le coze s cooking changed american dining his style , impeccably fresh fish cooked with respect and simplicity , was soon so widely copied that people forgot who had invented it that did not seem to bother mr le coze , who continued to turn out the most daring seafood in the city but as other restaurants followed the le cozes' lead , buying better fish and cooking it in more interesting ways , le bernardin itself was maturing the dining room caught up with the kitchen , and le bernardin turned into new york s most grownup dining experience most of the problems that plague other great establishments were solved here there were no rude reservations takers , no endless waits for tables , no overcrowding in the dining room the waiters knew their jobs and kept their distance dinners were appropriately paced when you reserved a table at le bernardin , you could count on being seated promptly , served beautifully and fed fabulously then last summer , mr le coze died unexpectedly at 48 when the shock wore off and the mourning ended , the wondering began what would happen to the restaurant \? those who predicted the decline of le bernardin did not reckon with miss le coze , who had been devoting herself to their other restaurants in coral gables , fla , and atlanta she dropped everything , returned to new york and with eric ripert , a talented 29yearold who has been the chef at le bernardin for nearly four years , gave the restaurant an infusion of energy the dining room , always notable for its comfortable clubiness , suddenly seems prettier and less ponderous flowers are everywhere , giving the masculine teaklined room a lighter feeling meanwhile , mr ripert seems to be having wonderful fun in the kitchen the key to le bernardin s food has always been that it allows each fish to express its personality other restaurants use fish interchangeably , substituting one for the other as the market dictates at le bernardin , the flavor of each fish is coaxed forward , and eating becomes an exciting sensory experience if you think all raw fish tastes the same , take a bite of the black bass ceviche topped with a confetti of coriander , mint , jalapenos and diced tomatoes then follow it with one of tuna carpaccio , a tender circle dotted with lime peel the one is clean and freshtasting , the other so soft it is like velvet in the mouth versions of each have been on the menu since the restaurant opened , but there are new discoveries here try the mackerel , a fish with real character , in a cool marinade of aged sherry vinegar , onions and carrots it tastes a little like herring , only better each dish offers its own surprise thinly sliced scallops , lightly cooked and served with a salad topped with asparagus and grilled porcini mushrooms , are so crisp and delicate they could pass as just another vegetable but when mr ripert wraps a single scallop into a cabbage leaf , adds some foie gras and truffles , and steams the entire package , the scallop becomes so soft and tender it turns into a sort of pate of the sea do n't miss it do n't miss the spanish mackerel tartar , either the fish is chopped and piled into a small caviartopped tower surrounded by dots of sauce gribiche who could resist it \? other impressive starters are the deeply flavored fish soup and the extraordinarily delicious fricassee of shellfish with sweet and delicate mussels , clams and oysters and once there was a fragrant broth , reduced almost to a syrup , with a raft of foie gras , chunks of black truffle and slices of lobster luxury in a bowl impressive as the appetizers are , it is the main courses i most admire each fish has been stripped to its basic elements and dressed up to emphasize them a fat chunk of cod is cooked until the outside is crisp and brown and the inside white and creamy , then is served on green beans , tomatoes and tiny potatoes presented in a pungent vinaigrette alive with the strong flavor of vinegar and the brightness of olives , this superbly simple dish is fresh and vibrant halibut , a delicate fish , is simply poached in a saffron bouillon skate is treated with tenderness too , roasted , spiced and served in a heady perfumed broth swordfish , on the other hand , the mild meat of the sea , is marinated in coconut and served in a light , creamy curry sauce few fish would be happy with this treatment , but swordfish revels in all that spice and butter
two and a half years after an enormous car bomb tore open the world trade center and exposed america s vulnerability to terrorists , the case seems solved but not fathomed like an intricately tangled conan doyle mystery , it continues to yield its intriguing secrets , but its deepest corners remain obscure the arrest last week of a new suspect has provided fresh details about the plot s final days and hours , but little new insight the suspect , eyad ismail , is accused of driving a van with 1 , 200 pounds of explosives into the trade center in lower manhattan on feb 26 , 1993 still , neither mr ismail s arrest , nor the trial last year of four other suspects , with its vast array of exhibits and testimony on the mechanics of the plot , nor extensive inquiries by federal and international investigators , has answered the case s most fundamental questions who was behind the conspiracy \? who put up 8 , 500 to bankroll it \? and why was it carried out \? investigators say there is an urgency to these questions , not only to close the trade center case , but also to understand the scope and rationale of the terrorist threat as the nation prepares for major events pope john paul ii s visit to the united states and the united nations' 50thanniversary events this fall and the olympics in atlanta next year that could be magnets for terrorists the task is daunting , but hardly hopeless in the past year , and especially since february , when ramzi ahmed yousef , the 28yearold suspected mastermind of the plot , was captured in pakistan and returned to new york for a pending trial , some pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place investigators say a contextual picture , while far from complete , is beginning to emerge from mr yousef s activities in new york , the philippines , pakistan and elsewhere the picture suggests a loosely organized conspiracy with amateur terrorists recruited and guided by mr yousef , a disciplined and educated loner of many aliases and languages who has moved in and out of countries with the ease of a shadow officials describe pragmatic approach mr yousef is regarded by investigators as a highly trained professional terrorist , in contrast with those he recruits he has entered countries with cash and false papers , swiftly assembled secret groups , controlled their money , provided them with expertise and organizational skills and made all their major decisions about targets , timing and methods as well as the roles of his followers , the authorities say although mr yousef publicly espoused the palestinian cause recently , in his recruiting he apparently exploited any passions that moved his followers antiamericanism , islamic fundamentalism or any other nationalist , religious or ideological themes that struck home his terrorist signature , investigators say , was a flexible , ad hoc approach to creating a terrorist cell out of people who cared about a cause but knew nothing about terrorism his followers , in turn , appear to have operated out of dingy rooms , using money and bomb manuals they were given and crude explosive material mixed in trash cans or kitchen sinks when their operations were over , they were left to scramble for themselves or take the consequences , while the elusive mr yousef slipped away , moving on to another destination , another plot investigators say the larger montage also shows that the new york bombing was just one of several terrorist plots directed by mr yousef these include the bombing of a jetliner flying from the philippines to japan last december and failed schemes earlier this year to assassinate the pope and blow up an american jetliner in manila and to blow up two american jumbo jets simultaneously over hong kong this portrait of a terrorist , the investigators say , is based on clues and connections telephone records , fingerprints , airline tickets , computer notes left behind by fugitives on the run and statements by suspects as well as on intelligence reports about islamic radical groups in the middle east and asia and on the global travel and secret activities and contacts of mr yousef when the trade center bombing trial ended in march 1994 , some investigators said they believed that mr yousef had been working for iraqi intelligence because the iraqis had the best motive revenge for american bombings of baghdad during the persian gulf war and mr yousef had been traveling on an iraqi passport when he arrived in the united states in 1992 , six months before the bombing other reports said he might have been sponsored by iran , syria or libya but since then , no evidence has emerged to show that mr yousef was backed by or acting on behalf of any foreign government investigators have not ruled that out , but some say radical muslims or palestinians could be responsible given mr yousef s ability to travel the world as a terrorist and fugitive with relative ease , given his access to money and highquality false passports , and given his extensive contacts throughout the middle east and other parts of the world , the investigators said it seemed unlikely that he had acted on his own suspect fought with afghan rebels
washington , dec 19 nudged along by a slowing economy and nervous financial markets , the federal reserve lowered a key interest rate today by a quarter of a point the cut in shortterm rates , which the federal reserve said was justified because of the lack of any threat of inflation , allowed the stock and bond markets to regain some of their big losses on monday but it left considerable uncertainty about whether wall street would be cheered by president clinton s agreement with republican congressional leaders this afternoon to come up with a framework for a budget accord that would be concluded by the end of the year the announcement at the white house came after the markets closed the federal reserve action , trimming to 55 percent the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight , marked the first time in five months that the nation s central bank has yielded to the perception in financial markets that interest rates were too high page d1 but in a quirk of the interplay among the federal reserve , the markets and the budget negotiators , the small cut in interest rates and the resulting 3468point increase in the dow jones industrial average may actually ease some of the pressure for a quick compromise on a balanced budget the sharp drop in the financial markets on monday provoked considerable fingerpointing in washington this morning fear spread among politicians in both parties that they might be blamed for reversing the huge runup in the stock and bond markets over the year but it was unclear how big a role those fears played in the agreement reached this afternoon among president clinton , house speaker newt gingrich and senator bob dole , the majority leader , to try once again to settle their differences this time by the end of next week a hundredpoint drop is not big enough to force anyone to make concessions they view as unwise , one senior administration official said today but it certainly is big enough to get your attention consumers are likely to derive only limited benefits from today s cut the federal reserve left unchanged at 525 percent the discount rate , which it charges banks for shortterm loans only one bank , banc one of columbus , ohio , responded to the fed s action today by cutting its prime lending rate , which helps determine the rate on a variety of consumer and small business loans others may follow soon markets also drove down longerterm rates that influence the cost of home mortgages , but they remained above levels prevailing earlier this month and any savings to consumers would be modest in washington , though , symbolism is often more important than substance , and the symbol of a rate cut at a time of a government shutdown and a possible budget deal is a particularly strong one the fed s chairman , alan greenspan , has waded into the middle of the balancedbudget debate several times , predicting to congress that a balanced budget accord would prompt the markets to cut longterm rates even further several analysts viewed the fed s rate cut as a carrot dangled in front of white house and congressional leaders as the nation moved into a critical election year to no one s surprise , mr greenspan mentioned none of the political maneuvering on the budget in his terse statement announcing the fed s cut in rates since the last easing of monetary policy in july , he said , inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated , and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions while the federal reserve was concerned about some indicators of a slowing economy weaker retail and auto sales , an erratic housing market and some signs that the worldwide demand for semiconductors is winding down after a frenetic year it clearly does not view a recession as a real danger economic growth , in fact , was not even mentioned in mr greenspan s statement what gave the fed a bit of room to operate was the low inflation rate curbing inflation is the fed s chief mission , and with the consumer price index rising only 26 percent so far this year , the ratesetting federal open market committee could initiate a modest reduction without any fear of adding any fuel to the inflationary embers no sooner had the fed acted today than the secretary of the treasury , robert e rubin , declared that the economy was in fine shape we believe that the current expansion has considerable room to run , mr rubin said in a statement that was released jointly with joseph e stiglitz , the chairman of the white house council of economic advisers but privately , mr rubin has been warning administration officials that the markets have built into their current high levels the assumption that a balanced budget deal will be reached and his warning was borne out on monday , when the specter of budget impasse was enough to touch off a correction that seemed simply waiting for an excuse to set it off the unresolved question is whether the slightly better prospect of a budget deal will be enough to sustain the rebound that began this afternoon while the fed s cut buoyed the market , that move is not likely to be repeated soon as one white house aide put it late today next week alan greenspan is n't going to be able to put his finger in the dike the federal reserve will not meet to consider interest rates again until the end of january , and it is unlikely to act any earlier unless economic conditions change markedly so the markets may be riding out the end of the year on the ups and downs of the budget talks , at once reflecting their progress and influencing their outcome it is a situation that leaves many analysts and fund managers uneasy when you look at the effect the budgets they are talking about have on the economy , it does n't amount to a hill of beans , said allen sinai , the chief global economist at lehman brothers the shrinking of the federal budget , mr sinai has calculated , could cause a 20 billion to 25 billion drag on economic growth next year in a 7 trillion economy that rolls ahead as relentlessly as the mississipi river , that is a small drop in the stream one crucial piece of information that the federal reserve is supposed to rely on the latest estimate of growth of the gross domestic product for the third quarter may not have been available to its policy makers today that is because of the continuing shutdown of many corners of the government , including the commerce department , which compiles the statistic it will not be released publicly until a continuing budget resolution is passed , allowing the department to reopen the federal reserve s action today concludes a year in which it received an enormous amount of scrutiny for doing relatively little to interest rates the last change in the federal funds rate came in july , when the fed lowered it by a quarter of a percentage point to 575 percent just as it did today , the fed left the discount rate unchanged at 525 percent seven increases during the 12month period beginning on feb 4 , 1994 , pushed the federal funds rate up to 6 percent from 3 percent the federal reserve board also raised the discount rate in four stages , to 525 percent from 3 percent , beginning on may 17 , 1994

of projects around the city nine years later , new york cares has a mailing list of 13 , 000 volunteers , and its model has been replicated in 26 cities the groups report a total membership of more than 75 , 000 people , most of them 25 to 45 years old , and they have created a national umbrella organization , known as city cares of america , to help form new groups and spread successful ideas experts on philanthropy credit the network with countering a declining interest in volunteerism among young working americans who seem to have neither the time nor the inclination to serve their communities the groups make charity work attractive to such people by simplifying the process of volunteering and removing the concept of guilt if someone wakes up on a saturday morning in a mood to help paint an elementary school , all he or she has to do is show up if he has to head into the office , or chooses to play tennis instead , no one calls to harangue him we do n't put the kind of restraints on people that other places do by saying you have to volunteer two hours a week , said kathy behrens , executive director of new york cares we want you to volunteer when you 're able that is what lured sarah l zimmerman , 34 , to hands on atlanta five years ago , when she moved here to take a job as the associate director of news and information for the southern baptist home mission board i travel a lot for work , and i do n't want to make a commitment to be someplace the third friday of every month , ms zimmerman said while sorting cans of creamed corn and tomato soup at a food bank on a recent evening if i do n't show up for a month , no one s going to think that i let them down with such flexibility , the charity network is tapping the energies of an age group that began to turn away from volunteerism in the late 1970 s and early 80 s , as women joined the work force and young people delayed marriage and family life , said virginia a hodgkinson , vice president for research at independent sector , a washington group that encourages philanthropy and volunteerism usually , if you 're a parent , you have schools and churches and other organizations that start you volunteering , ms hodgkinson said but there really were n't enough vehicles for these young professionals until these groups brought them into the community if we had n't had them , we may really have seen a decline instead , adults between 25 and 44 are the most active volunteers , according to independent sector in 1993 , for instance , 48 percent of american adults 18 or older said they had volunteered at least once in the past year , while 55 percent of those from the ages of 35 to 44 had volunteered while volunteerism among all adults has fallen since its peak around 1990 , when the recession gave charity work more urgency , volunteerism is at higher levels now than it was in 1988 , when independent sector began monitoring it the emergence of the city cares network reflects deep changes in society and the world of charity work the person who volunteered in the past does n't exist anymore , said philip l collyer , executive director of greater d c cares that was an individual who worked in the home and had some extra time everybody is working now outside the home and has far less discretionary time yet they still have a need and a want to support the community most of the groups are growing rapidly , usually with only wordofmouth advertising in the smallest city involved , greenville , sc , membership is growing 10 percent per month hands on greenville , which began only 20 months ago , now has 400 members at hands on atlanta , this month s calendar includes 187 projects , including park cleanups , tutoring programs and soup kitchens the projects are available on every day of the month there were several traditional thanksgiving dinners for the homeless with most scheduled for evenings and weekends for the convenience of working people started in 1989 by a group of 12 friends , hands on atlanta now has a 1 million budget , 17 paid staff members and a mailing list of 11 , 000 volunteers they include people like jill a barker , 30 , an accountant who spends her thursday nights running a mentoring program for sixth graders at paul d west middle school in east point , just south of atlanta last week , her seven charges raced around the library pulling books and magazines off shelves to research articles for a magazine they were producing
klein shifts from sexy to minimal all eyes have been on calvin klein s racy jeans ads , the ones with the teenage models in sexy poses that the designer pulled last month after they were criticized as bordering on child pornography with all that fuss , there has n't been a peep about the designer s quietly elegant eightpage home furnishings foldout , which is appearing in magazines this month art seldom causes the kind of commotion sex does , but the campaign goes beyond bed and bath to encompass an art angle , too both mr klein and his architect , the londonbased john pawson , are fans of the minimalist artist donald judd so when they were looking for a location to shoot the home furnishings ad campaign , they chose marfa , an old cattle town in southwest texas that was the artist s home base for the two decades before his death in 1994 marfa is also the home of the chinati foundation , which was founded by judd in 1976 and it was at chinati , a former army base with renovated barracks and artillery sheds , where the ads were shot calvin has always liked a minimalist approach to art , said barbara deichman , vice president of the calvin klein home division the backgrounds are so spare and light , they made the products stand out but the judd influence was not limited to the backgrounds the artist also designed furniture , including one of the beds used in mr klein s ads and judd s furniture designs , ms deichman said , have been the inspiration for many of mr klein s home designs \( some of these juddinspired designs , as well as authentic judd furniture , are used as props in the new calvin klein shop on madison avenue at 60th street in manhattan \) in return for using the foundation as his shooting location , mr klein became a corporate member \( to the tune of 5 , 000 \) and gave chinati a little more , said its director , marianne stockebrand , who declined to be more specific ms stockebrand said that she had made sure that none of judd s paintings or sculpture appeared in the ads we did n't want to mix it , she said his art should not be decoration for a furniture campaign but another artist s work is the painting hanging over the ad s opening bed shot is by hyongkeun yun , a young korean artist whose work has been exhibited at chinati in fact , the painting s geometry and technique have confused some contemporary art experts who have seen the ad , because the work is so eerily derivative of richard serra and barnett newman gallery partners go their own way the divorce of two contemporaryart superpowers , irving blum and joseph hellman , became final this week and the handwriting is already on the door mr hellman confirmed that after 22 years in business together , he had bought out mr blum and would run the two manhattan galleries , at 20 west 57th street and at 80 greene street in soho , as the joseph hellman galleries mr blum s name has already been removed from the windows and doors neither man would discuss details of their split mr blum said he intended to stay in the art business as a private dealer another bonanza for balletomanes will nureyev be as hot in london as he was last year in new york \? christie s certainly hopes so last january , it auctioned contents of the dancer s sixroom apartment in the dakota on central park west , and the twoday sale on park avenue became a feeding frenzy the sale made 8 million , nearly double its high estimate , as balletomanes slugged it out , outbidding each other until prices rose to astronomical levels \( a pair of the dancer s pink ballet slippers , for example , sold for 9 , 200 his copper bathtub , complete with nozzle and drain , brought a staggering 25 , 000 \) the new york sale was n't without complications it was to have taken place the year before , but nureyev s sister and niece challenged his will , forcing christie s to wait until the court gave it permission to go ahead the same thing happened in paris but now , after a year s delay , christie s will hold nureyev , part ii the contents of the dancer s home at 23 quai voltaire in paris will be sold at christie s in london on nov 20 and 21 as with the new york sale , the proceeds will go to the rudolf nuruyev foundation nureyev had two very different kinds of apartments , said david llewellyn , a director of christie s in london who has been negotiating the sale since the dancer died in 1993 the apartment in the dakota had large rooms and was more theatrical the one in paris , which was decorated by the italian decorator emilio carcano , is perhaps more personal it was also the dancer s primary residence included in the sale , which christie s estimates will bring 3 million , are paintings , furniture , antique dresses and textiles many of nureyev s personal items will be sold , including his silver table service engraved rn and silver picture frames with shots of such dancing companions and friends as margot fonteyn and erik bruhn among the bigticket items are a collection of 19thcentury french academy studies of men , attributed to gericault , which is expected to fetch 60 , 000 to 90 , 000 , and a 17thcentury walnut refectory table with an estimate of 22 , 500 to 30 , 000 christie s is heavily promoting the sale with such merchandise as a 45 black scarf , a 28 black polo shirt and shopping bags at 5 each the items have nureyev s name and the christie s insignia in red blow to barnes s brainstorm richard h glanton , president of the barnes foundation in merion , pa , is angry a ruling on sept 21 by judge stanley r ott of the montgomery county orphans court \( which oversees nonprofit institutions in the county \) forbids the foundation to open its famed art collection to the public six days a week or to charge a 10 admission the foundation s building is to reopen on nov 15 , after having been closed for 32 months for a 12 million face lift mr glanton had hoped he could transform the quirky educational institution , founded by the eccentric collector albert c barnes , into a public museum but the judge said that staying open six days a week goes far beyond the donor s intent as expressed in barnes s will and that an admission charge of 5 would strike a more appropriate balance than one of 10 we 've appealed the decision and are hoping for an answer soon , mr glanton said at knoedler , another departure to say that ann freedman , director of m knoedler company in manhattan , has had a rough time of it lately is something of an understatement the latest development the departure of jeffrey hoffeld , who had been the gallery s associate director for only four months all i can say is that the parting was amicable , mr hoffeld said meanwhile , mr hoffeld is working as a private dealer , and ms freedman said she is interviewing candidates to replace him last fall , lawrence rubin , knoedler s former director , left the gallery after 22 years , followed by donald saff , a consultant who had been hired to be ms freedman s codirector photo a donald judd bed , swathed in calvin klein sheets , under apainting by hyongkeun yun \( todd eberle calvin klein \)
easton , pa , oct 8 tom and evelyn dinan stood in a drizzle outside this city s center square the other day trading names of prospective presidents but like many other voters here , they were more certain of whom they did not want in the white house than whom they wanted certainly not dole , said mrs dinan , who , like her husband , is a democrat who sometimes backs republicans she thrust both hands out as if she were trying to stop senator bob dole , who leads in the polls for the republican nomination i just ca n't stand dole yet the dinans looked just as pained at the mention of president clinton mr dinan , a 73yearold retired construction worker , suggested a thirdparty candidate , as long as it was not ross perot or gen colin l powell finally , he came up with a name i 'll vote for harry truman where s harry truman \? the 75yearold mrs dinan concurred , saying , that s what we need the republican presidential competition is in full tilt in iowa and new hampshire mr clinton has amassed millions for his reelection drive mr perot is hurriedly putting together a third party as he mulls over running himself and general powell , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , is basking in the willheorwo n'the speculation but in this oncethriving industrial city of 27 , 000 in the lehigh valley of eastern pennsylvania , now best known as the home of the former heavyweight boxing champion larry holmes , voters are only beginning to sort through their choices for president in dozens of random interviews , easton residents did not sound particularly thrilled with their options not one voter said he or she had decided to back one of the major republican candidates in fact , most said they were not sure who was in the race and who was out and even those who have closely followed the parade of candidates and wouldbe candidates insisted that they had not settled on a favorite and were in no rush to do so nestled among hills and ridges at the confluence of the delaware and lehigh rivers , this city was heavily democratic in its industrial glory days , when the steel mills were dominant and the city s factories were in full force , cranking out crayola crayons and dixie cups as easton has struggled to diversify its economy by attracting new businesses , its partisan makeup has also grown more mixed voters in the 15th congressional district , which extends beyond easton to the larger cities of allentown and bethlehem , backed george bush for president in 1988 , then bill clinton four years later nowadays , many voters here say they are not wedded to one party or another and they hardly seem wedded to any candidate lee clewell , 38 , who works in the crayola factory , said that he usually voted republican but that none of the contenders struck him particularly favorably asked about mr dole , he said he would vote for him only as a last resort when you mention that name , mr clewell said , it sends chills up my spine but he could not cite any specific concerns about mr dole , saying just the way he presents himself that turns me off mr clewell said that speaker newt gingrich , who is not running but has not completely closed the door on a bid , is pretty much all republicans have going for them right now but several other voters , including some republicans , registered doubts about mr gingrich , particularly over whether he was presidential timber adolf klova , a 63yearold semi retired advertising executive , said he was pleased to see republicans controlling congress , explaining that mr gingrich lends balance where there never has been any before that said , mr klova does not want the speaker to run for president he s a little quirky in some cases , the executive said i could never see him as president , he s too erratic but then mr klova put down the republican contenders one by one , saying , we need someone with new thoughts and new ideas as for another noncandidate , general powell , voters here were not as infatuated with him as might have been expected given that thousands of americans have been lining up to buy copies of his memoirs while diehard backers said they would vote for general powell no matter whether he ran as an independent or a republican , others vowed never to support him virginia taylor , a 33yearold housewife who backed president bush in 1992 , said she hoped that general powell , who is retired , ran as a republican she said she would favor him by far over the current field he gives heroism back to america , mrs taylor said he s done a job and proven he can do a job if general powell runs as in independent next year , she said she would still vote for him mrs taylor offered a dream ticket powellperot powell s stability would help to balance perot , she said such a ticket was also suggested by a handful of other easton residents , including julio rivera , 23 , who voted for mr clinton in 1992 colin powell can be the president and ross perot can be the vice president , said mr rivera , a nursing home aide ross perot can give him ideas about the economy and powell knows the ins and outs of washington , dc but i do n't know if he 'll ever get elected being the first black guy several white voters said they hoped general powell would run to help smooth racial divisions rubbed particularly raw in the aftermath of oj simpson s acquittal on murder charges i 'd love to see the guy get in , said al manazer , 62 , who runs the easton bus terminal he s been a military man a career man he might be able to do something with this racist thing but a block away , larry kinchen , a 42yearold black foundry worker , said he would stick with mr clinton even though he thought the president had let down the poor and elderly why vote for colin powell \? mr kinchen asked he does n't have the experience whatsoever gerald stern , 70 , a poet , also prefers mr clinton , but for different reasons what is it with america that we 're in love with a military person \? he asked is what s attractive about him that he s an enigma \? are we going to vote for another puzzle \? mr stern said it was only with great reluctance that he expected to vote again for mr clinton what troubles me about clinton is what makes him successful , he said an extraordinary politician is one who can change his position in an instant and pretend he s always had it the media saturation about general powell has apparently not touched everyone here the name drew several blank stares do n't know of him , said samuel nutall , 25 , a crane operator explaining that he voted for ross perot in 1992 , and wants to do so again next year , mr nutall said he made himself a billionaire and i like the way he speaks but mostly , the mention of mr perot was greeted with snickers he wants attention , a little bit of love , mr stern said jim vones , 76 , a landlord who voted for mr perot in 1992 , said he was not eager to do so again perot knows how to make money , mr vones said but what good does that do you \? when you get in there , you make more money having soured on the candidates now running , mr vones also put in a plug for an old favorite you know what you need \? he asked you need a farmer with some good common sense a guy like harry truman
the music of hootie and the blowfish was blaring in the clubhouse again late yesterday afternoon , just as it has so often since midjuly when the mets rediscovered themselves and turned a miserable season into a pleasant adventure the joyous sense of victory was again in the air , punctuated by hootie , laughter and the praise of a 61yearold manager , who may have discovered the fountain of youth the mets had ended their season with a 10 victory over the playoffbound braves , a victory generated on a basesloaded walk in the 11th inning other teams may be headed to the playoffs , but none can feel better about themselves than the mets , who ended the year with the league s secondbest record after the allstar game break at 4431 and tied a franchise record with 11 consecutive victories at shea stadium i'm proud of our kids and the way they battled in the second half , manager dallas green said we got our act together and played as a team there were some doubting thomases as to whether the team could get it done or whether i could get it done i enjoy getting those kind of challenges and beating them the mets , who were 2544 at the break , finished 6975 with threegame sweeps of the central champion reds and the east champion braves sure , both opponents were going through the motions , preparing for the playoffs atlanta used 10 pitchers yesterday , the last being brad woodall , who walked tim bogar on a 32 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded in the 11th jason isringhausen did his best to tie a club record with eight victories in consecutive starts he allowed just four hits through eight innings before being lifted for a pinchhitter pete walker , who pitched one inning of relief , was credited with his first major league victory as the mets left the field , they tossed their caps into the crowd of 18 , 876 one youngster in a mets tshirt and a blue cap turned backward held a sign that read bring on '96 that was the prevailing attitude in the clubhouse as well i really do n't know how to feel , said pitcher bill pulsipher part of you wants to keep playing and the other part wants to get next year started if we can start next season the way we finished this one , there s no telling what we can do with the marlins' victory over the phillies yesterday , the mets moved into a secondplace tie with philadelphia behind the braves isringhausen said he would be watching the late scores to see the outcome reliever john franco , who has seen his share of bad times at shea , was satisfied just to go home happy it s the first winter in a long while where we can walk around with our heads up high , he said i'm going to enjoy that

los angeles each year , when oscar season begins about the same time as bear hunting in the adirondacks the academy of motion picture arts and sciences warns the studios to be polite , wellmannered and tasteful in bagging nominations items that begin to tread dangerously close to the definition of a bribe have been sent to academy members in recent years , arthur hiller , the academy president , wrote on aug 26 , adding that the academy frowns on care packages that include books , music videos , cd s and clothing his letter implied that studios committing such bribery would find themselves with fewer tickets to the academy awards ceremony and ball , which this year are on march 27 nominations are worth so much at the box office , to the ego and in the video store that the studios have brushed off the academy s threat disney has sent each academy member a 50 coffee table book on the making of the lion king and studios have competed with one another in lavish videocassettes that have become their chief marketing tool during the academy season whether a movie is any good has something to do with how many nominations it will get on feb 14 , but so does luck and some good movies or performances are , for various reasons , hard to sell in the most important category best picture what chance does a studio have with a threehour documentary about high school basketball in chicago or with a costume movie , released late in the game , about the british king who lost the american colonies \? how do you get the academy to award a bestactress nomination to a movie that has been on the shelf for three years or to pay attention to a movie that is aimed primarily at women \? and how do you get supporting actor and actress nominations for ensemble movies that have too many delicious performances \? this is how five studios are trying to solve those problems long shots for best picture there are no secret ways to get nominations at a cost of 60 , 000 to 500 , 000 per movie , almost every studio is holding endless screenings for the 5 , 000 academy members , advertising nonstop in variety and the hollywood reporter , and sending videocassettes to oscar voters \( it costs a minimum of 30 , 000 for a barebones mailing and can cost double that for fancy packaging of videocassettes sent by federal express \) if an academy member says to me , sam , it s a nice film , but it s only no 6 on my list , ' i 've done my job , says samuel goldwyn , whose samuel goldwyn company produced and released the madness of king george i 've gotten it in front of their eyes mr goldwyn is , in his own words , hustling this picture like i 've never hustled a picture before that is partly because two of the five bestpicture slots are wide open most years , hollywood insiders can accurately predict the bestpicture nominees by early december this year , only pulp fiction , forrest gump and quiz show seem to have locked up nominations , leaving legends of the fall , the lion king , the shawshank redemption , nobody s fool , nell , four weddings and a funeral and hoop dreams as roughly equal contenders , with little women and the madness of king george as longer shots hoop dreams is a muchpraised documentary about two black teenagers who dream of playing professional basketball no documentary has ever been nominated for best picture the idea of pushing hoop dreams for best picture started as a publicity stunt when we opened in early october , we thought it would make a good press angle , says ira deutchman , the former president of fine line features , the artfilm arm of new line we thought we might generate some publicity to get people to go to the movie we mailed a letter to academy members we spent very little money , less than 1 , 000 what we did n't expect were the phone calls and letters we got from academy members saying they would take the idea seriously even so , fine line would never have gambled on a fullfledged academy campaign without the example of disney , which had broken a similar barrier by getting a bestpicture nomination for an animated film , beauty and the beast , in 1991 hoop dreams would have had no chance without the critics but gene siskel and roger ebert , the two most influential television critics , and kenneth turan of the los angeles times gave the idea credibility by choosing hoop dreams as the best picture of the year then the movie was runnerup to quiz show in the bestpicture balloting by the new york film critics and came in third to pulp fiction with both the los angeles film critics association and the national society of film critics fine line has also been able to turn the underdog film s battle for a bestpicture nomination into news earlier this month , just before academy members received their ballots , the company s attempt to get hoop dreams a bestpicture nomination was featured on cbs and nbc despite the critics , none of mr deutchman s competitors except sidney ganis , president for worldwide marketing at columbia tristar , thinks that the academy might break with tradition and nominate hoop dreams in a wideopen year , it has a shot , says mr ganis , because it s a unique film that is easy on the eyes and ears and totally riveting
it was music minus one , a kingdom without a king , an event conceived around an absence to make the heart grow fonder carnegie hall s three soldout concerts celebrating the music of frank sinatra on monday through wednesday conjured up many of the elements of mr sinatra s musical world except the one most essential the singer himself the voice , the chairman of the board , ol' blue eyes , whatever you want to call him , chose not to attend the singer s absence paradoxically magnified his musical presence watching other singers perform songs identified with mr sinatra , accompanied by orchestral and bigband arrangements that had been custommade for him , they appeared to be followers not just of the sinatra style but disciples of the sinatra philosophy and none of them could swing with the mixture of subtlety and bravado that mr sinatra , now nearing 80 , still brings to uptempo numbers reminiscing about mr sinatra , different performers had different names for that philosophy rosemary clooney called it rugged individualism to joe williams , it was simply sincerity for frank sinatra jr , the series' final performer , his father s essential quality was his defiance while the concerts touched on all phases of mr sinatra s career , the emphasis was mostly on the 1950 s and 60 s , when the singer shucked off the role of romantic crooner and reinvented himself as the archetypal pop swinger that selfreinvention , whose flashpoint mr sinatra jr identified as his father s 1953 recording of i 've got the world on a string , was really the fulfillment of a movement that had begun in the 1940 s it had been mr sinatra who personalized crooning by infusing pop vocals with new currents of eroticism and a trembling emotional intimacy and in doing so , he led the movement for bigband vocalists to step out from the background , seize the reins of pop and express themselves their way during the 50 s cultural climate , when affluence and the dissemination of pop psychology promoted individual selffulfillment , mr sinatra was free to expand the range of his singing beyond romantic ardor and sadness to encompass the full gamut of human emotion his records elevated anger , petulance and an existential malaise into the gallery of acceptable pop attitudes this revolutionary broadening of the pop singer s emotional palette asserted a new relationship between the singer and the song , in which the lyric could be deepened with psychological subtext pop had at last become serious the revolution had an element of revenge , as the bigband singer who had once been relegated to a supporting role revived swing in his own image arrangers like nelson riddle , billy may and don costa , the three whose work was most prominently featured at carnegie hall , now served the singer and the recorded performance became a collaborative selfportrait , with the songwriter suggesting the pose and the arranger creating the background would pop music have gone in this direction had mr sinatra not existed \? it s hard to say but the carnegie hall concerts suggested that mr sinatra invented something that no one else had the talent , tenacity and force of personality to carry off the shows , for which the disk jockey , author and sinatraphile jonathan schwartz served as an erudite host , had the feel of digressive cultural essays meant to demonstrate mr sinatra s greatness monday s show opened with four singers michael feinstein , vic damone , mr williams and john pizzarelli each singing night and day in an arrangement taken from a different sinatra recording in the show s most exhilarating moments , mr damone and mr williams each sang suites of songs to arrangements from sinatra albums of all the singers who grew up in mr sinatra s shadow , mr damone , who is 67 , still has the smoothest and most mellifluous voice his singing came the closest to evoking the early50 s sinatra , when the crooner was metamorphosing into the swinger mr williams , who is 76 , sang understated versions of nelson riddle arrangements of young at heart , i 've got you under my skin and witchcraft they glowed with an autumnal warmth while swinging stealthily for the second night , the large orchestra was replaced by a 19member big band , and the performers were drawn mostly from the world of new york cabaret outstanding moments included nancy lamott s sweetly tender versions of call me irresponsible and all the things you are weslia whitfield s pointedly sorrowful how deep is the ocean \? the series' single most compelling moment brought down the house jack jones s luck be a lady captured mr sinatra s most aggressive side with a punchy , crowdpleasing verve on wednesday evening , the full orchestra returned , and linda ronstadt and ms clooney each sang a short set before joining voices on a plush , sloweddown but not for me ms clooney , like mr williams two nights earlier , radiated a special generosity of spirit and her warmhearted performance of i 'll be seeing you crystallized the feeling of nostalgia that permeated carnegie hall the concert s final segment , in which frank sinatra jr conducted , sang and reminisced , brought the series to a satisfyiing , if surreal , conclusion after trying to establish an intimate afterdinner ambiance , the honoree s only son and sometime conductor announced that he was going to answer a question he has been asked repeatedly over the years what was it like \? those who anticipated intimate family gossip and a hint of dirty laundry were in for a disappointment the son delivered a rambling , respectful essay on his father s music that focused on the 1950 s and 60 s , interspersed with performances of sinatra songs the son showed himself to be the ultimate student of his father in renditions of three coins in the fountain , lonesome road , ebb tide , old man river and others his singing bore a clonelike similarity in phrasing and intonation to his father s versions in these eerie moments , the man being honored seemed to be both there and not there what was missing was a light in the eyes , a snap of the fingers , the feeling that frank sinatra sr always conveyed of inventing himself , and with it america s popmusic culture , moment by moment photo rosemary clooney at the frank sinatra tribute at carnegie hall \( steve j sherman for the new york times \)
san diego , jan 8 in a weekend of playoff blowouts , the miami dolphins and the san diego chargers saved the best for last and dolphins kicker pete stoyanovich saved one of his worst kicks for last stoyanovich had made 8 of 10 field goals from 40 to 49 yards this season , but his try this afternoon with 6 seconds left from 48 yards missed the mark , wide right thus , the dolphins missed a chance to play in the super bowl at home miami had led in this game for all but the final 35 seconds the dolphins were halfway home , halfway to super bowl xxix and then lightning struck , a big blue bolt of a touchdown pass from stan humphries to mark seay for 8 yards and the extra point just before the stoyanovich miss it all resulted in a 2221 victory for san diego before 63 , 381 fans , the largest crowd ever at jack murphy stadium and it was likely the happiest one ever i was on my knees , said chargers back natrone means i looked to the crowd , not even at the kick , said chargers coach bobby ross they always tell you in that situation what you need to know the photographers near our sideline were saying , 'oh , he s got plenty of leg that s easy for him he s going to make it' i said , 'you guys just do n't believe we do' god was looking out for us you know that that kicker could line up nine more times and make that kick nine times in a row chargers safety stanley richard could not contain his emotions i saw the kick go wide , he said then i sprinted to the far end zone and saluted the fans then i ran behind our bench and jumped up and down with the guys then i sprinted to the other end zone then i ran back onto the field i could n't stop dolphins coach don shula could not sprint anywhere because of his leg injury but shula is not one to run and hide anyway he said simply that s about as tough a loss as i 've ever been around it s a bitter disappointment the bottom line is we could n't stop their running and we could n't run it looked like the snap was high when stoyanovich hit it , it did n't have anything behind it said the holder , john kidd , i stretched my arms out and i got the ball down as fast as i could stoyanovich did not meet with reporters after the game san diego was one very lucky team this afternoon it survived three turnovers \( miami made none \) it survived 67 yards worth of penalties it survived one dan marino passing assault after another it survived its own early ineptitude inside the red zone it even survived a couple of questionable calls in the fourth quarter in the first one , when dolphins tight end keith jackson pushed the ball forward after a reception , and it was recovered by san diego , the officials ruled it an illegal forward pass rather than a botched lateral that allowed miami to retain possession the second controversial ruling denied the chargers' shawn jefferson a touchdown when the officials said he caught a pass into the end zone out of bounds humphries threw an interception on the next play the chargers play at pittsburgh next sunday and hope for more luck it is in the american football conference championship game , with the winner earning a berth in the super bowl on jan 29 in miami s joe robbie stadium oh , how miami planned to be there but the chargers , with 3 16 left , were down by 2115 and began a drive at their 39 at the miami 8 , after an afternoon of futility inside the miami 20 , the chargers called what may have been their most creative play of the season seay lined up left , ran in motion right , ran back left and then turned around at the snap and sneaked in behind the middle of the chargers' offensive linemen he slipped through the middle and toward the right flat , and the dolphins' defense had completely lost him humphries tossed it to seay and he held on , and with the extra point , san diego had the lead with 35 seconds remaining it looked as if it were over , but it was not a terrible squib kickoff ross said that was an error in communication and that he had wanted a deep kick gave miami the ball at its 38 miami , behind marino and with the help of a 32yard pass interference call against chargers safety eric castle , moved to the san diego 30 a couple of incomplete passes later , 6 seconds were left in came stoyanovich , one of the league s alltime most accurate and best longdistance kickers it simply was n't to be for miami you have got to take the bad with the good , said dolphins receiver irving fryar it s disappointing , but what do you want me to do , cry \? we got to take this shot , take this lick the game was right there in the dolphins' grasp they led by 216 at halftime on the strength of three marino touchdown passes , two of them to jackson jackson gained 84 yards receiving in the first half but only 25 yards in the second half san diego , however , kept driving deep on the dolphins only to unravel near the end zone twice inside the 10yard line it settled for field goals in the first half once in the third quarter , on a fourth and goal at the 1 , it failed to get a first down but that may have been a blessing in disguise because on the next play , the chargers got a safety when bernie parmalee was tackled in the end zone and thus was able to both get points and get the ball back immediately and that led to means s bruising 24yard touchdown run where tackle eric jonassen pulled left to right and cleaned house in front of means it led to a 90 third quarter for san diego and a possession time lead of 12 10 to 2 50 it was a long third quarter , dolphins cornerback troy vincent said they came out in the second half and played like champions they kept the ball away from our offense i was very surprised they ran so well because we basically had an eightman line out there they played a better game in the second half that s why they 're going to pittsburgh and we 're not michael stewart , a safety , led the dolphins in tackles with 11 , and that s usually an indication that the other team is moving too frequently downfield marino was 24 of 38 for 262 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions humphries was 28 of 43 for 276 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions means rushed 24 times for 139 yards with his long run the touchdown run the difference in the rushing game was glaring miami gained 26 yards , san diego gained 202 miami ran 8 times , san diego 40 that huge differential is one reason why , with 4 24 left , when miami got the ball at its 24 and was still up by 2115 , the dolphins decided to pass three times three incomplete passes no time off the clock three and out and back to san diego on the punt and san diego got it with 3 16 left and marched down and scored with seay that was huge , but i might have done the same thing with dan marino , ross said it was a game like that , where some stuff you tried just did n't work and you paid for it we knew the feeling we were good we were lucky photo the chargers' mark seay is on his way to the end zone , and on his way to pittsburgh , scoring the decisive touchdown yesterday \( reuters \)
chicago , oct 16 not many people had heard of robert m cook before the arizona lawyer showed up 15 months ago in nebraska accusing ibp inc , the world s largest meatpacker , of illegally manipulating prices in the cattle market still , mr cook , a former lobbyist for an association of livestock auctioneers , was taken seriously when he contended that ibp s practices had cost ranchers about 1 billion between midapril and the end of june last year , a period when cattle prices plunged more than 20 percent his accusations were picked up by many regional newspapers and by leading trade publications so were his plans , later dropped , to file a class action lawsuit the broad notice mr cook received and ibp s response , which included hitting him with a libel suit , provide a good illustration of the tensions running through the beef business these days cattle ranchers and feedlot operators are mired in one of their worst slumps ever while meatpackers are earning what analysts estimate are record profits indeed , the stock of ibp , the only publicly traded company in the industry , has surged this year , starting in january at 3025 a share and closing today at 5525 on the new york stock exchange although cattle producers and meatpackers agree that the main reason is that ranchers have too many cattle to sell , mr cook s accusations played right into the suspicions of some producers and agribusiness critics that more than simple market forces are at work we have a lot of questions we do n't have answers for , said jeffrey biegert , a feedlot owner in nebraska some answers may be on the way a lawsuit filed against ibp in august by the packers and stockyards administration , the antitrust arm of the agriculture department , may help define whether the packers' favorable contracts with certain feedlots are unfairly hurting others and industry problems have been examined in a study commissioned by the agriculture department in 1992 under pressure from congress that is scheduled to be completed this fall the libel case , which came to trial last month , ended on a mixed note ibp won a ruling that mr cook s most specific accusations were false but apparently was unable to convince the jury that the statements had been made with malicious intent mr cook was found to be not liable , a result that ibp is appealing no lawsuit or study will put an end to the friction between the producers and packers , which is as old as the meat industry in fact , similar strains are common throughout agriculture , where producers tend to be relatively small and diverse while the food processors to which most of them sell their products are typically huge and few in number what looks like a move toward higher quality standards or greater efficiency from the processors' point of view may seem manipulative or unfair to many farmers and ranchers such struggles are usually no more visible to a consumer than the gory work of meatpacking in the long run , though , they can affect not only the quality and quantity of food products , but also their prices the tensions are particularly high these days among cattle producers because more than half are expected to lose money this year or just break even and suspicions about market manipulation are festering because a series of mergers in the late 1980 s left ibp and only two competitors the montfort division of conagra inc and the excel division of cargill inc in control of more than 80 percent of the beef cattle market that is a far bigger share than former powers like swift , armour and wilson controlled in the 1920 s when meatpackers were attacked by government trustbusters moreover , ibp and its rivals have been edging away from the normal cash market in which they buy huge pens full of animals for delivery no later than the following week the agriculture department says the packers now get more than 20 percent of their cattle in other ways these include contracts for future delivery and arrangements with regular suppliers who sign socalled formula contracts , which use average cash prices as a starting point and often peg the final compensation to an animal s quality at the time of slaughter in some weeks and some regions , a packer may get more than 60 percent of its needs from such captive supplies , according to a survey in several states initiated by the nebraska cattlemen s association many cattle feeders are eager to sign formula contracts , regarding them as a way to get the best possible price , to be rewarded for improving the quality of their herds and to develop something closer to a partnership relationship with a big packer but critics say such contracts give packers the power to be more choosy in bargaining for the rest of their supplies from producers who are left out of the formula loop those producers , the critics say , must take what they are offered as their cattle reach their prime or pay to keep feeding them with little hope of increasing their value the packers divided us and then they conquered us , mr biegert said
washington , april 29 a group of prominent conservative writers and strategists is starting a weekly national magazine on politics and policy that will be financed by rupert murdoch , the global media executive william kristol , an influential republican strategist who was chief of staff to vice president dan quayle , will be the editor and publisher of the washingtonbased magazine , to be called the standard mr kristol and mr murdoch met in new york late friday and concluded a tentative agreement , participants in the project said they said the magazine would be owned by mr murdoch s news america corporation , which has committed to financing the enterprise for at least three years and has budgeted about 3 million in the first year to start the magazine the company is also expected to draw on its resources to help promote and distribute the magazine , which is expected to debut around labor day after the republicans' great success in last fall s elections , mr kristol said , he believed there was a need for a weekly glossy magazine with a conservative bent it will run about 40 pages an issue and solicit advertisers it will be a magazine of politics and ideas that helps frame the debate and is a forum for serious but also lively discussion in this new era , mr kristol said we 'll be politically engaged but not in a partisan way speaking of the republican national committee , he explained , if we do n't make the rnc unhappy with some regularity , we wo n't be doing our job well a spokesman for mr murdoch , howard j rubenstein , said , rupert murdoch has long considered this type of magazine and believes there is room and a role for another highquality conservative publication mr kristol , 42 , said the magazine would be a cross between a conservative new republic and a weekly wall street journal editorial page with longer articles than the journal and a lot of investigative journalism the magazine s executive editor will be fred barnes , who for 10 years has been a senior editor at the new republic , a weekly magazine of essays and commentary that ranges from liberal to conservative the idea is that we 're entering a new conservative era and this magazine is not going to reflect that as much as define it and goad it and push it and steer it and be a player , mr barnes said the deputy editor will be john podhoretz , a television critic for the new york post and author of hell of a ride \( simon schuster , 1993 \) , on the decline of the bush administration the opinion editor will be david tell , a speech writer in the bush and reagan administrations and aide to william j bennett when he was education secretary mr kristol said that the project for the republican future , the public policy organization he established after the 1992 elections , would be disbanded and that the staff would be incorporated into the magazine he said he planned to assemble a staff of about 30 and hoped that the magazine would break even in three years , with 100 , 000 copies as the circulation goal mr kristol has drawn attention for iconoclastic policy memos his organization distributes to republican leaders , and he said the magazine would have a lead editorial each week that would essentially be an extension of those memos the magazine will give a washington presence to mr murdoch , whose australiabased media conglomerate owns several american television stations and publications that include tv guide and the new york post in britain , it owns the times and the sunday times of london mr murdoch found himself in the middle of a flap here earlier this year when speaker newt gingrich got a 45 million advance from a publishing house controlled by mr murdoch , who had several matters before congress mr gingrich later decided to forgo the advance the magazine s editors said mr murdoch assured them he would have no editorial control they said they did not see themselves as having a single direct competitor existing conservative magazines include the national review , a biweekly the american spectator , a monthly the public interest , a quarterly , and commentary , a monthly to some extent national review will be the competition , mr barnes said but to some extent so will the new yorker and the new republic martin peretz , editorinchief and chairman of the new republic , said he would not view the magazine as a competitor this will cause us as much aggravation as mother jones and the nation , he said none , that is mr peretz also said he did not think 3 million was enough to start up a weekly and that 7 million to 8 million would be more realistic presumably what murdoch wants is a place at the table of power , he said andrew sullivan , the new republic s editor , said there was a market for the magazine because there s a lot of faithful conservatives out there who do n't really have a magazine to tell them what to think inevitably , a magazine funded by murdoch and run by kristol is not exactly going to be excessively open minded , he added two of the top editors are continuing family traditions of writing from a conservative angle mr kristol s father , irving , was a founding editor of public interest and mr podhoretz s father , norman , is retiring next week as editor of commentary mr kristol said he and the others settled on the name , the standard , because it suggests images of holding aloft the standard like the flag and also , one hopes , setting high standards he acknowledged that when i first heard it it struck me as a little selfconfident , but what the heck
soon there may be a club for uncle vanyas first there was the highly praised louis malle movie vanya on 42d street , a filming of andre gregory s stage rehearsal of the chekhov play , in a translation by david mamet , with wallace shawn in the title role two more movies are still to come michael blakemore s country life , set in the australian outback , with john hargreaves as vanya , and august , in which anthony hopkins will assume the part and which he will also direct on thursday , tom courtenay , who became an overnight star in his debut in the 1962 film the loneliness of the long distance runner , opens in uncle vanya at circle in the square in a production with ties to the royal exchange theater in manchester , england among the cast is werner klemperer as the aging professor , whose arrival at the country estate with his beautiful young wife , yelena \( amanda donohoe \) , causes confusion and discord james fox portrays the doctor , who along with vanya falls in love with the indolent , unhappy yelena the play , in a version by jeanclaude van itallie , is directed by braham murray , an artistic director at the royal exchange mr murray and mr courtenay were invited to broadway by theodore mann , a founder of circle in the square though this uncle vanya is scheduled to end its run in april , mr courtenay may return before december in a solo performance , moscow stations the train trip narrated by an alcoholic russian everyman was a hit at the edinburgh festival last year and transferred to the west end but mr courtenay s and mr shawn s membership in the vanya club comes first the two met recently in mr courtenay s dressing room here are excerpts from the conversation , recorded by andrea stevens , an editor of arts and leisure the talk ranged from the current mood on new york streets to the ideal shape for a theater to the roses vanya is taking to yelena when he comes upon her in the arms of the doctor courtenay did you play vanya on the stage or just in a film \? shawn we rehearsed it what can i say \? think of it what you will andre gregory , our director , an unusual person , had the idea that we should just work on the play courtenay this is funny , because i was hoping you would tell me where the laughs come shawn i wo n't be able to tell you ! \( laughter \) courtenay now i'm going to be none the wiser until previews begin shawn when are you bringing in moscow stations \? courtenay it s not fixed yet my producer wanted me to carry on straight after uncle vanya find somewhere to do it here but i 'd be shattered i want to go home i find new york more disturbing this time to rehearse a play that is disturbing anyway , to rehearse it in new york , is actually disturbing shawn do you mean you think the suffering is expressed more directly here \? courtenay it s a bit more naked , is n't it \? there s more aggression on the street shawn people s anger is closer to the surface , and the resignation that you find in some of the more tragic parts of london is not prevalent here people who are defeated and sort of miserable is how england often seems to me whereas here , people are more courtenay fighting back shawn they 're not skilled at fighting back but they know that anger is appropriate or rage there are people who are in a rage , like uncle vanya , who use ineffectual techniques also , like uncle vanya , they pick the wrong targets sometimes the professor , at least in my view , did n't cause all of vanya s problems similarly , the person who pushes an old lady in front of a subway train is blaming the wrong person courtenay vanya went along with the professor for many years well , why not now \? just one day the penny dropped the way it does in people s lives i suppose that s what s appealing to people about the part he never stops saying that he s wasted his life people do feel that it s human nature shawn gorbachev specifically said that he identified with vanya and this was when he was doing rather well , not when he was a young commissar but why does the anxiety in new york get to you when you are rehearsing \? courtenay maybe it s the anxiety of rehearsing in london , when you have a show on the road , the old expression is is it coming in \? meaning to london i was talking with a friend about this play and he said , of course , vanya , he knows he s not coming in and that s the trouble all of a sudden he knows it , when he says i could have been a schopenhauer or dostoyevsky we 've argued about this werner says there s no way he could have been and braham says that s not the point , he might have been i would take braham s position you do n't know you ca n't be sure that vanya s wrong shawn that depends on your beliefs about human beings i personally believe that lots and lots of people could be dostoyevsky but they are squashed people say chekhov is preaching some kind of resignation , that you have to accept your miserable lot , that there s a heroism in just keeping on that s all so repugnant to me that i do n't believe it was chekhov s point of view and if it was it repels me but i do n't see the evidence for it in the play i do n't think you can play vanya as if he knows he s defeated
inside the chaotic emergency room at bellevue hospital , frances cave stared at the gaunt , listless figure of elisa izquierdo and knew that time was running out it was april 7 , and ms cave , a social worker with a nonprofit agency called project chance , had been watching the 6yearold sink deeper into distress month by month ms cave and others at project chance were not sure why it was happening , and they did not then suspect that the girl s mother , awilda lopez , was abusing her but they knew elisa needed help so badly that for months they had urged her placement in a psychiatric hospital on this day , ms lopez had finally agreed , but then changed her mind during the long wait in the emergency room look at her , ms cave begged ms lopez , motioning toward elisa she s dissolving in front of your eyes in that plea lay what was perhaps the last chance of rescue for elisa she was beaten to death seven months later in the apartment of her mother , who was charged with her murder in the end , the most disturbing aspect of elisa s story is the number of similar chances that were lost the child welfare administration rejected , ignored or appears to have ineptly investigated at least seven formal reports of the girl s possible abuse or neglect , beginning in may 1994 the month her father died and she went to live permanently with her mother in the rutgers houses project on the lower east side with the emergence of a more detailed picture of the last year and a half in elisa s life , it has become increasingly clear that she did not fall unnoticed through a tattered social safety net she was suffering in plain view and the pattern of error , omission and illegality reflected in the handling of her case was the same documented in other child fatalities reviewed by the state but those reports were confidential , and those children nameless elisa s story represents a paradigm of bungled casework and suggests a broad array of flaws in the child welfare system overburdened and illsupervised caseworkers , information lost or so fragmented it loses meaning , routine disregard of rules that homes be monitored and a failure to hold officials accountable even when children die child welfare officials were constantly warned about elisa a school administrator called an emergency room physician called social workers called , again and again they reported , variously , that elisa was withdrawn , bruised , balding , limping , smearing her feces on the kitchen refrigerator and burying her urinedrenched underwear in a hole under her bed some of these witnesses to elisa s unraveling suspected that she was in danger from one or both parents , while others merely recognized that she was a deeply disturbed child , sending out twisted , muffled cries for help many of their alarms fell on the ears of a manhattan caseworker , adrian navallo , who was apparently tracking elisa s progress from may 1994 at least through may 1995 ms cave , who had failed with ms lopez on that fateful night in the bellevue emergency room , said she called him then to urge that he remove elisa from the lopez home he did not , and in the months that followed , elisa drifted permanently from public view and prying eyes her mother , who had already pulled elisa out of school , ended the family s voluntary relationship with project chance that left elisa s fate to the child welfare administration , the only agency with a mandate to protect her and it failed to do so citing confidentiality laws , the agency will not discuss elisa s case mr navallo , who has been directed by the agency not to talk to the press , would not comment but his lawyer , gary maitland , depicted the caseworker as a very caring , diligent guy , hampered from start to finish by a system in disarray during the year he was responsible for elisa , mr navallo was handling as many as 38 cases and never fewer than 26 , his lawyer said , though the agency s own standards say no more than 15 can be handled safely and because his caseload was so high , he was placed on fieldwork restriction for 5 of those 12 months required to spend most of his time in the office doing paperwork to close cases , and allowed even less time than usual to visit children mr navallo s immediate supervisor , like many of his colleagues , had no childprotection experience of his own the veteran childprotection manager to whom they both reported had previously been in charge of three units during this period he was overseeing eight units , or as many as 1 , 000 cases and 40 caseworkers there s an essential lunacy to this , said mr maitland , who has been representing caseworkers for 15 years what i do n't understand is why more kids are n't dying ms lopez did not respond to a letter sent to the rikers island jail , where she is being held , seeking comment this account is pieced together from scores of other interviews and sources , including information from

washington , may 24 twentyone years after he left the national scene in disgrace , former vice president spiro t agnew returned to a merciful , mustier fate in the corridors of power today and beamed as a bust of himself was unveiled outside the senate the noble gaze of the white marble figure hinted not at all at the turmoil of mr agnew s departure as richard m nixon s vice president a once pugnacious politician forced to quit after prosecutors had detailed a classic wardheeler s graft scandal quite simply , he was accused of accepting bribes for years , even as he worked in the shadow of the white house i'm not blind or deaf to the fact that there are critics who feel this is a ceremony that should not take place , said the 76yearold mr agnew , pleasing longtime friends at the ceremony with a wisp of the scrappiness from his old campaign days i would remind those people that regardless of their personal view of me , this ceremony has less to do with spiro agnew than with the office i had conferred on me , he said , noting that all vice presidents are entitled to join the sculpture display that has been maintained for more than a century in the oftenoverlooked recesses of the capitol a 20minute ceremony attended by 300 friends and associates , including a score of current senators , was marked by a sense of official history and implicit mercy toward the once popular political warrior who resigned and pleaded no contest to a tax evasion charge in exchange for assurances that he would not be imprisoned the bribery scandal predated his tenure as vice president and began in his first years in office as baltimore county executive and continued while he was governor of maryland , according to federal prosecutors they said accumulated testimony from mr agnew s associates proved that he had solicited and accepted payments of tens of thousands of dollars from maryland public works contractors during a 10year period a master of suburban politics , mr agnew is still well remembered in maryland for a stylish , casual cronyism that extended to friends who stocked his home with free food and drink none of this history dims the clean lines and peace of the agnew bust , to be set eventually in a relatively prominent turning on the second floor just down from a main door of the debating chamber it is taking the place of the bust of levi p morton , prominent a century ago as a new york governor and vice president in the benjamin harrison administration that work is being moved to the first floor as part of a reorganization of the statuary undertaken by senator ted stevens , the alaska republican who is chairman of the rules committee lord god , you are the ultimate judge , senator mark o hatfield prayed in benediction , capturing the mood of the ceremony each day we are grateful for your forgiveness of our trespasses looking trimfigured , sharpeyed and confident , mr agnew basked in a standing ovation in which senator bob packwood , currently mired in his own official controversy , was among the first on his feet to offer strong applause in brief remarks , bob dole , the senate majority leader , chose to focus on mr agnew s fierce patriotism during the divisive vietnam era , saying , millions of americans were proud to stand with him senator daniel patrick moynihan , a new york democrat who was a staff veteran of the nixon administration , saluted mr agnew for finding the pulse of midamerica as part of a new breed of campaigner but for all the ceremony s dedication to history , there was no mention of mr agnew s role in the searing crisis in modern american government precipitated by his resignation and that of president nixon less than a year later in the separate abuse of power scandal known as watergate vice president agnew was a reflection of his time , and the collection should represent that , said don ritchie , associate senate historian , in an interview , contemplating the bust as a stony object lesson in the power of politics to immortalize and stigmatize in a single career aaron burr s in there , why not vice president agnew \? asked tom korologos , a nixon administration veteran and agnew loyalist he noted the senate collection s embrace of each vice president , even burr , who fled after slaying alexander hamilton in a new jersey duel but stopped off here to preside over a fond farewell in the senate you 've got to look at the whole man , the loyalty he gave to president nixon , mr korologos said in an interview he was beaten about the head and shoulders , and that s life he went out and now he s back mr agnew , a gleaming stump presence with serene features that translated easily to marble , clearly shared a sense of being back from oblivion , at least for the ceremony he grinned as he thanked the sculptor , william behrends , for capturing my squinty little eyes and mastodonic nose in the 50 , 000 work he left the gathering with a heartfelt defense of the office of vice president against condecension and disdain even more , he admitted to the personal comfort of having been elected and reelected vice president by american voters , who made me a part of the history reflected in the symbols and statuary we see around us mr agnew , the 39th vice president , left the official stage once more , this time to another ovation , his image standing firmly as a reminder to the public and to history
ankara , turkey to the concern of western allies and international human rights organizations , reports of rights violations in turkey have increased markedly in recent months , along with attempts by the government to crush the kurdish separatist insurrection in the southeast the number of people who have been disappearing while in the custody of the police and security forces , the reports of torture , killings by unknown assailants that appear to be political and arrests and convictions of writers , intellectuals and politicians under a law against separatist propaganda are all on the rise , turkish human rights groups say the main reason is the war in the southeast , said yavuz onen , a 56yearold architect who is president of the human rights foundation , a turkish group that was set up in 1989 to aid victims and document abuses the state uses the argument that they are in a struggle with terrorists and that they are defending the indivisibility of the territory , he said of course the state can defend its borders but most of the violations are against civilians torture is now widespread and systematic , not only for political crime but for common crime as well prime minister tansu ciller , in an interview , denied that there had been widespread violations allegations of torture are not new in turkey the foundation cited the cases of yasar kanbur , 35 , an engineer , and yusuf yukdirim , 35 , a health union worker the two men said they had been picked up as leftist students after the military takeover of 1980 and were held nine and a half years in prison during that time , they said , they were suspended by their chained arms , kept without food and sleep , beaten repeatedly and subjected to electric shock they scoffed at the idea that torture would ever be eliminated from turkey not by this regime , mr kanbur said torture is universal here the war against the kurds , who constitute about onefifth of turkey s 60million people , has been going on for a decade the kurds were originally concentrated in the southeast , but many are now scattered all over the country the fighting has claimed an estimated 14 , 000 lives the kurdish workers' party , or pkk , has used terrorism in its fight for an independent homeland it does not shrink from killing teachers who instruct in turkish and socalled village guards , who defend hamlets of government supporters , and their families the party is believed to have killed over 200 civilians in 1993 , and it took responsibility for at least 167 deaths in the first 10 months of 1994 but attempts to eradicate the pkk , whose leader , abdullah ocalan , is based in syria , have taken even more civilian lives western diplomats stationed here say security forces have been granted a free hand by the mrs ciller s government to deal with the insurrection the security forces have turned to brutal methods , especially in the 10 southeastern provinces that have been under a state of emergency since 1987 because of the insurrection the emergency grants quasimartial law powers to a regional governor and suspends the few modest constitutional safeguards in effect elsewhere a suspect , for instance , can be held for 30 days without access to relatives or a lawyer army and paramilitary groups sweep through whole areas of the southeast , destroying villages that they suspect of aiding the pkk and burning many of them to the ground the province of tunceli has been a battleground this winter , where some 40 , 000 turkish troops are pursuing guerrillas who may number up to 3 , 000 , by estimates of western diplomats more than 60 villages there have been wiped out the estimates of the number of villages destroyed over the last decade vary among the human rights groups , but usually run between 1 , 500 and 2 , 500 reports by the united states state department , amnesty international , the united nations committee against torture and the european committee for the prevention of torture have all condemned turkey for human rights violations a report by amnesty international , a policy of denial , said at least 50 disappearances in custody were reported in the first 10 months of 1994 , nearly double the number in 1993 it said the number of people shot down in the street by unknown assassins had soared from more than 20 in 1991 to 362 in 1992 , more than 400 in 1993 and 380 for the first 10 months of 1994 visitors to the southeastern region say four or five people a day are now being killed on the streets they include journalists investigating human rights violations and members of trade unions and political parties , including the people s democracy party , which has a largely kurdish membership and is anathema to the government leaders of human rights organizations rebut the government s argument that the kurdish insurrection is in any way a valid reason for curtailing civil liberties the continuation of the armed struggle by someone else cannot be accepted as the reason for delaying democracy , said husnu ondul , secretary general of the human rights association
new delhi , dec 12 concerns for the safety of four western hostages in indianruled kashmir , one of them an american citizen , have mounted after a shadowy muslim separatist group said it was no longer holding the men , who were seized more than five months ago a note delivered on monday to a local newspaper in srinagar , summer capital of the indian state of jammu and kashmir , said that three of the hostages had been arrested by indian army troops , and that the fourth man was missing after a clash between members of the separatist group , alfaran , and the indian forces on dec 4 indian army spokesmen had reported the clash earlier , saying it had resulted in the death of abdul hamid turki , whom the army identified as an afghan citizen and as the leader of alfaran , and four other alfaran members but after the note to the srinagar newspaper , the army said that none of the hostages were with the alfaran group at the time of the army ambush western diplomats noted that it was the first time since the abductions began on july 4 in a himalayan mountain region popular among foreign trekkers that an alfaran statement had disclaimed knowledge of the hostages' whereabouts the diplomats also noted that indian officials had said that , in their last contact with alfaran , by radio on nov 26 , an alfaran member had renewed threats to execute the hostages if india continued to refuse the group s demands for the release of kashmiri separatist leaders held in indian jails indian officials said the alfaran claim that it was no longer holding the hostages had dimmed , but not extinguished , their hopes for recovering the hostages alive they said alfaran s statements have often proven misleading at the same time , they also said that the note claiming that the hostages were caught up in the clash with the army could be an attempt to disclaim responsibility if they had killed them , it would be logical to try and shift the blame to the army , one official said in its original statement on the clash , the army said that three alfaran members who had been captured had said that the group involved in the shootout had left the hostages behind in the mountains about 50 miles east of where the clash occurred according to the army account , the captured men said the plan had been for the hostages to be handed over by other alfaran members to local militants , as distinct from the afghans and pakistanis said by indian officials to form the core of alfaran , or for the hostages to be abandoned in the army s wording , in the 14 , 000foot mountains where they have been held for much of the time since their abduction although western diplomats in new delhi have said little publicly about the prolonged ordeal of the four hostages donald f hutchings , from spokane , wash keith mangan and paul wells from britain and dirk hasert , from germany they have acknowledged privately that they have never been confident of securing their release a fifth hostage , from norway , was killed in august the latest developments have added to the diplomats' perplexity although hostagetaking has been common in the conflict that has gripped indianruled kashmir for the last six years , the abduction of the four westerners has been unusual among the puzzling factors has been the emergence of alfaran , a previously unknown group indian officials have depicted the group as part of a covert program by pakistan to destabilize indian rule in the twothirds of kashmir that is under new delhi s control but western diplomats have been wary of the indian explanation , just as they have been wary of counterclaims by many muslim separatist groups with political offices in srinagar from the outset , those groups have said that alfaran was a product of an indian program that takes captured guerrillas and turns them into rogue separatists , armed by india to conduct operations aimed at sowing discord among the authentic separatist groups and at discrediting pakistan at an early stage of the abductions , a senior western diplomat said that western investigations had produced no evidence that india had organized the hostagetaking but the official said there was no evidence that pakistan had played any role , either the implication was that the abductions might have been organized by hardline separatists beyond direct influence by pakistan , perhaps drawn from veterans of the war in afghanistan

the commandants of the gulags of the world and their securityministry masters have two things in common , in whatever country they operate they have a taste for torture , and they are very stupid perhaps part of the combination comes from genetics some people seem to be born to fight for freedom and others to draw blood from them but the stupidity comes from a particular environment the totalitarian environment the guardians of the gulags never have to test their minds against those of free men and women so , in time , they move from the mental inferiority that drew them to their line of work to becoming truly mentally handicapped unable to understand that to free , inquiring minds they are panes of glass revealing instantly all their actions , motives and maneuvers their stupidity is the belief of the gravely dimwitted that they can manipulate and fool their intellectual betters the first such individual i encountered was a governor of goa when it was a portuguese colony in india he gave me permission to tour his prison to show me that the people for whom i was searching indian socialists who had crossed the border carrying freedom flags were not in his custody he led me down a cell row leading left from a main corridor large , sparsely occupied cells , socialistfree as he showed me out , of course i walked to the right the cells were packed with prisoners who had just been jammed into them , my socialists they held up arms livid with cigarette burns the governor looked at me in astonishment that anyone would ever think of turning in an unauthorized direction in the soviet gulag a commandant was stunned that a visitor shown an isolation cell glistening clean white would smell the walls and discover they were damp with fresh paint lord , lord , how dull these people are but for impenetrable stupidity i have rarely known anything like the film the chinese made and sold to western news organizations this film is supposed to show that harry wu confessed that his reports are false my harry , your harry , the harry of all who admire those who put their lives on the line for freedom harry wu spent 19 years in chinese slavelabor camps after he was freed he made his way to america but he kept returning to china to get even more information to spread before the world about slavelabor exports that support china s military establishment and he has reported about organs taken from executed chinese prisoners , then sold to sick , rich chinese and foreigners who do not inquire whether the prisoners are guilty or of what of course , harry wu was heard confessing to nothing except maybe some editing errors by a bbc editor of his own organ documentary the gulag film really shows how hard mr wu resisted , not that they had broken him the us hopes that the film means the communists are getting ready to release mr wu but there is as good a chance that the police apparatus will demand continued imprisonment american diplomats are doing their personal best to help mr wu but if he is released it will not be because of irresistible us government pressure there has been none applied that beijing would recognize raising of tariffs , barring china from the world trade organization or blocking a world bank loan by breaking his promise to apply pressure for human rights in china and tibet , president clinton made himself the prisoner of beijing political apologias will not work , nor will the journalistic variety i am thinking of the fellow on the new republic who wrote a nasty little piece about how snatching salable organs from executed criminals was really not that bad and i am thinking of the house liberal on the mclaughlin show who revealed much too much about herself by saying that after all we had to understand that the chinese regarded mr wu as a spy the only realistic hope is that some chinese foreignservice officers who are not braindead will be able to overrule the security police , who gave mr wu and his fully documented reports world recognition by arresting him instead of stopping him at the border and sending him back harry wu has won his victory the only way china can now cut its losses and save face is to set him free may god bless harry wu
dallas , june 15 the owner of a mall that has become a rare beacon of black commerce here says that he hired the nation of islam to provide security because blacks can handle their own problems better than the police but the police say the security guards went way too far on monday , using belts and bamboo canes to flog four boys , stripped naked , whom they suspected of stealing a cash register from a bricabrac store today the police looked for more suspects besides the four nation of islam security guards they have already arrested on charges of aggravated kidnapping the case has pitted the boys , their parents and the police against the black muslim group and black business owners here the incident led to a confrontation on monday night when at least 50 members of the nation of islam , standing shoulder to shoulder in the westcliff mall parking lot , initially prevented the police from making any arrests an officer from the dallas police department was sent to the mall today to ask managers and owners of stores at the mall how they could be better protected but the police insisted that people could not take the law into their own hands not even parents have the legal right to discipline their kids to this extent , said jim chandler , a police spokesman they held the kids and they punished them and violated the law nobody at the nation of islam mosque and security office at the mall would comment today , despite a visit and repeated calls calls to the nation of islam s chicago headquarters were not returned but derick b hopkins , a 240pound guard who is 6 feet 3 inches tall and was one of those arrested , told the police they were whipped because they did wrong they broke in here therefore , they were disciplined we take care of our own ga oluku lagbara , a black pastor who owns the mall with his wife , said he and his customers were comfortable with the nation of islam in the black community and you see this in the o j trial , where all the white people think he s guilty and all the black people think he s innocent there s a distrust of the police the nation of islam has tried in recent years to earn money and broaden its support by providing guards , usually unarmed , in housing projects and businesses throughout the country although the guards have curbed crime in several projects , they have failed in others and some critics have said the guard contracts support a group whose leader , louis farrakhan , has made virulent antisemitic remarks the guards have been accused of violence before in inglewood , calif , two guards were convicted of seconddegree murder in the death of an unarmed patron at a nightclub they were guarding in 1992 in the dallas incident , mr lagbara and susie garrett , the owner of susie s collectables , said that the boys took a cash register worth about 300 that held about 55 in cash early on monday later that day , nation of islam guards at the mall apprehended one of the boys , who confessed and turned in his friends , mr lagbara said according to a police report , the guards held the boys for four hours on monday night , questioning them , making them disrobe and repeatedly striking them at one point the boys were forced to run a gantlet of 50 nation of islam members who beat them with their belts , the report said mr lagbara said in an interview that he had asked the boys why they attacked a business owned by blacks he also said he saw none of what he called alleged spankings ms garrett said the guards were trying to keep the boys from having police records , and teach them that they do not take other people s property the boys suffered bruises on their backs , buttocks and legs the guards released the boys to their parents , who soon returned with neighbors and the police the police charged zavier mcferguson and tyrone d miller , both of arlington , a suburb of dallas , and stanley n stephen and mr hopkins , both of dallas , with four counts each of aggravated kidnapping , a firstdegree felony carrying a minimum sentence of five years the accused were still being held today on bail of 100 , 000 each , while the police tried to identify and arrest others who they say took part in the flogging burglary charges against the boys three brothers and a friend whose ages range from 12 to 16 have been referred to juvenile court they and their parents could not be reached for comment mr lagbara , a former eigthgrade english teacher , bought the mall two years ago , saving it from demolition although modest by the sprawling standards of suburbia , it is the only one in texas owned by blacks , he said the parking lot is cracked and there are many vacancies but the 41 businesses inside , including the farrakhan tape connection , have found loyal shoppers in the surrounding neighborhoods of oak cliff , southwest of downtown dallas photo four members of the nation of islam acting as security guards in dallas were charged in the beatings of four boys whom the owners of a bricabrac store suspected of stealing a cash register ebony nealy , left , and gia thomas , employees of the store , are shown with the register \( kim ritzenthaler for the new york times

los angeles , oct 3 in the end , trials never happen in a vacuum moments after the jury handed down its verdict in the o j simpson murder trial , a group of los angeles police officers parading in front of the criminal courthouse building here was jeered by a mostly black throng of spectators many conflicting forces are likely to have combined in the acquittal of o j simpson , but perhaps none has loomed larger than the role of the los angeles police department , as personified by mark fuhrman , the detective whose racist views caused him to be vilified by both defense and prosecution in effect , the crowd outside the courthouse was a pointed reminder that the credibility of the police department and basic issues like unequal justice and racial bias still bedevil this strifeweary city nearly four years after the convulsions , turmoil and fear that followed the beating of the black motorist rodney g king , the police are still considered an occupying force in large segments of the community and the notguilty verdict in the simpson trial , many fear , is likely to fortify that view indeed , while in a narrow sense , the simpson case was simply about whether the wealthy and charming athlete killed his former wife and her friend , many angelenos suggested that the jurors ultimately cast their vote on the very fate of this sprawling city s social fabric this is a city in which wealth and celebrity are among the most valued social currency and mr simpson has certainly had a good share of both like scripts from the nearby hollywood soundstages , scandal and crime here often achieve a kind of theatrical quality and drama until the simpson trial , there were other criminal dramas and intrigues that fed the city s curiosity , like the beating of the truck driver reginald denny in the rioting after the king verdict , which appeared to validate the fears of white residents the trial of the menendez brothers , who are even now facing a second round in court on charges of murdering their parents , or the allegations of scandal surrounding michael jackson , the pop singer who had been investigated on accusations of child molestation more recently , there was the trial of heidi fleiss , on charges of running a highpriced prostitutions but it is also a city whose recent rambunctious history has been punctuated by ugly episodes involving police brutality and deeprooted racism what makes los angeles different from , say new york or chicago , is that since the rodney king trial , many people black and white feel that the issue of race has so tainted the prism through which people view their neighbors that there is no longer any common agreement on the issues that face the city , never mind how to solve them suspicion and fear have infected the political climate here like a deadly virus around lunch tables , over barber chairs , in offices and movie studios , in koreatown restaurants , on the streets of the south central area , the main questions are these will the verdict of not guilty exacerbate still simmering ethnic and racial tensions \? has anything changed since the convulsions after the rodney king case \? has the city learned anything from the simpson verdict \? a lot of people will pay the price for o j s freedom , because there s no question there will be a backlash , said susan estrich , a law professor at the university of southern california there will be a tremendous effort to reform the criminal justice system and reexamine things , and the whites will end up blaming the blacks , and the blacks will end up blaming the whites , and everyone will blame the police and the system , ms estrich added susan grigsby gates , a los angeles writer and newspaper columnist , also suggested that the verdict could inflame whites hostile and resentful of blacks she said that she was sitting next to a black man when the simpson acquittal was announced and that he turned to her and said , oh boy , we 're going to have to pay for this she added , a lot of the angst surrounding this centers on the fact that 9 of the 12 jurors are africanamerican , and the assumption is going to be drawn from this that they simply let him go nonetheless , the feeling among many blacks here was that the jury had achieved a rough justice by acquitting mr simpson , an action that in the view of some will have a farreaching , positive impact on the black community here i think this jury sent a message that the time has come here in los angeles and in america that there must be a level playing field for everybody , said john mack , president of the urban league of los angeles if we are going to be completely honest , he added , there is the issue of class and affluence o j s celebrity and status enabled him to retain a superstar africanamerican lawyer in contrast to what is more typically experienced by the average person in south central la probably nowhere was the reaction more emotional than at the first african methodist episcopal church on south harvard , a predominately black congregation where a large crowd gathered to watch the verdict on bigscreen televisions
tsingtao , china not long ago , tsingtao brewery looked unbeatable with a high quality product , a well established name , a booming beer market and ambitious plans to quadruple production in five years , tsingtao seemed perfectly positioned to ride china s locomotivelike economic growth in 1993 , when the government allowed china s top companies to list shares on hong kong s stock exchange , tsingtao was chosen to go first , and its stock was one of the hottest issues of the year yet tsingtao \( pronounced chingdow \) is going nowhere its profits are sagging , its stock is near an alltime low , and its expansion plans have stalled tsingtao managers have been reluctant to explain why the 190 million they raised in 1993 has not been invested in expansion tsingtao s story straddles a central paradox in china today in this nation s wrenching shift from a planned to a market economy , explosive growth has been accompanied by bumbling financial operations mired in a hopelessly inefficient system run by the communist party the heralded entry of chinese stocks into securities markets in hong kong and shanghai has been a dud even by the year 2000 china could become an economic giant but remain a financial pygmy , timothy beardson , chairman of crosby securities in hong kong , said at a recent conference in beijing the contradiction is striking china has emerged as a magnet for international investment , as manufacturers like motorola , cocacola and general motors pour in economic growth has averaged a sparkling 12 percent annually for four years , and an awakening demand for consumer goods and services is likely to continue for decades yet the financial system envisioned by china s leaders is stuck in its infancy china s stock markets remain tiny and lackluster in the past six months , as the dow jones industrial average kept racking up new highs , chinese shares on the hong kong and shanghai markets have drifted lower and lower unforeseen difficulties are inevitable , of course , when capital markets are being built from scratch in china , though , such problems are compounded by a situation that most western investors have a hard time fathoming companies that say they want to make money are still run by communist party bureaucrats who care more about meetings and government policy than revenues or profit margins many businesses survive on government subsidies and loans that banks are ordered to give them , and those selected to issue shares are picked as much for political reasons as for financial ones tsingtao s difficulties are especially striking because the opportunity is so great china s beer market is now about 118 million barrels annually , roughly 15 times as big as it was in 1980 and growing so fast it has overtaken germany to become the world s second largest , after the united states but tsingtao , unused to entertaining questions from anyone but government officials , is almost completely indifferent to investors and analysts , offering them little information of the 17 chinabased companies now listed on the hong kong stock exchange , only one , shanghai petrochemical , trades at more than its original listing price and brilliance china automotive holdings , a bermudaregistered company that promoted itself as china s first listing on the new york stock exchange , shot up to 30 shortly after its debut in 1992 , but now trades at around 4 american investment banks like morgan stanley , goldman sachs and smith barney , after big expansions into china in 1993 , now have little business here any analyst can list a number of reasons chinese stocks are down this year many have suffered from beijing s tightcredit policy , others were hit by unexpected tax increases , still others were simply priced badly but the main problem is that it has gradually dawned on investors that they understand little about how chinese companies are run when they do get a peek inside , they do n't like what they see tsingtao is a prime example it has been making beer here since the germans opened the brewery in 1903 , when they colonized a section of the shandong peninsula in northeast china as it earned a reputation for making the best beer in china , tsingtao gained a robust 70 percent of china s beer exports when they announced plans to list shares as the first of many red chip , or mainland chinese , stocks in hong kong , tsingtao executives boldly proclaimed plans to dominate china s fragmented beer market , in which more than 800 breweries compete response was overwhelming , and the initial offering was so oversubscribed more than 100 times that few investors could get in after tsingtao was listed at 36 cents a share , it climbed to 140 , a towering 98 times earnings , in 1994 the anheuserbusch companies , the american beer giant , bought a 5 percent stake but bad news began emerging about tsingtao in the middle of this year profit in the first half fell 49 percent , as prices of raw materials rose sharply but competition prevented tsingtao from charging more for its beer more troubling , analysts looking over the company s puzzlingly vague annual report discovered that tsingtao s managers had taken nearly half of the 190 million from their share issue and , rather than investing it in plant expansion as had been promised in a prospectus lent it to other chinese

the tunnel by william h gass illustrated 652 pp new york alfred a knopf 30 if you want to go down into the self , you 'd better go armed to the teeth paul valery says that somewhere , and it was what came to mind as i began reading the tunnel , this huge and longawaited novel by william h gass , the masterpiece , one must presume , of this 70yearold american master a middleaged professor of history at a midwestern university takes to going down into the cellar of his big middleclass house , away from his unloved , undesired , unloving wife he starts tunneling down through the floor and out beyond the foundations , lying on his fat belly and squirming past trowelfuls of clay and dirt and dust on his way out he is escaping from his life that is the operative metaphor of this 652page book , yet in only a few of its many chapters is the actual tunneling presented in ordinary narrative space as ordinary narrated event mostly the book is remembrance , invective and expostulation , along with lewd instances and merry excuses , and the tunnel remains just a motif , a poetic image occasionally stumbled into in the midst of other things all the things , in fact , that mr gass has provided his professor with in the way of the arms and weapons he will need to dig out of his life as we know , and not just from freud and other psychoenterologists , the only way to dig out of your life is to dig through it so the professor talks from the middle of his life , backward , forward , remembering a furtive love life that is mostly skin and spurt , the nasty trivial obsessions of academic life , his horrible home the tunnel is maddening , enthralling , appalling , coarse , romantic , sprawling , bawling it is driven by language and all the gloriously phony precisions the dictionary makes available it is not a nice book it will have enemies , and i am not sure after one reading \( forgive me , it s a big book \) that i am not one of them let me tell you what i can there was a little boy , an only child , raised in a bleak midwestern town by an alcoholic mother and a verbally brutal father it would not take a dickens to borrow the reader s sympathy and show us the little boy s suffering , his slow escape from that abusive milieu , and to delicately sketch the paths of liberty the boy might find , or the hopeless mire into which he might , reader sighing , fall back but that is not william gass s way instead , he leaps ahead half a century and gives us the sexbesotted , verbally brutal professor the boy becomes , a gross character with fascist views and a taste for sly affairs with his students he gives us the thick of the man , the dirt to tunnel through to get , if we get , at last to the truth of him in fact , it is not till more than 600 pages into the book that we learn anything like the full particulars of the boy s youth and when we get there , it is only to doubt that history is any more meaningful when it reveals origins than when it displays the blood and ordure of results our professor of history is william kohler \( the name reminds us of plumbing fixtures \) , who occupies a wooden chair once held by his teacher , a german scholar named tabor , who introduced him to the dangerous paths of historybyparadox , to the historian as the creator of history a loud knowitall , kohler began his academic career with a treatise that seemed to deny the probity and necessity of the nuremberg trials kohler has now crowned his work with a massive study called guilt and innocence in hitler s germany , among the typescript pages of which he interleaves the pages he is writing , the ones we seem to be reading the novel is then to be understood as the hidden , personal expression of that mind that publicly announces itself in a strange study of the range of german innocence once i tried to write a novel in the voice of someone i detested , while still engaging the reader s fellow feeling alas , it was all too easy and the reader found it all too easy to accept my monster as a hero there is a trahison des clercs not confined to historians and political analysts novelists and poets too can commit the treason of the intellectuals kohler s whole existence , his operatic selfpity , the very articulateness of his selfjustifications , affront our sense of right and of intellectual responsibility yet this is where the satiric novelist works best , exploring this plausible monster , our shadow man in creating such a character , mr gass avails himself of classic arms of modernism allusion , puzzle , style as flesh , language as fable in those particulars he will not at all disappoint the readers who were so excited by his stories \( in the heart of the heart of the country \) a quartercentury ago , his novel omensetter s luck , the enthralling essays of on being blue , and , closest in many ways to the book at hand , that nonpareil shimmer of text and image in the novella willie masters' lonesome wife , a foretaste of what we find in the tunnel but here the typographical games seem \( unlike those in the novella \) playful rather than evocative and while mr gass uses some devices georges perec or harry mathews might wield as strategies of composition , or grids of meaning , here the devices seem decorative , not so much claims on the reader s puzzlesolving faculties as rewards to the writer for going on , allowing himself some smutty doggerel after a night s hard noveling
charleston , sc , april 24 this is playoff week , which means it is time for camp riley for the fourth consecutive year , the knicks have traveled to the college of charleston to prepare for the playoffs and regardless of how anyone feels about riley s regimen , it is hard to argue with the success the knicks have a 30 record in the first round under riley they have never lost game 1 of the opening round under riley , and their average margin of victory in the opening games is 16 points so were any players surprised to be in charleston again \? you must be kidding if the knicks do not play well thursday night in game 1 against the cleveland cavaliers , it will not be due to lack of preparation hopefully , we 're going to have another twomonth run at this thing , riley said before camp opened with a 5 pm film session we ca n't let anything get in the way the knicks did not have a full workout today , so neither patrick ewing \( slightly strained left hamstring \) nor derek harper \( sore left ankle \) had to test their injuries riley said both players would practice on tuesday , and both harper and ewing were shooting baskets after practice the knicks will be here through wednesday before returning to new york there will be film sessions , and each player will be given individuallytailored videotapes to study in his room at night failure to study can be embarrassing riley has quizzes , and he has been known to insert a slogan or a distraction near the end of the videotape to make sure players watched the entire tape after traveling all season , many players would rather be home with their families , sleeping in their own beds but this formula has worked for riley he used to take the los angeles lakers to honolulu for training camp , and to santa barbara , calif , before the playoffs away from family , friends , and the distractions of new york , the knicks have few options but to focus on basketball and the team usually has bonding sessions during camp riley , like a team dinner and a team pool tournament none of that may help the knicks beat the cavaliers , but why change something that has been successful \? the knickscavs series is one of four openinground series in the eastern conference also getting under way on thursday will be the indiana pacersatlanta hawks series last year , the pacers reached the conference finals and they are coming off their first 50victory season and the central division championship on friday , the orlando magic open a threeoffive series against the boston celtics although orlando dethroned the knicks as atlantic division champions and has the east s best record , the magic has lost its last seven road games and was swept in last year s first round by indiana the most intriguing firstround series will feature the charlotte hornets tangling with the chicago bulls , a matchup that also starts on friday although the hornets have the homecourt advantage , the bulls have michael jordan , scottie pippen and the experience of winning three titles during the 90 s some believe the bulls can win a championship although they would have to win four series without the homecourt advantage many observers feel this is the most wideopen playoff field in recent years , with at least four teams the magic , knicks , pacers and bulls having a legitimate chance to emerge from the east practice time before the playoffs is crucial , because travel and the demanding schedule make it difficult to schedule consistent practices during the regular season this is the first time the knicks have had three days off between games since the allstar game break in midfebruary so what will the knicks try to accomplish this week \? they hope to know almost as much about cleveland s tendencies as the cavaliers do there are two keys to beating cleveland tempo and offensive execution forced to play conservatively due to key injuries , cleveland did a masterly job of running a deliberate , halfcourt offense , often taking at least 20 seconds off the shot clock before attempting a shot people look at the cavaliers' roster and yawn , wondering how they ever managed to finish 4339 but by holding the score down , playing tough defense and limiting the opposition s possessions , the cavaliers stayed close and won many games during the final six minutes the cavaliers have some impressive numbers cleveland led the league in defense this season , allowing just 898 points a game , and holding opponents to fewer than 100 points in 62 of 82 games the cavaliers were second in the league in 3point shooting percentage \( 385 \) cleveland had the secondfewest turnovers in the league , averaging 142 a game they 're one of the smartest , best executing teams in the league , said riley patience is going to be a real catchword for us our best defense is going to have to be played in the last 10 to 12 seconds of the shot clock they have a tendency to frustrate teams that want to score mark price is one of the best point guards in the league , and he is excellent at creating a good shot for either himself or for teammates the cavaliers are disciplined and unselfish , with five players who averaged in double figures price , tyrone hill , john williams , chris mills and bobby phills but the loss of the backup point guard terrell brandon \( stress fracture , right leg \) for the season weakened cleveland s bench to upset the knicks , the cavaliers will need a significant contribution from at least two of the following role players danny ferry , michael cage , tony campbell and steve colter cleveland and new york split the season series , 22 , with the road team winning every game that should be enough to get new york s attention this may not be an easy series for the knicks they have not always been patient offensively , and they have also had trouble executing offensively in the final few minutes of games riley said he would not harp on the two home losses to cleveland what you do n't want to do is instill any doubt or fear , riley said then what they 'll do is try not to lose , play close to the vest you 've got a chance to play now for the championship you 've got to go for it and for the knicks , that meant going to charleston
dublin , oct 8 seamus heaney , the winner of the nobel prize in literature , arrived home last night and was welcomed not only as a great poet in a land that loves writers and writing , but also as a symbol of hope for lasting peace in northern ireland mr heaney , who was born in northern ireland 56 years ago but now lives in dublin , was on vacation in greece when his award was announced on thursday for a full day , neither his children nor the scores of reporters seeking interviews could find him he was invited to a dinner party on friday at the residence of the american ambassador , jean kennedy smith , but did not appear but when he arrived at dublin s airport on saturday night , after cutting his trip short upon learning about the prize , prime minister john bruton was there to praise him as a literary symbol of the northern peace effort , and to have the poet autograph a book of his lectures asked at the airport how he felt about joining the other irish nobel winners , william butler yeats , george bernard shaw and samuel beckett , he said it s like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range you hope you just live up to it it s extraordinary he did not mention ireland s literary giant , james joyce \( a figure in his poetry \) , who never won the nobel mr heaney and his wife , marie , were whisked from the airport to the residence of president mary robinson for champagne and more praise he has been the main story on national television since thursday , and he read three of his poems on the radio today at the start of the main afternoon news program it was entirely bewildering , he said in an irish television interview before he left the greek port of kalamata , and still a bit incredible it s an awesome dimension asked how he felt about being considered a peace symbol , he showed none of the annoyance of some of his friends , who thought he should have won solely as a poet mr heaney has dealt with northern ireland in his work and acknowledges that his point of view supports roman catholic charges of harsh discrimination by the protestant majority he left the britishruled province in the early 1970 s after he was threatened by protestant paramilitary guerrillas there has been a new mood in the country since last year , he said , clearly referring to the peace effort that accelerated when the irish republican army declared a ceasefire more than 13 months ago it s a very precious mood because it promises new energy i'm also gratified that i 've been honored as part of that i 've a very strong sense of belonging to the north , and of course i insist on being irish referring to the province of his birth and the 25 years of sectarian warfare between catholics and protestants there , he added , one does n't want one s identity coerced but i 've said the british irish in the north should n't be coerced out of their identity , either when the award was first announced , mr heaney s childhood friend , john hume , the roman catholic political leader instrumental in starting the current peace effort , said he hoped the prize was for poetry , not politics mr hume has been nominated for this year s nobel peace prize , as has former prime minister albert reynolds , also for his work toward peace the irish times said in an editorial no doubt there will be mutterings from many quarters that the nobel committee has once again made a political choice by awarding the prize to an irishman at the end of a year which has been one of the most hopeful yet perilously balanced periods in the history of our two states such begrudgery , though typical of us as a nation , will only shame us in the eyes of an admiring world at the airport , prime minister bruton said that in the peace effort , i draw encouragement and inspiration from seamus s writing mr heaney , recognized in the streets of dublin by his frizzy white hair , spoke about growing up in the north , where his friends , in addition to mr hume , included the playwright brian friel and the poet seamus deane , who is now a lecturer at notre dame university in indiana 'teenage lads rampant , he said there was a lot of energy , but there was no sense of a future or destiny or anything like that i'm very moved to hear about the pleasure in the country at home i feel myself part of something not only being part of a community , but part of an actual moment and a movement of irish writing and art that sense of being part of the whole thing is the deepest joy photo seamus heaney , the poet , arriving at dublin airport on saturday night from greece , after learning he had won the nobel prize in literature \( reuters \)
meriden , conn , jan 9 they gathered in the blackness of 3 45 am in a commuter parking lot here , pulling their coats around them , shrinking into the seats of the ford club wagon with their lunch boxes and their makeshift pillows and their gruff greetings they drove the 87 miles to the general motors assembly plant in tarrytown , ny , by 6 , still in darkness they worked nine hours on the assembly line as they drove home , the morbid banter rolled on old age , aching muscles , spouses who have become complete strangers , and especially this winter s closing of the gm plant in bristol that took away their old jobs then , somewhere around waterbury , there was a subtle change , immediately perceptible to people who know one another s rhythms ricardo torres stopped joking i do n't think i can take it , said mr torres , 49 , who has worked for gm in connecticut for 22 years he said his new job , installing radiators on the tarrytown assembly line , was killing his hands , which are still sore from carpal tunnel surgery 10 weeks ago the way we work , i do n't think we 're going to make it , he said quietly detroit calls these people gm gypsies , and automotive industry experts say that across the country , as the nation s largest car manufacturer has closed plants and consolidated its parts and assembly systems , tens of thousands of such workers are in similar situations , commuting to the outer limits of endurance for many of them , coworkers have become a support group mr torres s expression of distress transformed the atmosphere today on the ride back from tarrytown sarcastic tones turned earnest hands reached out for a reassuring touch we 'll make it , shouted domnick ferraro from behind the wheel do n't worry , think positive nancy taylor looked back over her seat at mr torres we 've got to do it , she said that s it we 've got to do it in lordstown , ohio , displaced workers converge from across the state , traveling 120 miles or more each way in michigan , thousands of new commuters crisscross from flint to pontiac to saginaw to get to their new jobs other plants , in baltimore and shreveport , la , are staffed mainly with transfers who have moved in from closed gm plants hundreds or thousands of miles away this group from connecticut is among 75 displaced gm workers from the closed parts assembly plant in bristol who are making the daily trek to a place that is both far away and foreign to everything they have ever done , starting all over again in middle age learning jobs intended for 20yearolds about 80 other connecticut workers pulled up stakes completely and moved to ohio , where the bristol plant s work was being consolidated the added twist is that tarrytown is scheduled to close , too , sometime next year even if the displaced bristol workers were assured of permanent jobs in tarrytown , most would be disinclined to relocate in their late 40 s and 50 s , they have homes , children and sometimes grandchildren , and the long daily trip is as much change as they are prepared to deal with for now but the closing of tarrytown , in turn , could send former bristol workers to the next nearest gm plant , in linden , nj linden is another 42 miles past tarrytown , which is 87 miles from their homes near meriden and industry experts say linden s future is also far from certain , and the next gm plant after that is in delaware for new york , the closing of tarrytown will mean the end of car manufacturing in the state , although thousands are still employed making car parts in plants in rochester , syracuse and elsewhere for connecticut , the end is already here closing the bristol factory ended the last vestige of the car business none of the big three auto makers have any production in the state now prof sean mcalinden , a research scientist at the office for the study of automotive transport at the university of michigan , estimates that 120 , 000 gm production workers have had to move or commute 90 miles or more to keep their jobs he said he thinks the company s policy of trying to maintain work for current employees even as the company shrinks is humane , however wrenching it seems still , the bristol group , he said , is probably singular because tarrytown s scheduled closing means there is no incentive for anyone to relocate they 're stuck with this commute , he said certainly , many people would jump at the chance to make the salaries auto workers earn , upward of 21 an hour , with a generous benefits package and while thousands of people work on car assembly lines all the way to retirement , learning its ways in the late 40 s or 50 s is another matter altogether two members of this car pool , for example , have already been injured on the job after only one week general motors did not allow a reporter into the tarrytown plant , saying through a spokeswoman that a story about the bristol transfers would not be in gm s interest mrs taylor said there are people our age and older who have been doing it for a long time , but their bodies are accustomed to it we 're in shock when we walk out of there , we can just about lift up our legs to get in the van

nablus , west bank , dec 19 in the alleys of the casbah , a maze of centuriesold dwellings in the heart of nablus , portraits on peeling posters are all that remain of local heroes whose time has suddenly passed the men on the posters were killed in armed clashes with israeli soldiers and were revered as martyrs by a generation of young palestinians bred on the culture of violent rebellion that flourished here during the sevenyear uprising against israel that erupted in 1987 but the withdrawal of the israelis and the arrival of a palestinian police force last week have made such gunmen and their militant culture irrelevant the police wasted no time in moving against the remaining militants this week , rounding up dozens of fatah hawks , an armed group based in the casbah the hawks specialized in kneecap shootings and killing people suspected of informing for israel , selling drugs or sexual promiscuity at least one member of the group who refused to surrender was wounded in a shootout , and the gang s leader , ahmad tabouk , was arrested after a siege on sunday as palestinian selfrule takes hold here and across the west bank , officials of the palestinian authority face the challenge of dismantling old myths and helping to rebuild a society deeply scarred by the years of revolt , known as the intifada in defying the israelis , leaders of the uprising had also broken the authority of an older generation of palestinians parents , teachers and community leaders who had passively borne the indignities of occupation for two decades discarding these traditional rolemodels , young militants often turned to violence and guns to enforce a rough discipline on their people , disrupting normal life with strikes and protests , and torturing and killing hundreds accused of collaborating with israel nablus , a center of palestinian nationalism and the largest city in the west bank , was the site of some of the deadliest street battles of the intifada but the unrest also took a heavy social toll an atmosphere of lawlessness and the erosion of israeli control had led to soaring theft , and to clashes between rival gangs who held up shopkeepers and violently extorted money from businesses accustomed to defiance , these young rebels now have to submit to their own leadership but many still seem wedded to the symbols of armed resistance when the palestinian police moved into nablus last week , young men donned fatigues and swaggered through town shooting off guns they had kept hidden during the years of occupation a shopkeeper in the casbah did a brisk business in militarystyle clothing , the sale of which was banned under israeli rule today , however , with the police out on the streets and strict orders in force against brandishing or firing weapons , the makeshift uniforms are gone , and many young men said they were prepared to accept palestinian rule before we were rebelling against occupation , but we accept the authority of our brothers , said taher shtawi , who recently completed a fiveyear prison term for stonethrowing and other antiisraeli protests he said he was training to join the police mahmoud aloul , the new palestinian governor of nablus , who directed the crackdown on the fatah hawks , said the time had come for new priorities we 're now in the building stage , and work clothes are more important than military uniforms , he said in an interview the intifada was politically beneficial but it damaged the social structure and created a generation of rebels we have to train this generation now to take part in rebuilding society in this job , the palestinian authority has the backing of many ordinary people , said khalil shikaki , director of a political research center in nablus people want stability , economic prosperity , and law and order , he said there is a craving for normalcy reconstruction is needed on many fronts at the height of the celebrations in nablus last week , for example , young men crippled in the intifada complained bitterly to reporters that they were being neglected by the palestinian authority , which has been in charge of health , education and welfare in the west bank during the last year their monthly stipends of about 70 a month were a pittance and failed to arrive on time , they said we have the right to treatment , rehabilitation and work , said mohammed shaghnuba , who was shot several times in the leg in a raid by israeli undercover soldiers we should be able to make a respectable living we sacrificed the most valuable thing we have , and without us none of this would have been achieved zuheir dibi , a prominent journalist who publishes a local newspaper and serves as a mosque preacher , said the most pressing need was to build a sound basis for civilian life without the trappings of militarystyle rule the palestinian authority has to draw up programs and laws , and build institutions , he said real independence is economic independence the focus has to be on education and construction , and people have to make a profound change in their mentality , their culture and their customs i said in a sermon that strength is not measured by the gun , or by the losses you inflict on the other side , but by what you build for yourself photo children in nablus in the west bank , flanked by palestinianauthority police , flashed peace signs last week while brandishing the guns that were illegal under israeli occupation nablus came under selfrule last week \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \) map shows the location of

center prison , only time and tyson will be able to determine more than 200 reporters and camera crews , along with hundreds of curiosity seekers , some wearing tshirts that read , tyson is back , waited for hours in the cold and dark outside the low , redbrick administration building here about 18 miles east of indianapolis to witness the 28yearold tyson step into a waiting black limousine after serving three years and six weeks of a sixyear sentence for a rape conviction tyson s departure at 6 15 am , with his retinue encircling him , was reminiscent of his scenes from the ring , except for the expression on the former champion s face there was none of the arrogance and swagger so often associated with him , after having mercilessly dispatched an opponent , or on the witness stand at his trial in 1992 , haughtily snatching a garment in evidence worn by his accuser , desiree washington , then an 18yearold beauty pageant contestant at the black expo in indianapolis and now a fifthgrade student teacher in pawtucket , ri followed by don king , the boxing promoter and tyson s svengali , and surrounded by john horne and rory holloway , tyson s comanagers , and fruit of islam bodyguards , tyson emerged from the doorway of the building wearing a dark suit and an crocheted , eggshell islamic prayer cap , he was shielded from the cameras by a bodyguard who spread open his black leather coat tyson s eyes darted momentarily to take in the spectacle on either side of the building were the 10foothigh barbed wire fences that shown silvery in the wide expanse and many light stanchions of the prison area armed guards watched from nearby towers , and faces appeared from behind bars in the lighted windows of tiered cellblocks to observe the scene outside from around the country and from such places as japan and italy and england and brazil , several hundred reporters and camera crews , restrained behind the kind of yellow tape familiar in crime or accident scenes , stood in the nearfreezing morning amid vans and satellite dishes and glaring television lights to catch a glimpse of tyson several radiostation helicopters whirred overhead in the stillblack sky that was illuminated with a sprinkling of stars and a quarter moon before leaving prison , tyson filled out the count form , which states that he will not be among the 1 , 130 prisoners who must be accounted for , and signed a probation form , and is on probation for the next four years on monday , he must report to his probation officer in ohio when i saw him before he left , he said , 'goodbye , and thanks , ' nothing more , said phil slavens , assistant superintendent for the prison , who noticed tyson was reading ring magazine in his cell tyson did not acknowledge the crowd , but a statement was released that said i'm very happy to be out and on my way home i want to thank everyone for their support i will have more to say in the future i 'll see you all soon the limousine with king , horne , holloway and monica turner , a georgetown medical student whom slavens said had visited tyson before , arrived at 5 52 am with members of the fruit of islam in a red lincoln in front of it and a blue buick in back when tyson climbed into the limo and the cars pulled away , there was a chase , some in cars and some on foot there had been rumors that tyson would join muslims in prayer on the lawn of a dance studio across moon road the prison but that never materialized as the cars kept driving past the location tyson s multicar entourage then sped to the headquarters of the islamic society of north america , a mosque about five miles from the prison tyson , who is said to have converted to islam two years ago , was joined in prayers by muhammad ali , the former heavyweight champion and covert to islam , and the rapper hammer , who is not a muslim tyson has not publicly declared his religious affiliation , though in 1988 he was formally baptized , with the rev jesse jackson presiding he then was flown by private jet from the indianapolis international airport to youngstownwarren municipal airport in ohio and was driven to his 66acre farm in southington , near youngstown nine months ago , tyson had attempted to have his prison sentence reduced in an indianapolis courthouse in which he was brought in blue prison clothes and handcuffs , tyson told the judge he had witnessed things that could totally drive someone insane tyson , who once described himself as the baddest man on the planet , told the court he had changed i was young , i was arrogant , i did n't treat people correctly , he said i 've changed but tyson , or offender no 92335 in the indiana youth center , was n't convincing to the judge , patricia j gifford , particularly because he had neglected to attend classes regularly for completion of a high school equivalency program that was part of the rehabilitation program and because , while he said he was sorry about the situation , he never formally apologized to washington , with whom he maintains he had consensual sex gifford ordered the fighter to complete his sentence but had he changed \? it seems he s matured , said slavens he seemed at peace with himself
little fanfare attends the efforts this week of united states marines helping to evacuate the last united nations forces from somalia two years ago and one beach away , 26 , 000 americans troops waded ashore in a televised spectacular meant to symbolize a new humanitarian vocation for the united states military after the end of the cold war nobody wants to talk about that symbolism now somalia , including the death of 30 americans , has become a cautionary example of a mercy mission gone wrong , cited mainly by those who would keep americans out of future peacekeeping the story of international intervention in somalia is not as negative as conventional wisdom holds yes , with the departure of the last un troops , anarchy and civil war are quickly returning idealistic assumptions , illconceived expansion of the mission and fatal confusions over command and control marred military operations they cost the lives of 100 peacekeepers and several hundred somalis as the focus shifted from delivering food to hunting down gen mohammed farah aidid but this time the fighting has not engulfed the food supply , so it is unlikely the deadly starvation that inspired international action will soon return some 350 , 000 somalis died of hunger before president bush sent the first american troops in december 1992 perhaps 250 , 000 more were saved by the americans and the un forces that followed lessons need to be learned from the many mistakes made by washington and the united nations but the painful somalia experience warrants tempered pride , not shame the appropriate conclusion is to proceed with greater caution in future humanitarian emergencies americans want to help when they see people starving it is a human impulse sometimes soldiers can and should provide the help but the need for soldiers instead of relief workers usually means the humanitarian crisis cannot be solved without subduing military conflict first before political leaders send troops into these situations , they need to analyze the risks , define a mission that can be accomplished at acceptable costs and then honestly explain the decision to the american people and seek congressional approval none of that ground was adequately covered for the somalia operation by the bush administration , which launched it , or the clinton administration , which expanded it american mistakes were compounded by un secretary general boutros ghali , who allowed the un to become embroiled in local clan feuds , compromising its neutrality the worst errors were made by the un security council with the enthusiastic participation of the united states , it hastily converted a food delivery operation into an ambitious and ultimately futile exercise in nationbuilding , coupled with a searchanddestroy war against general aidid blame for the mistakes of somalia can be widely shared but so can credit for the larger good that was done , and now seems all but forgotten
palermo , sicily three years into italy s latest and most successful war against the mafia , palermo s anticrime prosecutors have growing doubts whether the italian state still has the will to pursue the war to its next , most sensitive stage we feel alone , and we are beginning to wonder whether there is anybody backing us , said roberto scarpinato , a deputy prosecutor in palermo we are at a delicate phase either we go forward as we have in the last two years , or in a few months , we could lose everything we have gained in a recent interview , giancarlo caselli , the chief antimafia prosecutor in palermo , spoke elliptically about shadows that have begun to cloud his team s ability to function effectively , at a time when it had begun to shed light on the political and financial connections that made the mafia seem to be such an invincible machine it is not up to us here to ask why this is happening , mr caselli said all we can do is register the light and the shadows , and the danger of the shadows most experts agree that italy has scored a string of extraordinary successes since 1992 , the year the mafia killed two respected and effective investigators , giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino , in separate bombings the killings produced a wave of popular revulsion against the mafia , and led to the passage of laws that gave both the police and judges new weapons in their revvedup fight against organized crime with testimony provided by pentiti , or repenters , as informers are called here , italian judges have succeeded in putting most of the top leaders of the mafia behind bars , where they are kept isolated under a strict regime designed to block their contact with the outside world the crack in the sicilian code of silence , omerta , has been law enforcement s biggest gain , and the mafia s greatest loss , which explains at least two recent killings in palermo where the victims were relatives of known or incipient informers omerta is one of the characteristics of the mafia , and they defend it strenuously , said gen giovanni verdicchio , who heads the national antimafia investigation department in rome the strength of the mafia lies in the death of the traitor the last years have also produced significant success in the effort to slow drug trafficking into and through italy , a major source of revenue for the mafia and other organized crime groups in southern italy last year the police intercepted a record 6 , 631 kilograms of cocaine , or roughly 14 , 600 pounds , most of it in a single haul in a shipment of shoes from south america seizures of heroin and marijuana also rose the weakening of the mafia has made drug trafficking weaker , and easier to fight , general verdicchio said investigations have also produced new information on the mafia s widespread moneylaundering operations experts estimate that organized crime groups in italy , of which the mafia is still the most powerful , move about 45 billion each year although only a small amount has been confiscated , the recent arrest of a mafia bag man in eastern sicily has led to ongoing investigation of a reported 14 billion stashed in foreign banks but the most sensitive arena for the palermo team lies in the collusion between the mafia and politics , a link that for decades gave organized crime the protection it needed to survive past campaigns against it here , too , investigators have had help from a former man of honor , as mafiosi who have undergone formal induction into the mob are called , who was once an elected official in the old christian democratic party his testimony will figure in the case against former prime minister giulio andreotti , who is to go on trial in september on charges of acting as the mafia s protector in rome but as their investigations go deeper into the mafia s links to the noncriminal world , prosecutors in palermo say they find themselves running into unexpected , and sometimes inexplicable , difficulties at the moment not surprisingly , when we have begun to investigate politics , the attack has become virulent , said a deputy prosecutor , guido lo forte the virulence is a sign that something in our work causes a risk to someone , someone who has not been touched until recently mr caselli pointed to a rash of criticism that has been directed not only against the antimafia team , but also against the informers and against the law that guarantees reduced sentences and special protection in return for cooperation to date , more than 900 informers have joined the government s witnessprotection program but in recent weeks the program has begun to show significant cracks two key informers francesco marino mannoia and baldassare di maggio , both witnesses in the andreotti trial announced recently that they would stop testifying in protest over the government s failure to keep its end of the bargain mr di maggio s role as an informer has already proved invaluable for state investigators in 1993 he turned in salvatore \( toto \) riina , the reputed boss of all bosses of the mafia , who climbed to power in the 1980 s after a gang war that wiped out the heads of the rival mafia families but even with mr riina in jail serving nine life sentences , his mafia family has maintained its hold and although informers have given prosecutors enough evidence to bring the falcone and borsellino cases to court , four top mafia bosses are still on the loose , presumed to be hiding somewhere in sicily , protected by the bonds of fear and intimidation that have always been the source of the mafia s strength the recent killings in sicily are thought to have been both a retaliation against relatives of informers and a settling of old accounts , carried out by a younger generation of mafiosi eager to prove themselves worthy of leadership , mafia experts said with the unemployment rate in palermo now at almost 30 percent , the mafia remains a powerful economic force , providing work to young men who otherwise would have none it is not enough to fight against organized crime , said achille serra , recently appointed by rome as the prefect in palermo many young people in palermo know they will never find work , which makes it all the more difficult to extract them from a life of crime prosecutors have few illusions about the mafia s ability to weather the state s periodic campaigns against it , which rise and fall on the wave of public reaction to horrific crimes , like the falcone and borsellino killings you can arrest 200 mafiosi , and 10 of its leaders , but that will never be enough because like a living organism , this is an organization that regenerates itself , mr scarpinato said to say the mafia is weaker because of arrests is an optical illusion luciano violante , a former prosecutor who also headed parliament s antimafia commission , also thinks the government s latest efforts are in danger of being swept away by a shift of political winds in rome and in sicily , where the mafia has long ruled through unspoken commands and unwritten laws , it does not take much for local people to detect even the most subtle slackening on the part of the state let s say we are the police , and we see a suspicious car driven by a mafioso , mr violante said if the political determination is there , and there is a strong will of the state , we will stop the car because it is our duty but if the political world is divided , and if politicians say that the fight against the mafia is a conspiracy of the left , if the political world is protective , then we will let it go photo when salvatore \( toto \) riina , a major mafia boss , was captured in 1993 , convicted and sentenced to nine life sentences , prosecutors thought they had the mob on the run now they are not so sure \( reuters , 1993 \)

east rutherford , nj , nov 27 sometimes the honesty of dan reeves is refreshing , but sometimes it simply gets him into hot water today , as he talked about his thinking on the controversial fourthdown play near the end of sunday s loss to chicago , he made an admission that is stunning for any pro coach that he changed his call because he was wary of how the crowd would react the play in question came with 55 seconds left in the game , the score tied at 24 and the giants facing a fourthand4 at the chicago 32yard line reeves decided to go for the first down instead of trying a 49yard field goal , and dave brown s pass to howard cross was incomplete the bears took over and drove for the winning field goal reeves said today that he at first wanted to punt and he actually sent in the play to brown the giants were going to have brown quickkick , something they had done once earlier this season a quickkick would likely have caught the bears by surprise and pinned them deep in their territory but reeves called a timeout and decided to change the call and go for the first down because , he basically said , he was afraid of the chorus of boos from the 70 , 000 fans at giants stadium you know what the biggest thought was \? reeves said , 'you are n't going to believe the crowd when they boo when they punt this football' and that was the thing that went through my mind i said , 'let s talk about this and make sure this is what i want to do' when asked why the crowd would figure into his decision , he said i do n't know why that would be if you were in contention , you would n't worry about it because you 're more concerned about the game but when you 're at a position of 38 , it enters into it reeves then tried to back off his admission that was n't a factor , he said you 're asking me what my thought process was , my thought process was to punt the football there was n't any question about it he added that he was used to being booed from his days as a player in dallas and as a coach in denver , where they would sometimes boo him at halftime reeves s comments , coming so soon after his assertion that he would not stay with the giants when his contract ran out after the 1997 season if the current management structure stayed the same , could get him in deeper trouble with his bosses it could also intensify debate over whether he can last beyond this year distractions happen in losing seasons but there have been times when reeves has brought the distractions upon himself and the team it s unusual for any coach to say that the crowd would affect his decision only a day earlier he had dismissed the fans' opinions , saying after the loss most of these people have never been in an arena in their life they 're swayed a great deal by what they see , what they hear and what they read i ca n't control that reeves also reiterated his conviction that he was correct in going for the first down , saying he would do the same thing again in that situation it s getting to the point where it almost seems as if reeves is trying to shake up the team and it is getting to the point where the giants \( 39 \) , losers of four straight and tied with washington , jacksonville and the jets for the worst record in the league , may not win another game this season of course it s disappointing , running back tyrone wheatley said you fight , you play your heart out week after week it really feels bad to keep losing it s not like we were n't trying hard we just came up short same old , same old the giants have four games left and none of them are easy the season has gone from one in which the team set a goal of an 115 record and now will have to fight to keep from finishing with the worst record in the national football league also , reeves is assured of having only his third losing season in 15 years as a professional head coach everyone is trying so hard to win , to make a play running back keith elias said sometimes you have to let things happen and we have n't been doing that it would almost be easier if we were losing 500 , but to be in every game like we have just makes it more frustrating it does n't get any easier for the giants they travel to arizona to play the cardinals in a nationally televised game on thursday night in order to get acclimated to the time change , the giants were scheduled to leave for phoenix this evening new york always has a tough time with the cardinals under reeves the giants were 22 against the cardinals coming into this season the giants won the first meeting , 2721 , in overtime on oct 8 at giants stadium after arizona comes a home game against washington , then a road game against dallas , perhaps the best team in the league the giants are 26 against the cowboys since 1991 the season finale is a home game against san diego the giants and chargers have played only six times , the last time in 1989 when the giants won , 2013 the problem for new york is that it will be playing for pride and playing out the string extra point running back rodney hampton needs only three more rushing touchdowns to pass joe morris \( 48 \) on the giants' career list he also needs 186 yards over the final four games \( a 465 average \) to get his fifth consecutive 1 , 000yard season
philadelphia a recent morning robert j hall , publisher of knightridder inc s two philadelphia daily newspapers , is discussing his latest costcutting plan with a visiting reporter his papers' reporters will no longer be able to call directory assistance , he says they have this incredible thing called a phone directory two hours later maxwell e p king , editor of the philadelphia inquirer , the respected broadsheet , sputters when a visitor describes the publisher s plan we 're not cutting directory assistance for reporters , he says reporters on deadline often need to get telephone numbers quickly several days later zachary stalberg , editor of the philadelphia daily news , the scrappy tabloid , says , yes , the papers are cutting directory assistance for many reporters the publisher insists , he says this little melodrama of confusion and discord was not fictional it happened at the philadelphia newspapers in recent days and , in one way or another , it is happening at most large american newspapers , as publishers and editors struggle with the intense pressures of rising costs for newsprint , sharp pressure for profits and , often , declining circulation sometimes , the cost slashing and bickering reach the level of slapstick , as in the great directoryassistance debate but sometimes , they get quite serious as a result of a corporate mandate to nearly double profits at the two newspapers , at least 230 to 250 of 3 , 300 jobs are to be lost at the philadelphia papers , mostly through buyouts and attrition also , sections of the papers are to be discontinued or offered to readers less frequently and no one yet knows how far the costcutting will go among newspaper people in philadelphia , a marathon of open debate is expected to reach a climax on nov 9 mr hall and the other leaders of the two papers are due in miami that day for a budget review at knightridder corporate headquarters the philadelphia newspaper executives are to be tested , in effect , on whether they have planned enough cuts to satisfy the corporation many newspaper people here say the meeting may be a watershed , not only for their papers but also for knightridder , one of the country s largest newspaper publishing companies , with 26 other dailies it s a simple question really , said robert j rosenthal , an associate managing editor at the inquirer who expressed the views of many of his colleagues at both papers do the people who are making these decisions believe publishing a quality newspaper over time is a good business strategy or do they believe an inferior newspaper will make as much money \? people involved in planning the cuts said knightridder had never before seemed as willing to make the biggest cut of all , to consider turning philadelphia into a onenewspaper town by killing the philadelphia daily news the daily news has always been the financially weaker sibling of the much larger inquirer , which is one of the country s 15largest newspapers , and the daily news s imminent death has been frequently predicted in the past mr hall has expressly declined to rule out closing the paper the fervor to cut costs has provoked an unusually open discussion here , a microcosm of the debate inside many publicly owned newspaper companies in recent months the editors of both philadelphia papers have been unusually open in discussing their anxieties about the future mr stalberg told readers in a column in october that among the challenges facing the daily news was what appears to be a loss of faith in the old maxims of the newspaper business for example , he said , he was no longer certain that business executives still believed that newspaper quality is the best route to a strong bottom line in an interview , mr king of the inquirer said he understood the need to increase profits but , he added , the concern i have expressed is the pace the pace may be so abrupt as to disadvantage us long term but mr hall , the publisher , said let s make the tough decisions now let s get over it to the delight of some wall street analysts , p anthony ridder , knightridder s chairman and chief executive , indicated at a briefing for securities analysts on nov 2 that he was determined to improve profits in philadelphia but the next day , in response to a request for an interview with mr ridder , a spokesman for the company , polk laffoon 4th , read a statement knightridder newspapers have always been highly regarded for their editorial quality and none any more so than our papers in philadelphia that is not going to change several costcutting offerings have already been agreed upon for mr hall s trip to miami both philadelphia papers will lose features and staff , and the inquirer will retreat from a strategy , which took years to put into effect , of publishing separate zoned sections for the suburbs the paper will soon fold suburban coverage into its metropolitan section , with a total reduction of about 20 percent in the amount of local news supplied to readers to lift profits , both papers risked losing readers by raising newsstand prices at the end of october the inquirer , with a weekday circulation of about 470 , 000 , is now 50 cents , up from 35 cents , and the daily news , with a circulation of about 195 , 000 , is now 60 cents , up from 50 cents still to be decided will the newspapers' unions , in exchange for a contract until the year 2000 , give management enough concessions to avoid more cutbacks \? will the inquirer still publish a sunday magazine , which many at that paper see as an important part of the profitable sunday inquirer and some consider a hallmark of a worldclass newspaper \? and will the daily news survive \? the debate here began this summer , when mr hall let it be known that he was under orders from his corporate chiefs in miami to get profits up fast the immediate target was a profit improvement from about 30 million to about 60 million , according to people familiar with the papers' finances the papers' operating profit margin of about 8 percent , on revenue of about 455 million , was no longer acceptable , mr hall told staff members next year , mr hall must hit a profit margin of 12 percent , people at the papers said , and the year after that 15 percent , which would still be lower than knightridder s corporate average of 165 percent some large publicly held newspaper companies , like the gannett company and the tribune company , have newspapers with profit margins of 20 percent or higher knightridder s stock has been lackluster , perhaps because of shareholder dissatisfaction with profits , several analysts said among the top newspaper executives in philadelphia , the message from miami was clear , several of them said mr ridder and his aides wanted to improve the corporate bottom line by pressing their newspapers for higher profits and knightridder could get a large lift from philadelphia , the company s biggest newspaper property , where the two papers account for 18 percent of the company s revenue if mr hall and his aides do not meet the corporate goals , one member of the paper s management group said , there was a clear or else from miami the manager , who requested anonymity , said , everybody s assuming the 'or else' would be , 'we 'll step in , either with the current people or with new people , and we 'll make suggestions'
a huge turnofthecentury water main ruptured just south of times square shortly before dawn yesterday a geyser of floodwaters that surged unchecked for six hours turned seventh avenue into a small lake and two subway lines into rivers that ran chestdeep and fast to greenwich village , two miles away no one was injured , and damage was limited to the broken main , a cratered street and flooded basements around the site at 40th street and seventh avenue but the spectacular break halted all seventh and eighth avenue subway service , created huge traffic snarls in midtown manhattan and left the city with an enormous cleanup job in mudcaked , debrisstrewn subway stations and tunnels service on the eighth avenue line resumed in midafternoon , several hours after emergency crews capped the broken main and began pumping out the flooded tunnels but while transit officials said they hoped to restore some service on the seventh avenue irt for this morning s commute , they advised riders to expect delays and to take alternate lines we recommend that riders take the eighth avenue ind line or the lexington avenue irt , said joseph hofmann , a senior transit authority official , at a 10 pm news conference i'm not saying we 're giving up on the seventh avenue , but we do n't know what kind of service we will have traffic on 40th street at the site of the break was expected to be cut off for repairs for the rest of the week , and seventh avenue was to be only partially open drivers were urged to avoid the area while new yorkers and visitors faced confusion and delays in getting around midtown manhattan yesterday and a few riders had to evacuate two trains caught in the subterranean flood , city officials said the break s timing was lucky , coming on a day when most businesses in the area were closed , and providing a full day for repairs and cleanup before the start of the work week and they noted that despite a drop in water pressure , there had been no loss of water to businesses or residents it was just rerouted on the grid of mains serving the area , and it was clean and drinkable moreover , they said , electric and gas service in the area were not affected only one building lost its telephone service , and no traces of asbestos were found in air samples luck was in our favor this time , said james peterson , a spokesman for con edison the break occurred just two blocks north of the spot where another water main ruptured in 1983 , flooding an underground power station and plunging the garment district into a weeklong blackout that shut down 4 , 000 businesses and cost millions the cause of yesterday s break was not immediately determined , but officials noted that the 48inch castiron main was brittle with age it had been laid in 1902 and carried 10 million gallons of water a day and for decades had been subjected to the stress and vibration of traffic overhead and subways nearby what might have been just another sleepy sunday morning for denizens of the broadway theater district known as the crossroads of the world turned into a sirenwailing , lightflashing spectacle shortly before 5 15 am as a 25foot crater suddenly erupted from the asphalt on 40th street , just east of seventh avenue , and millions of gallons of water began gushing and whooshing the water flooded streets for blocks around and cascaded through air vents and other grates into the seventh and eighth avenue subway lines subway track beds became surging streams that rose above the third rail at times square and , farther south , above platforms at 34th and 14th streets the water surged as far as the christopher street station in greenwich village on the seventh avenue line , the waters halted a southbound express at times square and flooded into the cars of a northbound local at 14th street both trains were safely evacuated , and the no 1 train stalled at 14th street was moved from the station around midnight service on the seventh avenue 1 , 2 , 3 and 9 lines and the eighth avenue a , c and e lines was halted in both directions through midtown we shut them down as soon as the water started rising , said charles seaton , a transit spokesman we were lucky it was so early in the morning and it was a sunday meanwhile , crews from the city s department of environmental protection began the difficult task of trying to shut off the water it was not simply a matter of finding and closing a nearby shutoff valve , officials said doing that could have abruptly increased pressure in nearby mains , raising the risk of other breaks eventually , by adjusting and closing no fewer than a dozen valves in the grid of mains under midtown streets , water flowing to the broken main was shut off at 11 30 am by then , pumping had begun in basements ,

when murray eisenstadt asked althea gibson to give a tennis clinic at brooklyn s midwood high school in january 1958 , he felt her monumental visit would accomplish two goals gibson , at the time the united states' topranked female player , was looking to build on the fame gained a year earlier by winning wimbledon and becoming the first africanamerican to win a major tennis championship eisenstadt , a teacher and tennis coach at midwood since 1944 , believed that a visit by an international champion would energize his argument that the new york city public school system was an untapped cauldron of tennis talent he felt that gibson , who got her start on courts in harlem , would be the catalyst for a marriage between tennis and the city s public schools thirtyseven years later , neither goal has fully materialized gibson , as one of only two africanamericans to win a major tennis championship , is a cultural symbol but never became the pied piper like jackie robinson in baseball in many ways she is a monument to the failure of tennis to become an equalopportunity american pastime eisenstadt has not seen his vision of bustling public school tennis competition materialize , but time has not broken his spirit in fact , at 84 , he s more of a zealot than he was in 1958 i'm out of the system , he said , but the flame still burns his message is the same tennis will find gold in the new york city public school system once it discovers how to mine the resource there are some great treasures hidden among these 11 million kids in the new york public school system , he said some of those treasures have come out in the more glamorous sports how do we find them and put them in tennis \? eisenstadt , once a liaison between the public schools athletic league and the united states tennis association , proposes a creative , aggressive plan called early identification that is aimed at recruiting great athletes into the sport under eisenstadt s plan , the usta would assign 10 scouts to cover the public school system s 32 districts on a daily basis each scout would be responsible for three schools athletes would be put through a battery of tests running , jumping , handeye coordination , reaction , he said the screening would go on for 180 days each year when we get the best athletes from 32 districts , boys and girls , we will take them to the wonderful teaching programs of the usta , he said we 're looking for the best athletes we will make them tennis players the junior tennis league , founded in 1970 by arthur ashe and supported by the usta , has been the most consistent presence aimed at young players but even it has its limits the junior tennis league is doing a great job , eisenstadt said it s helped motivate tennis and kept it going but there s something lacking what is lacking is that in all of its 25 years of existence , how many players has it had in the us open draw \? speaking to jim o'neil , the executive director of the national junior tennis league , i realized eisenstadt s plan is on the mark o'neil spoke enthusiastically about the league s impressive budget , the 325 schools that have afterschool programs and the new 800 , 000 bronx international youth tennis center with all the resources , however , only seven junior league players have achieved national ranking only one has played in the open , none in this year s tournament even o'neil admitted we have to get more serious , we have to do a better job in identifying talent the question is how \? no the question is do you really want to \? as solid as eisenstadt s early identification plan appears , athleticism is only a partial answer to integrating tennis althea gibson was a remarkable athlete she was tall , lean and quick and dominated the court she won wimbledon but never became the heroine she should have become for her pioneering alone the door she opened was rapidly closed and has been reluctantly cracked , at best , ever since in sports like tennis , with its countryclub and corporate ties , desegregation has been slow the game of tennis has been less an obstacle than the culture of tennis this is precisely what makes eisenstadt s plan to go after superior athletes not merely good but necessary it will take a tremendous leap to clear the sport s wellentrenched hurdle photo murray eisenstadt \( steve hart for the new york times \)
the naked heart the bourgeois experience victoria to freud volume 4 by peter gay illustrated 463 pp new york w w norton company 2995 peter gay is the author of many books , but his multi volume work the bourgeois experience victoria to freud is clearly meant to be his masterpiece the naked heart is the fourth volume of the series , and it seems there is at least one more to come the first , education of the senses \( 1984 \) , was intended to revise conventional notions of the place of sex in 19thcentury bourgeois culture it was followed two years later by the tender passion , which moved the inquiry from sex to love in 1993 there followed the cultivation of hatred these are all very long books , discursive in method but carefully annotated , supplemented by huge bibliographical essays and animated by the same freudian interest in the discontents induced by the conflict between what human beings desire and what their civilization permits freud is not only mr gay s terminus but his mentor his presence is decisive without being obtrusive , a sort of ground bass to the evidence , which is drawn from a thousand sources , american , english , french and german these books testify to an astonishing assiduity in research mr gay , the sterling professor of history emeritus at yale university , likes to approach his grand theme anecdotally , and the multitude of case histories he offers constitutes much of the pleasure of reading his work though one may occasionally feel that his passion for storytelling is such that the flood of illustrations swamps the basic argument his first volume opened \( after a valuable general introduction \) with the tale of mabel loomis todd , that reputable , socially ambitious wife and mother who became the mistress of austin dickinson , the treasurer of amherst college and brother of the poet emily mabel todd kept a sexually informative journal , preserved , along with many letters , in several boxes mr gay saw no reason to be economical in his account of this treasure , and , although he has rarely treated other individuals in quite such detail , he showed in his pages on mabel todd how he meant to continue in the earlier volumes mr gay also discussed in his lively , thorough way such matters as victorian sex manuals and courtship customs , but in the third he turned away from the study of love to the study of hatred , sometimes the antithesis , sometimes merely the obverse , of love explaining how this bourgeois society dealt with innate human aggression called for disquisitions on the dueling customs of german students , the cult of manliness , the oppression of women , the appetite for corporal and capital punishment , and much else , above all nationalism and war in short , all the seemingly uncontrollable aggressive forces that the bourgeois conscience had to try to contain mr gay has always emphasized the surviving influence of enlightenment thinking on the 19thcentury bourgeoisie neglect of this influence he takes to be one of the reasons that the conventional representations of that class have been inadequate in the naked heart he takes up the question of its romantic inheritance , most visible in its changing conceptions of selfhood this is not a new topic , but mr gay treats it in his own way he seeks and finds in abundance evidence that the bourgeoisie sought in the 19th century as never before to lay bare their hearts and the efforts of the period to understand individual as well as general human motivation culminate , of course , in freud the new starting point is , rather unexpectedly , music , which mr gay regards as an important indication of a new taste for inwardness that the bourgeoisie inherited from the late 18th century a taste for music , and owned pianos \( which became an index of class \) , is certainly true it is also true that music came to be listened to with reverence and deep emotion mr gay aptly quotes stendhal s remarks that music can provide a deeply regressive communion with one s past wagner and schumann set everybody an example by combining inspiration with craftsmanship , mr gay writes , a coalition of genius and prudence held to be typical of the general cultivation of a controlled inwardness he does mention the phenomenon of bayreuth hysteria , which surely entailed some loss of selfhood , but perhaps you could succumb to the ecstasies of the second act of tristan und isolde without quite forgetting yourself i'm reminded of the french symbolist who urged all poets to proceed to bayreuth on their knees , but reminded them that there was an excellent train service the book really gets going when mr gay begins to talk about romantic literature and its legacy a new sense of selfhood to the victorian bourgeoisie now the romantic egotistical sublime broadened out into a bourgeois egotistical sublime , and one consequence was a profusion of autobiographies , written in rousseau s shadow but constrained by both the fear of saying too little and the fear of saying too much
there are theories galore about the best time to buy a stock when earnings are growing rapidly or the stock is trading below book value , even one that relates to which team wins the super bowl and you ca n't pick up a personalfinance magazine these days without being bombarded with the 10 or 15 , or 20 mutual funds that are absolutely , positively hot , right now ! but wait a second when it comes to selling which goes hand in hand with buying there is almost total silence for all sorts of reasons , investors do n't like to think about selling , and many on wall street are more than happy to oblige by ignoring it , too often , the best the financial pundits have to offer is vague and contradictory conventional wisdom do n't sell winning investments , but be sure to take profits sometimes , though , you must sell for tuition , a house , a wedding , retirement and this year s ripsnorting bull market has nearly everyone wondering if now is the time to cash in at least some investments , before it s too late all too often , though , the silence that surrounds selling makes the act haphazard at best a stock drops , investors panic and sell when they should hold investors get attached to particular stocks or want to avoid capitalgains taxes and hold when they should sell but panic selling and blind devotion can be hazardous to net worth whether buying or selling , put emotion aside , get a plan and stick with it , the experts say while there s no guarantee that you still wo n't make a mistake , your odds of getting out at the right time are a lot better which is why plenty of astute professionals pay a great deal of attention to selling most pros try to follow general rules , and they tend to agree that if you would n't buy a stock at its current price , it s probably time to unload it some sell when a stock rises a certain percentage others pick a target value and sell when the stock nears that level take robert sanborn , manager of the oakmark fund , among the top mutual funds recently mr sanborn sells a stock as soon as it hits 90 percent of the value he places on it , an estimate that he continually updates based on his appraisal of the company s underlying business other successful investors , whatever their specific strategies , share a faith in rules that govern sell decisions the sell discipline is probably more important than the buy discipline , agreed paul greenwood , a senior research analyst at the frank russell company , the tacoma , wash , pension fund consultants who follow more than 1 , 700 portfolio managers if there s a common thread among the best managers , it s a strong sell discipline panic selling but such discipline is in short supply , and the psychological forces surrounding selling are strong people are reluctant to engage in the kind of soul searching that goes on when buying , and it s not hard to see why when people buy a stock or mutual fund , they are usually full of optimism about a company s prospects or a manager s stockpicking abilities when it comes time to sell , the opposite is true there s a whole attitude of defeat associated with selling , noted eugene lerner , a former finance professor who now runs disciplined investment advisors , an evanston , ill , money management firm it s an act of rejection because people tend to identify themselves so closely with their investments , they become unable to sell under any circumstance people use the market to validate their selfesteem , mr geist explained if a stock or mutual fund goes up , they 're so busy patting themselves on the back for being smart that they miss signs of trouble if the investment goes down , they do n't want to admit to having made a mistake many individual investors , and even some pros , sell only in a panic they are whipsawed by the market , selling only when their stocks or funds are down during last year s bond market debacle , bond fund investors rushed for the exits just as prices were touching bottom , according to a study by the david l babson company , the cambridge , mass , investment management firm by the time these investors thought it was safe to venture back , prices had already rebounded this was a classic mistake of buying high and selling low , noted h bradlee perry , babson s former chairman , who now serves as a consultant to the company the same was true during the long and gruesome bear stock market of 1973 and 1974 , said robert bacarella , manager of the monetta fund when he studied which money managers best survived that grizzly downturn , he discovered that those with strict selling rules avoided bailing out at the market s low some people sell as soon as they are faced with a loss , even if their stock or fund would probably have recovered they 're feeling terrible about themselves so they get out as soon as the stock drops , explained richard geist , a waban , mass , psychologist who studies the psychology of investing mr geist said one patient panicked whenever his stocks fell because those losses stirred up childhood feelings of deprivation he would just sell immediately and feel much better , mr geist said
aviano air base , italy , june 10 as he lay in the bushes near where his parachute landed , his face in the dirt and his ears covered with camouflage gloves , capt scott f o'grady thought that a few feet away there were people looking to kill him it was n't that they were just walking around me , the 29yearold pilot said today it was that they were shooting their rifles , and they were n't just shooting at bunny rabbits , because i never saw any bunny rabbits , i never saw a squirrel i think they thought they saw something that was me and were trying to kill me at his first news conference since his dramatic rescue two days ago , captain o'grady , whose f16 jet fighter was downed by a serbian missile while on nato patrol over bosnia , told how he managed to survive for six days in a bosnian forest hiding by day , never sleeping for more than half an hour at a time , moving around only at night , and even then never ranging farther than a mile and a half he scrounged for water even wringing a few drops of rainwater from the wool socks he was wearing and dug for ants and he gave nicknames leroy and alfred to two pestering cows that twice closed in on his hiding place , together with their cowherd , whom he called tinkerbell once , at the start of the news conference , captain o'grady broke down and cried as he listened to a tape of the radio conversation he had in the early hours of thursday with his friend capt thomas o hanford , who is known as t o and was then flying 30 , 000 feet over his hiding place basher 52 reads you loud and clear , said the faint voice from the ground , barely audible over the crackling interference i'm alive help later captain hanford , whose code was basher 11 , asked captain o'grady , basher 52 , to name his squadron in korea juvat , juvat , came the answer copy that , you 're alive good to hear your voice , captain hanford said i am not a rambo , said captain o'grady during the news conference today this is really amazing to me , all this attention i'm getting and everyone saying 'you 're a hero , you 're a hero' naah , i'm not a hero all i was was a scared little bunny rabbit trying to hide , trying to survive captain o'grady , who leaves on sunday for the united states to join his family , said he was still weak i ca n't walk very fast and my feet are pretty bad right now , but i'm ok , he said , adding later that when his leave is over , he wants to go back to his job flying f16 s in a calm , composed voice , captain o'grady told his tale , stopping in several places to praise his rescuers and to thank god for protecting him but what was clear from the narrative was that captain o'grady felt himself to be in danger at all times , even as he was lifted out of bosnia on board a marine helicopter , heading for the amphibious assault ship kearsarge in the adriatic we were flying out and the sergeant leaned over to me and says something about taking fire , he recalled 'hell , yeah , i took fire , ' i said , and he said , 'we 're taking fire now' later , he said , one of the marines showed him a bullet that had penetrated the helicopter but there was also luck , starting with the missile that struck his plane but spared the pilot the first thing i saw was the cockpit disintegrating in front of me , he said there was fire all around me , and this beautiful golden ejection handle between my legs it was the most gorgeous sight i ever saw in his impatience , captain o'grady pulled the cord on his parachute while he was still at a high altitude , and this meant that he made a long and highly visible descent into an area where he could see a military truck and some cars the bad luck was that the only clearing in the sky was where i was at , he said so everyone on the ground could see as i came down they were standing there , watching me the whole time within minutes of his landing , he could hear people he said later they numbered about 10 poking around his parachute after that , people were walking right by me and that continued on for a couple of hours , he said for the first few days , captain o'grady did not worry about eating then he said he ate some grass and leaves , and tried to hunt down some ants in an anthill next to his hideout , but without much success but what i really was , was really thirsty , he said when he had finished the eight fourounce packs of water that had been in his survival kit , he looked for sources of water , but found none then he prayed for rain and god delivered he tried all the tricks he had been taught collecting the rain and later dew into plastic sacks , using a yellow sponge he had with him , then resorting to his socks but , he said , i could n't get much out of them two or three times , he heard nato planes flying overhead , but only during the daytime , when he did not dare reveal himself finally , on wednesday night , he activated the emergency beacon on his radio and moved into a clearing so his signal would be clear i lit up the world , he said i was hopefully trying to let someone know i was there thank god t o was there captain hanford and when i heard three clicks my heart started racing i was really scared he would n't hear me but when he heard me , i knew i was in there , as far as letting everyone know i was alive as far as the rescue , i had no doubt in my mind that nato and the us military were going to do everything in their power to come in and get me , and they did the last scene as he was getting ready to board the helicopter was almost comic , and involved captain o'grady s only apparent infraction of the survival rule book a fog had descended in the valley where he had been hiding , and captain o'grady had fired off red smoke as a locating device he also had a hat , green on one side , orange on the other , that he decided to wear because i figured there would n't be anyone out there , serbian or muslim , walking around with an orange hat , so they would know that if anyone had an orange hat on , it would be a stupid american and he had his ninemillimeter gun , unused until then , which he decided to load at that moment i had the gun out , running through the bushes , through the fog , and i broke into the clearing where the sea stallion helicopters had set down , he said and what did they see but this guy with a huge beard and a ninemillimeter pistol with an orange hat , running at them , going for broke they stopped , they did n't know what to do , he recalled the funny thing about it is that the one thing you are taught to do if someone comes to rescue you , is never run to the helicopter with a loaded weapon photo capt mike kelly , a public affairs officer , yesterday demonstrated the kind of survival kit capt scott f o'grady used

i agree with paul starr s comments about the potentially harmful consequences of managedcare expansion as part of the republicans' program to control medicare and medicaid expenditures \( look who s talking health care reform now , sept 3 \) corporate america is appropriating health care in this country with the sole purpose of making profit , by brutally squeezing doctors and hospitals financially and by restricting , and even denying , hightech care to patients the irony of hmo s aggressively seeking medicare patients is evident from the fact that medicare pays less than 70 percent of actual cost obviously , the only way they can make a profit from these patients is to deny care i can vouch from personal experience that this is increasingly taking place however , i disagree with starr s portrayal of the clinton plan as the solution i opposed the clinton proposal largely because of its complex bureaucratic structure and complete governmental domination , not only of decisions regarding the delivery of health care but also , to some extent , medical scientific and educational activities one of my major concerns with the clinton proposal , as well as with the changes taking place today , is the threat to the academic health centers i have yet to learn of an ideal solution to this complex problem i have had the opportunity to travel and work throughout the world in widely different systems of healthcare provision i found none that i would consider ideal or even better than our own my own view is that the concept of regional medical programs , as proposed in president johnson s commission on heart disease , cancer and stroke , of which i was chairman , provides a reasonably good start in approaching the problem michael e debakey , md houston
glen cove , li , march 1 for 71 straight games , the story of basketball at the webb institute of naval architecture has been depressingly the same webb sinks baskets the other team sinks more a lot more the school , in fact , has not won a game in seven years the last college it beat no longer exists defeat is such a tradition that the streak is not even a record for webb , a fouryear marine engineering school on long island sound that has just 75 students the previous string of 139 consecutive losses began in the early days of the ford administration , and was not broken until the end of ronald reagan s first term given the paucity of euphoric moments in the locker room , it would be understandable if the basketball powersthatbe at webb just gave up but that is not the way at webb forget that webb players perform on the court like fine naval architects forget that the team s star forward has to miss the last two games of the season because he is doing an internship on a ship in the middle of the atlantic ocean forget even that the coach , at just over 6 feet , towers overs most of his players the simple fact is that the webb players , who have never known the pleasure of looking up at the scoreboard at the end of a game and seeing a bigger number on their side , love playing ball and they plan to keep doing it , they say , until they get it right playing college basketball , mused gene miller , the team s center and cocaptain i can think of a dozen guys i 've known who 'd kill for the chance to get their brains beaten out like this it is not that the webb clippers are gluttons for punishment they would probably trade all the kind remarks about their grit , about how courageous it is for a school of 75 students to compete against colleges enrolling thousands , for one cathartic moment of triumph the team got achingly close to that feeling during a game against pratt institute earlier this season , when , in the second half , webb found itself in a wholly unaccustomed position ahead by a point they called a time out , mr miller recalled i could n't believe it we forced a time out ! eventually , pratt came back that night , overwhelming the clippers , 7345 when they went into the locker room , there were no recriminations in fact , the coach , richard harris , an adjunct english professor at webb , was downright proud you can never question their effort , mr harris said the other day as he watched the 11man squad work out in the webb gymnasium we have guys , even 40 points down , diving for the ball they hated having lost to pratt , but they felt good about playing well webb , one of the most academically selective schools in the nation , entertains no dreams of becoming a powerhouse in basketball , although coach harris keeps alive his own little fantasy i'm looking for a 6foot7 guy with great sat s and a messiah complex , he said the school offers no athletic scholarships and allows any student , regardless of ability , to join the team there is none of the typical bigschool pressure to win from the alumni , many of whom , after all , had a hand in that 139game losing streak still , losing takes its toll a few years ago , player availability was so low that during one away game , the coach had to ask a student who had traveled to the game as a spectator to don a uniform so he would have a substitute but this year s crop of players , webb officials say , are among the most highly motivated they have seen in years , resurrecting hope that the string of disconcertingly perfect seasons might soon come to an end we 've cut 30 points off the average margin of defeat , coach harris said and we 've had a number of games where we 've been in it for twothirds of the game one of the team s top talents is john mixon , a sophomore from portland , ore , a mainstay of webb s soccer team , which had a winning season like many of his basketball teammates , he cannot stand the idea that people might be snickering i go out every game to win , he said , sitting in a common room in webb s main building when he gets wind of a cynical comment , he finds it hard to hold his tongue i 'll say , 'last night i scored 18 points what were you doing \? ' he said this week , after the school s traditional hiatus in january and february , when webb students go off for internships around the world and the basketball team must interrupt its 13game schedule , the squad was back in action for two final games on tuesday , the clippers faced the state university at purchase in a tournament for the hudson valley men s athletic conference , of which webb is a new member it is not a member of the national collegiate athletic association , or any other national athletic organization on friday , they play their season finale at cooper union in manhattan the webb clippers travel light for the purchase game in pratt s athletic center in brooklyn during the conference tournament , the only refreshment they brought was a large box of oranges and the only webb fans were two sophomores videotaping the game and a freshman who serves as scorekeeper let s watch the turnovers , mr harris lectured his men in their blue and gold uniforms their necks and thighs looked about half the size of those of the players from purchase , a school of 2 , 400 students that had beaten webb twice this season , by margins of 35 and 36 points from the opening jump ball , it was clear that two months off the court had not done anything for the clippers' skills they did not score for the first five minutes , and managed 9 points the whole half it s a nightmare , muttered mr mixon as he hustled onto the court for the second half he added that his feet were blistering inside his sneakers to no one s surprise , purchase won handily some webb players winced at the final score , 8024 \( gene miller had 14 points \) pete caruso , the purchase coach , said i have a lot of admiration for them what are there , 75 people in the school \? and they go out and have fun and compete \? i really admire it mr harris and scott bodamer , webb s athletic director , ventured into the locker room and told their players as much good effort , mr harris said after the game , the players and coaches got into vans for the ride back to long island one more game to go this season it could be the one to break the streak and if not that one , well , maybe the first game next fall and if not that one these guys really want to win , mr bodamer said we know that it s going to happen photo the basketball team at the webb institute of naval architecture has lost 71 games in a row , including one this week to the state university at purchase , 80 to 24 after the game , the webb coach , richard harris , had praise for the players to assuage the dispiriting if accustomed defeat \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
reaching back to the era of the expressionist d d jackson fez almost by definition , young jazz musicians favor one era over another , and d d jackson , a 28yearold pianist , showed on tuesday night that he likes the decade bw \( before wynton \) there was an interest , then , in finding a rapproachment between the swinging jazz tradition and the experiments of the earlier jazz expressionists , a compromise between noise and consonance mr jackson s show , even though it was limited , did just that , playing with free time and swing , with simple harmony and none at all mr jackson spent two years studying with don pullen , and it showed his improvisations quickly moved into bangedout clusters in two or three pieces he articulated specific harmonies , simple , gospellike chord progressions that mirrored some of the writing of mr pullen , who died last month , and recalled an era when long , freely improvised pieces were capped by an excursion into a celebratory gospel or pop piece mr jackson and his band david murray on saxophone , john geggie on bass and jean martin on drums played mostly at a high volume the pieces , with their slight melodies and mr jackson s habit of using a clump of notes to suggest a general rising or falling of pitch , but not a specific note , became tiresome with all its power and volume , the music took its cue from rock and pop , in valuing emotion over craft ultimately it missed subtlety , the shadows and elegance that give it depth peter watrous

the ohio ballet , directed by heinz poll in akron , remains the engaging company it has always been judging by the first of its two programs , anyone who ambles into the joyce theater this week stands a chance of having more than a good time the highlight of the troupe s opening on tuesday night was a polished , lively revival of an important sociopolitical gem kurt jooss , best known for his 1932 antiwar masterpiece the green table , choreographed the big city the same year in a few cinematic strokes , the german choreographer painted a picture of human character engulfed by forces beyond any control on the surface , this short ballet was a vignette about a poor youth losing his girl to a swell , who deserts her but on the eve of hitler s rise to power , jooss s picture of class divisions and urban alienation in the big city had a deeper meaning the germanborn mr poll trained at mr jooss s school after the war and danced in chile under the direction of charter members of jooss s original company nonetheless , the rest of the program at the joyce \( 175 eighth avenue , at 19th street , chelsea \) has none of the expressionist style represented by jooss and is more typical of the ohio ballet s eclectic repertory lucinda childs s trilogies , one of the local premieres , exemplified mr poll s hospitality to experimental moderndance choreographers the second program will feature works by charles moulton and laura dean trilogies shows ms childs extending herself with an unexpected use of a commissioned jazz score by paul schwartz and also remaining true to her signature style of meticulously repeated patterns mr poll s choreography was represented by his new eight by benny goodman , a clichefree bigband ballet in which xochitl tejeda de cerda is a knockout as a torch singer , and by his 1974 chopin double adagio , summer night , danced outstandingly by ms tejeda de cerda , yumelia garcia and their partners , kyongho kim and david shimotkahara the dancers , in fact , have never looked more mature and assured even the big city , which requires the kind of dramatic projection that americans are rarely taught , was a tribute to their versatility , and especially to the principals luc vanier , as the workman , knew how to telegraph dejection through stillness head bowed to one side , hands in pockets , or leaning forward in a standard ballet position , he became a distilled image of heartbreak and yearning stephani achuff , as the young girl , understood the differences in gait and phrasing innocent in her white beret , midinette appearance and scurrying steps , she seemed transformed not only by the evening dress she received from paul ghiselin as the tophatted libertine but also by the jazz age rhythms of her ballroom dances jooss was dealing in stock characters but in europe in 1932 , the workingclass men really did wear caps , and their clothes set them apart from rich men in capes similarly , there is a touch of kathe kollwitz s drawings of workingclass life in a remarkable and terse scene four wideeyed children \( kara davis , joe roesner , linda hymes and edward augustyn \) , curve their backs to fit under the protective arms of their mothers \( amy hayes and susan lodise \) and reprovingly watch the young girl what is so stunning is the economy with which jooss makes his points the charleston dancers in hermann markard s costumes are replaced in a filmic dissolve by a bal musette this difference in social dances \( the workers hold their women close and revolve across the floor while the rich folk are more frenetic and modern \) tells the story of the big city the ballet , a mustsee , looks just as fascinating as when it had a shortlived revival with the joffrey ballet in 1975 anna markard , jooss s daughter , and airi hynninen have conveyed the spirit of jooss s body language to the dancers , and lois rova ozanich and david fisher , live at two pianos , play alexander tansman s infectious atmospheric score the neoromanticism of mr poll s summer night gains mightily from mr garcia s and ms tejeda de cerda s boldly projected arabesques and line ms childs , for her part , makes the dancers \( the women are in toe shoes but do n't always rise on point \) look somewhat awkward as they snap into positions but there is also a kaleidoscopic dazzle to the way she moves three quartets of dancers in colorcoded costumes around in her staminademanding patterns , partnering and mirror dances eight by benny goodman uses recordings from 1939 to 1946 in a suite the company , mainly in formal dress , mixes ballroom and ballet the whole thing is exhilarating photo stephani achuff and paul ghiselin of the ohio ballet in the big city \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
for 20 minutes on monday evening , the twoton bell in the tower of the old jefferson market courthouse rang over greenwich village , breaking a virtual silence of 97 years except for throat clearings of a few bongs now and again , the bell , said to be the second largest in new york city , after one at riverside church , had not tolled seriously since sounding adm george dewey s victory at manila bay during the spanishamerican war that was when some battleenthralled graffiti painter had daubed to hell with spain remember the maine 1898 , inside the bell s skirt , where the inscription is still visible but this week s peal had nothing to do with jingo bells instead , what was being marked as tom sharkey , the superintendent of the building , pushed and pulled the clapper was a triumph somewhat more parochial than the dismantling of the spanish empire namely , the preservation and restoration of the courthouse at 10th street and the avenue of the americas , which had been modeled after a bavarian trifle and now houses a branch of the new york public library it s a very lyrical moment , said margot gayle , who 37 years ago set about rescuing the building as it was about to be auctioned to developers coveting the ground it stood on she paused and looked up before joining some 80 people who had gathered to recall a long trail of community action now that the building s renovation has been capped off with a new slate roof i keep thinking of all of us who got involved years ago and i realize that we really did it , said ms gayle , who was sitting next to marvin schneider , the clockmaster of the city s clocks when the bell rang , i felt my spirits rise it was in 1959 that ms gayle began organizing i was working for the department of city planning and living on ninth street i got to know some architects and they pointed out just how spectacular that courthouse was it had been built in 1877 on the edge of what was then one of the city s poorest neighborhood , pushed forward as another of boss tweed s extravagances large sums were appropriated before anything was ever built , and when construction began , no opportunities for kickbacks seemed to have been ignored , with contractors providing stainedglass windows , gargoyles , venetian fountains , intricate ebony door frames , the clock with its four faces and the huge bell among the wealth of details , there is an inscription cut into the circular stairway stipulating that the precepts of the law are these to live correctly , to do an evil to none and to render to everyone his own by the time the building was completed , this third requirement must have been fulfilled with everyone duly rendered unto the new york times observed at the time that putting up so lavish a building in such a rundown neighborhood was like placing a jewel in a swine s snout , and the architects , frederick clarke withers and calvert vaux , one of the designers of central park , were accused by some critics of incompetence , even insanity but 10 years later the courthouse was voted by architects as one of the 10 most beautiful buildings in america the courts moved out in 1927 and by the time ms gayle s interest in the building developed , city agencies had moved out and it was empty it s hard to believe now , but there was absolutely no interest back then in public victorian architecture , ms gayle said plans were made to sell off the property , along with the adjoining women s house of detention that was ultimately razed i thought we should focus on the clock , said ms gayle for years , its hand had stood at 3 20 and i thought everyone would want the clock to move so we named our group the committee of neighbors to get the clock on jefferson market courthouse started we were a small group , but we had this very long name people joined in , among them lewis mumford and jane jacobs , the architectural critics , and e e cummings , the poet who lived across 10th street by 1961 , the group had raised enough money to restart and illuminate the clock that effort spurred greater ambitions , and in response to the committee s appeals , in 1961 mayor robert f wagner announced the building would be preserved as a library since opening in 1967 , the library branch has , according to paul schmidt , the director , become one of the best used in the city it is a gloriously welcoming building , said the librarian , who has been there from the start no , we 've had no reports of ghosts i guess the weirdest thing i can remember is that once a reader left me a note saying that twice the world has been saved because of what had happened in this library i really do n't know what he had in mind ms gayle said that bell s ringing had inspired her do n't you think it would be neighborly if the bell rang out the hours \? said the woman who got the clock to move you could see her thinking
federal investigators now have evidence linking the two principal suspects in the oklahoma city bombing to the robbery of an arkansas gun dealer last november and speculate that this may explain how the bombing was financed in what could quite literally be the key to the case , a bank safedeposit key stolen in the robbery of the gun dealer s home in november was found when federal agents searched the herington , kan , home of one of the bombing suspects , terry l nichols , in april and the robbery victim believes that timothy j mcveigh , the other principal bombing suspect , may have been involved in the robbery , in which a masked man knocked him unconscious , bound and gagged him , and took guns , jewels , gold and silver valued at almost 40 , 000 the discovery of the stolen safedeposit key in the nichols home and the possible connection between the bombing and the robbery were disclosed in an affidavit filed in federal district court in detroit on may 3 and unsealed on tuesday the financing of the bombing has puzzled investigators from the outset although the bomb itself could have been built at little cost the materials , fertilizer and fuel oil are estimated to cost about 3 , 000 mr mcveigh was often noticed paying cash for his expenses from a large roll of bills however , the suspects seemed to have scant resources both scraped by on shortterm jobs and a marginal business selling guns and military equipment at traveling gun shows and swap meets federal bureau of investigation agents trying to follow the money trail say they now believe the bombing was financed by robberies in the past , they have speculated about a string of midwest robberies committed by two or more men who used homemade bombs as a threat the affidavit was filed in support of an application to search the home of mr nichols s brother , james d nichols , in decker , mich that search was carried out , but investigators have not disclosed the results and the detailed list of items seized from terry nichols s home has not been revealed if investigators can link mr mcveigh and mr nichols to the arkansas robbery , they would be able to tie them together in a criminal enterprise stretching back at least to last november , a period in which investigators so far have turned up a number of tantalizing leads the discovery of a possible connection between the bombing and the robbery could also mean that it was carried out , not by a large conspiracy , but by a much smaller group , these two and perhaps a few others in the affidavit unsealed in detroit , an fbi agent , arthur r baker , mentioned the robbery of weapons from a house in arkansas and , in what could be a major development in the case , added that also stolen in the arkansas robbery was a safedeposit box key , which was recovered during the recent searches at terry nichols s residence the agent also said that the victim , who , it was learned , operated a gun business in hot springs , ark , believes that tim mcveigh may have been involved in the robbery , in that he had visited the owner on several occasions and was familiar with the gun collection the affidavit requested a search warrant to see if a chinesemade sks assault rifle seen in james nichols s michigan house was one of two such weapons stolen during the robbery it was not immediately known if the sks rifle a cheap and relatively common weapon in guncarrying circles was recovered and if it was indeed stolen the robbery took place in royal , ark , about 11 miles west of hot springs , last nov 5 , and the accounts of local authorities revealed that the robbery may be far more important to the case than a single stolen rifle the robber wore a full camouflage uniform , a black ski mask , and gloves , and wielded a pistolgrip shotgun he made off with cash , weapons , military gear , precious metals and gems worth at least 37 , 700 , according to the police report of the incident there may have been a second man , the victim told the police , but he could not be sure because he was quickly subdued , tied up and blindfolded with duct tape while his house was ransacked for an hour and a half there were 66 rifles taken , including expensive ar15 assault rifles and mini14 s in the haul , along with 8 handguns , according to the police reports some of the weapons were special modified or competition models or antiques , but the owner did not list serial numbers or seek insurance repayment despite their apparently rather meager resources , mr mcveigh and mr nichols told friends they planned to set up a gun dealing business together , traveling a kind of circuit of regular shows federal authorities found 33 guns in terry nichols s house when they searched it last april , a few days after the bombing , which took 167 lives the list of exactly what was recovered during the execution of the search warrant , known as a return , has been put under seal in the federal district court in wichita , kan , so it could not be immediately determined if some of the weapons matched those stolen in arkansas but the affidavit filed in detroit said the search had found the safedeposit key among the items apparently bundled up in sheets and blankets and carried off in the robbery garland county sheriff larry selig said the fbi had taken all the records of the robbery , but he remembered the safedeposit key it was in a box , with a lot of other things , sheriff selig said sheriff selig said that the victim initially had no idea who his assailants might be he presumably came forward to the fbi after the publicity surrounding mr mcveigh s arrest as a gun dealer , the robbery victim would have met mr mcveigh in gun show circles the police inventory of the stolen items shows two boxes , one filled with , among other things , emeralds silver rings gold coins gold nuggets much more the other is a cigar box of precolumbian jade the list of stolen items included approximately 8 , 700 in cash , in 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 bills , along with silver ingots and bars worth almost 6 , 000 and gold commemorative coin sets worth 3 , 000 that fall , around the time of the robbery , the authorities say that mr nichols bought some two tons of highnitrate fertilizer of the kind used to make the bomb and , using a series of aliases , rented a number of storage lockers later in november , he left for the philippines to be with his second wife , marife , leaving a sealed letter with his first wife , lana padilla in las vegas , nev she was the only person he could trust , he said , and she should only open the letter if he died or did not return for 60 days ms padilla opened the letter the next day , finding another letter for mr mcveigh and the key to a storage locker in las vegas in the locker , she has told reporters , she found thousands of dollars in silver bullion and gold , ski masks , tubular pipes and survival gear the letter to mr mcveigh , which she also opened , was what she described as a cryptic message to be sent in the event of mr nichols s death as far as heat none that i know , the letter said at one point , and then urged mr mcveigh you 're on your own go for it
the operas that eve queler presents in concert form with her opera orchestra of new york are usually a bit rarer than i puritani , bellini s tale of english roundheads , cavaliers and the woman whose family and lover are on different sides the metropolitan opera has a production of the work \( last heard in 1991 \) , and the new york city opera has presented it within the last decade still , it is not quite standard repertory its demands are great besides a spectacular soprano , it needs a tenor who can cruise up to a high f , and a few strong basses and baritones but as an evening of drama , the payoff is modest listeners eager to while away the hours \( just over three \) taking in graceful melodies and vocal acrobatics can find plenty to admire here , but even they admit that the work offers none of the hit tunes that so many of its contemporaries have yielded if presenting rarities is the primary mission of ms queler s ensemble , a secondary one is to showcase promising singers , and that presumably was why she offered i puritani at carnegie hall on monday evening on that count she had a mixed success a soprano taking on the role of elvira has big shoes to fill maria callas , joan sutherland and beverly sills all gave celebrated portrayals that live on in recordings ms queler s elvira , mariella devia , certainly has the goods to make a claim to the role she sang bellini s music with a pure , focused tone as well as the power and agility to give thrilling accounts of the leaps and scale passages in the two mad scenes she also brought a measure of emotional depth to the role , not an easy thing given elvira s fundamental instability gregory kunde , the tenor who portrayed elvira s lover , arturo , was not quite ms devia s match what he had going for him was a strong middle and upper middle range , and an unusual timbre that in mr kunde s best moments called to mind alfredo kraus he has the requisite high f s , and the power to make them ring through the hall but even as high f s go , mr kunde s were pinched , shouted and generally unattractive carlo guelfi , an italian baritone making his american debut in the performance , is the latest addition to ms queler s estimable list of vocal discoveries mr guelfi , who was riccardo , arturo s rival , produces a tremendous , resonant , beautifully rounded tone that filled carnegie hall without the slightest sign of strain and like ms devia , he brought an emotional flexibility to the music that made it touching rather than merely showy dean peterson s bassbaritone sounded cloudy when heard after mr guelfi , but he did giorgio s music justice there were also solid contributions by ron naldi \( bruno \) , eric j owens \( walton \) and carla wood \( enrichetta \) ms queler s reading of the score could have been more fiery , particularly in the last act , where the energy seemed to flag but she drew fine , robust playing from her orchestra , and she had the benefit of a polished choir
washington , april 21 one of the most hunted men in the world , wanted as john doe no 1 in the bombing of the federal office building in oklahoma city , was right where the authorities wanted him in jail except the fbi did not know it , and his jailers almost let him go it was not until today less than an hour before the authorities in perry , okla , about 60 miles north of oklahoma city , were ready to let the man go that a routine check of his social security number and the wanted poster released hours before convinced them and federal authorities that an inmate they had arrested on wednesday could be the suspect with the lightbrown crewcut the inmate , timothy mcveigh , had been stopped on interstate 35 about 90 minutes after the bombing because he was driving without a license plate on his car , the authorities said but the arresting officer , highway patrolman charles d hanger , discovered that mr mcveigh had a glock 9millimeter semiautomatic pistol in a shoulder holster , local lawenforcement officials said , and he was held on weapons charges mr mcveigh , a former army enlisted man at fort riley , kan , gave the base as his address when he bought the gun , which he owned legally , federal authorities said they said that mr mcveigh and a companion had rented the truck used in the bombing from a ryder truck rental agency in junction city , kan , near fort riley , on monday the pair provided the rental agent with information from a forged south dakota driver s license that bore the issue date of april 19 , 1993 , the day that the federal bureau of investigation began a tear gas attack on the branch davidian compound near waco , tex the confrontation ended with a fire and the deaths of about 80 people , including many children the positive identification of mr mcveigh , announced this afternoon by attorney general janet reno , pushed the already speedy investigation of the oklahoma city bombing to an even quicker pace registration slips that mr mcveigh signed as he checked into the dreamland motel near junction city led federal authorities to a farm in rural michigan , which mr mcveigh had listed as his address , and to two men who had lived at the farm one of the men , terry lynn nichols , surrendered to the authorities in herington , kan the other was his brother , james douglas nichols , who was still living on the farm , in decker , mich , about 80 miles north of detroit terry nichols was questioned at a police station in herington he had driven to the public safety office , arriving in a battered blue gmc diesel pickup truck the vehicle had an infant car seat in the back and a sticker on the bumper that said american and proud almost simultaneously in michigan , in images drawn from crime dramas , lawenforcement agents with automatic weapons converged on the farmhouse the agents found james nichols there they said later that he agreed to cooperate the authorities said they were searching the farm for evidence in the bombing case lawenforcement officials said they suspected that the 500acre farm might have been used as kind of proving ground to test explosives like the ammonium nitrate and fuel oil components used in the oklahoma city blast the officials described the nichols brothers as potential witnesses , not suspects the officials said the brothers were associated with the michigan militia , one of the growing number of armed citizen organizations around the nation that fiercely oppose the authority of the federal government , particularly agencies like the treasury department s bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms that enforce gun laws it was unclear whether either nichols brother was john doe no 2 , the bushyhaired man whose face was flashed around the world as the second suspect in the bombing it now appears that neither brother is that man mr mcveigh was stopped for not having license plates on the yellow mercury he was driving at about the legal speed limit trooper hanger stopped mr mcveigh at 10 20 am wednesday , 10 miles north of a perry exit the bomb had exploded at the federal building about 9 am when the fbi went to the authorities in perry , mr mcveigh was on his way to court , where he was to have been arraigned on the traffic and weapons charges and released on 5 , 000 bond mark gibson , an assistant district attorney , said the fbi called the county sheriff , jerry cook , at about 10 am today , half an hour to an hour before mr mcveigh s appearance in court the federal authorities had matched his social security number with a number entered by local authorities into a national crime computer data base after his arrest on the weapons and driving charges mr gibson said that only the fact that he and the judge were busy with other matters on thursday and this morning delayed mr mcveigh s release mr gibson said in an interview that when the sheriff passed a note to him in court this morning , saying that mr mcveigh was the suspected bomber , he thought that it was a courthouse joke after pulling mr mcveigh s car over , trooper hanger , who has a reputation among his colleagues for going by the book , had noticed a bulge under the shoulder of mr mcveigh s jacket , mr gibson said pulling his own revolver , trooper hanger asked to search mr mcveigh , who admitted to having the glock pistol in a shoulder holster mr mcveigh was also found to be carrying a sixinch knife the trooper reported that mr mcveigh was calm , saying he was driving crosscountry mr mcveigh was very polite , answering questions , yes sir , and no sir , saying he had served in the military and as a security guard no , sir , i did not intend to break your laws , he told tooper hanger , according to the prosecutor i just carry the gun for protection county prosecutors had prepared charges of carrying a concealed weapon , transporting a loaded weapon and driving without a license plate or insurance these charges , none more serious than misdemeanors , were dismissed today when mr mcveigh was turned over to the fbi a judge had set bond at 5 , 000 , but mr mcveigh , carrying 2 , 000 , could have borrowed enough from a bail bondsman with 500 down , mr gibson said mr gibson said that local authorities had not recognized mr mcveigh from the published drawing amid all the scrambling for evidence at sites scattered across the midwest , lawenforcement officials tried to adjust their thinking about the explosion , which had brought international terrorism to mind ms reno said today that for the first time since the blast that it seemed to be a domestic case other officials said they remained open to all possible motives , including international terrorist links but the new evidence drew the spotlight of suspicion on antigovernment militants who might have launched the attack as a retaliatory protest to events like the branch davidian assault near waco officials of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms were housed in the building destroyed in the bombing militant groups opposing gun control have blamed the agency for heavy loss of life in the siege of the sect s compound chart hierarchy how the manhunt

songs in ordinary time by mary mcgarry morris 740 pages viking 2495 the plot of mary mcgarry morris s latest novel , songs in ordinary time , sounds in summary an awful lot like a sick parody of the bridges of madison county a traveling man arrives in a small , isolated town and meets a lonely woman he romances her with windy talk about her strong , strong heart and the opportunity and freedom to be had in america , and despite the protestations of her estranged husband , she soon falls madly in love only after this mysterious stranger has taken all her money and nearly destroyed her family does she realize that he is not who he claims to be that , in fact , he is a liar , a con man and a killer such a melodramatic plot is not easy to pull off , but given ms morris s impressive track record , the reader is initially hopeful that she will be able to perform this difficult feat after all , her two earlier novels were narrative tours de force that were as affecting as they were absorbing in fact , with vanished and a dangerous woman , ms morris established herself as a credible heir to carson mccullers she established herself as a wise , unsentimental portraitist of the lonely , the damned , the desperate and the incomplete unfortunately for the reader , something has gone terribly wrong with songs in ordinary time ms morris has not only temporarily lost her magical sympathy for her characters , but in doing so she has also managed to misplace her ability to tell an emotionally compelling story part of the problem has to do with the very ambitiousness of this novel ms morris is not content to tell the story of lonely marie fermoyle and her conniving lover , omar duvall she wants to depict the lives and loves and disappointments of all their neighbors in the fictional town of atkinson , vt the result is a sprawling , episodic narrative filled with subsidiary characters and rambling asides asides that undercut the urgency of the main story and that are tied together only by portentous remarks about the disaster that s coming and the implacable cadence of doom to make matters worse , almost everyone in the town of atkinson seems like a dysfunctional refugee from a talk show whereas much of the poignancy of ms morris s earlier novels derived from her heroes' sense of themselves as misfits , as social pariahs unable to connect with the rest of the world , songs in ordinary time gives us a fictional town entirely peopled with fools , perverts , malcontents and schemers , characters whose lives are a tangled and unbelievable mess of felonies , suicide attempts , sexual indiscretions and betrayals there s marie s former husband , sam , a hopeless drunk and the town buffoon , who embarrasses his children with his drunken binges and sam s sister , helen , an embittered old witch who keeps their incontinent mother locked in a huge crib in their house helen s husband , renie , is the sniveling owner of an unsuccessful appliance store , a deeply unhappy man who makes obscene phone calls to women late at night her maid jozia is a dimwitted woman who is involved in a strange , incestuous relationship with her twin brother , howard the local police chief is apparently having an affair with his sisterinlaw , while his terminally ill wife hoards pills in the hopes of committing suicide the local insurance man has been embezzling his clients' premiums and tries to pull off a bank robbery to keep his demanding wife in the little luxuries she craves and the local priest seduces marie s teenage daughter , alice , and suffers a nervous breakdown when they are caught together in bed as it turns out , alice s affair is the least of the fermoyle family s problems when omar announces that he needs money for a soap franchise , marie applies for a phony home improvement loan and forges the signature of her brotherinlaw renie to guarantee the bank s approval her youngest son , 12yearold benjy , meanwhile , has entered into an even more dangerous covenant with omar benjy , it seems , saw omar arguing with a black man named earlie , a man whose corpse benjy subsequently discovers rotting in a field instead of reporting the body to the police , benjy eagerly helps omar cover his tracks he sends two of earlie s suspicious friends off on a wild goose chase and vows to say nothing of the incident to his mother or his siblings none of these developments feel even remotely plausible to the reader although ms morris asks us to believe that benjy s actions are motivated by his recognition of his mother s love for omar \( and his own desire to see them together as a happy couple \) , we ca n't help but wonder why he would want his mother to keep company with such a sinister man why is benjy so reluctant to acknowledge omar s role in earlie s death \? why is n't he terrified of this man , whom he has repeatedly seen lie \? why does he encourage his mother in this doomed and dangerous romance \? because benjy is so subversive of his family s interests and because his actions are so hard to fathom , it is difficult for the reader to sympathize with him or care about his fate for that matter , none of the major characters in this novel are convincingly portrayed from within whereas ms morris expertly dramatized the needs , longings and motivations of aubrey wallace in vanished and martha horgan in a dangerous woman , she settles , in this volume , for bald statements about her characters' emotions and behavior marie emerges as a willfully obtuse woman who likes to put down her children with cruel remarks sam comes across as a selfpitying failure , eager to put himself before everyone else and omar is depicted as an outandout bully and sleazeball , a careless and ultimately evil man the rest of the characters in songs in ordinary time also lack the emotional chiaroscuro that ms morris has lavished on her creations in the past the main reason , in the end , why this book is such an odd \( and , one hopes , anomalous \) departure from her remarkable earlier work
prague , feb 7 acting on a tip from an anonymous female telephone caller , the prague police swooped down on a smart blue saab on a crowded shopping street at midday just before christmas as they were told they would , the police found highly enriched uranium stashed on the back seat in metal canisters 27 kilograms , or about 6 pounds' worth since the uranium was seized , czech investigators and western officials interviewed have determined that the prague cache was was 877 percent uranium235 in oxide form , and the smugglers were former nuclear workers who knew what they were handling it turned out to be by far the biggest seizure to date of highly enriched uranium in what defense officials say has become a major threat to united states security in the postcoldwar era the illicit trade in radioactive materials from the former soviet union and other former communist countries but merely verifying that the uranium is real is only the beginning the real mystery is where it came from and who it was destined for the car carrying three former nuclear workers from the czech republic , belarus and ukraine , and the gray powder on the back seat , was yet another reminder that much remains to be done to encourage the russians to improve their nuclear safeguards , nuclear experts said this is the largest confirmed case of highly enriched uranium to come out of the former soviet union , said a washington official people sat up when the document that purported the material was 877 percent enriched turned out to be accurate that s what got people s attention that the uranium was not quite weapons grade and not sufficient on its own to create a nuclear weapon was small comfort , the officials said after preliminary tests , experts said they believed that the high enrichment indicates that the uranium could have come from a either a storage site of the russian navy or a fuel fabrication plant in the former soviet union nuclear submarines in the former soviet union use fuel of similar enrichment levels , they said stopping leaks of nuclear material from poorly guarded military and research sites , storehouses and nuclear plants in the former soviet union has become a priority of the clinton administration there are 950 sites for enriched uranium and plutonium in the former soviet union from the western borders to the eastern peninsula , said mark d hibbs , european editor of nuclear fuel , a washington based specialty publication supplies of nuclear material were spread across research institutes , weapons laboratories , assembly plants , power plants , nuclear waste storage sites and naval fuel depots the task at hand is which of the 950 inventories holds the 877 percent fuel what worries american experts is the possibility of stockpiling amounts of highly enriched uranium like the 27 kilograms , either by countries near the nuclear threshold like north korea or iraq , or by terrorists according to the international atomic energy agency , making a bomb would require 25 kilograms of the type of enriched uranium found in the car in prague although 93 percent enrichment is ideal for a bomb , if you 're sophisticated enough you could make it detonate at 877 percent said david r kyd , the director of public information at the agency given the lack of information the russians had about their own inventories of nuclear material , mr hibbs suggested investigators were facing an almost impossible task the czech police have said that the russians were not being cooperative in the investigation last year , the russian authorities balked at helping the germans solve nuclear smuggling cases and accused western intelligence agencies of trumpeting the arrests in order to discredit the russian nuclear establishment but czech investigators , proud of having cracked this case at least in the initial stages have released some details about the czech , jaroslav vagner , 54 , a former nuclear worker , and the two men with him in his saab last dec 14 in many ways , mr vagner fits the profile experts have developed of the likely nuclear smuggler an underpaid communist scientist seeking vast riches it was also telling , several american experts said , that mr vagner is czech after the normalization of relations with the soviet union after 1968 , the czechs were moscow s most trusted scientists in the warsaw bloc , they said mr vagner made several trips to the former soviet union while working at a czech nuclear plant in the 1980 s , czech investigators said after graduating from the czech technical university in prague in 1963 , mr vagner worked for 11 years at the nuclear research institute at rez , specializing in heavywater reactors he worked at the ministry of fuels and energy and during the 1980 s worked at the dukovany and temelin nuclear power stations frustrated by poor pay , he left the temelin nuclear plant and went into a variety of businesses , the police said he lived in a municipal apartment block where most people drove cheap skodas , but mr vagner was conspicuous for his saab mr vagner s two companions in the car at the time of the seizure were from belarus and ukraine , and both were nuclear workers who had come to the czech republic last year , the police said like other nuclear smugglers caught in europe in the last year , the trio were apparently asking exorbitant amounts several million dollars for their uranium , an investigator said they had apparently been trying to hawk the uranium in prague , now a city awash in foreigners , he said czech investigators said they were getting no cooperation from the three suspects now being held in a prague jail the suspects have hired lawyers and are not talking more clues to the origins of the prague cache are expected to surface toward the end of the month when the laboratories at the atomic agency in vienna are expected to have completed their analysis of the uranium , mr kyd said the chemical analysis is expected to reveal the signature of the material , which will reveal details of the enrichment process used in making the contraband material and therefore narrow the possibilities of its origin , he said but mr hibbs warned that because the russians had refused to give the vienna agency their database showing the individual signatures of their stockpiles , it would be virtually impossible for the agency to determine where in the former soviet union the uranium seized in prague came from nuclear experts are already speculating that the prague cache bears some relationship with a much smaller quantity eighttenths of a gram or 028 of an ounce of highly enriched uranium seized by german police in landshut in bavaria last year there is a lot of similarity with the documentation and the people involved in what took place in bavaria and in prague , said a western official experts have said that the haul in landshut and the 27 kilograms in prague were of similar enrichment levels , leading to the supposition that they came from the same place an american official said washington was helping the czechs to try to solve the case and the czechs , anxious to prove they are potentially good allies , were receptive it s hard to make a weapon , a washington official said but if you can get large enough quantities and have the knowledge you can make a bomb none of us want to bet on a happy ending we all take it very seriously chart the details theft and the fuel cycle the former soviet union and other eastern european countries are not radioactive material in

buenos aires , may 21 in a bizarre tale of industrial espionage , an argentine engineer says he stole a wide range of technical secrets from two leading computer chip makers in the united states and provided the information to china , cuba and iran the technical information , he said , included computer chip designs and stepbystep instructions on how to manufacture the 386 , 486 and pentium chips that power most of the personal computers in use today the engineer , bill gaede , said in an interview that he had taken the information from advanced micro devices inc from 1983 to 1993 and from the intel corporation in 1993 and 1994 , when he worked for the companies he said he was initially motivated by a love of communism but that later he stole for personal gain mr gaede said the data he provided to cuban representatives was passed to the soviet union and east germany in the last years of the cold war he also said that at one point he had turned himself in to federal authorities and cooperated with an investigation by the fbi much of the detail that mr gaede provides is corroborated , but his account of his involvement with foreign governments and the fbi could not be confirmed spokesman for the fbi would say only that the bureau would have no comment on mr gaede s story other lawenforcement officials said they were aware of mr gaede and his activities but that he had not been a government informant because none of the nations cited by mr gaede \( pronounced gaydee \) have sophisticated chipmaking operations , the stolen data would not damage the american companies any time soon but experts said the information might reduce the time needed to become competitive if nothing else , mr gaede s tale of hightech robbery raises questions about the vulnerability of corporations to industrial espionage and theft and how adequate their safeguards are although mr gaede lacked a valid visa to work in the united states , he obtained highly sensitive jobs at the nation s two leading semiconductor makers mr gaede , 42 , said he had decided to go public because his telephone was being tapped here , he is being followed and he is afraid of being hurt no charges have been filed against him and he is not a fugitive at advanced micro devices in sunnyvale , calif , peter costner , chief of security , said mr gaede had stolen a significant amount of intellectual property and given it to cuba , which in turn passed the information on to the soviet union and east germany advanced micro officials said they had not pressed charges against mr gaede , who left the company voluntarily , because they have no corroborating evidence to prove that he stole the intellectual property he certainly was in a position to do it , and we believe what he says is true , said charles malloy , a company spokesman at intel , john thompson , a spokesman , confirmed that mr gaede had worked for the company but declined to describe the circumstances of his departure we are not commenting at all on this issue , mr thompson said mr gaede provided a copy of a letter to him on intel stationery , dated may 31 , 1994 , saying his employment had been terminated due to your refusal to cooperate in a reasonable security investigation intel declined to comment on the letter mr gaede provided the new york times with dates , times and places he says he met with cuban representatives in mexico , as well as what he says are tape recordings of conversations with fbi agents and a list of the agents he says he spoke with the fbi , provided with that list , declined to comment on it technical experts said foreign competitors , particularly russia and china , might be able to use the chip designs and manufacturing techniques that intel and amd spent billions of dollars developing to begin producing chips , narrowing the technological lead of the united states the chinese and iranians are having a field day and are learning a lot about american manufacturing , mr gaede said the experts said the benefits to foreign competitors would not be evident for many years because the technology of the semiconductor industry advances so rapidly that designs and manufacturing techniques quickly become outmoded mr gaede , who had been working for intel in chandler , ariz , said he returned to argentina in september , after intel uncovered the theft and dismissed him he said he had used a computer intel had given him to allow him to work from his home to get access to the company s data base using his video camera , he would then tape chip specifications from the computer screen the technique allowed me to work undetected , store greater amounts of information in a smaller medium and make copies quicker for interested parties , he said michael slater , publisher of microprocessor report , an industry newsletter , said in a telephone interview that he found that part of mr gaede s story difficult to believe , because he doubted that intel would allow an employee access to proprietary information about its latest chips through a home computer modem it sounds fishy to me because i suspect that intel s security is a lot tighter than that , mr slater said
immediately after the oakland raiders' 4710 victory over the jets on sunday night , willie brown , the raiders' director of squad development , sought out curtis ceaser , the jets' rookie wide receiver the two walked off the field and through the tunnel brown , 54 , did the talking , ceaser , 23 , did the listening when it came time to part they shook hands and went their separate ways brown to the raiders' black and silver , ceaser to the jets' green and white but the thread that binds them is the black and gold of grambling state university , and a man they call coach rob eddie robinson s remarkable career at grambling covers more than five decades 1941 to the present , with a break in 194344 for world war ii on saturday , eddie robinson will attempt to become the only coach in college football history to win 400 career football games when grambling plays mississippi valley state at magnolia stadium in itta bena , miss a more poignant indication of the breadth of robinson s influence was the presence in giants stadium on monday of five generations of former players willie brown , a hall of fame cornerback for the raiders , played for robinson from 1959 to 1962 james harris , an assistant general manager with the jets , from 19641968 harris went on to play quarterback for the buffalo bills and the los angeles rams albert lewis , one of the national football league s premier defensive backs , played for robinson from 1979 to 1983 , and andrew glover , lewis s raider teammate , played at grambling from 1987 to 1991 ceaser , the jets rookie , played for robinson between 1990 and 1994 there is no generation gap with the players who have come through grambling , brown said it s like family , said the 23yearold ceaser you see a player who went to grambling and even if you were n't at grambling at the same time , it s like you know each other because you have so much in common robinson s coaching achievements during his 54year tenure are astounding he s won more games than any other coach he s had more that 100 players drafted by nfl teams , seven of them as firstround picks , and sent at least that many to pro camps as free agents in 1949 one of his players , tank younger , became the first player from a historically black school to be signed by an nfl team three of his former players brown , buck buchanan and willie davis are in the pro football hall of fame i respect all of the things he s done as a football coach , said lewis , but his greatest achievement has been the productive young men that he has produced , the number he has taken from the backwoods and the other side of the tracks and turned into good productive citizens lewis said that when he went to grambling he was just a young country boy who did n't know much about anything other than how to survive in a very poor environment coach robinson taught me a lot about how to assimilate in the world how to go out and be a part of society that i knew nothing about , lewis said although grambling is predominately a black school , and most of its players come from areas that are predominately black , coach robinson teaches you about the world as it relates to being nonracial we have learned to survive in a world that has no color lines one of robinson s consistent themes is patriotism , and the importance of taking advantage of what s available in the country he always says that this is a great country , only because of the opportunity it affords its citizens , lewis said his philosophy is that if you get an opportunity , that s really all you can ask for he always said that anything you have and do n't use , you 're going to lose he was very persistent in making us aware of that , and that s why he s had more great players to come through the national football league than any other school in the country we understand the importance of opportunity robinson will celebrate his 77th birthday next feb 13 he has not mentioned retirement and none of his players have noticed a dramatic fading of intensity people ask me 'when is he going to slow down \? , ' brown said , referring to robinson i do n't think he s ever going to slow down he burns the candle at both ends trying to find a way to win this is his life , his passion that has n't changed in 30 years
san bernardino , calif , nov 22 in a protest vote , county supervisors here on tuesday approved an ordinance against a dump for lowlevel nuclear waste proposed for the eastern part of san bernardino county near the colorado river adoption of the ordinance on a 5to0 vote was prompted by residents' fear that the dump could contaminate drinking water a supervisor , john michaels , said the vote reflects opposition that cuts across all strata of local society the vote is legally meaningless , because the county lacks jurisdiction over the site , said elisabeth brandt , chief counsel for the state agency that licensed the proposed dump it is unfortunate that the county has passed something that people will think has significance when it has none , ms brandt said roger carrick , a los angeles lawyer representing the fort mojave indian tribe and other opponents of the dump , asserted that the county could regulate potential hazards suppose someone wanted to put on a fireworks display on state land next to a heavily wooded neighborhood , mr carrick said you do n't think the county fire marshal s office could stop it \? the proposed dump site is in ward valley , an uninhabited stretch of the mojave desert along interstate 40 , about 20 miles from the colorado the facility would use unlined trenches to bury lowlevel waste from power plants , hospitals and factories across the nation public concerns about burying radioactive waste near the river , a major source of drinking water for southern california , has prompted a decade of legal battles , although scientists at california s department of health services have said the waste would decompose safely the company licensed to dump at ward valley also uses a site in beatty , nev , where tests found radioactive pollutants had seeped hundreds of feet down , nearly to the water table the authorities say the seepage is due to illegal dumping of liquid waste the san bernardino ordinance bans radioactive waste dumps within 10 miles of significant water resources but allows them in other county areas if they have waterproof steel , concrete and lead vaults supervisors passed the ordinance a few days after congress authorized the transfer of the federal land to the state , a requirement before the dump can open
sometimes i want to rail against the brooklyn academy of music for giving us so little time to see theater that is so worth seeing england s insolently modern cheek by jowl company performed john webster s vengeful jacobean tragedy the duchess of malfi for nine days this month at the majestic theater they 're gone now , on the next stop of their international tour , but i am still in the grip of what i saw reliving it , arguing with it , haunted by it the stage was bare of everything except thick , shroudlike curtains that gave new force to that old expression , let us draw the curtain on evil thoughts and deeds the actors took their places on a chessboardlike floor when the play began , and they spoke their initial lines \( the lines that established the status and temper of each character \) staring past one another but they were connected one felt the currents of energy that bound them together and showy as this opening was \( cynics might call it a highconcept beginning \) , it became the visual and architectural corollary of an important fact of emotional life we go through our days carrying on soliloquies obsessive conversations with ourselves about ourselves at the same time that we struggle to carry on dialogues with the people around us we talk , we try or pretend to listen , we act and react but what really drives us and drowns out all else is the sound of our own needs the duchess of malfi \( played by anastasia hille \) is a beautiful and arrogant widow who would rather marry than burn and who decides to marry her steward , antonio \( matthew macfadyen \) her twin brother , the duke \( scott handy \) , and her elder brother , the cardinal \( paul brennen \) , will do anything to prevent this , and once she goes ahead , they do everything to destroy her servants , spies and assassins abound so do treachery , torture and lust , both incestuous and sadomasochistic we are watching a family of beasts in a kingdom of beasts , and cheek by jowl s director , declan donnellan , makes them modern 1920 s beasts presiding over an italian court where pomp and fascism reign how could it be otherwise \? fascism is as much a family psychology as it is a social ideology stripped of the power to do as she pleases , the duchess does master humiliation and does meet her death bravely but she is a warrior and ruler , not a heroine and ms hille s performance is brave , for though it fascinates us ms hille burns herself onto our memory it neither seduces nor ingratiates everything is taken at a high , stern pitch , and the effect is chill and merciless there is no real redemption to be had when antonio s loyal friend delio delivers the orderrestoring elegy that ends so many elizabethan and jacobean plays , calling the duchess , her brothers and their minions these wretched eminent things , his words strike the air like a curse do you care for any of these people as you care , say , for hamlet or come to care for king lear \? no , and i missed those feelings the force of each individual s cruelty or suffering was made part of the whole here it was the structure of corruption and pathology that mattered the couplets and passages that were cut from this production invite us to sit back and briefly moralize , but even with them , webster s world is harsh and singleminded in a way that shakespeare s is n't program notes are often more decorative than insightful , but the words of st augustine that cheek by jowl chose came through with terrible exactness in the end augustine said there is no such thing as evil , just the gradual removal of good until none is left that void is what remains for us they are a brave company they study , improvise , revise and rehearse together constantly and it shows their voices and bodies are mobile and flexible \( the voices a touch selfconsciously so at times \) furthermore \( and the mark of a real company \) , they know one another s rhythms and impulses so well that they do n't have to wait for words to start responding that too is true to life as we know it , and we must see and feel this kind of knowledge every time we sit down in a theater if theater is going to keep mattering to us 'holiday' i do n't expect holiday , playing through jan 14 at circle in the square on broadway , to matter in the same way that the duchess of malfi mattered it s a romantic comedy , after all , not a revenge tragedy , and though it has undertones of real melancholy and a nice way of mocking the coarser pretensions and conventions of america s selfmade aristocracy , it is meant to be an entertainment the play presents a problem , then solves it the problem of a goodhearted , idealistic society girl who longs to flee the confines of her relentlessly upperclass life and who meets a goodhearted , idealistic workingclass boy just as he is about to marry into that society it finds a way , even though the boy is engaged to the girl s sister , to match them up and let them flee the land of the stuffy and shallow rich together , though not without enough money to insure that their escape will remain a riskfree holiday
randy l levine , new york city s commissioner of labor relations and one of mayor rudolph w giuliani s closest aides , announced yesterday that he would resign next month to become the chief labor negotiator for the team owners of major league baseball mr levine , whose announcement had been expected for several weeks , becomes the first member of the mayor s inner circle to return to the private sector , where most had made larger salaries before entering government service a former federal prosecutor , mr levine was a private labor lawyer before coming to work for mr giuliani he had done legal work for george m steinbrenner 3d , the owner of the yankees , where he came to know baseball officials and other owners as labor commissioner , he negotiated several key agreements with municipal labor unions that became hallmarks of the giuliani administration s plans to reduce the size of local government one of the most notable was the agreement by the municipal unions to a severance package that lowered the city s work force by 17 , 000 without layoffs but he also drew criticism from outside budget monitors like the citizens budget commission for not pressing unions harder for widespread productivity savings mr levine has passionately defended his negotiating record and may yet be able to demonstrate greater success at the bargaining table if he is able to complete talks with either the teachers , uniformed employees or civilian workers before leaving city hall on oct 23 at a city hall news conference yesterday , he said he hoped to have all or a good portion of the talks completed before moving on the mayor , who has often called on mr levine to negotiate agreements outside his direct jurisdiction , as he did with hotel workers this year , said , i think it s a real credit to new york city and new york city government that baseball has reached into our government to seek the help of the person that i think is the best labor commissioner in the history of new york city in his new job with the baseball owners , mr levine will be replacing richard ravitch , whose contract with the owners was not renewed when it expired at the end of 1994 the announcement that mr levine was leaving came coincidentally on the same day that mr ravitch withdrew from consideration as the city s next schools chancellor dick ravitch is a friend of mine , mr levine said yesterday he did nothing but encourage me to go forward with this mr levine is walking into one of the most difficult jobs in labor relations the difficulty , some say , comes not only in dealing with a strong union but also in having to work with 28 strongminded team owners as the owners' negotiator , mr levine will take over the effort to reach a new collectivebargaining agreement with the players unlike their position during the eightmonth players' strike , the owners have decided that none of them will participate in negotiating sessions that means that mr levine will be discussing proposals that he might help formulate but will not have the authority to act completely on his own the players struck on aug 12 , 1994 , and returned last april after a federal judge granted an injunction that prevented the owners from putting into effect new terms and conditions unilaterally mr giuliani said mr levine would continue to counsel him on labor matters in an unpaid senior advisory position in the meantime , the acting labor commissioner will be mr levine s first deputy , james f hanley , who was commissioner under mayor david n dinkins in addition to the severance agreement , mr levine won wide praise for renegotiating a tentative contract with school custodians the new contract included major concessions and for the first time linked pay increases to reviews of job performance , requiring custodians to report to the principals of their schools and follow their orders photo randy l levine \( philip greenberg for the new york times \)
a government explosives expert acknowledged in court yesterday that bombs could not have been made from the ingredients being used in what prosecutors say was a plot to blow up major buildings and transportation links in the new york area the expert , james thurman of the federal bureau of investigation , was called as a defense witness in the trial of sheik omar abdel rahman , a prominent muslim cleric , and nine other men charged with conspiring to bomb the united nations headquarters and the lincoln and holland tunnels in an effort to intimidate the united states into changing its middle east policies prosecutors in the trial in federal district court in manhattan have said that bombs were being made from diesel fuel and fertilizer that several of the defendants were mixing at a queens bomb factory in june 1993 , when fbi agents raided it and aborted the plot but mr thurman testified that the fertilizer being used did not have enough ammonium nitrate for the brew to be explosive , and that it also contained potassium phosphates , which would hinder an explosion mr thurman was called by wesley m serra , the lawyer for victor alvarez , a muslim of puerto rican background who is one of two americanborn defendants on trial the others are immigrants from middle eastern countries although none of the defendants are charged with the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center , which killed six people , that attack is said to have been part of the same conspiracy four other men have been convicted of the trade center bombing the fact that bombs could not have been built with the ingredients being mixed in the aborted plots does not negate the bombingconspiracy charges in the trial , because a criminal conspiracy does not have to be successful for it to have taken place but defense lawyers said that inadequate ingredients could help the jury decide to acquit the defendants on an attemptedbombing charge , since a guilty verdict on that charge requires proof of more than mere preparation and the inadequacy of the ingredients has already led to the dismissal of bombpossession charges that had originally been lodged in the case against some of the defendants
great carved dragons guard the entrance to korea palace , giving the restaurant a fancy and slightly forbidding air the limousines parked in front only add to the impression so it is surprising to walk inside and find that the restaurant has the casual , bright , utilitarian look of a converted coffee shop the tables are bare and the small colored lights dangling from the ceiling look left over from the 60 s and while the air is perfumed with garlic , chilies , sugar and sesame , the efficient metal hoods over each booth inhale all the smoke generated by customers' barbecuing their own meat if you would like something a little more upscale , that can be arranged the entire back of the restaurant is occupied by small private dining rooms , each equipped with an intercom but the private dining rooms can be hot in the summertime , and even in winter korean meals are entertaining enough to make it far more fun to sit in the large dining room where you can watch what everybody else is eating this can vary considerably the menu at korea palace is large , ranging from the standard korean barbecue dishes to more esoteric fare like spicy cod soup the food , in fact , is so varied and so appealing that it is hard to understand why restaurants like korea palace have not proved more appealing to a nonkorean clientele my mother s best friend offers a clue a korean restaurant , dear \? she said when i invited her to dinner i do n't think so why do n't you try one of your younger friends and save me for another evening \? i promised that i would not ask her to eat anything strange she was not persuaded finally , i threw in an offer to take her to rumpelmayer s for a hot fudge sundae if she was still hungry after dinner that clinched it she immediately put aside the long metal chopsticks at her place and asked for a fork the waitress smiled politely and brought one , fussing over the old lady with such concern that she elicited a smile you 'll like those , the waitress promised when i ordered the dumplings called mandoo gui and the noodles known as chap chae mom s friend looked dubious nevertheless , she was crazy about the small meatfilled panfried dumplings , pronouncing them better than chinatown and the clear , delicate noodles stirfried with tiny strands of meat and vegetables were also a hit delicious ! she said still , she looked doubtful when the waitress started setting panchan , the small plates of salads and pickles that are the heart of every korean meal , on the table i quickly slid the spicy pickled cabbage kimchi to my side of the table , along with a dish of tiny fried fish the size of pins i left the cool water kimchi on her side , along with a small dish of poached watercress with sesame hmm , she said , pleasant salads meanwhile , i was inhaling a plate of chinese cabbage sparked with bright red chilies for the main course , i thought we should try one of the barbecued meats , but i was n't sure whether to order marinated short ribs , kalbi , or sliced ribeye steak , bulgoki the waitress had another suggestion try the seafood , she said the lady will like it the lady did , watching attentively as the waitress melted butter and carefully cooked scallops , shrimp , clams and lobster tail when they were almost ready and the muscles had relaxed , she snipped the clam shells in two with a small scissors and cut the lobster tail into neat pieces , solicitously placing them on our plates delicious ! said my mother s friend so plain and simple afterward , when we were eating the little dishes of lemon ice that the waitress brought us for dessert , she said , you know , i ca n't understand why i have never had korean food before the problem , for me at least , was that the meal had left me hungry for the big , fiery flavors that i have come to love in korean cooking so the next night , i returned with a more adventurous group we started the meal with a fine assortment of sushi then we had haemul pajun , the seafood and scallion pancake found all over korea this version was crisp and greaseless , and dipped into the soy sauce on the side , i found it irresistible i loved nak ji bokkeum , stirfried tiny octopus mixed with spices and vegetables and served with thick , white noodles but even doctored with kochu jang , the red chili paste that is the national sauce of korea , it was not sufficiently spicy for me have the kimchi chigae , said the waitress with a sly smile i did , inhaling the spicy cabbage , chili and bean curd casserole until the tears streamed from my eyes it was hot i loved it and then we had bulgoki , barbecuing the sweet , pungent marinated meat ourselves we snatched each slice from the grill and rolled it up in slices of lettuce spread with hot bean paste and sprinkled with slivered scallions is there anybody who would n't enjoy this meal \? i wondered , taking a sip of soju , the cold korean sweet potato vodka , and putting another piece of meat onto the grill there are restaurants on 32d street in manhattan and in flushing , queens , that offer a more satisfying assortment of korean salads or a more exciting menu but it would be hard to find a better introduction to the seductive cuisine of korea than this pleasant restaurant after all , if korea palace can please my mother s best friend , it can probably please anyone korea palace  127 east 54th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 8322350 ambiance the front is bright , open and casual , but there are also many small private dining rooms service unlike many other korean restaurants , everyone speaks english but like many other korean restaurants , everyone is extremely helpful and attentive recommended dishes mandoo gui \( dumplings \) , chap chae \( stirfried clear noodles \) , sushi , haemul pajun \( seafood pancake \) , korean barbecue , stirfried pork and kimchi , stirfried octopus and noodles , kimchi casserole with bean curd , bibimbab \( korean rice with various toppings \) wine list the wine list is well chosen and inexpensive , but soju , the korean sweetpotato vodka , or beer are better matches for this powerful food hours 10 30 am to 10 30 pm daily lunch specials 11 30 am to 2 30 pm mondays through fridays price range appetizers 850 to 1595 , entrees 895 to 5095 \( for more than one person \) , desserts 250 to 13 credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility separate entrance for wheelchairs bathrooms for handicapped what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews hundreds of times restaurant reviews are available on line from times , an arts and entertainment guide on america online software and information 18005485201
washington , july 9 after agonizing for more than a week , president clinton is expected to approve the recommendations of an independent commission on military bases , now that the pentagon has been assured that it has the authority to keep thousands of jobs at a california air force base , administration officials said today mr clinton had been considering rejecting the commission s recommendation to close mcclellan air force base near sacramento because the loss of the installation s 11 , 000 military and civilian jobs would hurt the economy of a large state crucial to his 1996 campaign hopes that prompted complaints from republicans and some commission members that the white house was meddling in a process set up to insulate decisions about base closings from political influence a final decision has not been made but could come as early as monday in an exchange of letters late saturday , the commission s chairman , alan j dixon , a former democratic senator from illinois , assured deputy defense secretary john p white that the panel s recommendations could allow the pentagon to turn over all but about 800 jobs at mcclellan to local private contractors pentagon lawyers had demanded written assurances that this was what the panel intended that may assuage the white house and let mr clinton claim victory for california , but it carries a political price some commission members said that the administration had hurt the integrity of the baseclosing process by having mr white , the secretaries of the air force and navy , and other pentagon political appointees call panel members in the previous 48 hours to express concerns over the specific intent of the commission s recommendation on mcclellan that s why we 're getting a little angry , said joe robles jr , a retired army general and member of the commission who received calls from mr white and a senior army official it looks like they 're just trying to score brownie points with california senior administration aides denied playing politics with a process that had remained largely apolitical through three earlier rounds of base closings they said they were just trying to clarify what the eightmember commission really meant to say on mcclellan , since this is the last scheduled round of closings i wanted to understand what each was thinking , and we have an obligation to talk to them , mr white said in a telephone interview but in none of the earlier rounds has an administration hemmed and hawed so openly , for political reasons , over a panel s findings in 1988 and 1991 president george bush quickly endorsed the commission s work and sent it to congress , which speedily approved the findings the same was true in 1993 , under president clinton this dithering has hurt the president more than anything , said a commission member , who spoke on condition of anonymity california politicians are also upset , because they say that the assurances do not guarantee that the jobs will stay in the area by law mr clinton has until july 15 to approve the commission s list or send it back with specific objections if the president were to send it back , the panel would have until aug 15 to make any changes at that point , mr clinton would have to accept or reject the list in its entirety mr clinton met for 90 minutes on saturday with defense secretary william j perry , mr white , gen john m shalikashvili , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff leon e panetta , the white house chief of staff , and anthony lake , the national security adviser much of the meeting focused on how to keep mcclellan s jobs in private hands after the base closed , a concept called privatization in place mr clinton asked pentagon officials to provide in the next few days more details on how this would work also at issue was whether the commission s recommendation on mcclellan allowed the pentagon to award local contractors those jobs lawyers for the commission said it did pentagon lawyers wanted more specific language this disagreement prompted the phone calls from pentagon officials to individual commissioners as far as i'm concerned this was drafted as an open process and should be an open process , said wendi louise steele , a commissioner if i were in their position , i would n't make those calls but other commission members said they saw no harm benjamin f montoya , a retired rear admiral who said he received calls from mr white and secretary of the navy john dalton , said secretary dalton called and wanted to know what procedure i 'd find acceptable i do n't think it was lobbying he just wanted my views on the language j b davis , a retired air force general who said he spoke to mr white and secretary of the air force sheila widnall , said it does n't upset me at all they 're just trying to measure something before they put it on the table but general davis said that the white house had overreacted to the concerns of california s two democratic senators , barbara boxer and dianne feinstein , before receiving the commission s recommendations on july 1 almost anything they do now appears political , he said in response to a letter from mr white , mr dixon repeated in writing on saturday what he had said publicly for weeks that the commission s recommendation authorizes the pentagon to transfer all work at mcclellan , except about 800 communications jobs , to any other defense department depot or to any private sector commercial activity , local or otherwise , including privatization in place the panel directed that the communications jobs go to the tobyhanna army depot in pennsylvania mr white said mr dixon s letter and his conversations with other commission members satisfied the pentagon s legal questions
washington , sept 6 of all the props at all the capitol hearings that now seem to occur here as an endless series of tabloid tableaux the rifle waved at the waco hearing , the scribblings of the suicidal presidential aide at the whitewater inquiry none appeared as purely theatrical as the simple woodandglass cabin door displayed today as the senate opened its inquiry into the shootout at ruby ridge , idaho the door stood unhinged and leading to nowhere in a display bracket its calicofringed denim curtains added an american gothic touch as the senators arrived to hear a tale about guns and backwoods individualism and ninjasuited government sharpshooters in which three people died in a bloody showdown in august 1992 the door stood upright to the senators' left , looking as flimsy as a leftover prop from summer stock it had a single clean bullet hole in the glass that , for all its suggestion of bmovie stagecraft , was made starkly believable as a scene of siege and madness was described to senators intent on plumbing the ruby ridge case in the telling , one wellarmed man s extremist anticipation of apocalyptic confrontation finally did visit his mountainside homestead with whirlwind fury , a fury that now has turned back on the federal bureau of investigation it was open part way , said randall c weaver , a whiteseparatist gun fancier , who stood at the door showing the senators how his wife , vicki , was suddenly shot through the head by an fbi sharpshooter as she stood by the door holding their 10monthold daughter the previous day , a gunfight erupted between a team of united states marshals and mr weaver s son , samuel , and when the smoke cleared his son as well as one of the marshals were dead mr weaver s stark tale seemed to catch the national mood of unease about police professionalism it brought allusions to corruption in philadelphia and conspiracy theories at the o j simpson trial from members of the senate subcommittee on terrorism , technology and government , who listened closely mr weaver , a lean , darkbrowed , grayhaired man , wore blue jeans and a gray denim shirt in visiting the federal city he has long distrusted he bunched the curtains back a little , trying to show them at the moment the sniper s bullet crashed through and struck down his wife she was holding elisheba , our 10monthold baby girl , in her arms , he recalled as the senators sat rapt wary officials of the justice department , whose version of the debacle will come later in the hearings , watched from a windowed witness booth overlooking the hearing room we took the baby from her as she lay dead and bleeding on our kitchen floor , the father said in his numbing narrative , mr weaver told of defying federal authority on a charge of illegally selling two sawedoff shotguns , only to face a hightech armada of government sharpshooters in the idaho north country the lives of his wife , their 14yearold son , sam , and a federal marshall , william degan , were lost in a gunfight that has come to haunt the fbi as much as mr weaver for its shoottokill rules of engagement against an embattled american family the swashbucklers are in control , said senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa , complaining of what he termed the militarization of the fbi in the force and rules the bureau used at ruby ridge more than a dozen fbi officials have been suspended or disciplined in a devloping scandal in which documents were destroyed in a suspected coverup mr weaver told his tale with a soft twang that yielded to silence when he fought tears in trying to describe how his kin died and his loner s world came crashing about him there were advance fears that his story might provide explosive new inspiration to the nation s ragged interest in extremist and militia dalliances but mr weaver , who had shepherded his family of six with 14 guns at hand in the idaho wilds , spoke rather mournfully of his individualism his expertise sounded especially pathetic as he spoke of the weapon fired from afar through the door to bring down his wife a 308caliber sniper rifle with a specially weighted barrel and a 10power scope in hindsight , he agreed with senators that his search for white separatism was not really practical , just as one of his bumper stickers was hyperbolic in declaring the government would have to unclaw his cold dead fingers to enforce gun controls i am not without fault in this matter , said mr weaver , who was eventually acquitted of all major weapons and homicide charges in the aftermath he also was awarded a 31 million damage settlement by the government as evidence surfaced that he might have been denied full opportunity for court defense and surrender negotiations if i had it to do over again , knowing what i know now , i would make different choices , he said i 'd have come down from the mountain for the court appearance , he said of the gundealing charge that he chose to ignore in his mountainside standoff but my wrongs did not cause federal agents to commit crimes , he said , bitterly demanding a full account of government behavior in his losses , in which his young son , despite all his father s personal training in gunmanship , perished in a sudden outdoor faceoff with federal agents the citizens should know , said the rugged individualist , sounding sad he had to concede that his court acquittal and the fact that he was being heard out fully in the capitol was a revelation in itself for a man used to denouncing government people as liars they 're giving me a fair shake now , he said warily as the hearing went forward into the question of how such a man as mr weaver came to prompt such furious deadly force from the government photo randall c weaver at a senate hearing demonstrating his view of the raid by federal agents at his idaho cabin , during which an fbi sniper killed mr weaver s wife , vicki a senate subcommittee today began its inquiry into the raid senate aides held the door to the cabin , shot through by the sniper \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg b14 \)
amherst , mass , feb 14 george washington university , chelsea clinton s favorite basketball team , accomplished tonight something no other school could do over a span of 41 games going back more than three years the colonials beat massachusetts on the minutemen s campus court , 8078 , in a tingling , bruising match that followed by 10 days a george washington victory over the minutemen in washington president clinton and his daughter saw that one , a 7875 upset that came at a time when umass was ranked no 1 in the land this victory by george washington \( 169 and 94 in the atlantic 10 \) not only ended a 41game winning streak here by umass , but also marked the first time since the 19901991 season that umass \( 183 , 92 \) has lost twice in one season to the same team rutgers was the last double winner over the minutemen , in the third season here for coach john calipari calipari and mike jarvis , the george wwashington coach , were verbal and visible throughout tonight s contest while harassing two veteran officials , john hughes and art mcdonald each coach was assessed a technical foul and later one of the colonial players , antoine hart , said , we let the coach do all the hollering and screaming we did the playing they played very well hart was speaking of the composure he and his teammates maintained in the hostile environment of the mullins center and its 9 , 943 loud spectators no umass team had lost here since this arena opened two years ago and west virginia was the last visitor to win on this campus , 7675 , on jan 8 , 1992 jarvis did not regard any of the broken umass streaks as important what s most important is that we won our 16th game , he said it was one of those nights when with two minutes to go i thought we were going to win , because with everything that happened we had an answer , he added i know that against this team , if we do n't play hard we 'll lose that s why it s war when we play umass the theme of warfare in this series was also used by calipari who said of the game , war , like always umass led only once , 76 the minutemen trailed by as many as 11 points in the first half , by 14 in the second , and they kept coming back only to be turned back they were down by 10 with 57 seconds left and at the end closed to the 2point margin when tyrone weeks , the backup center playing for injured marcus camby , made a tipin basket at the buzzer calipari said of the defeat this humbles us , all of us we did n't shoot well and did n't make free throws he pinned the loss on the failure of his team three times in the last two minutes to exploit a captured rebound off the offensive backboard a following shot failed and george washington got the ball back none of the statistics gave george washington any advantage except the final score the minutemen , for example , outrebounded the colonials , 5140 neither side shot well from the floor or from the foul line umass almost always does better than its 375 field goal percentage , 310 in the first half , and the minutemen missed 13 free throws

los angeles , jan 24 the jury , the victims' families and the press that crowded into courtroom 9307 had all been warned that , inevitably , the moment would come when grisly photographs from the death scene would be shown but few , it seems , were prepared for the sight of the brutally slashed body of ronald l goldman as it was flashed on the huge video monitor there was a sharp gasp from spectators , then choked sobbing frederic goldman , the victim s father , lowered his head , pulled his glasses from his face and softly moaned his wife , patricia , grasped his shoulder , her face also tearful , trying to comfort him juditha brown , nicole brown simpson s mother , slumped in her seat on the bench behind them next to her , her three daughters cried softly on the other side of the aisle , mr simpson s family was equally distraught one woman put her arm around eunice simpson , mr simpson s mother , to comfort her and she grimaced , then took a deep breath moments later , the spectators gasped again when prosecutors displayed a photograph of nicole simpson s body curled in a fetal position across a bloody sidewalk all the while , o j simpson , seated at the defense table , wrote furiously , his face impassive , his eyes only intermittently leaving the notepad but steadfastly staying away from the views of the crime scene it was , perhaps , the only episode today that galvanized spectators who had seemed weary by waiting and by the drain on their emotions that the long wait had entailed they filed in quietly today , as yesterday , like parishioners coming to church , solemnly taking their assigned seats and so they remained , subdued , attentive and ineffably sad at the afternoon recess , the goldman family , seated in the front row of spectators , turned around , and grasped each other s hands and those of lou and juditha brown and their daughters about 100 people who were in the courtroom today , including jurors and court officers , saw the enlarged photographs of the bodies of nicole simpson and ronald goldman on a large video screen mounted above the witness stand judge lance a ito ordered the television monitors that feed closedcircuit broadcasts to the pressroom and to the rest of the world blacked out before the photographs could be shown for most of today s session , however , lawyers on both sides of the simpson case took pains not to overwhelm the jurors christopher a darden , the deputy district attorney who gave the first of the prosecution s opening statements , rarely raised his voice , maintaining a conversational tone , even stumbling at times there was none of the fierce passion that had flared in earlier court appearances marcia clark , the chief prosecutor , who has often seemed aggressive and truculent during pretrial hearings before judge ito , was reserved , almost deferential as she spoke to the jury , measuring each word , especially when explaining complex evidentiary matters , like dna testing outside the criminal courts building here , opportunism tinged with neediness permeated the sidewalks as hundreds of people gawkers and souvenir hawkers crowded the sidewalks awaiting whatever excitement and discord might unfold within civility has been abandoned in the hustle to be a part of history , no matter how small the role one man carried a huge placard with a wanted poster of his mother that offered a 25 , 000 reward for her arrest not far away a vendor , wearing a tattered coat and a soiled , red cap , was selling baseballcardsized photographs of mr simpson dressed like a clown , with a red fright wig and bulbous nose simpson media circus , the cards said , 1994 1995 season pass los angeles , of course , is accustomed to sensational trials and lawsuits and the camp followers who attend them but the swedish daily newspaper svenska dagbladet never requested seats in the courtroom for the trial of the police officers who beat rodney g king it has in the simpson case and french radio did not send correspondents to file dispatches from the trials of lyle and erik mendendez for their parents' murder it has in the simpson case indeed , the onslaught of several hundred journalists from around the world prompted the radio and television news association , coordinator of the trial coverage , to rent a parking lot across the street , known by its inhabitants as camp o j the lot is now home to more than 40 satellite trucks and airconditioned trailers , many of which contain control rooms ready to go to instant live coverage of key testimony , closing arguments and the verdict cable television s court tv is offering gaveltogavel coverage cnn and e ! entertainment television plan to offer extensive live coverage fox broadcasting is providing its affiliates a feed from the courtroom s pool cameras , to be used at the affiliates' discretion the three remaining networks , abc , cbs and nbc , plan to cover opening statements , and then offer periodic trial updates
london , oct 5 in a move that contrasts markedly with the way the court handled the news media in the o j simpson trial , a judge here has thrown out an assault case and threatened editors of eight newspapers with contempt charges because of pretrial publicity judge roger sanders called newspaper coverage unfair , outrageous and oppressive in throwing out the case on wednesday and said it had damaged the rights of the defendant , geoffrey knights , to a fair trial mr knights , a businessman who is often the subject of tabloid newspaper articles , was facing assault charges from an altercation with the driver of a cab carrying a soap opera star he has been dating for seven years the collapse of the case at the pretrialhearing stage shows how differently britain grapples with the complicated freepress , fairtrial issue here , newspapers and broadcasters operate under strict rules that prohibit publishing or offering details on the air that could influence a jury those who flout the rules can receive fines that usually run to the tens of thousand of pounds juries are rarely sequestered to keep them away from news reports instead , the reports themselves are usually bare bones and contain none of the lurid details familiar to readers of american trial coverage although the tabloids are known to engage in excesses in the course of the coverage of other events cameras are not permitted in british courtrooms , although one was allowed several months ago inside a courtroom in scotland as an experiment it was not widely seen as a success , and the fallout from the simpson case now makes it doubly unlikely that the idea will spread the simpson case is widely seen here as one in which justice went haywire , in part because of frenzied coverage still , broadcasts of the trial drew large audiences as an example , a sensational trial opened on tuesday in winchester , that of rosemary west she is accused of joining her husband , who has since committed suicide , in murdering ten young women and girls , including her own daughter the jurors were sent home on tuesday with an admonition not to read or listen to news reports about the case , and in any case legal restrictions prevent the news media from reporting what goes on in the courtroom in the jurors' absence until the trial is finished , lawyers are not allowed to comment publicly restrictions on trial coverage were tightened by a new law in 1981 , the contempt of court act essentially it said that in bringing a case against editors or owners of news organizations , the attorney general did not have to prove that they intended to create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to a trial , merely that they did create it i think that in both the united states and britain the balance between free speech and other public interest needs to be adjusted , said lord lester , who often argues before the european court of human rights in the us it s slanted too much in favor of free speech against fair trial in this country it s traditionally been too much in favor of fair trial and against free speech the tabloids' fascination with mr knights stems in part from his stormy relationship with gillian taylforth , who is a star in the soap opera eastenders last year they lost a libel action against a tabloid that said they had performed a sex act in a parked car today attorney general nicholas lyell said he was examining the case against the eight newspapers , which printed headlines such as knights beats me to a pulp he said he would contact the editors to hear their side and then decide whether or not to bring contempt charges
the white house picked hyde park as the site of yesterday s meeting between boris yeltsin and bill clinton because the roosevelt homestead is a symbol of the wartime alliance between moscow and washington the more relevant symbolism of the hudson river estate might have been franklin roosevelt s acute instinct for balancing politics and diplomacy it is a commodity that will be much needed in the months ahead as mr clinton and mr yeltsin try to guide the volatile relationship between their countries through the heat of presidential elections in both the united states and russia the domestic political pressures already bearing down on both men were evident at hyde park , where much of the discussion dealt with russia s role in a bosnian peacekeeping force that would follow a balkan peace agreement the two leaders reported they made some progress , and mr yeltsin said russian troops would participate but despite a giddy news conference , where mr yeltsin s admonishment of the press left mr clinton oddly convulsed by laughter , they resolved none of the hard questions about russian involvement mr yeltsin , eager to show that russian prerogatives cannot be ignored , has refused to contribute troops if the peacekeeping force is under nato command mr clinton has rejected mr yeltsin s proposal of united nations control the spirit of hyde park suggests a compromise that can satisfy the two presidents' political concerns without undermining their principles russia must be represented in any peacekeeping mission lest the force appear tilted against the bosnian serbs and their allies in belgrade without serbian cooperation there can be no peace in bosnia but russia does not have to be an equal participant with the united states , britain , france and other countries the value of a russian role can be preserved if russian troops play a support role and do not take part in combat operations that might be required to keep the peace that way nato command can be maintained , which is essential to avoiding the blurred lines of authority that crippled un peacekeepers in bosnia the bosnian mission should not be freighted with the highly charged issue of nato expansion some clinton aides mistakenly see russian participation in bosnia as a first step toward enlarging the alliance , and some of mr yeltsin s advisers just as mistakenly see a russian role there as capitulation to nato peacekeeping in bosnia is not a test case for nato expansion it is still far from clear that expansion of a coldwar military alliance is necessary to consolidate democracy and market economics in central europe today for washington to push expansion now , and make it integral to the bosnian case , seems not only gratuitous but selfdefeating the surest way for washington to encourage nationalism and rearmament in moscow is to push nato expansion as russia turns toward parliamentary elections in december and presidential balloting next june franklin roosevelt held the world war ii allies together with shrewd leadership and a subtle sense for the mix of politics and foreign policy mr clinton and mr yeltsin should follow his example
i agree with paul starr s comments about the potentially harmful consequences of managedcare expansion as part of the republicans' program to control medicare and medicaid expenditures \( look who s talking health care reform now , sept 3 \) corporate america is appropriating health care in this country with the sole purpose of making profit , by brutally squeezing doctors and hospitals financially and by restricting , and even denying , hightech care to patients the irony of hmo s aggressively seeking medicare patients is evident from the fact that medicare pays less than 70 percent of actual cost obviously , the only way they can make a profit from these patients is to deny care i can vouch from personal experience that this is increasingly taking place however , i disagree with starr s portrayal of the clinton plan as the solution i opposed the clinton proposal largely because of its complex bureaucratic structure and complete governmental domination , not only of decisions regarding the delivery of health care but also , to some extent , medical scientific and educational activities one of my major concerns with the clinton proposal , as well as with the changes taking place today , is the threat to the academic health centers i have yet to learn of an ideal solution to this complex problem i have had the opportunity to travel and work throughout the world in widely different systems of healthcare provision i found none that i would consider ideal or even better than our own my own view is that the concept of regional medical programs , as proposed in president johnson s commission on heart disease , cancer and stroke , of which i was chairman , provides a reasonably good start in approaching the problem michael e debakey , md houston
atlanta , oct 23 advocates for prisoners say last week s disturbances in five federal penitentiaries were a response to congress s refusal to narrow disparities in sentences between crack cocaine offenders and other drug offenders but prison officials and republican congressional leaders say the cause of the disturbances is still under investigation and cautioned against snap judgments since saturday , when a nationwide lockdown was put in effect , the prisoners themselves have not been able to speak publicly several advocates said they were urging president clinton to veto a measure congress passed last wednesday to maintain harsher sentences for crack cocaine offenses , as compared with those involving powdered cocaine the sentences , said wade henderson , the washington lobbyist for the national association for the advancement of colored people , had a disproportionate impact on young , black males , who were more likely to be involved in the crack cocaine trade we are urging president clinton to veto congress s action , mr henderson said speaking of the disturbances , he added as much as we abhor the violence and injury in the prisons , it has focused attention on a glaring inequity which has been virtually ignored it can be changed only if we have an uprising of citizens of good will but others involved in the debate said mr clinton was unlikely to veto the bill because the administration has supported the maintenance of harsher penalties for crimes related to crack cocaine meanwhile , the five prisons where disturbances occurred last week in alabama , illinois , oklahoma , pennsylvania and tennessee were reported quiet today and , like 70 other federal penitentiaries around the country , in strict lockdown conditions under such conditions , said john russell , a spokesman for the justice department , inmates are restricted to their cells or dormitory areas , fed cold meals in paper bags and barred from receiving visitors or making telephone calls mr russell said officials at the five prisons were still estimating the damage while there were several minor injuries to inmates and staff , he said , none were more serious than a broken nose or smoke inhalation the cause of the violence is still being investigated , mr russell said juanita hodges , president of seekers of justice , equality and truth , a prisoner advocate group based in atlanta , said inmates had been waiting for the results of congress s vote on the sentencing measure , as had many of their family members i know they were watching it on cspan at talledega , ms hodges said , referring to the federal correctional institution at talladega , ala , just east of birmingham all during the congressional debate , i was receiving telephone calls from brothers in prison who were watching developments the violence was because of congress s vote but andy dillon , a spokeswoman for representative bill mccollum , the florida republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee s subcommittee on crime , said such speculation was unwarranted even the bureau of prisons did not know the cause of the uprisings , she said , adding , it may suit some people s agenda to attribute the riots to the vote , but we have no indications that that is true ms dillon also said she did not know why inmates were so interested , because any change would not have been retroactive but some defense lawyers , like leslie ballin of memphis , said there was a possibility that such a change could affect prisoners now incarcerated john walters , executive director of the new citizenship project , a nonprofit , anticrime group , said , i think crack is the most serious and destructive domestic force in our society and we ought to have harsher penalties associated with it he continued , it would be bad policy and grossly irresponsible to respond to the developments in the prisons by easing up on the crack trade earlier this year in a voluminous report , the united states sentencing commission recommended ending the 100to1 disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine offenses that disparity has existed since 1988 under current federal law , conviction of possession or distribution of five grams of crack cocaine would mean a mandatory fiveyear sentence with no parole but someone would have to possess or distribute 500 grams of the more expensive powdered cocaine to get the same sentence it is from this disparity that the 100to1 ratio is drawn according to estimates by the commission , about 14 , 000 of the 90 , 000 federal prison inmates are serving sentences under these laws for crack cocaine offenses a study of the 1993 convictions showed that 883 percent of offenders were black , 71 percent hispanic and 41 percent white those convicted of powdered cocaine offenses in that same year were 32 percent white , 274 percent black and 393 percent hispanic federal sentencing data leads to the inescapable conclusion that blacks comprise the largest percentage of those affected by the penalties associated with crack cocaine , said the commission in recommending that the statutory distinction between crack and powdered cocaine be dropped and that the penalties be calibrated in some way other than the static 100to1 ratio but congress rejected the change the first of some 500 recommendation made by the commission since its creation in 1984 that have been rejected republicans say this was not surprising because it was the first time that a conservative , republicancontrolled congress had an opportunity to consider a recommendation from the commission but the clinton administration had also rejected the commission s recommendation and scott wallace , head of the national legal aid and defender association , said it would be difficult heading into an election year to find lawmakers and even a president willing to support a change that he said was fair they have to risk that in the next election there would be a 30second spot from their opponent on how they had voted for shorter sentences for heinous crack offenders , mr wallace said part of what amazes a lot of us is that congress and the president are rejecting the recommendation of a body that was set up precisely to remove politics and snap judgments from the sentencing process so there is n't discrimination
san diego , march 26 alan l keyes , a passionately partisan black conservative who held several state department posts in the reagan administration , jumped into the 1996 presidential contest today , the first of his race to seek the republican nomination in modern political times he vowed to turn the contest into a wideopen debate advocating family values and opposing abortion , an issue many other republicans would just as soon leave on the back burner because of his relative political obscurity , few political experts expect much from mr keyes s candidacy , even if it is based primarily on the incendiary abortion issue but mr keyes , who is 44 years old and now earns a living as a baltimore talkshow host , writer and lecturer , nevertheless plunged in with outspoken vigor this morning somebody has got to stand up and raise the banner , he said thundered , actually in announcing his candidacy during a meeting of the california republican assembly , the conservative wing of the state republican party too many of our political leaders finesse or run away from the questions of principle that will determine the kind of people we are and want to be , he continued we can no longer afford to follow leaders for whom the moral challenge this nation faces is an afterthought the paradigm of all peace and security should be the peace of the unborn child in the womb the assembly is hardline conservative , as only california republicans can be hardline conservative , and mr keyes surely picked a good forum for his announcement no issue scores with assembly members like abortion and mr keyes , a devout roman catholic , more than once brought the house down with his attacks on what he called this moral evil at times he even won applause from the many assembly members who were wearing pins in support of senator bob dole of kansas , senator phil gramm of texas and patrick j buchanan , the columnist and commentator still , mr keyes , who was brought up in a military family and turned toward conservatism while studying government at cornell and harvard , faces major probably insurmountable hurdles with his candidacy though he is on the political lecture circuit and though he served in the reagan administration as an ambassador to the united nations economic and social council and as an assistant secretary of state , he nevertheless is not widely known in the country , is almost never recognized in any national polls and has little campaign financing perhaps worst of all , the half dozen other republican candidates or wouldbe candidates have already laid claim to most of the positions he holds dearest , though most cannot match his impassioned rhetoric in articulating them add to all those hurdles the fact that mr keyes is black in a party whose 20thcentury history has been mainly white he s good for the party and i welcome what he says , said one assembly member , steve mesarch , a high school administrator from palm springs but , well , phil gramm also says it and i'm for him that s the kind of thing a keyes candidacy will constantly have to face william kristol , a republican strategist in washington , offered an even blunter assessment of mr keyes s political prospects alan s candidacy is historical and good for the debate but , no , he s not going to get the nomination , said mr kristol , an adviser to mr keyes in 1988 when he ran unsuccessfully in maryland for the united states senate a 1992 senate candidacy there also failed whatever his 1996 prospects , mr keyes declared his intention today to campaign the length of the country with his message that the cry is not only abortion but also teenage pregnancy , homosexuality , godless schooling and a loss of those values that made this country what it is he asserted that abortion was the central issue in american politics as the century draws to a close he argued that if the nation did not outlaw it , a collapse of the american way was inevitable the debate over abortion epitomizes how we define freedom , he said abortion is a moral wrong we have the opportunity , the duty to stand up and say , 'nay ! ' then , in what seemed to be his own blunt assessment of his political prospects , he concluded this is not a horse race this ca n't be a campaign about winning government power it has to be a campaign about winning back that power that built this country faith , responsibility , family values that is the victory that matters most alan lee keyes current job radio talk show host , columnist and lecturer born aug 7 , 1950 new york city education harvard university , ba 1972 phd 1979 religion catholic military service none married jocelyn marcel , 1981 children andrew , maya and francis government positions ambassador to the united nations economic and social council , 198385 assistant secretary of state for international organizations , 198587 other candidate for the united states senate from maryland , 1988 and 1992 resident scholar , american enterprise institute , 198789 president of citizens against government waste , 198991 interim president of alabama am university , 1991 photo alan l keyes , who served in the state department under ronald reagan , announced yesterday at a convention of conservative republicans in san diego that he will seek the party s presidential nomination \( associated press \)
washington forget the rumors the american president , rob reiner s new film about the pratfalls of an oval office courtship , is a comedy , a romantic comedy a comedy with a political tinge , to be sure , but just a comedy if it bears passing resemblance to the clinton white house , it is only passing the american president , which opens on friday , is as much about the current american president as gone with the wind was about meteorology we have hollywood s word on it and who could dispute it \? mr reiner s film is mostly a happy variation on the king and i , a wry look at what happens when the widower president andrew shepherd \( michael douglas \) , smitten with a spunky environmental lobbyist \( annette bening \) , tries to make romance in front of the world , political rivals and news media included maybe it contains a few cinematic allusions to mr clinton s political tribulations and perhaps a character or two ok , ok , five seem at times to be drawn from the democratic white house s inner circle sure , both white houses push a crime bill with a weapons ban and get heckled for supposedly weakkneed environmental stands both run big legislative campaigns from war rooms both prove democrats are no wimps by bombing a dictator s intelligence headquarters both have short , bright , highenergy domestic advisers both defend flag burning as an example of democracy s resilience both object to rooting into someone s behavior 20 years ago as mindless scandalmongering both like hamburger \( president shepherd is a meatloaf man \) all of this is true but people used to draw the same kind of parallels between jack kennedy and abe lincoln , and that did n't make them the same , did it \? naturally , there are characteristics of the clinton administration that would carry over into this film , mr reiner said in a telephone interview last month this was the one administration we were allowed access to ask the film s prizewinning screenwriter , aaron sorkin , whether the film borrows from the current american president not at all , he says anyway , the whole idea for the american president predated bill clinton s arrival in the white house , even though he was campaigning for the office at the time mr reiner said that he and mr sorkin came upon the concept after they completed the film adaptation of mr sorkin s play a few good men in 1992 basically , we 'd wanted to do a political film set in washington for quite a while , the director said i remembered a project robert redford had approached me with in '89 he 'd been developing it for a long time called 'the president elopes' it was more or less a pure 30 s40 s screwball comedy set in the white house \( william richert , who wrote the screenplay for the president elopes , is questioning mr sorkin s sole screenwriting credit on the american president , but mr reiner said that he and mr sorkin had purposely never looked at earlier scripts we purchased the rights from universal , he said we basically bought the idea of a single president having to date , and we took it from there \) in the hands of mr reiner and mr sorkin , the idea has become less screwballish and more presidential , not to say clintonian get past the teteatete in the presidential residence and the tongue hockey in the china room the american president is a yarn about a popular president whose reelect ratings plunge when his love life becomes fodder for political enemies and a gossipmongering press president andrew shepherd is a brainy democrat , a onetime college professor who skipped vietnam for greater glory on the field of political battle he has an unexplained character problem that his republican foes were not smarmy enough to raise against a widower but that they gleefully trundle out when his romance with a lobbyist becomes public the widower part aside , much of this may sound vaguely familiar to political buffs mr clinton , a brainy onetime college teacher who skipped vietnam , was a pretty popular democrat whose reelect numbers went into the sewer when his personal life hit the tabloids in 1993 \( after first hitting the tabloids the year before , during the campaign \) well , sure , mr reiner said when a film crew spends as much time in the white house as this one did , a little osmosis is bound to occur mr reiner visited the white house five times in 1993 to research the script , including a twoday trek with mr clinton through the presidential schedule mr sorkin was there mr douglas and others also dropped by at the time we were researching the film , whitewater was raging , the paula jones thing had broken , and we thought , 'my god , how do you do that job \? ' mr reiner recalled it s scary to think that some of our more qualified people would shy away from these jobs because , well , who wants the scrutiny \? still , mr sorkin said , the osmosis mostly ends there i looked at presidential diaries going back to johnson lyndon , that is and saw that the white house as a work place was reinvented with every administration , so i had a lot of latitude , he said i'm sure people will say michael j fox is george stephanopoulos , and all that it really is n't that
carriages , but no horses imagine a baseball museum without bats that is kind of how it is at the carriage museum in stony brook plenty of carriages are on display , but no horses horses are very risky , the curator , merri ferrell , said , especially if you are trying to preserve a collection into perpetuity you hitch a horse to a carriage , she said , and faster than you can say , whoa ! there is wear and tear on the carriage it s not ethical to use the carriages anyway , ms ferrell added would the baseball hall of fame allow people to play with babe ruth s mitt \? so the carriages have remained horseless at the museum , part of the museums of stony brook nary a neigh has been heard until last sunday the paumanok driving club of long island offered a demonstration of what it s like to drive a carriage they imported six of their own carriages , and nine of their horses rita and jerry trapani of north great river own 10 carriages and 5 horses our horses get a workout , mrs trapani said they have driven up to the bank teller as a bank drivein does n't stipulate what type of horsepower may drive up , the trapanis have banked by horse waldbaum s could be next they love riding around in their carriages plus we do the driving , mrs trapani said there are n't many carriages with coachmen left on the island the thrill of driving is as exciting as riding for the 70 club members mr trapani is president , and mrs trapani is secretary the club goes for pleasure drives , she said , although it s hard to find trails the width of a carriage two favorite spots are connetquot river state park and blydenburgh county park we also took a ride through paumanok vineyards recently , she said they not only allowed us , but at one of the rest stops we had a wine tasting no wine was served at the demonstration last sunday in stony brook but the public seemed to enjoy the show , and the members the outing we 're in the driving season now , said ms ferrell , who is not only curator , but also a club member when she is not overseeing one of the largest collections of carriages in the world the museum has more than 250 she is riding around in her own she also takes her horse and carriage to schools and , sometimes , to the museum for educational purposes i 've taken my horse to the museum for guide training , she said and to educate children there was a fiberglass horse at the museum , she said , a horse mannequin i was told the kids could learn about horses from that then i saw a kid sitting on the horse s head so i 've brought my horses to the museum besides teaching parts of a harness , she teaches parts of the horse i teach horse anatomy , she said it s important kids see equines in the flesh pogmania as recreation superintendent in brookhaven , kurt leuffen tries to keep abreast of the latest pursuits take pogs mr leuffen never has i'm not a player of pogs , he said but i 've read about it pogs are those little round objects that come in foil or cardboard and portray just about every popular theme if a player is able to flip the pogs face up using a device called a slammer the player wins the pogs for some adolescent boys , pursuing pogs is more attractive than pursuing girls to keep young men busy this summer the recreation department has been sponsoring a pog tournament it s open to those age 6 to 18 , mr leuffen said there are no age divisions the youth just show up with their pogs every friday morning at the new village recreation center they bring their own slammers , too , mr leuffen said it s like carrying personal pool cues the town simply supplies the table , mat or board supervising the competition is sue fitzgerald she s our pog tournament director , mr leuffen said although prized possessions change hands , the town is n't encouraging a form of gambling , he added playing pogs is similar to the flipping of baseball cards in the 50 s only in the 90 s the most coveted pog consists of the head of a skeleton , and the most popular slammer is the o j model , he said a pog championship will be held on aug 25th , and the public is invited mr leuffen said , we 'll set up chairs money and power parties before this summer john powell of medford visited the hamptons about as often as he won the lottery , which was basically never but then mr powell did win a lottery of sorts he was one of the first to bet on george e pataki s becoming governor , and now mr powell is chairman powell of the suffolk county republican committee , a confidant of the governor and one soughtafter guest at hamptons parties i'm out in the hamptons just about every weekend , he said because every weekend sees some type of fundraising event mr pataki has had five in the hamptons this summer and none for less than 1 , 000 a pop , mr powell said all that money being raised , and the governor is not even up for reelection nor are mayor rudolph w giuliani or senator alfonse m d'amato , both of whom had fundraising events last weekend mr d'amato held his in brookhaven , but with his close relationship with an east hampton homeowner , claudia cohen , the senator and mr powell rub elbows at hampton parties almost daily the hamptons are fertile ground for fundraising , mr powell said a lot of people out there are financially stable this being the time of year the financially stable people are in residence , mr powell is busy commuting he does n't have a driver i drive myself , he said , in my ford explorer other chairmen ride around in a caddie or a lincoln i'm a babyboomer chairman another baby boomer , dan quayle was on the east end raising money for representative michael forbes , republican of shirley the senate majority leader , bob dole , was on hand to raise money for his presidential campaign it was at the home of some kansas billionaire , mr powell said you should see these homes they 're incredible what a summer for mr powell sumptuous homes and sumptuous dining i usually lay off the food , he said i try not to eat after 8 pm well , there is always fine wine i do n't drink i have just a club soda with a twist or a coke so what does he get for the 1 , 000 admission \? oh , i do n't pay , he said these fund raisers are all in my county i'm the host photo rita trapani sitting in one of her carriages at stony brook \( michael shavel for the

flint , mich , jan 19 several general motors assembly lines ground to a halt today , deprived of spark plugs , instrument panels , oil pumps and other critical parts made at a sprawling complex here that was struck by 6 , 600 workers on wednesday in pontiac , mich , an assembly plant that produces two popular pickup trucks closed before noon , idling 3 , 000 workers later , a small car plant in lansing and an assembly line in a wisconsin truck plant also shut down , idling more than 10 , 000 workers other plants were expected to close soon negotiators for gm and the united automobile workers met here again today , but did not resolve their dispute over whether gm should hire new workers and give them more parts to manufacture they agreed to meet again on friday morning as negotiators bargained inside the plant , john f charron walked in a slow oval in the damp outside it , holding his picket sign and thinking about the echoing space within the complex it used to be nothing but workers , mr charron , a machine repairman , said of the brick and steel factories where he has worked for 13 years now you see more empty space than you do workers and you see signs that say 'for future business' but it does n't come back it s empty , and it stays empty that spreading emptiness explains why , despite boom times in the automobile industry , the uaw has struck gm factories six times in the past year to match its competitors' efficiency , gm has been steadily depleting its work force it has squeezed maximum production out of those who remain , scheduling a record amount of overtime many union members here say they have been working 12hour shifts , six or seven days a week gm is also trying to contract with more outside suppliers to produce parts once made at complexes like this one gm argues that outside suppliers can make parts more cheaply , because they often pay workers less than half the 42 an hour in wages and benefits that uaw members make at the big three auto makers workers here say they had hustled to cut costs and improve quality , just as gm asked but they say they are not being rewarded with that future business they 're bleeding our jobs out , and enough s enough , said don beauchamp , chairman of the union s local 651 our work force keeps going down and down and down mr beauchamp said general motors had violated the local agreement it signed here last february under the terms of the threeyear contract , he said , the company should have hired 239 workers at the plant in 1994 , and 500 in total through 1996 but , he said , it has hired none a spokesman for the company , john shea , declined to discuss the substance of the dispute or how it might affect other plants we 're not going to speculate about what may happen , he said since the end of 1990 , the company s hourly work force has declined by a quarter , to 246 , 000 from 329 , 000 meanwhile , its sales of cars and trucks have risen 2 percent , to just over five million the result is its remaining hourly workers , who on average are about 46 years old with more than 20 years in the plants , are getting tired many feel that they are making more sacrifices than the company is , without receiving rewards they were promised mr charron , who is 44 , said he served on a committee in his shop area created to make suggestions to management about how to improve the workplace they 'll listen to your suggestions , and then they 'll throw them away without any explanation why , he said they do n't take us seriously

paris , jan 18 prime minister edouard balladur , the frontrunner in spring presidential elections according to all the opinion polls , finally said today that he was a candidate in a statement broadcast on television and radio from his office , the softspoken 65yearold conservative promised a positive , serene and optimistic campaign that would steer clear of personal attacks on rivals to succeed the 79yearold socialist incumbent , francois mitterrand , who will retire in may the announcement today was no surprise as things stand , mr balladur s most formidable rival in the tworound election is a member of his own neogaullist party jacques chirac , the 62yearold mayor of paris seeking to avoid the fray of daytoday governing , mr chirac promoted the appointment of mr balladur as prime minister in 1993 so that he himself would have a clear shot at the presidency , for which he ran unsuccessfully in 1988 after two years as prime minister mr balladur , riding a wave of popularity as france starts to recover from an economic recession , said he was running to prepare the country for the competitive economic rigors of the 21st century france does not have to be afraid not of the future , nor of others , nor of the world , he said she should believe in herself france s main european partners are already preparing for a balladur victory chancellor helmut kohl of germany , a close friend of mr mitterrand s , recently spent a day cementing personal bonds with the asceticlooking prime minister at a ski resort in the french alps mr kohl s aides say mr balladur is as convinced as mr mitterrand is that the key to the future development of europe is a close relationship between france and germany but they worry about whether he can avoid being tainted by corruption scandals that have forced three ministers in his cabinet to resign in the last year mr kohl s real favorite , german insiders say , had been jacques delors , who stepped down today as president of the european union s executive commission mr delors , a socialist , surprised voters at the end of last year by announcing that he was not in the race since then , three socialists lionel jospin , henri emmanuelli and jack lang have said they would be available to run when their party picks its nominee next month none of them is anywhere near mr balladur in the opinion polls , which show him winning 40 percent or more of the vote in the first round on april 23 a runoff among the leading candidates on may 7 will decide the winner if no one wins a majority in the first round according to the daily le monde , two out of three members of the neogaullist party , the rally for the republic , support mr chirac , but 7 of the 11 cabinet ministers from the party are backing mr balladur foremost among them is interior minister charles pasqua , who has led a popular crackdown on illegal immigration from north africa and elsewhere over christmas , mr pasqua made the prime minister look like an antiterrorist hero when french paramilitary troops stormed an air france plane hijacked by islamic extremists from algeria mr mitterrand , who has been president since 1981 , is suffering from cancer of the prostate so far mr balladur is the 10th candidate to throw his hat into the ring to succeed him for a sevenyear term among the others is jeanmarie le pen , the leader of the farright national front , who won more than 14 percent of the vote in the first round in 1988 on an antiimmigrant platform
with the help of state officials , various nonprofit organizations and causes across the country are moving beyond the bumper sticker to the specialty license plate , an effort to raise awareness as much as to raise money , or more so thirtysix states now have specialtylicenseplate programs , which charge motorists extra fees for tags bearing the name of a group or a message promoting an approved cause , the american association of motor vehicle administrators says in most cases , the association says , the sponsors can keep part or all of the premium while some states offer only a limited number of fundraising plates , benefiting things like universities , environmental initiatives and arts programs , others , like connecticut , also issue plates in cooperation with qualifying community groups , like the american federation of garden clubs maryland issues plates to raise money for the chesapeake bay trust save the bay drive , and maine offers an environmental loon plate , with money going to state environmental agencies new york expanded its specialtyplate program last year to include organizations , and so far about a dozen nonprofit groups are participating , said gene rosenthal , speaking for the custom plates division of the new york department of motor vehicles plates supporting these groups , which include universities , a police organization and celebrate broadway , an arts group , cost from 5 to 50 above the regular license plate fee most popular is the plate for members of the fraternal order of police 900 have been sold , carrying a surcharge of 5 state officials say they are also planning to offer an environmental awareness plate to raise money for environmental purposes but while the number of specialty plates appears to be on the rise , the plates' usefulness as a moneyraising tool is more often than not limited mr rosenthal says it is doubtful that any sponsor is rolling in money from the surcharges fund raising is probably the last reason groups get plates , he said it s good advertising , but they 're not pushing fund raising this is demonstrated by the fact that we do n't have a large number of people doing it for the last three years , the four state universities in alaska have been trying to raise money through specialty plates , according to dell jensen , office manager of the alaska motor vehicle department s juneau field office but the program is not turning out as planned the juneau office has only sold 35 university plates in the three years , mr jensen said although there is some potential for raising money with specialty plates , many sponsors offer them mainly for member identification in maryland , whose 175 participating organizations were the most of any state last year , nonprofit groups can set any premium for their specialized plates and keep all , part or none of it but thomas johns of the maryland chapter of the disabled american veterans said his organization had sold 4 , 501 plates this year at the regular 15 state fee we do n't do it as a fund raiser we never have , he said we do it to allow our members to identify themselves california lays claim to having begun the issuance of specialty plates to benefit groups and causes , first offering them in the 1970 s and there , at least , money is clearly the object in the last four or five years , there has been a concerted effort to produce plates for fund raisers , said william madison , a spokesman for the department of motor vehicles california now offers only six fundraising plates , which benefit staterun , nonprofit organizations and causes the beneficiaries get most of the surcharge , which is in addition to the standard 27 plate fee money raised from the sale of ucla plates , for example , helps finance scholarships at the university , while proceeds from a new series of plates bearing a firefighter s logo , circulation of which began on sept 1 , will help finance a monument to california firefighters mr madison said the most popular specialty plate by far , with 27 , 000 buyers last year , was a yosemite plate , whose proceeds go toward preservation efforts in the national park as of june , california had sold 45 , 173 specialty license plates this year , mr madison said illinois has added a twist , letting groups sponsor temporary special event plates to promote things like the annual champaignurbana duck race and the cheese festival in the town of arthur specialevent plates , which illinois has issued since 1983 , are particularly popular in small communities , said dave urbanek , press secretary to the illinois secretary of state they are attractive fund raisers for a small organization , like the farmersville centennial celebration , he said they raise seed money for an organization but getting one also involves a small amount of pride plate buyers in the state capital may have another motive , mr urbanek said here in springfield , license plates are a big thing , he said people like to have low digits or even single digits on their license plates even if it s only for two months photo a maryland license plate whose issuance raises money for the chesapeake bay trust save the bay drive is just one of many plates around the country promoting nonprofit organizations and causes \( marty katz for the new york times \)
high schools guard versus guard shaheen holloway , of st patrick s in elizabeth , nj , believed that his new york city homecoming in the adidas super would turn out much different than it did yesterday at fordham university the nation s no 1 rated junior point guard expected it to be him against stephon marbury , the country s topranked senior guard holloway also anticipated his shots falling with consistency and his team , ranked no 19 in the nation , knocking off the land s no 10 team , lincoln but none of holloway s dreams came true yesterday although the 5foot10inch guard

to the editor fretful latvians turn to german with a racist past \( news article , oct 17 \) exaggerates the importance of joachim siegerist s gains in the latvian parliamentary elections the good news about the elections is that no party won more than 18 percent , which means parties that want to enter into the government will have to move to the center and compromise their extremist programs mr siegerist , with 16 percent of the vote , was no winner the bad news about the election was that 48 percent , almost half of all latvians , voted for bossist , or oneman , parties a former communist and kgbcombined party called boss , led by ziedonis cevers and assisted by a kgb functionary , ivars kezbers , won 18 percent the unity party , led by a onetime adviser to mikhail s gorbachev , the former soviet leader , won 8 percent janis jurkans , the somewhat more democratically inclined former foreign minister , gained 6 percent all the above are law , order and prosperity parties the danger may be that despite their ideological tilt , they combine to form a government if such a coalition fails , that is hardly a chance for any other combination to gain 50 percent , which means a new election will need to be called among the nine parties that gained seats in the parliament , none have traditional names a european politician would recognize four of the parties were organized by individuals who , though short on charisma , had large amounts of cash mr siegerist s money comes from germany the sources for other bossist parties are more mysterious andrew ezergailis ithaca , ny , oct 17 , 1995 the writer is professor of history , ithaca college
when arthur crier was driving his 2yearold granddaughter to day care in the bronx recently , a police officer stopped him because the child was not in a car seat but on her brother s lap mr crier , a 68yearold blues singer , instinctively reached for his wallet to pull out his license the officer , he said , followed his own instincts he pulled his gun he was real nervous , mr crier said and that made me real nervous on the streets of the central bronx , mistrust between the police and the people flourishes in what seems to be a morally ambiguous landscape where mothers push strollers past drug dealers , where third graders roll imaginary joints and where teenagers interrupt jump shots to hawk heroin in such a landscape , top police officials say , the police in the bronx have evolved a separate culture , a more aggressive style of policing that apparently makes it easier for them to cross the line into brutality and illegal activity in the last year , particularly , many officers seem to have interpreted misinterpreted , officials say orders to crack down on drugs and minor street crimes as a kind of license to abuse as a result , police officials say , they now face a crisis in the bronx , where the twin problems of police brutality and corruption have spilled beyond the criminal world to touch ordinary citizens this week , the new york city police department is preparing to arrest up to 12 officers who work the overnight shift in the 48th precinct in the bronx on allegations of drug dealing , beating up suspects , busting down doors without warrants and lying in court , according to law enforcement officials alarmed by a surge in complaints throughout last year , the civilian complaint review board has pressed inquiries in all of the borough s 12 precincts the police department and the bronx district attorney s office are conducting investigations into not only the 48th precinct but also the adjacent 46th and 44th covering such neighborhoods as east tremont , university heights , morris heights and the south bronx in the 48th precinct , all told , about 20 officers are expected to face arrest or departmental discipline in several other bronx precincts , police officials are investigating scores of additional officers on the suspicion that they committed perjury in court , broke into apartments without warrants , and engaged in brutal behavior many of the offenses already uncovered small groups of officers working together to shake down drug dealers and abuse suspects are similar to the patterns of abuse that led to more than 30 arrests in the 30th precinct in the last year at this point , none of the individual precinct scandals in the bronx appear to be as deep , but taken together , they seem to paint a picture of the police in wide swaths of the bronx acting like undisciplined rogues on the loose maybe our firstline supervisors failed , said assistant chief rafael pineiro , the police department s bronx borough commander i think they did he added the problem is a matter of attitude by some of our cops they are overly authoritarian sometimes two weeks ago , gregory brea , a 46th precinct community police officer was convicted of extorting cash payoffs from drug dealers and tipping them off before raids in march , officer francis x livoti of the same precinct became the first onduty officer indicted on a homicide charge in three years his indictment arose from the death of anthony baez , whose confrontation with the police in december began when a football he threw hit a patrol car tensions between the police and the community erupted on march 31 at william howard taft high school when two police officers broke up a fight between two girls , a youth who was watching shoved one of the officers to the ground the officer called for help , and as dozens of officers from the 44th and 46th precincts arrived , residents and students threw debris at them in the melee that followed , the police arrested 13 students , including one who needed treatment for a concussion a style of policing 'you have to be tough to survive' i 've been hearing about brutality in the 48th since i got here in '65 , said mr crier , the singer , who has been coordinating local youth activities for 14 years the kids are always complaining about being harassed by cops with a nasty attitude when the knapp commission investigated the police department in the early 1970 s , it found that the police in the bronx systematically took bribes from bookmakers the roots of police misconduct in the bronx were nourished in the mid1980 s , when crack emerged and easy money flowed through the borough as a temptation to youths and officers alike and then came the election of mayor rudolph w giuliani , who ordered the police force to become more aggressive in sweeping up drug offenders a convicted bronx officer named bernard cawley described to the mollen commission in 1993 how the police in the 46th and 48th precincts customarily tuned up suspects with their nightsticks at random and made lucrative deals with narcotics peddlers in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s
what a hubbub over such modest music what a large frame to put around such small art paul bowles s visit to new york , after nearly 50 years in morocco , touched the city with the story of an exile returned and how touching it might really have been on a more suitable scale greetings from remaining friends , some gentle public acknowledgment of his erstwhile composing career , a chat with the press , perhaps a visit to old haunts what greeted mr bowles instead last month was a neartorrent there were the celebratory concerts at alice tully hall , both very well attended prominently displayed interviews were drawn with difficulty from an 84yearold man who is not in the best of health the cream of new york s freelance community reconfigured into a new group called the eos ensemble add to everything else a book tiein some of the younger generation s best singers actors like rosemary harris and tom hulce a garish but thoroughly produced adaptation of the bowleslorca zarzuela , the wind remains , and sprinkled over all what must have been a considerable amount of money we americans are good at getting things done , but we do not always choose our targets wisely the most effective killers often bear not guns but kindness , and what happened here was what happens so often in american culture the medium transcended the message if you want a more cynical assessment , try this one that paul bowles week had more to do with the careers of those who put it on than with mr bowles himself he is a romantic figure , our icon of the footloose american , nephew to the lost generation of hemingway and fitzgerald he has shared that fearless , innocent american eagerness to explore the strange world outside mr bowles has said all this in his writing as well as in his life the sheltering sky has entered the 20th century s literary repertory , and short stories like the delicate prey still bear a malicious charm mr bowles s principal gift to americans has been a certain kind of daydream , a gauzy image of escapism tinged with dissolution the drugs , the beautiful people , the implications of sexual freedom and , above all , the languid exoticism of faraway places where accountability counts for less am i the only one who , trapped in some summertime subway tieup , has let his thoughts turn fleetingly to the happy expatriate smoking hashish on his tangier couch and planning some lurid entertainment for his entourage \? mr bowles may in fact live the life of an ohio accountant , but our fantasies have propelled him elsewhere once he was a composer , with close associations to the stage we heard this music , or a lot of it , over two evenings orchestra suites , songs , a concerto for two pianos , a little stage piece , some incidental music to the glass menagerie none of it is very good its principal charms match the life style a jaunty , whynot hubris that excludes no challenge and shows no fear of failure the cheering thing about paul bowles the composer is that he composed at all he gives amateurism a good name , but amateur unfortunately means other things as well the twopiano concerto chatters with attempted virtuosity nothing much happens repetition seems more an act of necessity , even desperation , than of conviction this comes across in a lot of mr bowles s music he likes bright materials , especially the boulevardier clashes of key , the mexican flavors and the rude injections of pop culture the abrupt , often startling , changes of meter and movement are the big attentiongetters indeed , motion remains the truly interesting aspect of this music , despite \( or because of \) the clumsiness involved the placement of words against notes in songs like in the woods seems terribly awkward , but you are made to listen , at least for a while composers of high sophistication can turn awkwardness into art mr bowles ca n't as an orchestrator , he chooses all the right light bulbs but does n't quite know how to turn them on opening the first concert with stravinsky s suite no 2 for small orchestra was not the happiest of strategies succinct , blinding with color , this gloss on popular culture simply leapt into the listener s ear later in the week , peggy glanvillehicks s settings of mr bowles s letters used middle eastern rhythm with subtlety and depth revueltas s homage to federico garcia lorca offered the rich , impudent yet craftsmanlike spirit of true revolution bowlesiana seemed rather gray beside all three we all want this music to be better than it is art is run by specialists these days , and here was a polymath mr bowles once gave composing an extended try and then thought better of it the first step took guts , the second a shrewd selfsurveyal two evenings devoted to this composer , a man who has made only the most modest of claims for his musical self , seemed an awful lot like overkill to me it s nicer to think of these concerts as a party for the man himself mr bowles liked to write incidental music , and in a sense his pieces relived that function here maybe the art was in the doing persuading him to come here in the first place another explanation is this that the great man , needing a holiday from paradise and facing the prospect of unwanted september visitors , simply came along for the ride
when nardi contreras arrived as the yankees' new pitching coach the other day , he did not bring any 20game winners with him he has none hidden in his equipment bag or stashed in his locker in fact , the coaches' room at yankee stadium is so small it does n't even have room for equipment bags lockers it has seven of them but they are n't big enough to hide a 20game winner either the coaches' room has a small shower stall , but no established starting pitcher was sighted ducking behind the plastic curtain last night andy pettitte was the yankees' starting pitcher against the chicago white sox , allowing nine hits and four walks but only one run in a seveninning , 11 tie it marked the 20th time in 72 games a rookie has started for new york throw in sterling hitchcock , who s in his second year in the major leagues but first in the starting rotation , and the yankees have had 34 of their 72 games started by inexperienced , unestablished youngsters we have the arms here , contreras said , discussing the rotation that s supposed to hurl the yankees to a division championship as long as we have some quality people , they 'll win they 're out there every fifth day they have the stuff they can win well , what else is the new pitching coach supposed to say , especially if he does n't want to become a former pitching coach fast \? george steinbrenner usually makes the changes in pitching coaches , but this change , according to a member of the yankees' family , was the idea of the manager , buck showalter , who was not enamored of billy connors but no pitching coach can construct a pennantwinning pitching staff when he s given a band of rookies for bricks hitchcock began the season as the no 5 starter in a fiveman rotation , but pettitte and mariano rivera \( with brian boehringer thrown into the mix briefly \) have been rushed from the minors because of injuries to jimmy key , scott kamieniecki and melido perez for the first time in his baseball life , steinbrenner has balked at spending money and prospects for established pitchers david cone has not reached yankee stadium nor has bret saberhagen or kevin tapani or doug drabek or jeff fassero or ken hill one may still arrive , but the yankees may need two mercenary pitchers to catapult them to the top the way they have played jack mcdowell is the team s lone veteran starter who has not missed a start he is scheduled to pitch tonight against jim abbott , who replaced mcdowell in the white sox rotation after the yankees discarded him as the link to the two rotations that were so effective last year and have failed so miserably this season , mcdowell was asked for his assessment of both situations the white sox pitching staff had the american league s lowest earned run average , 396 , the only one under 400 , last season this year the white sox era is 532 , exceeded only by minnesota s 584 the yankees have plunged from 434 , fourth last year , to 509 , 11th this year it depends on how people step up and perform , mcdowell said , discussing the yankees' youth movement you ca n't have everyone having their normal years and win a pennant you have your leaders do what they usually do , but everybody else has to step up and do more rookies , of course , do n't have a track record to exceed , so no one knows what to expect from them if expectations are too high , they most likely will fall short much more often than not speaking of expectations , mcdowell said , the expectations were for jimmy to be jimmy and me to be me with jimmy out , i ca n't go out and win any more games than i would have in the white sox clubhouse , the question was whether mcdowell s departure from the staff with which he won the cy young award only two seasons ago was the underlying cause behind its dismal performance one theory has it that the team s young but good pitchers have been unable to overcome the loss of their leader , unable to deal with the increased responsibility who knows \? said terry bevington , chicago s second manager this season i ca n't speak for each pitcher if i'm a pitcher with the team and i was 155 last year and jack mcdowell leaves , why should n't i be 155 again \? i ca n't be a 30game winner making up for jack i'm not saying that did n't happen , but i do n't know jason bere , at 24 , is the chicago s youngest starter after compiling a 122 record with a 381 era last season , he has struggled at 48 and 587 it may have subconsciously happened , he said of the mcdowellabsence theory but there s no need to step up a notch just because jack is n't here you 're just moving up a spot in the rotation i do n't think jack s not being here is an excuse for the way i 've been pitching bere suggested that mcdowell s walk has had less to do with the pitchers' poor performance than their walks last year the staff had the second fewest walks in the league this season it has the most the walks have been the biggest things , bere said the walks and the big hit right after the walks last year it seemed when i gave up the walks , i did n't give up the big double right after this year i'm getting bitten two pitching staffs , two different problems the future does n't appear bright for either
choosing the flags q i 've always noticed the flags of various nations hanging off the sides of bloomingdale s how do they decide which countries' flags to display \? also , how is it decided at the plaza hotel \? a two sets of flags hang outside bloomingdale s , one group of eight on the third avenue side and an identical set on the lexington avenue side we put the flags of popular european and asian countries out there , said david ender , director of corporate public relations at bloomingdale s he said the flags of france , italy , germany , and japan are practically staples the flags are changed around about once a month , when they get dirty , mr ender said , or when , say , there is a merchandise promotion from some country or a group of japanese tourists coming through \( a common phenomenon , mr ender says \) it s a different story at the plaza hotel two of the five flags are always the same the flag of the united states and the emblem of the plaza hotel the other three are changed at least once daily , if not twice or three times it all depends on who s who at the hotel that day diplomats , governors and large foreign groups are likeliest to be honored with the flying of their country or state flags if the 800room hotel has five ambassadors from different countries staying at the same time , the staff switches the flags in the middle of the day so that everyone gets their turn , said curt gathje , a manager at the hotel in charge of the flags and if the hotel is full of americans , i 'll look on the calendar and pray it s canada day or something , mr gathje said we always make sure we are politically correct , he added i would never fly the japanese flag on pearl harbor day the most frequently flown flags are brazil and saudi arabia bong , boink , ding q years ago when i went into a department store in new york city i used to hear this sound i liked bong , bong , bong what was this for \? and how come i do n't hear this today in department stores \? a the bong , bong , bong , or the bong , bing , boink , pause , ding that could be heard in almost all of the department stores around the city was a paging system in the 1960 s and 70 s called autocall , said barbra lewinsky , a spokeswoman for bergdorf goodman , who asked around until she found store employees who remembered the system they told her that every manager was assigned a code for example , the cosmetics counter manager may have been assigned two beeps , a pause and a bong if someone wanted to reach that manager , they would call the store operator , who would in turn project the sounds over the speaker system the manager would know to pick up the phone and find out where the page came from it was a forerunner to the beeper systems that are now in place , she said it seems that none of the major department stores in manhattan still use this system , but for those fans of the binging \( however few you may be \) , it may still be used in some of the older department stores around the country , ms lewinsky said and there s always the doorbell long wait at the fdr q there is an entrance to the fdr drive on east 48th street and first avenue but it has been closed for a long time why \? are they ever going to open that ramp \? a the ramp was closed down more than three years ago because of structural problems the city then took two years to decide whether they were going to repair it temporarily or permanently , or relocate the entrance completely , said allan j fromberg , the spokesman for the city s department of transportation in 1993 , after much pressure from neighborhood residents for a decision , the state took over the project there is a planning study under way , which should be done by the end of november , said dave seaton , a spokesman for the state department of transportation he said that once the study is finished , the department will know how long it will take to reopen the ramp , probably before the next century monique p yazigi

zurich , aug 15 if his brother cannot pull noureddine morceli along to a world record in the mile on wednesday night , perhaps 50 , 000 and two pounds of gold waiting at the finish line will serve as sufficient motivation i do n't run for money , morceli said in an interview today still , it is impossible to overlook the financial rewards of the zurich stop on the mobil grand prix circuit the weltklasse meet is the most bountiful of track and field s invitational competitions in terms of money and talent the recently concluded world championships awarded mercedesbenz automobiles to the winners , but did not offer appearance fees or bonus prizes there is no secret why so many as nine world records will be challenged wednesday , including the mile by morceli of algeria , the 400 meters by michael johnson of the united states and the 3 , 000meter steeplechase by moses kiptanui of kenya andreas brugger , the meet organizer in zurich , has sweetened the pot by offering 50 , 000 and a kilogram of gold for a world record , 7 , 000 for first place in selected events and 5 , 000 for a stadium record morceli and johnson are said to be receiving appearance fees in the range of 70 , 000 apiece , and , organizers suggested on monday , should morceli break his world record in the 1 , 500 meters on his way to setting another standard in the mile , he may receive two bonuses totaling 100 , 000 the mile is approximately 120 yards farther than the 1 , 500 meters and bears a historical and emotional weight unmatched by its metric equivalent we will see , morceli said with a coy smile , when asked of the possibility of double bonus money at 25 , he has been leaping world records this summer as if they were hurdles , setting marks last month at 1 , 500 meters \( 3 2737 \) , 2 , 000 meters \( 4 4788 \) and 3 , 000 meters \( 7 2511 \) sunday , morceli secured his third world championship at 1 , 500 meters in zurich , he resumes his assault on the record books like a mountain climber attempting to scale all of the world s tallest peaks wednesday night , he will attempt to better his world mark in the mile of 3 4439 , because it has stood for two years and because it pays better this year in zurich than the 1 , 500 meters then , if money matters are settled , morceli will attempt on friday in cologne , germany , to become the first person to run two miles under eight minutes , the equivalent of running backtoback subfourminute miles it is his ambition to own every distance record from 800 to 10 , 000 meters you lose nothing by trying , morceli said god has given me a gift i ca n't waste it i do n't want to regret when i get older that i did n't take the chance as unbeatable as johnson is at 200 meters and 400 meters , morceli is even more dominant at distance running since he let himself be boxed in and finished a dismal seventh at 1 , 500 meters at the 1992 summer olympics , morceli has won 37 of 38 races he also owns four outdoor world records while johnson as yet owns none michael had a great championship week , but in terms of international stature , morceli is the man , said brad hunt , who is johnson s agent he s so dominant , no one thinks about beating him slight and stolid at 5 feet 7 inches and 135 pounds , morceli lacks the charisma of the great moroccan runner said aouita , and he runs with his shoulders slumped , as if he is slightly embarrassed by his great talent on the track , though , his long legs transcend his shy personality , and his voluminous lung capacity allows such marvels as the 512second final lap that clinched the world 1 , 500meter title in 3 3373 on the victory stand in goteborg , sweden , emotional tributaries flowed into morceli s face and joined in a flood of tears this was his third world title , and his friends and family were watching on television back in algeria but , he said , he cried out of sadness as well as happiness he has not been home in eight or nine months , and his country is locked in a violent struggle between the government and muslim extremists it was something special for me , with all the hard work and all the suffering , morceli said , speaking as rapidly as he runs for me , it is a shame all over algeria to see people suffer and to shed blood when i win , it gives an example for them there is still hope wednesday night , he will try to set another example with his running , even if sport gives little to politics except convenient metaphors his younger brother , ali , will pace him through the first two laps of the mile in 1 50 or 1 52 , and marcus o sullivan will serve as a rabbit for the third lap then morceli will be on his own , and there is not likely to be anyone who can stay with him already , he is chasing a dream 1 , 500meter race at the 1996 summer olympics to erase the nightmare of the 1992 summer games in barcelona , spain it s a pity and a shame if you do n't learn something from your mistakes , morceli said about getting boxed in at barcelona the only thing i need to complete my career and be one of the alltime greats is to get an olympic gold medal
as more and more questions are raised about beta carotene , until recently considered a wonder nutrient that all on its own could protect against the scourges of disease like cancer and heart disease , another short cut to good health is falling on hard times like many another easy alternative , the lesson with beta carotene seems to be that popping a pill is not enough you have to eat those carrots and broccoli and dark leafy greens , just as you have to exercise to lose weight and make yourself relax to reduce stress although a number of studies have suggested that beta carotene could have a protective effect against cancer and heart disease , nearly all involved people whose diets were otherwise exemplary they ate fruits and vegetables and other foods rich in carotenoids , the large family of nutrients that includes beta carotene after a welldesigned finnish study suggested last year that beta carotene supplements might be harmful , many researchers began to revise their thinking about using supplements alone to reap the purported benefits of the nutrient even if beta carotene turns out to be of primary importance , it might have to be consumed with other carotenoids to be effective for decades , the main interest in beta carotene had been in its role as a parent compound for vitamin a several other carotenoids can also become vitamin a , but none are as good a source or as prominent in foods as beta carotene once in the body , beta carotene can be split into two parts , each of which becomes a molecule of vitamin a , an essential fatsoluble vitamin vitamin a assists in the formation and maintenance of healthy skin , hair and mucous membranes it aids in the ability to see in dim light , and it is needed for proper bone growth , tooth development and reproduction preformed vitamin a is found in animal foods like liver , eggs , cheese and butter all are high in cholesterol , saturated fats or both , and are therefore not featured in a hearthealthy diet if consumed in excessive amounts , preformed vitamin a can be highly toxic , causing blurred vision , loss of appetite , headaches , rashes , digestive and menstrual irregularities , abnormal bone growth , brain and nerve injury , joint pain and liver damage but when vitamin a is obtained from beta carotene , the body makes only enough to meet its needs the conversion is not very efficient six milligrams of beta carotene are considered to be the nutritional equivalent of one milligram of vitamin a excess beta carotene , a yelloworange pigment , enters the circulation unchanged and , when consumed in very large amounts \( for example , by drinking lots of carrot juice \) , it may give the skin a jaundiced look but it is not known to be toxic and it cannot cause vitamin a poisoning modernday enthusiasm for beta carotene stems from the many observational studies that have linked high dietary or blood levels of this nutrient to a reduced risk of suffering a heart attack or developing a number of lethal cancers , especially cancers of the respiratory and digestive tracts beta carotene is known to be an antioxidant , a substance that can sop up celldamaging free radicals and block harmful changes in normal body constituents and in potential carcinogens that enter the body through food , air or water beta carotene may further protect the body by enhancing immune function but in three studies that have been completed thus far , taking supplements of beta carotene did not prevent cancers of the lung or skin or precancerous lesions of the colon as for preventing heart attacks , only one small and as yet unpublished study , a part of the physicians' health trial being conducted by harvard medical school , suggested that beta carotene supplements might reduce the risk of heart attack in men with serious atherosclerosis thus far , however , vitamin e seems to be far more effective as a heartprotecting supplement a team player but keep in mind that beta carotene is only one of about 40 carotenoids that are prominent in common foods until recently , little was known about which and how much of the other carotenoids were present in typical american diets however , dr gary r beecher and his colleagues at the united states department of agriculture have spent almost a decade analyzing the various carotenoids in fruits and vegetables values for five major carotenoids lutein , lycopene , alpha carotene , beta cryptoxanthin and beta carotene are now available for 150 fruits and vegetables and more than 2 , 000 combination foods scientists may now be able to sort out more precisely the relationship between carotenoid consumption and the risk of various cancers and other potentially lethal or crippling disorders in addition , fruits and vegetables contain other substances like indoles , phenols and flavonoids that may interact with carotenoids to protect against cancer the best way to get all the possible benefits that the various carotenoids may bestow is to eat at least five servings a day of a variety of fruits and vegetables , especially those that are dark green , deep yellow , orange and red currently , however , americans fall short even on beta carotene , the easiest carotenoid to obtain because it makes up onefourth of dietary carotenoids while nutrition experts recommend that adults consume at least six milligrams of beta carotene a day , the average adult consumes only 15 milligrams among the foods that are americans' top 10 sources of previtamina carotenoids are vegetable soups , beef stew and orange juice , none of which are concentrated sources of these nutrients nutritionists are also concerned about the current penchant for stripping fat from the diet without fat , carotenoids are not absorbed , and if a lowfat diet is carried to an extreme , it could deprive the body of potentially protective carotenoids thus , eating a carrot between meals or consuming a salad with a fatfree dressing without simultaneously eating a food that contains some fat may not be a useful source of carotenoids
as memorial day approaches and the school year slouches to a close , a frenetic ritual is well under way the teenagers of new jersey are scrambling for summer work , and despite slight improvements in the state s economy , those jobs are still relatively scarce after several years of recession , when young people were competing with adults for summer jobs , the market finally improved last year in the third quarter of 1994 , unemployment among new jersey residents age 16 to 19 was 16 percent , down from 207 percent in 1993 but the chances of finding a job were much slimmer than in the late 1980 s , when a labor shortage made it a summer jobseeker s market , and the state department of labor s annual employer outlook survey , to be published in june , suggests that the market will remain stagnant this summer as well what we hear is that employers expect hiring to be about the same as last year , said jan dejong , chief of the labor department s bureau of labor market information we have definitely improved over the recession levels , but it does n't look like there will be considerable change this summer an exception could be the shore region , where 54 percent of all tourist dollars are spent and businesses experienced an economic rebound last summer in fact , the shore offers more seasonal jobs than any other part of the state , so thousands of adolescents flock there each june , seemingly eager to hawk tshirts , dispense snow cones and deliver seafood platters to tables of tourists but even when the economy is thriving at the shore , the number of summer jobs does not necessarily grow the casino pier and waterworks in seaside heights hires about 700 employees every summer , regardless of the economic mood it may vary by 10 or 20 people , but the number of jobs does n't change , said bill erwin , the general manager , adding that he would be hiring slightly fewer people this season like many shore businesses , the amusement pier has far more applicants than jobs typically , mr erwin said , 700 teenagers apply for 180 positions at the pier s water park for jobseekers who lack seaside lodging , there is a popular alternative the six flags great adventure amusement park the park , located in jackson , is the state s largest private summer employer last summer , about 5 , 000 high school and college students worked as ride attendants , maintenance workers and security guards , among other things so far this year , almost 8 , 000 people have applied for summer jobs at the park , and 3 , 558 mostly teenagers have been hired like boardwalk businesses , great adventure lures the same employees back year after year marybeth clayton , the public relations manager , said 60 percent of the park s employees from last summer were returning for another season some , like zhi zhi kurokawa , confess to wanting a yearround job there it s a great place because the company shows us how much they appreciate us , said miss kurokawa , who at 22 has spent seven summers at great adventure barbecues and bingo games for employees , she said , make up for the long shifts spent under a hot sun and the friendships that blossom among park employees continue after labor day another perk is transportation because many teenagers lack cars , great adventure transports employees between the park and 18 locations in burlington , mercer , monmouth and ocean counties while most summer jobs are found by combing the classified section or scouting out help wanted signs , great adventure actively seeks employees with a corporate approach in january , the park holds a rehire reunion , giving the previous summer s employees the first crack at positions for the coming summer \( the most popular job \?

minneapolis for some time , psychological profiles have been all the rage for major league teams that wish to look beyond raw talent to determine whether a prospect possesses the right stuff for years , the yankees were infamous for using reverse psychology , inadvertently importing far too many sensitive souls despite their onfield credentials , such players as dave collins and ed whitson and more recently danny tartabull were often cowed by a big apple that is too often famous for taking a big bite out of fragile egos recently , the yankees have tended to reverse the whitson syndrome , often with successful results the team brought in teflontough guys like wade boggs and john wetteland they secured jimmy key from toronto , a quiet man who would have made john wayne proud paul o'neill is emotional , but channels it well , occasionally toward a dugout water cooler , but most often toward opposing pitchers , with magnificent results friday night , the roll continued the yankees acquired david cone , the quintessential king of cool pitching for the yankees , even pitching for george steinbrenner , should be a lark to this savvy veteran of the games people play in new york cone could easily provide the boss with his first jousting partner in a long time , a la reggie jackson and graig nettles all that said , the yankees will have to wait to see whether they batted 1000 or merely 500 after their biggest swap meet in recent memory for the yankees not only acquired cone from toronto , but also ruben sierra from the oakland athletics to obtain sierra , the yankees were able to exchange tartabull and what was left of his psyche the nowpardoned yankee right fielder had become shellshocked after too many days of being the boss s biggest target steinbrenner openly questioned tartabull s heart and intestinal fortitude in sierra , the yankees got a player who was arguably the a s biggest enigma , a powerladen switchhitter who suddenly seemed powerless at fending off his own demons sierra feuded openly with the a s general manager , sandy alderson , and , amazingly , with the ultimate players' manager , tony la russa the a s skipper , leaping out of character this season , went so far as to call the player who showed too little patience at the plate and too little pep in the outfield the village idiot that prod caused sierra to immediately collect 20 hits and 17 runs batted in in 50 atbats but sierra , like tartabull , can also run hot and cold he can also run the gamut between sensitivity and brooding sierra , who last year saw a 130rbi pace disrupted by the strike , brought 42 rbi to new york but he has none since july 1 he has 12 home runs , but none since june 27 sierra has a solution for the slumping numbers new york and peace of mind hopefully i can have more fun than i did over there , sierra said upon joining his new team saturday and batting third in the order as the designated hitter i'm going to try to do the best i can , to give my heart for this club because i know we 've got a chance to be a contender , the amazingly softspoken hulk of a man said after going 1 for 4 , with his single a key hit in the yankees' threerun fourth inning i'm going to try to help them win because i'm a winner , and i like to win sierra will try to win in new york , an oasis filled with family why , one of two sisters living in new york owns jimmy s bronx cafe up on fordham road , practically in the shadow of yankee stadium the idea of entering such an environment pleases sierra , who has always enjoyed visiting the city and playing in its most famous park like cone , he will bring allstar credentials and postseason experience unlike cone , sierra cannot point to many happy moments since his lone playoff experience , declaring his last happy time in baseball to be 1992 , when he was traded by texas to oakland in time for the postseason i was real happy because i was in the playoffs , i got out of texas , we were going to have a chance to win the ring , sierra said and i looked good i played good and did the best listen to sierra and it is obvious it has been downhill from there the a s did not let him play baseball the way he plays it , he said , a natural game he says he knows full well how to execute you can try to dominate me , but i know how to play , sierra said i do n't want to be sad playing this game i want to be a happy man i love this game i do it with my heart when i'm playing baseball it s obvious that the heart went out of the player when he played in oakland but yankee stadium and its strident atmosphere is always a curious place for any player to seek refuge , never having been confused with happy acres and la russa , no matter how tough he was , can never be confused with steinbrenner and steinbrenner can never be confused with dr christian barnard or the wizard of oz , for that matter every player should know to bring their own sturdy heart to the bronx and nurture it like never before , if they expect to survive photo ruben sierra \( associated press \)
a city council committee approved pay raises of up to 28 percent for council members and some other elected officials yesterday , and final approval of the increases seemed all but certain when the full council votes on the proposal today committee members endorsed mayor rudolph w giuliani s recent arguments that the city s elected officials , commissioners and managers had gone too long without salary increases , making it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain talented toplevel city employees the mayor has said he would propose a broad package of raises for the commissioners and managers after the raises for the elected officials are approved the council s committee on governmental operations approved the raises by a 5to1 vote , after a fastpaced twohour public hearing in which relatively few people spoke against the increases indeed , city officials have faced very little popular outcry since the increases were proposed by a mayoral commission in october , though some recent opinion polls suggested that new yorkers overwhelmingly oppose the raises under the proposal , a council member s base salary would go to 70 , 000 , from 55 , 000 , and the mayor s salary would rise to 165 , 000 , from 130 , 000 those levels would prompt raises of 23 , 000 for city commissioners , most of whom now make 110 , 000 , and 72 percent for managers none of the elected officials have received pay raises for eight years commissioners last received raises in 1990 , and managers in 1992 the pay levels would be retroactive to july and would remain in effect until june 1999 , when pay raises would be considered once again council members attributed the low level of opposition to the public s recognition that the city council took on greater responsibility when the city charter was changed in 1989 , without a commensurate salary increase they also argued that their constituents seemed to agree that the raises were fair because salaries for elected officials have been frozen since 1987 but members of government watchdog and citizen advocacy groups said people had largely remained quiet out of a sense of powerlessness , because it had seemed clear for weeks that council members would support the raises it s a sign that people are dispirited , said chris meyer , a lawyer for one advocacy group , the new york public interest research group people feel that this is typical of what politicians do giving themselves raises is as immutable as time marching on , and nothing can be done to stop them the front steps of city hall are a common , open forum for rallies and protests involving all manner of controversial issues but the payraise proposal prompted only one such event in recent weeks a press conference called last week by the same boat coalition , an umbrella group for about 120 advocacy and social service organizations and nobody came to it , lamented frank llewellyn of the same boat coalition edward i koch , the former mayor turned talkshow host , said he had fielded few phone calls to his radio show from people opposed to the raises i was a little bit surprised at the low number of calls , mr koch said but i think the vast majority of people understand that public officials are always behind , not ahead , when it comes to pay most people understand that this is fair , and they accept it mr llewellyn noted , however , that the usual organizing entities , including elected officials and unions , had not been up in arms against the raises i think you 'd be hardpressed to find many new yorkers who think the raises are a good idea , he said but there has n't been a powerful center of opposition to rally behind councilman john d sabini , the only committee member to vote against the measure yesterday , said he believed that the council should consider deferring the raises until the next term of office , following the examples of the state legislature and congress
there is a scene in jernigan , a 1991 novel by david gates , about \( and narrated by \) a cynical , selfloathing suburban father living in what sounds a lot like essex county , in which the eponymous protagonist pays a visit to his father , a painter who is something of a renegade , in connecticut it s a pungent but understated encounter , in which the author manages to get across a mutually believed but unspoken truth between father and son , namely that the son has let go of his principles and resigned himself to a secondrate life so how do things march down there in america \? ' the father asks , at one point , over a glass of bourbon america , in his code , jernigan tells us in an aside , meant new jersey historically speaking , new jersey is not the place where fictional characters or novelists or americans , for that matter have gone looking for america unlike , say , new england or montana or the deep south , new jersey does n't exactly leap to mind as having spawned a literature of its own , or a literary school , or a tradition of letters nor has it ever been one of those places viewed as a metaphorical landscape , where god or the nation can be found in the details new jerseyness has never had much resonance now , however , the argument can be made that that is changing , and the sort of jokiness with which new jersey has long been treated in the culture seems a lot less funny indeed , at a time when there is no western frontier for a literary hero to test his mettle against when the contemporary south is being so urbanized and suburbanized that it looks and feels more and more like the contemporary north when problems of race and class seem to affect no place more than anyplace else , and when the psychic malaise of the nation seems to have spread over the continent more uniformly than ever , it makes sense that the issue with which many novelists struggle is the very lack of distinction that has perhaps always been new jersey s most distinguishing feature the rootlessness of contemporary life may well have its roots here in the expanding body of fiction that has found not just a setting in new jersey but also a thematic home here , one finds the work of novelists like mr gates , richard ford \( the sportswriter and independence day \) , jane shapiro \( after moondog \) , mark leyner \( et tu , babe \) , tom dehaven \( jersey luck and sunburn lake \) , ursula perrin \( the lookingglass lover \) , rebecca goldstein \( mazel \) and rick moody \( garden state \) , and shortstory writers like gary krist \( the garden state \) , agnes rossi \( the quick \) and tom perrotta \( bad haircut \) over the last decade they have begun to give voice and character to a place that in the popular culture had long seemed anomalous by its lack of either one my first editor begged me to set the book anywhere but new jersey , said jon katz , whose fictional detective , kit deleeuw , has solved three suburban mysteries since his debut in 1993 death by station wagon , the family stalker and the last housewife from his mall office in the town of rochambeau , nj , which bears a resemblance to mr katz s own montclair he saw it as an unhip , unglamorous place he said 'ca n't you put it in connecticut \? set it anywhere else nobody s going to care about new jersey' the new jersey found in the current spate of books is full of malls and subdivisions , highways and office complexes , lawns and hardware stores and fastfood restaurants and cars and gas stations for followers of american fiction , it has a familiar veneer but beneath the surface , one finds neither the desperate landscape of suburban affluence and despair depicted in john cheever s westchester nor the squalid and forgotten middle america of raymond carver it s less tragic than either one most lives led in literary new jersey are n't all that dramatic or suspenseful , although they 're frequently riddled with anxiety the jersey novel is all about a fruitless attempt at finding community , said michael aaron rockland , who , as chairman of the american studies department at rutgers university , teaches a class in jerseyana we are the most suburban state in the country we have no viable cities we call ourselves the garden state , but we 're the most polluted state my whole notion of new jersey is that we live in a nevernever land , where we pretend we 're living on a farm the real centers of new jersey are these office parks in the middle of nowhere life is not bad in new jersey , not bad at all , but what every writer writes about is our trying to find a center in our lives a case in point is the peripatetic richard ford , a mississippi native who now divides his time between chinook , mont , and new orleans , and whose fiction has spread itself all over north america his bestknown works , however , are the sportswriter \( 1986 \) and its sequel , independence day , published this year both novels are narrated by a middleaged man named frank bascombe and emanate from the years mr ford lived in princeton , taking place largely in a town that much resembles it , a fictional place called haddam
washington , march 24 the senate voted today to repeal a tax break aimed at helping minorities buy cable and broadcast companies , as republicans in congress pressed their assault on affirmative action programs the bill repealing the tax break would use the government s increased tax revenue to offset the losses that would arise from allowing selfemployed americans to deduct part of their health insurance costs from their taxes the tax break s repeal had been expected , and the senate approved the bill on a voice vote because the house approved a different version of the bill on feb 21 , a group of house and senate members will try to work out a compromise bill in the coming days and then resubmit it to each chamber for another vote the senate vote was a setback for viacom inc , the new yorkbased media company viacom agreed last year to sell its cable television systems for 23 billion to a group of investors led by frank washington , a black entrepreneur in california , who had financial backing from telecommunications inc , a large cable company the minority communications tax break currently allows a company to avoid capitalgains taxes if it sells a broadcasting or cable system to a company controlled by members of a racial or ethnic minority but that program came under strong criticism in congress following reports that viacom would receive a tax break worth 400 million to 600 million mr washington and viacom both reacted with dismay to the senators' willingness to change the law i 've been totally unsuccessful in trying to figure out what these people do and why they do it , mr washington said mark a harrad , a spokesman for viacom , said the deal with mr washington s group was contingent on viacom s obtaining the tax treatment available under existing law but the company remains committed to finding a buyer for its cable systems in any case , he added the lack of serious opposition to the bill in the senate reflected not just the current mood of skepticism in congress toward affirmative action programs but also the tremendous political power of selfemployed americans an estimated 32 million selfemployed americans deducted 25 percent of their health insurance premiums last year under the tax break that today s bill would revive and extend the house bill calls for 25 percent deductibility the senate version allows 25 percent deductibility for health insurance costs in 1994 and 30 percent deductibility thereafter the political influence of selfemployed americans had prompted a push in both houses to pass the bill and send it to president clinton for his signature before april 17 so taxpayers could include the deduction in income tax filings then if the deduction is not passed by then , selfemployed people will have a choice of either filing immediately and possibly amending their returns later , or filing for an extension the white house had tried to save the tax break for minorities in broadcasting and cable transactions by proposing ways that the program might be modified , including changes that would have raised the threshold for minority ownership of broadcasting and cable operations under the current law , the minorityowned company can qualify for the program even if it supplies almost none of the capital for the purchase and holds only 20 percent of the voting stock mr washington wrote in a recent letter to senator frank h murkowski , republican of alaska , that his plans called for borrowing 22 billion of the purchase price from viacom while putting up 100 million in equity mr washington said that he would put up 21 percent of the equity , including 21 million of his personal money and the 189 million balance in borrowed money telecommunications inc would hold a smaller ownership stake but might lend part of the 22 billion , he wrote after today s senate vote , senior white house officials said the question of whether mr clinton would fight to protect the tax break was now tangled in the administration s review of affirmative action programs they said it could be some weeks before the president and his aides decide whether the program and others should be protected the white house has been reluctant to threaten a veto because of the popularity of the health insurance deduction senator bob packwood , republican of oregon , the chairman of the finance committee , led supporters of today s legislation while minorities have had trouble raising money to buy cable and broadcast companies , there is not a problem of people refusing to sell such properties to them for discriminatory reasons , so the tax break is not needed , he said but senator william s cohen , republican of maine , disagreed we have yet to fully and honestly confront the fact that racism is an evil that is not simply a stained chapter in our history books , he said it still flourishes in many overt and , i would suggest , even more subtle ways
when you order a shrimp cocktail at gloucester , you get a single giant prawn in a bright blue glass bowl the creature , as large as a small lobster , arrives on a bed of ice with shreds of fresh horseradish and lemon peel dangling from its head like so much seaweed it is probably not what you expected , but then almost nothing at this lavish restaurant is each meal at gloucester is like a ride on the excess express the thrills just keep coming they begin the moment you walk in the door and find yourself in a visual maelstrom of tiles , murals and polished mahogany three majestic cobalt blue glass and copper chandeliers descend from the ceiling , looking like the result of a union between tiffany and disney upstairs in the bar , individual television consoles , each with a headset , await drinkers downstairs in the open kitchen , chefs carve watermelons into women s faces , fashion butterflies out of lobster and arrange the food so artistically it is almost impossible to tell what you are eating it is as if the staid old gloucester house had closed after 47 years only to wake up a year later and discover that it had turned into an amusement park for food you will not be bored and you will not be hungry the portions are enormous whether you will be happy depends partly on your inclinations and partly on what you order i have had six meals at gloucester a couple were good , a couple were disasters and a couple were somewhere in the middle but even when i liked the food , i found eating at gloucester an assault on the senses there are so many homebaked breads to choose from \( the biscuits are rich and delicious \) , so many beers and wines on the excellent , mostly american list , so many people wondering if you are happy and well cared for it can all be exhausting consider the appetizer called spaghetti vegetables it arrives looking like an aztec god of a salad , filaments of carrots , cucumbers and beets crowned with long slices of fried plantain it s a beautiful thing , all vibrant color that wakes you up and makes you laugh and then makes you wish it tasted better or the tasting selections from the pantry , a generous assortment of salads , stuffed vegetables , smoked salmon and the like , crowded onto a plate i was sated long before it was gone while it is a bit much as an appetizer , it makes a fine , varied lunch at a very reasonable 1050 lunch is my favorite meal at gloucester , mostly because the sandwiches are so satisfying the lobster club sandwich arrives on thick golden slices of brioche spread with lime mayonnaise each rich mouthful is enhanced by applewoodsmoked bacon a fried softshell crab comes in a cushion of bun with a heap of coleslaw on the side a burger is served with cheese , bacon , marinated onions , pickles and chips , a lot of food for 950 i 've liked most of the soups at gloucester , too as you might expect , they are beautiful and out of the ordinary while the bits of lettuce , tomato and bacon in the bottom of the bowl of blt soup did nothing but get soggy when the tomato broth was poured over it , most of the soups are more successful the yellow corn chowder is generously dotted with crab meat and chives , and the gazpacho is colorful , spicy , flavorful and even more generously dotted with crab meat there are other places on the menu where the unexpected works surprisingly well the avocado blinis , for instance , are delicious with the excellent crab cakes the fennel salad served with panfried red snapper on a bed of buttery mashed potatoes is very appealing , too and when a pair of those giant prawns are charred and served with grits and collards , they create an appealing new interpretation of a southern classic but too often the menu goes astray italian dishes are particularly chancy the pizzas , despite the special brick oven , are unexceptional the first time i had angel hair with manila clams , shrimp and tomato , it was a perfect rendition of the dish the last time i had it , the pasta was so undercooked it was brittle and the halved cherry tomatoes were little more than skins floating in the bowl linguine was served with oil , burnt garlic and a few pathetic leaves of spinach fish dishes are not always successful either i have had the black sea bass with sweet ginger sauce twice once it was a pleasant if slightly dull dish , the other time it was completely overcooked and a whole fish like a porgy from florida , special , was nicely grilled but served with raw pea shoots that would have been better cooked desserts are another puzzle it is hard to understand why a kitchen that produces such excellent biscuits makes its threeberry shortcake with overly sweet slices of poundcake the individual banana cream pies topped with crisply caramelized strips of banana are sometimes rich and irresistible , other times stale and dull and with all the showmanship in the kitchen , would n't you expect more from a devil s food cake than two sedate little diamonds \?

which family are we talking about in this debate about family values \? is it the gambino family \? of course not could it be the house of atreus \? do n't be absurd i do n't think it is the oblonsky family either too unhappy , the oblonskys , so distinctively unhappy that they made tolstoy say that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way when americans say family values , i think it is a happy family they have in mind the marriage of the words family and values practically forces you to think of happiness remember frankenstein s monster happily puffing a cigar while the blind hermit entertains him on the violin \? the poor abused monster , enjoying a rare moment of bliss , says something like smoke good music good same with me when i hear family values i feel an urge to say , family good values good so i very much doubt that this muchdiscussed family of the enviable values is england s royal family no , not charles and di not funloving fergie and randy andy what of william faulkner s snopes family \? insufferable the addams family \? they 're a barrel of ghoulish fun all right they are also a family that ruins the neighborhood family values or no family values , realestate values must be revered realestate values speak of capitalism , moolah , the bottom line , scratch , the big jack when i hear realestate values , i think capitalism good moolah good bottom line good scratch good big jack good what about the adams family \? presidents john and john quincy , scrappy abigail , ambassador charles francis , scholarly henry some family , no \? no not in the age of noot despicable elitists all they probably want to save public broadcasting i am trying here to explain why i spent 141 minutes watching true lies the other night having read in the paper that senator bob dole recommended true lies as a movie expressing family values , i thought seeing it might help me identify the mysterious family whose values so delight politicians alas , i was misled , for mr dole later declared he had never recommended true lies as family friendly by then , however , i had already spent an evening with it and thought of several families who might find it rich in the values they admired these included ma barker and her boys , the borgias , and mark twain s grangerfords and hungerfords in huckleberry finn , all the grangerfords and all the hungerfords murder each other for a good reason that none of them can remember in true lies , the indestructible arnold schwarzenegger slaughters whole battalions of people for one obvious reason to keep america laughing it is death as hilarity the murdered villains are arabs , apparently the last people except episcopalians whom hollywood feels free to offend en masse i want to be outraged but am amused anyhow thus can evil movie magicians corrupt the noblest american i argue with myself if the classic huckleberry finn can use the murder of two entire families for humor , surely schwarzenegger is entitled to slaughter multitudes for a laugh it is a weak case twain is preaching an acidly funny sermon about human foolishness arnold is killing thousands to help millions kill time even here , though , i feel a touch of hypocritical selfrighteousness the truth is , i am amused by the bugs bunny insouciance with which schwarzenegger can wipe out dozens of heavily armed , highly trained killers , usually without even bothering to aim his vast armory of weapons actually , the movie is nothing more than a cartoon everything is mindless fluff all life is falsified to clear the way for jokes , none of which is half as funny as the often ingeniously amusing ways in which assorted villains are killed the fake violence takes me back to moe , larry and curley , whose physical brutality to each other in ancient three stooges shorts once seemed joyfully funny to me do i harbor a brute within \? the stooges let it drop after 10 or 12 minutes and made way for bette davis the tireless schwarzenegger s hourafterhour killings wear out your smile my own family values seem clear during all this fake violence is good clean fun , but two hours of it is vulgar , immoral and disgusting
the o j simpson case has produced a hot blast of racial disaffection in the country , and no one should be surprised that charlatans of all hues want to use that blast to lift unworthy careers and causes to new heights similarly , it is no surprise that louis farrakhan is foremost among the callous selfpromoters it is also unsurprising that the rev benjamin chavis jr , whose disgraceful behavior almost wrecked the national association for the advancement of colored people , should have signed on as director of mr farrakhan s million man march these two black men have this in common with the white racists of the previous generation they want to prolong and exploit the nation s racial divisions yet their cunning invocations of black family stability and of a potent symbolic event , the 1963 march on washington , have tended to make people of conscience overly timid about criticizing either their contrived event or the twisted farrakhan ideology that it is intended to promote in endorsing the march , the rev jesse jackson and the black congressional caucus have foolishly let a misguided solidarity about the march s public goals divert their attention from the ideas and character of its leader mary frances berry , chairwoman of the united states commission on civil rights , has correctly diagnosed mr farrakhan s pathology as racist , sexist , antisemitic and homophobic the coalition of black feminists led by angela davis and jewell jackson mccabe emphasized one of the many dangers inherent in this march they labeled the march s message that it is time for men to step forward and women to step back as an insult to 400 years of burdensharing by black men and women it is understandable that many black americans will be tempted to overlook mr farrakhan s separatism and mr chavis s financial and personal peccadilloes because of a shared concern about drugs , unstable families , unemployment and violence but they should realize that mr farrakhan intends to use their support to aggrandize himself and the nation of islam there has been a lot of talk about apples and trees lately everyone must recognize that only poisoned apples can fall from mr farrakhan s tree in the last few days , even as his mainstream allies tried to buff up mr farrakhan for national consumption or downplay his involvement , the man and his minions have become ever more flagrant in their racist selfpromotion in an interview released by reuters on friday , mr farrakhan asserted that jews , arabs , koreans and vietnamese doing business in black communities are bloodsuckers on thursday , mr farrakhan s chief of staff told a press conference that those who march will be showing that they personally support mr farrakhan and that they look to him as a national leader but contempt for the leaders of the march must not lead to any kind of national denial about the underlying realities of race in america prejudice remains a historic , thematic problem in american politics and law the behavior of the los angeles police , the ceaseless beltway war against government programs that benefit minorities , the commercial excesses of the o j industry all attest to the continuing need for healing leadership the way ahead will be made rougher by talk shows , tabloids and , if recent events are an indicator , perhaps by mr simpson s delusional campaign for some kind of public approbation none of that changes one truth that serves this moment no matter how many wellmeaning citizens he can mislead on any given day , mr farrakhan remains a symptom of our ills , not a physician who can heal them
indianapolis how quickly gen colin l powell has disappeared from television and the news pages the elite political observers who so confidently predicted he would run for president are now confidently making predictions about other things what s surprising is not that he chose not to run but how close he came to running he had never sought office , had not said he would run and had not asked anyone to drum up support for a candidacy i am certainly familiar with the issues surrounding a candidacy finding the muchtouted fire in the belly , which demands total emotional commitment every waking moment throwing your privacy and your family s out the window , and establishing an effective political operation to raise enough money and attract thousands of committed volunteers general powell had concerns about the first two issues as for the third , seeking the nomination would have been an uphill struggle that s not a reflection on his character or appeal anybody entering a campaign in which 10 candidates are spending tens of millions of dollars will find it grueling besides , he is not a politician after a 35year military career that culminated in the chairmanship of the joint chiefs of staff , he does not view political office as the only way he can continue to serve our country i always thought it highly unlikely general powell would run while he was considering his options , why were there so many news stories that seemed dead certain about the campaigninwaiting and almost none spelling out the compelling reasons why he might not run \? probably because the media desperately wanted colin powell to get in the race they consider a doleclinton race inevitable and boring while they enjoyed ross perot s show in 1992 , they do n't take him seriously now a powell candidacy would be new and exciting , guaranteeing a horse race through much of 1996 thus , creating a powell candidacy was irresistible for months , colin powell deflected the issue while he prepared to market his autobiography , having his name raised as a candidate enhanced his visibility and extraordinary appeal but he did not lead people on he refused to form an exploratory committee or ask anyone to do so as the book tour ended and the media frenzy reached fever pitch , he did not play games he set a deadline and met it now the media feel betrayed , and perhaps annoyed , that this noncandidate declared himself a republican having gotten so far ahead of themselves , some commentators have settled on the facesaving explanation that he lacked courage but what s the point of criticizing a man for backing out of something he never backed into \? the episode is another example of media types interviewing and quoting one another and validating one another s expert opinions , in a virtually factfree environment colin powell s decision was sensible , carefully reached and reasonably predictable now he is free to find other ways to serve he is a man of his word those who say his public career is finished are just as wrong as those who said he would run

in a highly unusual finding , a new york stock exchange arbitration panel has agreed with a prudential securities broker that her firm committed fraud by instructing her to sell limited partnerships to clients during the 1980 s , and ordered prudential to pay her more than 327 , 000 the complaint was brought by betty s allen , a 50yearold broker at prudential s office in orlando , fla , who sold more than 12 million of the limited partnerships during the seven and a half years she worked at the firm these sales were responsible for 60 percent to 80 percent of the commissions that ms allen generated during her career at prudential , her lawyer , n james turner , said in a telephone interview yesterday after an extensive investigation by federal and state regulators , prudential securities , a unit of the prudential insurance company of america , settled securities fraud charges that it had misled tens of thousands of investors nationwide about the risks involved in some 700 limited partnerships in 1993 , it agreed to establish a fund to repay investors' losses resulting from fraud at the firm , and has aside more than 14 billion to cover potential claims ms allen , who technically remains a prudential employee , took disability leave from the firm in march 1993 as a growing number of her clients complained about losses from the limited partnerships ultimately , more than 40 customer complaints were filed by ms allen s clients against prudential news of the arbitration panel s decision , which was handed down july 18 , was reported yesterday in securities week , a newsletter that tracks developments in the industry limited partnerships , which invest in assets like real estate and oil wells , were sold to investors in the 1980 s to investors seeking tax deductions and profits from asset appreciation such investments were usually sold to wealthy clients , but at prudential the partnerships were sold to almost 340 , 000 investors , often with little attention paid to the suitability of such partnerships to the clients' portfolios according to charges by the securities and exchange commission , many of those sales were achieved through lies and deceptions , often in sales materials distributed to brokers by the firm prudential prepared sales materials and literature about the limited partnerships that was misleading , mr turner said , not only to the general public , but to its own sales force still , mr turner acknowledged that the question of accountability did , to a certain degree , fall to prudential s brokers prudential sent out sales literature that said the partnerships were tax sheltered , and prospectuses that said they were not taxsheltered , he said if you want to hold the broker to the standard that she should have read the prospectus , and that there was a difference , then so be it perhaps brokers should read prospectuses , he added , but the reality is that they do n't , and there is clear evidence prudential did not encourage them to do so in a brief telephone interview , ms allen declined to say whether she had read the prospectuses of the limited partnerships she sold to clients in seeking compensation from the arbitration panel , ms allen said the client complaints , which became part of her employment history at prudential securities , effectively made it impossible for her to find work elsewhere in the securities industry she will never work in the industry again , mr turner said , because the complaints have piled up like a telephone book she is saying 'my career in the securities industry is over' ms allen had sought more than 3 million , including punitive damages ms allen is not the first prudential securities broker to seek damages from the firm but plaintiffs lawyers said the arbitration ruling in her case , though not setting a precedent , might still embolden others to seek similar remedy susan atran , a spokeswoman for prudential securities , said that to date , we have had relatively few of these cases , and none have resulted in any settlements this is the finding of one isolated arbitration panel , ms atran said , and it is an unusual decision theodore g eppenstein , a partner at the law firm of eppenstein eppenstein , which specializes in cases involving investors , said ms allen s case does not have to stand as precedent for the broker in the next cubicle at prudential still , mr eppenstein added i think this will encourage a lot of former brokers to try this if the argument flew once before , it could probably fly again
wedged into a tiny control room at new york university , hair flying and arms waving above their heads , a group of graduate students danced wildly in the glow of television monitors and to the cacophonous sounds of canned music , scratchy broadcast conversations , touchtone phone beeps and the screech of feedback you got it ! prof nick west shouted into a microphone experimental television , and we 're putting the 'mental' in it ! on screens behind him and in homes across manhattan , images of tiny robotic figures jerked to the same earsplitting music the dancing of these computergenerated mannequins was manipulated by a few television viewers punching buttons on their touchtone telephones after dialing in to the university s latenight interactive tv program one minute , viewers could see the real dancers the next , the robotic mannequins all keeping time to the same music experimental shows like this are irreverent , funky , hip a digital mix of music , video and bright graphics graduate students in the interactive telecommunications program call the shows the future of television the technical elite who style themselves the digerati might find that , energy aside , the scenes were generations behind the computer images in the disney film toy story but the students , who made the movie a topic on their show , are indifferent to such comparisons they say they want to extend multimedia to the technological havenots of the information age , the people with television sets but no computers , phones but no modems in a world that celebrates the ever more complex , new york university has created a graduate program built around the notion that technology is truly useful only if it enhances creativity for all in the interactive telecommunications program , technology is a liberal art in practice , this means that the 200 students take one course in programming , but none in electrical engineering or physics , in contrast with the requirements of computerscience programs at schools like mit while most students here know such technical arcana as which digitalcompression standard works with what kind of computer file , their curriculum has the same freeform , randomaccess feel as the digital world they work in we 're more interested in content than in hardware , said red burns , a new york university professor and head of the interactive telecommunications program since 1983 to me , the computer is just another tool it s like a pen you have to have a pen , and to know penmanship , but neither will write the book for you thus , in contrast with many technically oriented graduate programs , her students get formal training in multimedia with an emphasis on what they can do for technology , not the other way around i think new technology represents a cataclysmic change in the way we look at the world , in the way we communicate , professor burns said but since we 're in the middle of it , we do n't know what it is the program has no required texts or theories what they know of the field they came from is what they will use in technology , she said they bring ideas , play with ideas , examine ideas and look for the appropriate technology we try to train people to learn how to learn , to go out and work in a technology world that is changing all the time the nyu program predates the current hyperbole about the convergence of computers with entertainment and information it has existed since 1979 , its founders believing that a multimedia revolution was already under way at that time , it was cable and video , professor burns said originally a documentary film maker , in the mid1970 s she helped create twoway television programs to inform the elderly about community social services she and her colleagues put video cameras in retirement homes , hospitals and housing agencies , and linked them through a cable system they used technology in untried ways to answer questions and spread information about facilities for the elderly as professor burns said recently , we did n't go in and say 'here s the technology , let s find a way to use it' we said 'here s a need' with nyu colleagues two decades ago , she cobbled together the space at the university , found money for the program , and took on about 20 graduate students , dubbing the effort the interactive telecommunications program i had a very hard time trying to explain to people what it was , professor burns recalled nobody understood it was n't mass media \? then what was it \? today , about 200 students are enrolled for two years to study multimedia forms , ethics of the digital domain , and , as professor burns puts it , enough about technology to be able to use it many work in familiar areas like interactive video , computer graphics and electronic publishing but some classes range further afield , adopting the attitudes , and prose style , of modern social science theorists in a course titled e merging media , students are taught how to control the dynamics of merging and interactivity so as not to abandon the content
atlanta , oct 22 javier lopez was not the reason the atlanta braves did not win the 1992 world series that s because javier lopez did not play in the 1992 world series , even though he was on the braves' roster if the braves win the 1995 world series , though , javier lopez will be at least partly responsible lopez is playing in this world series , and tonight his bat and his arm propelled the braves to a 43 victory and a twogamestonone lead over the cleveland indians when the series resumes in cleveland on tuesday night , the indians will be facing one of those odds of probability of the 27 times the home team has won the first two games , the home team has gone on and won the series 23 times charles nagy will pitch for the indians , but there has n't been much wrong with their pitchers it s the cleveland hitters who have failed the american league s no 1 team during the season in hitting , hitting home runs and scoring , the indians batted 125 in the first two games and scored five runs , three of them unearned eddie murray hit a tworun home run against tom glavine in the second inning tonight , but by the time the indians scored another run unearned in the seventh , lopez had hit what would be the gamedeciding tworun home run against dennis martinez the inning after the indians narrowed the atlanta advantage to 43 , catcher lopez picked manny ramirez off first base , deflating an indians threat lopez , who will turn 25 years old in two weeks , did not play in the world series opener charlie o'brien catches when greg maddux pitches nor did lopez play in any of the six games against toronto in 1992 i did n't expect to play i was just a rookie , lopez said , recalling his previous world series experience but i was part of the team and it was a good feeling i got the feeling to be in the world series i felt the loss of the team and i felt the win of the team the braves were neither winning nor losing when lopez stepped into the batter s box in the sixth inning the braves had tied the indians with a tworun burst in the third inning after martinez opened the inning by hitting marquis grissom with a pitch , then throwing the ball away attempting to pick grissom off second i tried to do it so quick i made a bad throw , said the 40yearold martinez , who is the third oldest pitcher to start a world series game grissom moved to third on the error , and chipper jones drove him in with a fly to left field david justice singled home the tying run justice led off the sixth with a single to left that albert belle bobbled , enabling justice to reach second he moved to third as ryan klesko grounded out to second , and that s when lopez went to the plate the time before , when i hit the ball to the wall , i thought i had it , lopez related when i saw that albert belle caught that ball , i said , oh , no how hard can i hit the ball to hit it out \? my next at bat he threw me the same spot but a different pitch he threw a changeup the first time , then a fastball away i hit it pretty well martinez had a 12 count and said he tried to go away with the fastball but , he explained , it ran into the middle of the plate lopez already had hit one big home run in the braves' effort to get to the world series and to win it this time after the braves scored a run in the 10th inning of the second game of the national league championship series against cincinnati , lopez sealed the victory with a threerun home run a 315 hitter during the season , he entered this game with a 391 postseason batting average and a 565 slugging percentage no doubt about it , this is a great feeling , the puerto rican player said everybody wants to be a hero i'm glad that i hit the home run in the world series this is my first time in the world series as a regular player and to become the hero in the second game is nothing you can forget but lopez s starstudded night did not end with the home run after ramirez singled with one out in the eighth , with the braves ahead by only a run , lopez picked him off for the second out ramirez refused to talk about the play , but mike hargrove , the indians' manager , said the man just got out there too far it s in the scouting report that lopez likes to throw we 're aware of it , he s aware of it he just did n't get back ramirez was a victim of his own carelessness when ramirez was on first base for the first time , lopez said , fred mcgriff told me he 'd been taking a big lead off first base so the second time he got to first base , i saw him take a big lead and i saw fred mcgriff looking at me and i gave him the sign the next thing , i threw him out alejandro pena was pitching and had a 22 count on jim thome lopez called for a fastball down and in , but pena threw it up and in what i was thinking was call a fastball , strike him out and throw him out at first base , lopez said he did n't swing at that pitch , but at least i threw to first base and got him out pena threw a fourth ball to thome , but mark wohlers came in and retired paul sorrento , a pinchhitter , on a fly to deep center field in the previous inning , it was pena who relieved greg mcmichael with runners at first and third and two out kenny lofton had scored from second base when mike devereaux overran omar vizquel s line drive and turned it into a twobase error belle was the batter pena had to face , and he got him on a foul pop to lopez early this season when i was with boston , pena said , he hit a homer off me this was revenge i started him off with a slider and then got him with three straight fastballs wohlers gave up a twoout single to vizquel in the ninth , and vizquel then stole second with carlos baerga at bat but just as he had in the first game , baerga ended the game by popping up to jones at third i thought about that as it went up , jones said i'm glad it s worked out that way hopefully , we 'll have two more that end the same way photos javier lopez getting a high 10 from david justice after lopezhomered in the sixth inning with justice at third , the hit put the braves ahead , 42 , and sealed their victory \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c1 \) javier lopez slamming the tworun homer that put the braves ahead by 42 this is a great feeling , he said everybody wants to be a hero \( rick stewart allsport \) \( pg c4 \)
jailed for two years , fined more than 1 billion and barred from the securities business for life after pleading guilty to six counts of fraud in 1990 , michael r milken was disgraced , his career as a brilliant financier in ruins now , defying all predictions , mr milken is back in business , counseling corporate chieftains like rupert murdoch , ronald o perelman and ted turner all clients of mr milken during his heyday as they reshape the landscape of the world s media and entertainment industries he stands to make tens of millions of dollars just from turner broadcasting s planned sale to time warner inc the wall street journal puts his pay at 50 million but few milken watchers believe that profit is his governing motivation for one thing , he is believed to be worth 550 million already he thinks he s like michelangelo painting the ceiling of the sistine chapel , doing god s work , and then along comes some government bureaucrat who wants to know if he s got a painting permit , a person who has worked with mr milken said recently whether mr milken s return to the world of multibilliondollar takeover deals puts him on a collision course with the securities and exchange commission is a question that both his fans and detractors are beginning to ask just what mr milken is doing for his clients , and whether it constitutes involvement in the securities industry , is a complex issue in effect , he is allowed to be a consultant , giving broad strategic advice , but cannot play the role of an investment adviser in specific securities transactions as a financial visionary , his advice , even broadly stated , is apparently valuable to corporate leaders of the 90 s like mr turner and mr murdoch and from mr milken s perspective , his record this year is undoubtedly a vindication under the agreement he signed with the government , mr milken , now 49 , is barred from association with any broker , dealer , investment adviser , investment company or municipal securities dealer his lawyer , richard v sandler , said on friday that his client had not even come close to running afoul of that agreement , and that mr milken and his advisers were very conscious about what he can and ca n't do mr milken really ca n't be involved in the securities business , as defined in the securities laws , and he has not been , mr sandler said no one who has sought out his services has wanted to get into those areas as for the payment in the turner deal , mr sandler said , whatever fee is to be paid is yet to be determined the deal is n't closed yet , and he will not get paid unless the deal closes and regarding his relationship with mr turner and mr murdoch , the lawyer said that mr milken consults with his clients he does not attend board meetings or strategy sessions because he does n't have time to do that at the sec , james t coffman , assistant director in the division of enforcement , said the agency was aware of mr milken s recent business activities the commission is always interested in the enforcement of , and compliance with , its orders , he said , declining to comment on any matter specifically related to mr milken but others say the government has not achieved what it sought in its punishment of mr milken if the sec believed it was permanently barring mr milken from anything but personal transactions , it clearly did not achieve that result , said marvin g pickholz , former assistant director of the enforcement division of the sec , who now practices law in new york no doubt mr milken will take the position that he is operating independently as a consultant and not as a member of the securities industry , mr pickholz said the interesting question will be whether the sec decides to test its agreement with milken by contending that his continuous series of transactions renders him in effect as an investment adviser or investment banker operating in the securities industry the deal makers who have been seeking mr milken s services and paying millions for them apparently reckon that his talents and experience still make him one of the best advisers to have as the entertainment industry goes through rapid changes he s an old friend he s one of the smartest guys about the business that i know , mr turner , chairman of turner broadcasting system , said on sept 22 , when his company agreed to be acquired by time warner for 75 billion mr milken served as a consultant to mr turner on the deal mr turner , who uses phrases like smarter than a treeful of owls to describe mr milken s talent , also relied on mr milken to come up with crucial financing in the 1980 s mr milken has also been a consultant to mr murdoch , whose news corporation has been expanding into radio and linking up with mci communications inc in exchange for a stake in the news corporation , mci has agreed to invest up to 2 billion in it mr milken takes credit for introducing mr murdoch to bert c roberts jr , chairman of mci mr milken earned about 10 million for his work for mr murdoch , a lawyer familiar with the news corporation transaction said mr milken has also advised mr perelman as that financier sets up new world communications inc , a broadcasting company
salomon brothers inc suffered a onetwo punch yesterday first , normandy america inc , a fledgling reinsurance company that salomon had taken public on monday , withdrew its 180 million offering , citing market conditions and then , for the second time in nine months , the standard poor s corporation downgraded its ratings on salomon s longterm debt and some classes of preferred stock because of the firm s weak earnings and the departure of a number of key investment bankers s p lowered its ratings on the firm s preferred shares to below investment grade the rating change does not apply to the 700 , 000 preferred shares controlled by the billionaire warren e buffett , a salomon spokeswoman said the agency also cut its ratings on 15 billion in debt to a low investment grade , although salomon said the move would have a relatively small impact on its financing costs the withdrawal of the normandy america offering after one day of trading was a further embarrassment for salomon , the lead manager , especially at a time many initial offerings are being enthusiastically snapped up by investors canceling an initial public offering effectively treats the offering as if it never took place , because no stock certificates have been issued and no money has changed hands the losses that investors in normandy america sustained on tuesday , when the stock price dropped 7 percent , vanished with the company s announcement yesterday morning nonetheless , companies rarely cancel offerings , because doing so casts a shadow over any future public offering they may consider it s very unusual for an offering to be pulled , and it s even more unusual for one to be pulled for quoteunquote market conditions , said robert natale , who follows initial public offerings for standard poor s in the rare event that someone does pull an offering , it s usually pulled for a companyspecific reason for instance , celestial seasonings inc pulled its public offering in 1983 a few days after someone became sick after drinking its herbal teas and in 1992 , the central garden and pet company canceled its offering after only one day of trading because its distribution center burned down both companies later went through with their stock offerings no such actofgod event occurred at normandy america , but the offering seemed ill fated from the start salomon and its comanagers , alex brown sons and schroder wertheim company , marketed the startup reinsurance company and its 30yearold chairman and chief investment strategist , christopher k bagdasarian , as the next coming of the hugely successful investment company , berkshire hathaway inc , and its chairman and chief investment strategist , mr buffett mr bagdasarian has managed millions of dollars of family money since he was 19 since 1989 , he has been chairman of criterion holdings , a private moneymanagement company that realized a 247 percent total return on investments last year , compared with the 13 percent return that would have been realized from stocks that mirrored the standard poor s 500 index for the last 10 years , the return on investments managed by mr bagdasarian averaged 291 percent , according to the stock offering s prospectus but details of how he achieved such success are sketchy the prospectus did not disclose which stocks performed so well and none of his investors stepped forward to praise him publicly in addition , details of his personal life raised eyebrows investors were curious as to why a man whose personal wealth is valued at 400 million by some investment bankers wanted to raise money for a public investment company and they were uncomfortable that mr bagdasarian s wife and former highschool english teacher , victoria briggs , was to be the secondincommand the whole thing was just odd , said one potential investor who attended the company s promotional programs merrill lynch company and bear , stearns company turned down invitations to comanage the offering , adding to uneasiness about it , investment bankers familiar with it said both merrill lynch and bear , stearns declined to comment with all the outstanding questions , salomon s investment bankers were divided on whether to go ahead with the offering in hindsight , those who proposed calling it off were apparently right on friday , salomon reduced the number of shares to be sold to 72 million from 84 million and when the shares began trading on tuesday , the first trades were 50 cents lower than the 25 price salomon had placed on the shares almost immediately after the stock began trading , salomon and its fellow underwriters were forced to buy back at least two million shares the stock closed tuesday down 175 , or 7 percent , at 2325 a share faced with owning a big part of the offering themselves , the underwriters advised normandy america to cancel the offering neither michael sitrick , a spokesman for normandy america , nor salomon had any comment on the withdrawal of the offering
kuwait , nov 19 today s bombing in pakistan serves as the clearest warning yet that islamic militants may be turning their threeyearold war against the egyptian government to the international front the attack on the egyptian embassy in islamabad was the single deadliest strike against an egyptian government target since 1992 , when the militant islamic group began its violent quest to overthrow secular authority in egypt and impose an islamic state with most of the militants' operations in egypt crushed under a fierce government crackdown , some experts in cairo today dismissed the choice of a faroff target as a product of desperation but the attack is the latest in a series that began with the attempted assassination of president hosni mubarak in ethiopia in june it follows a bombing in croatia last month and the assassination of an egyptian diplomat in geneva last monday , and it was described by several western officials as a troubling new sign of the militants' ability to carry out operations beyond egypt s borders they 're on the run at home , and no one knew whether they might pop back up , a western official said now it looks like they have after two years in which egypt was rocked by bombings and assassinations , that country has been largely quiet for months , with clashes between militants and the authorities limited to territory along a 150mile stretch of the nile in the south tourists have returned to egypt in large numbers , and the government s authority appears secure but with egyptian parliamentary elections now less than two weeks away , the new attacks outside the country appear at least an attempt by the militants to show that they remain a powerful and deadly force for the west , which has seen mr mubarak assume a central role as an intermediary in the middle east peace effort , the bombing carries the prospect that the egyptian leader , who denounced the attack as an evil crime , may need to turn more attention to security matters at the same time , the attacks will almost certainly add to tensions between egypt and european countries like britain and germany , which mr mubarak has sharply criticized for their willingness to grant asylum to islamic militants egypt has said those countries' policies have helped the militants establish wideranging networks of operations and support , and mr mubarak warned on a visit to paris last week that such countries would one day pay a very high price in egypt , the attack comes as mr mubarak and his supporters have put dozens of muslim leaders on trial in a special military court until now reserved for terrorist suspects none of the defendants are accused of taking part in violent attacks , and the widening crackdown on islamic activists has widened the deep division between their supporters and the secular government among those who regarded today s attack as a reflection of the militants' weakness was dr mohammed alsaeed , deputy director of the al ahram center for strategic studies in cairo , who called the bombing desperate terrorism pakistan has always been a haven for militants , dr saeed said in a telephone interview from the egyptian capital this kind of operation does not require such strong organization or technical skill other analysts , however , pointed to the fact that the attack took place in pakistan as a reason for renewed concern many egyptian militants are veterans of the americanbacked war by islamic guerrillas in afghanistan , and they are believed to have maintained close links with other veterans who have remained in the region since the attack on mr mubarak in ethiopia , for which the islamic group claimed responsibility , suspected egyptian militants have twice attacked targets in europe last month , the islamic group said it exploded a bomb in the croatian port of rijeka to protest the detention there of the group s spokesman , talaat fouad kassem and last monday , an egyptian diplomat was killed in geneva , where a previously unknown group calling itself the international justice group claimed responsibility and threatened to carry out further attacks meanwhile , the egyptian authorities must also now contend with a new flurry of attacks in southern egypt militants have fired on trains carrying tourists three times this month , and an egyptian guard was killed in an incident on saturday night
portrait of jennifer a biography of jennifer jones by edward z epstein simon schuster , 25 jennifer jones s work as a movie actress \( the song of bernadette , duel in the sun , portrait of jennie \) was never brilliant , and edward z epstein s biography of her life is even less so you would think that a woman who inspired the obsessive love of the producer david o selznick and the actor robert walker would inspire a factfilled , juicy book , but the facts here are tedious and the worst vice mr epstein reveals is that miss jones relied too heavily on her hairdresser s skills the writing is none too lively either mr epstein , whose previous books include biographies of lana turner , rita hayworth and jane wyman , has an irritating overreliance on the word nonplused \( a costume designer was nonplused at jennifer s splendid life style irene selznick had announced to an astonished david that their marriage was over he was nonplused \) miss jones , who is 75 , hates being interviewed and refused to cooperate with mr epstein she was probably nonplused andrea higbie
johnnie l cochran jr repeatedly told jurors at the o j simpson trial today that if it does n't fit , you must acquit the chief defense lawyer was talking not just about an infamous leather glove , but the prosecution s entire case against the former football star salting his closing argument with references to a rush to judgment and obsession to win at all costs , mr cochran derided the prosecution s case as a pastiche of distortions , contortions and fantasies , with anything potentially exculpatory conspicuously ignored its case , he said , could be reduced to two words , for which he offered definitions speculative and cynical mr cochran began quietly , gravely , almost stiffly , with references to cicero , lincoln , frederick douglass and mr orenthal james simpson for much of the day , he fell short of his rhetorical capacity , but he heated up over time , his cadences becoming almost biblical when you see people tell you about mountains of evidence and oceans of evidence , he said at one point , their ocean soon becomes little streams , their mountains become molehills by the end of another long day , mr cochran had reverted to his usual voluble self part politician , part preacher , part emcee he made mark fuhrman , the former detective , a target , calling him a lying , perjuring , genocidal racist and an unspeakable disgrace who had long had it in for mr simpson and any black man married to a white women , but whom prosecutors pampered because he fit their needs more explicitly than ever , he accused mr fuhrman of planting the incriminating glove on mr simpson s property , which the detective testified to finding moist and sticky why would it be moist and sticky unless he brought it over there and planted it there to try to make this case \? mr cochran asked indignantly this man cannot be trusted he is central to the prosecution , and for them to say he s not important is untrue and you will not fall for it picking up on deputy district attorney christopher a darden s plea to the jury not to blame the bearer of the simpsonasmurderer message , mr cochran said several times , if you cannot trust the messenger , you ca n't trust the message untrustworthy messengers , he said , could explain why there was not enough blood on the purported killer , not enough in mr simpson s ford bronco , not enough in the test tube that a police nurse filled , and too much on the sock found in his bedroom , which mr cochran said the police had lifted from a hamper and spiked he urged jurors to send the police a message of their own , a task , he said , that was not for the fainthearted , the timid or the weak darting from theme to theme , mr cochran suggested that the deaths of nicole brown simpson and ronald l goldman were the handiwork of professional killers , who could just as easily have been after mr goldman but the police , he said , out to burnish their image and perhaps express their racism , never looked beyond mr simpson that was why prosecutors had to base their case on a dog s plaintive wail closing the prosecution s presentation earlier on , mr darden urged jurors to rescue baby justice from the burning house lit by the defense , and not be deterred by the billowing smoke you do n't have to go through any house afire , mr cochran countered you just have to keep your eyes on the prize and the prize is justice as part of what he called a journey toward justice , mr cochran displayed photographs of mr simpson smiling at a charity dinner the night before the killings , and a videotape of mr simpson beaming just as broadly after his daughter s dance recital hours before he thanked heaven for such videotapes , noting pointedly , we know in this city how important videotapes can be juxtaposing those images against the prosecutor s portrait of a smoldering man ready to explode , he asked derisively , where s the fuse now , mr darden \? mr cochran conceded that the simpson marriage had stormy moments but accused prosecutors of dwelling on a few isolated episodes in a campaign of character assassination he s a human being he s not perfect , mr cochran said of his client he s not proud of some things he did , but they do n't add up to murder it was a blunt counterpoint to what mr darden had said hours earlier he s a murderer he was also one hell of a great football player but he s still a murderer mr cochran festooned his argument with a bouquet of reasonable doubts in an effort to show that as the defendant said in declining to testify mr simpson could not , would not and did not kill mrs simpson and mr goldman en route to the lectern , mr cochran greeted their families minus mr goldman s father , who left for a while rather than listen he asked , why would anyone who had lived in one home on one property for 17 years not know the location of an air conditioner and bump into it \? if mr simpson was bloody when he came back from the crime scene , where was the blood on the carpet \? the banister \? the door knob \? and why was there no blood surrounding the glove that the police retrieved from behind mr simpson s house \? but mr cochran concentrated on what he considered two impossibilities that mr simpson had the time to kill two people and that he could have worn the murderer s gloves , gloves that did not fit
opposing the system by charles a reich 219 pp new york crown publishers 23 when a much celebrated and widely discussed author like charles a reich drops out of public view for nearly 25 years and then reemerges with a new book , it is always a matter of some curiosity to see how the accumulated experiences of the intervening years have changed his views as part of the generation that arrived at adulthood when the greening of america was published , i , for one , look back on the things that i thought and did then with more embarrassment than nostalgia this is not simply because i'm more mature now , but because of changes in the society as a whole then , the chief problem seemed to be stifling conformity now , a totally asocial individualism has become the norm so far as i can tell from opposing the system , charles reich has been asleep for the past generation he has now arisen , like rip van winkle , to articulate views that many considered dated and cliched only a few years after the greening of america came out the rich menu of social pathologies that grew so much more intense while mr reich was away , from singleparent families to drug use to crime , is due , according to him , to one single factor large corporations it turns out that we are actually governed by a system we cannot see an invisible system this system \( he capitalizes throughout \) now controls the right of livelihood , and in its indifference to individual human beings it treats many people as surplus , resulting in poverty , layoffs , falling wages , temporary employment without benefits , and lack of meaning in work employment is not a matter of voluntary contract because the system maintains a permanent class of surplus unemployed persons to coerce the working population into accepting authoritarian conditions of labor this is not , of course , a view widely shared these days , but that , it turns out , is only because the system also controls the media television s talking heads have all been coopted into justifying the system s behavior democracy , individual rights and the rule of law are merely formal , not substantive , because corporations manipulate them behind the scenes though they 're not labeled as reruns , the final chapters of opposing the system retrace many of the ideas behind the greening of america s consciousness iii many of life s most important values , it is asserted , are noneconomic people would be happier communing with nature than struggling to make a living we should add intangibles like spiritual life and nature to our definition of wealth and deduct environmental damage as costs in a breathtaking reversal of customary analysis , mr reich tries to ride the current wave of antigovernment sentiment by enlisting it in his cause it seems that the american electorate was just a bit confused in thinking that we in the united states are governed by the president and congress actually , we are governed by economic or private government \( that is , large corporations \) the millions of americans who voted republican last year were in fact demanding the same things the 1960 s counterculture did the solution to their malaise , despite what these voters may think about the matter , is bigger public government to restrain the corporate invisible government the analysis in opposing the system portrays the system as if it were a big agency that made bad decisions at our expense the system has made a governmental choice to devalue labor behind this phrase there is indeed a real problem the decrease , over time , in economic rewards going to lowskill labor the sources of this decline are complex , and include technological advance , the globalization of the economy , immigration and a declining public education system to some extent , of course , we all drive these changes because we benefit from them in terms of lower consumer prices , higher quality , wider choice or , through our pension funds , higher returns on our investments those with education and skills have seen a huge increase in the opportunities open to them in recent years a solution to the problem of declining lowskill wages is far from obvious the european model a more extensive welfare state to buffer the poor simply means that the problem shows up in the form of higher un employment rather than falling incomes , and at the price of decreased competitiveness mr reich s proposed cure for the social evils he describes takes none of these complexities into account the book is peppered with phrases like we would provide an unlimited supply of challenging and fulfilling work for those who are underemployed , or child care and help for the elderly should be well paid this kind of thinking reminds me of juan peron give to the people , especially the workers , all that is possible , the argentine dictator once said when it seems to you that already you are giving them too much , give them more there is nothing more elastic than the economy , which everyone fears so much because no one understands it one of mr reich s favored approaches to dealing with an unpleasant economic reality is to write a new provision in the constitution \( or else find such a provision already implicit \) that simply legislates the desired reality into being , much like contemporary brazilian constitutional law , which establishes the rights to education , health , work , leisure , security , social welfare , protection of motherhood and childhood and assistance to the destitute not just to the pursuit of happiness but to happiness itself the economic consequences of mr reich s various proposals would land the united states in a position somewhere between those of argentina and brazil

tampa , fla , aug 6 watching the jets this season could be an exquisite form of torture , or it could be like playing a snazzy pinball game say this for the jets , who won their opening exhibition game in the rich kotite regime they showed they can make life interesting , maybe even frustrating , for the opposition the opponent saturday night was the tampa bay buccaneers , the perennial loser of 10 games a season the score was nick lowery 9 \( three for three on field goals \) , buccaneers 3 the jets left the game still looking for a workaholic running back and a receiver who can be in the right place at the right time still , the team rushed the passer , had some interceptions and generated some tricky special teams plays and the conservative offense worked to a point the jets were unable to work their wide receivers into the offense we 'll have 'go' patterns , boomer esiason said , but it 'll be a very patient , conservative offense and if this is the way it s going to be , it s fine with me he could n't help mentioning and laughing about a monstrous pass he threw 10 yards beyond stevie anderson , i wanted to show everyone i could throw 60 yards , esiason said more important in this offense , which has tight ends and running backs going out for passes , esiason connected on 8 of 12 passes in his one quarter the passes averaged under 6 yards an attempt , and those modest gains continued with bubby brister \( 4 of 9 for 29 yards \) in the second quarter and glenn foley \( 9 of 13 for 55 yards \) in the second half johnny mitchell grabbed four of his six receptions in the opening quarter , stretching for one and looking like a commanding presence i wanted to get off to a great start , mitchell said i wanted to do as much as i could individually but without putting the pressure on me to do it all myself that i had last year although the jets' quarterbacks tossed 34 passes and completed 21 , only one wide receiver , orlando parker , caught any of course , it is possible that at this stage , kotite would rather stay away from his inexperienced corps of receivers and take the short , snappy stuff that esiason executes so well but there were sparks the rookie passrusher hugh douglas was turned loose late in the game and produced three quarterback pressures one led to an interception he also made a fine play by running more than 30 yards downfield to tackle a receiver the special teams , under the firstyear coach ken rose , unveiled a bunch huddle on kickoffs that made it difficult for the receiving bucs to identify the players and then when the huddle broke , the long kicker , don silvestri , produced four boots that went to the goal line , one for a touchback there was an attitude that led to 10 penalties , although none for extreme viciousness douglas , who played for the small school central state of ohio , continued to have his troubles lining up the answers have not come quickly , especially when the tight end is n't where he expects him to be with all that , he is still , in kotite s admiring postgame description , relentless in his pressure his presence changes the dynamics of the defense the bucs' trent dilfer and casey weldon completed only 19 of 40 passes and were intercepted four times in the closing seconds , after weldon completed a 49yarder to horace copeland at the jets' 4 , the bucs were unable to score on four passes on the other hand , the jets' runners averaged only 2 yards a carry ron moore generated only 24 yards on 8 carries while richie anderson had 9 on 5 attempts kotite would like someone to take over rather than runnerbycommittee photo jets cornerback aaron glenn taking off after recovering a fumble in the first quarter in an exhibition game against the tampa bay buccaneers \( agence francepresse \)
american tabloid by james ellroy 576 pp new york alfred a knopf 25 james ellroy s brilliantly unpleasant new novel chronicles the seething interactions of a bunch of sleazos , spies , thugs and mobsters in this case i think i will not be giving anything away to begin with the end , which is the assassination of john f kennedy every such entry in the conspiratorial genre has its own cunning convolutedness to follow after reading don delillo s remarkable novel libra , which american tabloid in some ways resembles , or after seeing oliver stone s film jfk , one remembers less the how and the why of the deed than the sheer wheelswithinwheels complexity of it all american tabloid ends a few moments before the assassination , and lee harvey oswald never makes a direct appearance all of which makes for a certain elegance analogous to that of the sonnet whose form excludes all but essential and perfect words and while at first sight this novel seems more sprawling than the reverse , it is in fact a supremely controlled work of art , built on sentences of almost untouchable terseness hoover bought the lie an la agent told boyd that marilyn monroe was now under intense surveillance bug taps and six fulltime men said agents were baffled jack the haircut kennedy and mm have not been in contact pete laughed himself silly dracula howard hughes confirmed the rumor marilyn and jack were one hot item ! ! ! ! boyd said he skinsearched all jack s girls for hidden microphones boyd said kennedy and nixon were running neckandneck pete did n't say , i 've got dirt i can sell it to jimmy hoffa i can give it to you to smear nixon with jimmy s a colleague boyd s a partner who s more procause pro invasion of cuba jack or nixon \? tricky dick was hotly antibeard castro jack was vocal but still short of rabid john stanton called nixon 'mr invasion' kemper said jack would greenlight all invasion plans boyd s key campaign issue was compartmentalization scarcely a word could be deleted from this without wounding the meaning every sentence advances the plot my parenthetical identifications and explanations could be considered an extended compliment to the exacting schematic language that mr ellroy has evolved but even more of an achievement than this is what the novelist does with his characters none of them \( with the possible exception of robert f kennedy \) are at all likable john f kennedy is a vacuous womanizer ungrateful to those who idolize him pretty much everyone else is weak , cruel or twisted so one would expect not to care , to be merely entertained at most , never to be moved and , in fact , i cannot honestly say that i cared about soandso when soandso gets tortured or murdered and yet these people , while unable to command our empathy on their own account , serve as dye markers to illustrate the vector trails of all the various evil forces that spring from that most capitalistic force of all , selfinterest in the superlogical trajectory of mr ellroy s plot , almost every permutation of betrayal arises the betrayals are never gratuitous or sadistic \( although the violence with which they are often executed is sadistic indeed \) the necessity of each becomes apparent only at the last minute , when a proactive or reactive strike has been dictated by selfprotection in response to some previously unforeseen move in the process of betraying others , the characters betray themselves one agent who becomes a hit man wakes up every morning automatically processing lies to tell his alltoovarious interestconflicted employers another begins the tale by zealously supporting bobby kennedy s crusade against the mob , and ends by being a lawyer for the mob j edgar hoover , howard hughes and other powermasters of the period are ruthlessly drawn , but no more so than lowlifes like oswald s murderer , the nightclub owner jack ruby , who comes across here as less desperate than in libra , but more vile and crawling , reeking of his squalid dogs what mr ellroy makes us realize is that loyalty to others is one of the few essential guarantors of selfidentity if we do n't stand for those who trust us , then we stand for nothing and will be ground down into nothing of course , safety is not predicated on loyalty , but at least if we are faithful to something or someone then we will die for a reason this novel will not teach anybody anything new about the kennedy assassination like pulp fiction , the movie to which in style and content american tabloid is somewhat related , the goal does not seem to be so much accuracy or even verisimilitude as the depiction of a community of interlinked stories and lives violence becomes exaggerated almost to the point of caricature , but never crosses the line into mere gratuitousness laced with gruesome humor , american tabloid remains far less funny than sad the different coalitions of people in it struggle , slay , steal ambitiously , recombine , and in the course of striving to get everything they become nothing meanwhile , the larger twists and turns of allegiance they act out give us a feeling of history schemers rise , overreach themselves and are cut down by schemers extortionists and appeasers have their day love becomes a means of entrapment the plot thickens and thickens no matter that most of the events of the tale are imaginary the causative agents in human affairs are so very often connivings , greeds and treacheries that mr ellroy cannot but convince
vladivostok , russia , aug 21 these last few years have not been easy on russia first , the wall came down then they ditched communism altogether thinking about the future gives people headaches and thinking about the past can make them cry people want a little continuity in their lives a little stability and if they 'll just check into a hotel , they can still get it because that s where they will find the floor ladies , the often gruff and unflappably stolid women who guard the keys and the morals of nearly every hotel floor in the country the floor lady , or dezhurnaya , is part big nurse , part house mother , part cop and all russian drunks constantly try to slink past them like wayward teenagers coming home too late from a date it almost never works i do n't even know why they bother to hide it , said valentina ivanovna yeltskaya , the trim 46yearold commander of the third floor of the hotel vladivostok but they always do they try to pretend i'm blind big mistake like thousands of other floor ladies in russia she works 24hour shifts and knows everything that happens in her grim domain long seen as a particularly unpleasant sentry of soviet authority , the floor lady is always stationed near the elevators at the entrance to every corridor she and it is always a she controls all room keys , adjudicates all disputes and dispenses justice as she sees fit when they are nice they can take the edge off the bleakest hotel experience , but there is nothing scarier than a dezhurnaya with a bad attitude there are some costconscious hotels that have discarded the floorlady system nor will they be found at those fancy western hotels with minibars and cnn it s got to be a russian hotel a big , ugly , concrete fortress with hundreds of rooms and one roll of toilet paper here at the hotel vladivostok , the russian far east s biggest hostelry with 500 charmless rooms on 11 floors sitting on a promontory above the city harbor , the tradition lives on i am here to make sure this floor runs the way a floor should run , mrs yeltskaya said if you need soap you ask me if you need a towel i can get it any questions , i have the answer if i do n't i 'll find it like most floor ladies , mrs yeltskaya is on one full day and off the next she has worked the 44room third floor , and no other , for the past six years because management feels that insures continuity she spends most of her roundtheclock tour at a wooden desk with a control panel beside her the panel no longer works it was from a more glorious time when guests could order tea and cookies to be delivered last year the tax inspectors came , she said with one of those whatkindofworldcanwebelivingin looks they said if we are selling candy or cookies we need to have cash registers and we need to pay taxes it was easier just to stop these days , mrs yeltskaya said , her duties have been diminished she boils water \( for a small fee \) , cleans clothes \( slightly larger fee \) and helps book phone calls \( no fee at all \) floor ladies are always in charge of their guests' phone needs if somebody has to call anywhere outside the city he must book a call and wait about half an hour to be connected afterward , the city operator calls the floor lady directly and tells her how much to charge people who forget to settle the bill get unexpected wakeup calls beginning around 6 am , because each floor lady is responsible for paying the bill to the hotel management even if the guests stiff her it happens , mrs yeltskaya admitted glumly about hotel guests' propensity for skipping town without paying the phone bill but we watch pretty carefully that s for sure not much escapes the notice of a woman like mrs yeltskaya bare feet get nasty frowns open liquor bottles in the corridor get worse mrs yeltskaya can fix refrigerators and telephones and knows as much about wiring as many electricians she makes a special poison for cockroaches from some chinese herb and she does n't let her customers get wet unless she does n't like them you 'll need an umbrella today , she said early one morning this week as a guest walked by and then she produced one dezhurnaya duty used to be simpler they were mostly watchdogs , reporting any weird activity to the kgb \( which is why they are in charge of phone calls \) and did some cleaning but these are complicated times and the floor ladies are called on to do more and more for the 100 or so they usually earn each month we need to know all the restaurants in the city now , said mrs yeltskaya , admitting that she had been to only a couple of them in her life we are supposed to know about movies and museums and tours none of that fazes mrs yeltskaya she only worries about one thing young girls that s what management wants these days , she said ruefully they want cute young girls who speak foreign languages now why on earth is a cute young girl who can speak a foreign language going to want a job like this \?

a public corporation in the early development stage is sort of like a teenager it s awkward , has lots of blemishes and tries to mooch money from just about anyone but the family puts up with it in expectation of a big payoff one day it will be able to support itself with a good income some teenagers , though , keep hanging around the house , using up cash and jabbering about their dreams just as parents seem to maintain their faith that someday these children will be a success , some shareholders keep hanging on to companies stuck in adolescence for an example , look at the solvex corporation , a corporate teenager that ca n't seem to get its act together solvex has been around for 15 years , aggressively trying to peddle its technology to extract oil out of oil sands in recent years , the company has also begun bragging about its ability to extract trace metals , like aluminum and gold , from the tailings , the stuff left over after oil is extracted from the sands apparently attracted by the promise of transforming dirt into gold , investors have been diving in recently since late september , the price of solvex stock has jumped more than 20 percent , closing friday at 1025 , up 813 cents in trading on the nasdaq smallcapitalization market before anyone concludes success is just around the corner , though , solvex s history deserves a closer look for solvex , around every corner there has been another corner worse still , even though investors are scooping up shares , corporate lenders and institutional investors that are needed to finance this dream have been , for the most part , extremely leery and with good reason in its 15 years of hope and promises , solvex has never made a dime of profit and has seen next to no revenue instead , it has tested and researched , seeking out more money for financing and issuing a string of announcements that indicated it would soon be up and operating solvex , based in albuquerque , nm , found its place on the map thanks to the synthetic fuels corporation , the government behemoth constructed in the carter administration in hope of encouraging the development of technologies that would cut the country s dependence on imported oil under the guidance of its founder , john s rendall , solvex was tentatively promised 426 million in aid from the government to help it build a fuels plant in new mexico to refine oil out of tar sands shortly after receiving the letter of intent from the government in january 1981 , solvex went public at 425 a share it all sounded like a great american success story until a congressional subcommittee started investigating at a congressional hearing , witnesses testified that one month before its stock sale , solvex had been informed by a consultant that the oil potential of the new mexican tar sands was onehalf to onethird of the amount anticipated mr rendall testified that he did n't think the study was conclusive , or would significantly affect profits but a few months after the stock sale , when more information about troubles at the site emerged , the new mexico project was abandoned fast forward a few years in 1988 , solvex acquired a lease to 5 , 874 acres of land in alberta , canada the land , according to the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission , contains substantial quantities of bitumen that can be mined , and , through a new technology , metals as well a few things stood in the way of this dream the necessary permits to develop the land and about 125 million in financing that was a lofty amount given the company s small capitalization , which even now stands at less than 200 million making matters worse , under the terms of its lease , solvex has only until the end of 1997 to start producing 10 , 000 barrels of bitumen a day from the canadian land if it fails , it loses the lease and this is not a company that has shown itself able to stay on schedule in the fall of 1994 , the company said that it expected construction of a plant on the canadian land to begin in the spring of 1995 , with operations scheduled to start late in the year neither has happened indeed , the company has made several announcements about developments that moved its stock price , but that had little real impact it has announced deals with other companies that will market oils and minerals and that will let it have access to huge pools of tailings but without an operational plant , it sounds much like the teenager who proclaims that he has a new automobile sound system and lots of cool cd s and that all he needs now is a car then there is the matter of the vanishing financing solvex has n't been able to raise anywhere near the 125 million that it needs for the canadian project it has raised a few million here and there through the private placement of stock , but not enough to get this project going in 1993 , the company announced that it had arranged a financing package of 191 million with deacon barclays de zoette wedd , a toronto company but that money never materialized on the company s books in an sec filing earlier this year , the company said it needed 7 million in interim financing to maintain its construction schedule any delays could make construction impracticable or more expensive , the company said so it was with great hope that the company announced in august of this year that it had reached a memorandum of understanding with glencore ltd , a swiss company , that would provide 10 million last week , the memorandum of understanding lapsed without being finalized , and the needed capital vanished in an interview , mr rendall said a dispute developed over which metals solvex intended to market as soon as its plant was operating if the solvex technology works as well as the company contends , why are n't institutions throwing cash at it \? maybe they do n't believe the company or maybe they 're a bit concerned about investing money with solvex even as its auditor expresses substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern , an issue raised for at least the last several years in an interview , mr rendall dismissed all these issues , saying , as he has in the past , that all of the company s problems are about to be solved he said that he expects the company will be granted its permits in canada and will raise more than 150 million , all within the next 30 days and what if this prediction , like the others , does n't pan out \? i ca n't predict the future , he said even if solvex builds its plant in time , it faces enormous competition the company will be competing against entities having much greater financial , technical , personnel and marketing resources , the company said in a recent filing so what are investors to do \? well , if solvex were a 20yearold , lounging on the couch and proclaiming its intent to take the world by storm , its parents would probably make their expectations known they 'd ask the couchpotato to explain , in detail , how all the obvious problems would be overcome then they 'd demand proof of the proclaimed talents in solvex s case , publicly available evidence from independent analysts that these technologies work as well as the company contends finally , they would insist on a time frame in which some results had to be seen and if none of that comes to pass \? they might show the slacker some tough love sell the stock graph a stock hangs on shows solvex corp daily closing price fromaug to nov \( source datastream \)
the photographs currently on view in the benton museum at the university of connecticut in storrs come from a single source the sandra and david bakalar collection all 49 prints are black and white

collectors than the anthology it is , mounted by thomas bruhn mr bruhn , who is the museum s curator of art collections , proposes in his catalogue essay that figural photographs tell stories and in a way that is essentially theatrical the show proves its point , of course , but it also suggests that the principal story is about mr and mrs bakalar and it is told by the show as a whole photography has enjoyed many heydays including that accompanying its invention all the same , it seems that the heyday of the early 1960 s was the most significant , for it confirmed the medium s status as art without detracting from its democratic appeal also , it coincided with the advent of pop , the movement that toppled high art off its pedestal , then replaced it photography galleries proliferated ,

what kind of investors end up owning shares of an obscure canadian company that is promoting a huge pipeline project in wartorn sudan with pledges that it will be financed by a littleknown saudi arabian prince \? some of the biggest mutual funds in the country , that s who and , by proxy , millions of individuals who on their own might never go near such a venture the mysteries surrounding the company , the arakis energy corporation , deepened yesterday as regulators at the securities and exchange commission , the national association of securities dealers and the vancouver stock exchange reviewed the financial situation of the company and its announcements about a proposed oil and gas pipeline project in the sudan arakis shares never opened for trading yesterday their trading was halted tuesday afternoon by regulators at nasdaq and the vancouver stock exchange , who asked arakis for clarification about a proposed 750 million investment , intended to pay for the project , from the arab group international arakis has scheduled a news conference for today but it remains unclear when trading will resume and , when it does , how much anyone will be willing to pay for the shares shares of arakis last traded at 11875 on nasdaq , up from 4 at the beginning of the year but down from more than 26 last month at its peak , the company s market value was more than 560 million few individual investors would have more than a passing interest in arakis , had most americans not made mutual funds their primary vehicles for equity investments several popular mutual funds are current or recent owners of arakis shares , among them the kaufmann fund , the pioneer capital growth fund , the t rowe price international discovery fund , and one or more funds managed by fidelity investments none of those funds has suffered significant losses , because the stakes generally have represented small portions of their portfolios for the kaufmann fund , its 400 , 000 arakis shares represent less than 1 percent of its 22 billion in assets but the trading halt presents a potential problem to those funds , which must price their portfolios every day in those cases , a fund usually uses the price of the last trade whether that price has any relevance for arakis is also not yet known the arakis situation could give pause to mutual fund investors who have recently moved the bulk of their savings from bank accounts into mutual funds it is up to investors to make sure that the goals and investment style of any fund chosen match their own that is not always easy the pioneer growth fund , for example , describes itself as an aggressive value fund value investors typically look for companies whose share prices are cheap relative to the value of the profitproducing assets on their books arakis , which has lost money for years and had less than 1 million of working capital at the end of 1994 , would not seem to meet some of the criteria of potential value investments warren j isabelle , manager of the pioneer fund , said yesterday that the fund had recently sold its 107 million arakis shares at a profit he said the fund had bought the shares because it saw them as undervalued at the time ken gregory , editor of the noload fund analyst , a newsletter based in san francisco , said that although mutual fund investors should not try to scrutinize every holding in a fund portfolio , some diligence was necessary i'm not sure it makes sense to be looking over the fund manager s shoulder at every holding , mr gregory said but no one should be totally ignorant of what his fund owns while every fund manager will have some stocks that perform badly , investors should be concerned if there are too many unknowns about a company , he said that might validly impact the confidence one has in how a manager is doing his job , mr gregory added now , fund managers and investors alike are left to wonder what will happen at arakis shareholders were scheduled to vote today on whether to allow the company to go through with a proposed sale of stock to prince sultan ibn saud ibn abdullah al saud and the arab international group arakis said last month that the group would pay 345 million to buy 23 million arakis shares at 15 apiece , giving the group 42 percent of the company s stock the remainder of the 750 million investment would be a letter of credit but arakis shares plunged below 15 on monday after an article in barron s , the financial weekly , questioned the proposed investment on tuesday , regulators asked for a clarification after the company said that only 40 million of the stock purchase would be for cash the remainder was to be paid in pipeline and oilfield service equipment yesterday afternoon , the vancouver exchange reported that the company planned to voluntarily delist its shares after the exchange raised questions about the noncash portion of the investment james d spellman , a spokesman for nasdaq , said officials there were awaiting a company announcement and would make sure that arakis met listing requirements before allowing trading to continue a person familiar with the situation , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the securities and exchange commission had also begun a preliminary inquiry into the situation mutual funds are not the only big institutions with large holdings of arakis shares other owners include several wellknown hedge funds private investment groups open to a limited number of investors among them , according to recent regulatory filings , are zweigdimenna partners , a new york group

washington , march 10 michael p c carns , the retired air force general whom president clinton selected to be director of central intelligence , said today that he was withdrawing from consideration after the federal bureau of the investigation uncovered a tangled set of personal circumstances that appear to have included violations of labor and immigration law mr clinton , who has been without a chief intelligence officer for more than 10 weeks , immediately chose john m deutch , the deputy defense secretary , to replace general carns as his new nominee for the intelligence post , a senior white house official said mr deutch had earlier declined the intelligence job , which has turned into one of the least desirable highlevel assignments in washington because of the agency s recent problems general carns s withdrawal is the latest in a string of failed or bungled nominations that have plagued the clinton administration since its earliest days , including the choice of dr henry w foster jr as surgeon general , which has met with substantial opposition in the senate in an interview this evening , general carns said he had warned white house aides of a potential problem in his background but had not recognized anywhere near the full dimensions until the fbi began investigating the circumstances under which he had arranged to bring a young family friend into the united states from the philippines general carns said he had made a gross error in his dealings with the filipino man , elbino runas he said he had not fully understood until being told by the federal investigators last week that the arrangements he had with mr runas were improper general carns brought mr runas , who is now in his early 30 s , to the united states in the late 1980 s as a member of his household after mr runas asked for help in avoiding a life of poverty in the philippines but general carns said the main reason for his decision to withdraw was what he called unwarranted accusations of a personal nature against his family made by mr runas in interviews with the federal investigators i see no reason to put my family through it and i see no reason to put myself through it because it would embarrass me and the administration , said general carns , who retired last fall as vice chief of the air force he said he had made the decision today after several days of discussions with senior officials at the white house , where aides to mr clinton made clear that they had also come to see the nomination as untenable i am really concerned that in the way we conduct today s confirmation proceedings , one is innocent until nominated , general carns said in a telephone interview this evening moreover , you are then in a struggle to prove innocence i think this is a really serious and growing deterrent to people being willing to serve general carns said he had given mr runas more than 6 , 000 during and immediately after the five years that the young man lived with the carns family in the united states , including 4 , 000 in a final settlement in 1992 that the general said fulfilled a commitment to provide the young man with a nest egg for his return to the philippines but tonight , he expressed bitterness at what he said were mr runas s accusations that he had been exploited , including some made by the young man to the fbi that the general said were so sordid that it is absolutely outrageous general carns said mr runas was treated as a member of the family but the bureau determined that mr runas had been brought to the united states under an immigration program that permits americans living abroad to bring foreign nationals home only if they work as domestic employees general carns never paid mr runas the wage required by the policy and on occasion permitted him to work outside the home in violation of labor and immigration laws , the general acknowledged in the 30minute interview this evening , general carns accepted responsibility for what he portrayed as unwitting mistakes , and he described his problems as the result of a good deed gone awry i'm responsible for doing it right , and i did n't do it right , general carns said of the arrangements he made for mr runas i was wrong i am fully accountable i did not do this thing properly mr clinton picked general carns for the cia post early last month only after mr deutch turned the job down the collapse of his nomination will prolong a vacancy at the central intelligence agency that opened in december , when r james woolsey resigned unexpectedly from the job a senior white house official said that mr clinton telephoned general carns at his mother s home in northern california this afternoon to express regret at his decision but after several days in which the white house has reviewed the report of bureau investigators and after inquiries about its contents this morning by the new york times , the officials made clear that they had shared general carns s view that there was no option but for him but to step down
as black religious leaders criticized the way the police handled a melee at a south jamaica , queens , church sunday night , a senior police official said yesterday that officers had not conferred with supervisors before going into the church to arrest a parishioner it was that attempt to make the arrest for the beating of a retired policeman that ignited the melee the police official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that two senior detectives from the 103d precinct neglected to notify their supervisor that they were returning to the universal calvary church to make the arrest while the official did not suggest that the detectives broke any formal rules , it is common practice for officers to consult with supervisors before entering potentially sensitive or hazardous situations in the ensuing melee on sunday , 34 people were hurt , including six officers police officials say churchgoers pelted officers with bottles and other debris , and each side accused the other of using pepper spray after the first signs of trouble , the officers called for backup , using the radio call for an officer who needs help 1013 and specifying that there was a large , disorderly crowd at the church that distress call immediately drew about 100 police officers , some in riot gear , to the church , further inflaming tensions black officials of several churches criticized the police response at a press conference yesterday , calling the officers hooligans and saying their handling of the incident underscored the poor relationship between the police and black worshipers the church leaders referred to two similar incidents , involving a nation of islam mosque in harlem last year and a brooklyn church in july , in which police officers and worshipers also clashed the rev al sharpton , who called a meeting of church leaders at the brown memorial baptist church in brownsville , brooklyn , where the press conference was held , said there seemed to be a trend of complete disrespect , if not contempt by the police department for black worshipers tom kelly , the deputy commissioner , said yesterday that police investigators were still looking into the department s handling of the disturbance , but that members of the church had declined to cooperate with the investigation mr kelly said that the minister , the rev emmanuel oseiacheampong , had declined to give investigators a copy of a videotape of the melee , which was made by church members mr oseiacheampong , who spoke at the press conference , said he was considering releasing the videotape to reporters later this week , but he would not discuss its contents the police and the churchgoers have given starkly different versions of the initial scuffle between some churchgoers and the retired officer , clifford warsop , 44 , of jamaica , and the melee later they agree that the melee began three hours after mr warsop tried to enter a revival service on the last of 38 consecutive nights of revival meetings at 7 50 pm sunday , apparently to meet his children , who were attending the revival with their mother , angela pennicooke the police said that mr warsop grew upset when church security officers blocked him from entering and he was not allowed inside to see his children , ages 5 and 12 mr warsop told the police that several churchgoers tackled him and forced him to the ground in the scuffle , three churchgoers wrestled a licensed revolver from him the pastor said at first that church security officers did not recognize mr warsop and believed he was trying to rob them the pastor said later that they believed mr warsop intended to harm ms pennicooke , from whom he was estranged some details of the events relayed by the minister and churchgoers on monday seemed to contradict earlier accounts given by him and by other churchgoers for example , the churchgoers initially echoed the police account that they discovered mr warsop s gun under his shirt during a tussle hours later , mr oseiacheampong said mr warsop had brandished the gun and about 12 hours after the incident , one woman said she had heard officers shouting racial epithets and had seen one officer put a gun to a 6monthold baby s head police officials said they did not believe any such incident occurred mr warsop was never charged the police have charged three churchgoers , michael bennett , 32 , horace gordon , 35 , and nedley walters , 35 , with assaulting mr warsop , who had bruises and cuts and received 23 stitches near his left eye mr gordon and woodrow campbell were charged with resisting arrest , assaulting two police officers and starting a disturbance cornelius caliz was charged with assaulting a police officer a 15yearold was referred to family court , and a seventh person , keno k reefer , was charged with assault none of those arrested had criminal records the church leaders , including mr oseiacheampong , said they believed the men had been unjustly charged instead , they said mr warsop should have been charged for violating an order of protection ms pennicooke had obtained against him the police said the order had never been served photo the rev

washington , june 21 in a sharp departure from earlier decisions protecting the right of lawyers and other professionals to advertise , the supreme court ruled today that states could require lawyers to wait 30 days after an accident before writing to solicit the victim s business the court was bitterly divided in a 5to4 decision that reflected the continuing debate , both among the justices and within the legal profession , over the wisdom of the court s 1977 ruling that advertising by lawyers is a form of commercial speech entitled to protection under the first amendment in the case today , the florida bar , defending the state s 30day moratorium on solicitation , which had been declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court , asked the justices to overturn the 1977 precedent the court declined to go that far but the majority opinion , by justice sandra day o'connor , cast doubt on several subsequent decisions that had found constitutional protection even for rather aggressive advertising tactics by lawyers as long as the letters or advertisements were truthful and nondeceptive the case today was brought by a tampa lawyer , g stewart mchenry , who owned a referral service called went for it inc and made a living by finding clients for personalinjury lawyers by soliciting accident victims after the florida supreme court , at the urging of the florida bar , imposed the 30day moratorium in 1990 , mr mchenry brought a lawsuit in federal district court in tampa to have the restriction declared unconstitutional under the first amendment after being disbarred for other reasons , mr mchenry dropped out of the case , but the lawsuit continued in the name of his company and another lawyer , john t blakely the suit was successful in both the district court and the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , in atlanta , which ruled last year with obvious reluctance that it was bound by supreme court precedent to find the moratorium unconstitutional in her opinion overturning the appeals court ruling today , justice o'connor , who is the court s most outspoken critic of the court s professionaladvertising doctrine , said florida s restriction was justified despite the precedents she said it served the valid purpose of protecting injured floridians from invasive conduct by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that such repeated invasions have engendered justice anthony m kennedy filed a dissenting opinion that was , for him , unusually biting in tone he said the majority had endorsed censorship pure and simple without persuasive evidence that the restriction even served the interests of the public it was intended to protect and censorship is antithetical to the first principles of free expression , justice kennedy said the case , florida bar v went for it , no 94226 , had been the oldest undecided case on the court s docket and it was evident today that a big struggle over the outcome had consumed the court in the more than five months since the justices heard the case there was strong evidence that the court had initially decided to strike down the moratorium and that justice o'connor won the support of a member of the original majority of the 11 decisions issued by the court from its january argument session , this was justice o'connor s third majority opinion , leaving justice kennedy with none that is highly unusual because , while opinion assignments cannot be shared evenly by the nine justices with mathematical precision , each justice can expect one or two assignments a month the justice most likely to have switched sides was justice stephen g breyer , whose vote with the majority was perhaps the most anomalous of his tenure on the court so far two other members of justice o'connor s majority , chief justice william h rehnquist and justice antonin scalia , have long been critics of the lawyeradvertising precedents , and the fifth member , justice clarence thomas , usually shares the views of those two justices john paul stevens , david h souter and ruth bader ginsburg joined justice kennedy s dissenting opinion , which included a subtle dig at justice breyer in an otherwise irrelevant reference to the federal sentencing guidelines justice breyer played a leading role in drafting those guidelines both as a senate staff counsel and later as a member of the united states sentencing commission justice kennedy cited the sentencing guidelines in response to a point in the majority opinion that the regulation properly applied to all accident victims , even victims of minor accidents who might not need the protection , because it was too hard to write a regulation tailored to distinctions among degrees of injury after all , the criminal law routinely distinguishes degrees of bodily harm , justice kennedy said the majority today accepted the defense of the moratorium offered by the florida bar , which argued essentially that not only the public , but also the legal profession itself , needed protection against intrusive and overreaching behavior by lawyers
atlanta , march 7 a federal judge in mississippi ruled today that a state plan to eliminate the vestiges of a racially segregated system of higher education did not go far enough , and he went on to block proposals to close a historically black and a historically white university instead the judge challenged the state s practice of using different admission standards for the historically black and white campuses in the eightcampus state university system and ordered the policy changed the judge also ordered the state to spend about 30 million beginning in july 1996 as part of a program to improve its three historically black universities the ruling , handed down in federal district court in oxford by judge neal b biggers jr , was the latest development in a 20yearold legal battle that has been to higher education what brown v board of education has been to elementary and secondary education it is likely to have wide ramifications in the 18 other states that have maintained racially separate higher education systems , because federal officials have said they would use the case s outcome as a yardstick by which to measure those states for that reason and others , the ruling is likely to be appealed in his ruling , judge biggers found that mississippi s differing admissions standards for white and black colleges and universities , its setting of missions for the institutions and the duplication of programs all contributed to the continued racial identification of campuses each factor alone is not significant , he wrote in the 100page decision , but taken together they raise the serious inference that the state continues to promote segregation while the court s ruling praised the state for the progress it has made on integrating higher education in a host of areas , including graduate admissions and improving racial climates on campus , it stopped short of approving one of state s main plans for continuing that progress that plan included closing the overwhelmingly black , 2 , 300student mississippi valley state university campus in itta bena and consolidating it with predominantly white delta state university 50 miles to the north the court finds that the board s proposal for merger of dsu and mvsu is predicated to a large degree on optimistic speculation that a new university , fully integrated and without any racial identity , will likely result , the ruling said the court further finds that the board s proposal is unsupported at this time by sufficient research to determine whether it is practical to merge these institutions in blocking that aspect of the state plan , the court handed a partial victory to black plaintiffs in the case , which has already been up to the united states supreme court the plaintiffs had been concerned that black institutions would bear the brunt of desegregation efforts by being shut down , rather than being improved so that they would be more attractive to all students the 19 states that maintained segregated colleges , in some instances well into the 60 s , have been struggling to desegregate and reorganize their systems along lines that are politically and legally acceptable in a time when previously allwhite universities are open to blacks , the continued existence of historically black institutions has been a sore point in many states so far none of the 38 historically black colleges in those states have been closed as part of desegregation efforts there was concern among many blacks that a decision in the mississippi case backing any such closings would have a domino effect today s ruling also rejected a state plan to merge the mostly white mississippi university for women with mostly white mississippi state university the mississippi case , which was originally called ayers v mississippi after jake ayers , a black state resident who was among its original plaintiffs , began in 1975 as an effort to get more financial support for historically black institutions with the support of the united states department of justice , the plaintiffs took the case to the supreme court , where the justices ruled in 1992 that simply erasing the barriers to blacks attending previously white institutions was not enough and that the state had to eradicate other vestiges of the dual systems the high court sent the case back to judge biggers , an appointee of president ronald reagan , for a thorough examination of the state s system , with an admonition that he consider whether the continued operation of historically black institutions helped or hampered desegregation partly in response to that suggestion , the board of trustees of the institutions of higher learning designed a plan to restructure the 60 , 000student state system that relied heavily on closing or consolidating historically black colleges and universities today s ruling praised mississippi for improving access to higher education for blacks , noting that black enrollment in public higher education per thousand blacks in the population was higher in mississippi than the national mean but the present admission standards are not only traceable to the de jure system and were originally adopted for a discriminatory purpose but also have present discriminatory effects , said the ruling , in directing the state to change its admissions policies projections detailed in the ruling indicated that the new standards to go into effect in the coming academic year would increase the pool of black students eligible for admission to historically white universities from 324 percent now to 525 percent there are now about 12 , 000 black students attending the three historically black colleges and 5 , 000 attending historically white institutions one of the big winners in the ruling is jackson state university , a historically black institution that is slated to have its undergraduate and graduate programs improved in a way that judge biggers said promised to increase its prestige and amounted to sound education and desegregation policy
denver , april 20 the new york yankees came back to denver today for the second time in less than a month , facing fatigue , the flu , the flurries , an unbelievably taxing schedule and the throng that helped reintroduce coors field to baseball buck showalter , the yankees manager , could n't be happier , though , because this time showalter came with the varsity , major leaguers favored by many to win the american league east that made a world of difference to the manager whose first entry into the new ball park came at the end of march and featured replacement yankees playing replacement rockies after going through the replacement thing , i 'll go anywhere , a lighthearted showalter said shortly after shuttling through snow flurries and under threatening skies from denver s new airport to denver s new ball park i'm proud to represent the organization anytime , but i'm doubly proud to be here with these guys he had even more reason for jocularity about four hours later , after the yankees won an errormarred game , 73 scott kamieniecki and four relievers limited the rockies to five hits kamieniecki allowed two runs en route to his first victory of the spring showalter did n't take all his frontline players to denver jimmy key , the lefthander scheduled to pitch tomorrow afternoon in the twogame series finale , was left behind in florida , not because of injury but because of weather that had already dipped to 44 degrees by game time i'm not able to control the weather conditions on opening day , but i am able to control the weather he pitches in until then , showalter said and it was too bad a forecast so he s going to pitch in an extended spring training game tomorrow in tampa key joined fellow yankee pitchers jack mcdowell , melido perez and john wetteland none of whom were scheduled to throw today or tomorrow on the list of players excused from the quick hop to the rocky mountains the bullpen , starting with the lefthander , andy pettitte , was scheduled to go in key s place tomorrow one yankee who made the trip was don mattingly , despite a bout with the flu i 've had the chills off and on for a few days , mattingly said i had them again today , but i do n't know if it s the flu or the cold outside , he said with a smile mattingly s temperature , which had ranged from 100 to 102 the previous two days , was normal today , he reported that enabled mattingly to serve as the designated hitter , batting ninth i'm used to it down there remember , that s where i hit when i first came up , ' mattingly said showalter knows that players of mattingly s caliber are why 37 , 577 tickets were sold for the game \( although the fans showed up in lesser numbers \) the same could be said of some rockies players it s a thrill , said garvin alston , a rockies rookie pitcher who is a product of mount vernon \( ny \) high school and a cousin of del alston , a former yankee who is currently a coach with the team i 've seen don mattingly at ball parks before , but not on the same field it s exciting as the designated hitter , mattingly doubled in four atbats and scored one run by the eighth inning he was gone because the rockies brought in a lefthanded pitcher no less important , showalter has vowed to shepherd his flock of division favorites through a travelfilled last week before a regular season truncated because of the strike after two days here , the yankees must return to florida to play the mets in port st lucie saturday and the braves in fort lauderdale sunday they play the braves again monday , in atlanta then it s on to new york , where the yankees will work out tuesday , then open the season the following day against the texas rangers the wednesday afternoon game represents the yankees' first home stand after an offday , they then move on for a threegame series in kansas city such travel , showalter admitted , has made the team rethink its approach to travel and work schedules we ca n't afford to have setbacks physically , he said we just do n't have that comfort zone because of the shortened season the weather could have hurt more than it did it hurt in batting practice bad enough and it got worse , the yankees' first baseman , jim leyritz , said it was rather cold out there still , by the end of the night , the team was a little colder , had a few bumblebee like stings to the hands because of the frigid weather but that was all , for which showalter was grateful at this point , you want to get your work done , but it s almost as important to keep your people healthy , the manager said inside pitch the national league rockies let their pitchers hit instead of using a designated hitter brian boehringer pitched two scoreless innings and struck out four jeff patterson pitched two scoreless innings bernie williams , the only starter to play the whole game , collected a double , triple and drove in two runs the 34 rockies committed four errors the yankees' joe ausanio allowed a ninthinning home run to the rockies' dante bichette , the first home run hit in coors field
imagine fixing a broken plate while eating from it while it is balanced on your head something like that is under way , on a far grander scale , along queens boulevard in sunnyside the transit authority is rebuilding a crumbling , 78yearold concrete viaduct , tearing away and replacing 40 , 000 tons of concrete and rock , while 400ton no 7 trains rumble over it in a day and night procession there may be no better demonstration of the challenges the transit authority faces in trying to run an antique system , constantly replacing its timeworn parts without shutting down service but to some , the 90 million reconstruction of the viaduct a series of arches 4 , 300 feet long that stretches from 32d to 48th streets along queens boulevard is also a sterling example of poor planning the work could have been done in the 1980 s , when the authority spent more than four years replacing the viaduct s tracks that effort turned three stations into construction sites , constricted traffic on queens boulevard and eliminated express service on the no 7 line but the authority did not know because no one checked that the new rails were being installed on a structure that was falling apart now that work has to be undone , and another fouryear project , scheduled to end in april 1997 , is under way express service is limited , streets have been closed , and residents say noise and dust are nonstop annoyances yet even some of the transit authority s critics concede that the work is an impressive response to a difficult problem this project sort of shows the best and the worst of the transit authority s capital program , said assemblywoman catherine t nolan of ridgewood , a democrat whose district includes the viaduct transit officials have had to figure out how to dig out a bed of loose rocks under the tracks without disrupting service for more than three years , a spider web of scaffolding , braces and , at times , cranes has encased parts of the 41foottall structure , so that old masonry could be safely jackhammered away workers spent thousands of hours building temporary structures designed to keep service continuing while more permanent fixtures were built no doubt , this is one of the toughest projects we 've ever had , said william m rodwick , the project manager for the transit authority it would have been a lot easier and quicker to knock it down and start over again joseph conley , a property manager who is chairman of community board 2 in sunnyside , also lauded the work , but he said that residents and merchants along queens boulevard had been telling the transit authority for years that the structure was in trouble they could have done it all at once , but instead , people have been living with this for 10 years , he said if they 'd listened to the community , they would have saved a lot of time and money to some extent , transit officials agree with the criticism in the early 1980 s , after years of neglect , the subways had two overriding problems weak tracks and track beds that caused chronic derailments , and old trains that frequently broke down or caught fire in 1982 , when the city , state and federal governments agreed to finance a multibilliondollar rebuilding program , everyone agreed that tracks and trains should come first all the basics were just staring them in the face , so that s what they addressed , said jerome forman , vice president of the transit authority in charge of capital planning , who joined the agency in 1986 during the two capital programs that covered 1982 to 1991 , he said , there were some places where we did things that we had to undo later , when the program got more sophisticated to prevent a repeat of such redundant work , assemblywoman nolan had a provision inserted in the third capital program , which began in 1992 , requiring the transit authority to do a detailed survey of the physical condition of the entire system along queens boulevard , the viaduct project has closed a traffic lane in each direction , at times shutting down cross streets that pass under the viaduct and filling the neighborhood with an often startling racket it s constant noise and constant dust , and it seems like it s been going on forever , said helen lahy , who lives half a block from the viaduct and works in a doctor s office on queens boulevard at 41st street many boulevard merchants complain of parking problems and other inconveniences , though most say they do not believe their business has been hurt by the project but some riders on the no 7 line , one of the city s busiest with 332 , 000 passengers each weekday , say they feel a bit persecuted besides construction problems , in the late 1980 s and early 90 s , passengers suffered through frequent train breakdowns on their line , which for a time had the worst ontime performance in the system the problems with the trains have since been corrected it never ends , said joseph m jackson of jackson heights , who rides the train to his job as a building superintendent in manhattan for 10 years , it s been slow trains , broke trains , no express , a little express and on and on
washington , july 30 six days after the suicide of vincent w foster jr , bernard w nussbaum urgently led hillary rodham clinton into his white house counsel s office he showed her a note , which had been found in shreds on the bottom of mr foster s briefcase and lay on his conference table , pieced together by mr nussbaum and an aide like a jigsaw puzzle in it , mr foster , one of mrs clinton s oldest and dearest friends , spoke of his anguish about washington she glanced at mr foster s observation that he was not up to his job and that in washington , ruining people is considered sport , and she looked shaken , mr nussbuam recalled in an interview she had a strong emotional reaction , said mr nussbaum , who later resigned under pressure she got up and said , 'bernie , i ca n't deal with this , ' and with that , she walked out of the office two years and one week later , mr nussbaum is still musing over that moment , which epitomized the tensions in the white house in those days , as he prepares to return to washington to face questions from democrats and republicans about his handling of the files in mr foster s office he will be asked by the senate whitewater panel about his belated discovery on july 26 of the foster note , which he overlooked during a review of the office in the presence of federal investigators four days earlier he is certain to be questioned about a secret service officer s testimony that some of mr foster s files were removed on the evening of his death , before investigators had arrived and he will come under strong criticism from the republicans for blocking justice department lawyers from looking at any of the files in mr foster s office his defense , mr nussbaum said in a wideranging interview on friday , is that he did nothing improper , that it is a malicious lie to say mr foster was depressed about whitewater , that mrs clinton never ordered him to do anything improper and that his only sin was having a poor sense of public relations furthermore , he hastens to add , there were others at the white house who had far worse political judgment than he in fact , he said , two southern lawyers on the white house staff , jack quinn and bill burton , actually advised that he not permit investigators to enter the deputy counsel s office , an idea that he rejected because he said he wanted to accommodate the investigators while preserving the confidences of his client neither mr quinn nor mr burton returned telephone calls this idea that i was n't politically savvy i 'll ask you to compare my solution with others in the white house to keep the investigators out of mr foster s office entirely , mr nussbaum said i think i have a fair amount of political sense what would have been the political story if i had followed their advice white house refuses to let investigators into foster s office mr nussbaum s downfall symbolized the unraveling of the clintons' inner circle one by one , the old friends the clintons had brought to washington went home in disgrace , in a few cases to face legal inquiries his republican detractors and some investigators say mr nussbaum impeded a federal inquiry into mr foster s suicide they say that he initially promised justice department lawyers that they could look at the files in mr foster s office in search of a suicide note or extortion note , and then abruptly reneged after talking to susan thomases , one of mrs clinton s closest advisers ultimately , mr nussbaum made the justice department investigators sit in the office like cigarstore indians , as one later wrote as he went through the files deputy attorney general philip b heymann complained to mr nussbaum that he was making a terrible mistake that threatened to ruin the investigation his usual supporters in congress and the clinton administration are critical they describe him as a tough new york litigator out of place in politics , a lawyer who can make an innocent person look guilty , one with a tin ear for the appearancedriven ways of washington it appears that bernie nussbaum is emerging as the heavy in all this , senator paul simon , democrat of illinois , said recently mr nussbaum insists that no one in the white house in july 1993 had any notion that whitewater would emerge later that year as a big story , fueled by regulatory requests for a criminal investigation and justice department subpoenas for the president s whitewater papers this story will not be written for a long time , he said if anybody really wants to write the real story , some day it will be recorded what really happened for nearly four hours at his manhattan law firm , mr nussbaum offered his story , a preview of the testimony that he has been preparing with the assistance of a battery of washington and new york lawyers he is planning to tell the senate whitewater committee that the investigation into the events of the summer of 1993 is , to paraphrase voltaire , a search in a dark room for a black cat which is n't there
three men were arrested yesterday in the kidnapping , torture and slaying early this month of a chinese immigrant in brooklyn after new york city police detectives tracked the suspects across the country to a cheap motel room near san jose , calif , the police said following a trail that led them from borough park , where the immigrant , a chinese woman , was slain , to monterey park , calif , to milpitas , a town just north of san jose , the detectives found the men early yesterday morning watching television in a super 8 motel , and the local police arrested them as of late yesterday , none of the men had been charged in the case , but they were being questioned in milpitas by four new york detectives the crosscountry search followed a slaying that has drawn attention not only for its brutality but also because it occurred one day after new york state s death penalty law took effect and could lead to the first charges under the new law the law provides that capital charges can be brought if the victim was intentionally killed during the commission of another crime in this instance , kidnapping or if torture was a component of the murder in the brooklyn killing , one of the woman s fingers was cut off before she died capt joe silva of the milpitas police department identified the suspects as chen jia wu , 29 peng you zhong , 23 , and chen fu xin , also 23 the suspects are believed to be members of the fujianese flying dragons , a renegade splinter of the flying dragons , a major gang in new york s chinatown investigators said chen jia wu led a group that kidnapped the woman , gao liqin , a queens garment factory worker , on aug 22 , then tortured and killed her in a borough park apartment after failing to get 28 , 800 in ransom from ms gao s family in china officials said utility records from the apartment led them to mr chen investigators said they believe the kidnapping was one of a string of abductions performed by the fujianese flying dragons , who have specialized in kidnapping , raping and torturing female victims , often demanding ransoms from the victims' families in china the group concentrates on women , one investigator said , because fujianese immigrant women have traditionally been reluctant to report being kidnapped or sexually assaulted they do n't come forward , said the investigator , who spoke on the condition of anonymity they just pay up and get on with their lives around midnight on the evening of aug 22 , investigators said , at least four men lay in wait for ms gao as she was walking from the da dong sewing factory in corona , queens , to her apartment nearby police officials said ms gao was dragged into a van and taken to the basement apartment at 1616 east second street in borough park , where she was kept with other victims , some of whom were gangraped within days , officials said , her family in china was called by the kidnappers , who demanded a 38 , 800 ransom and said that ms gao would be dismembered if the money was not delivered to cohorts in china ms gao s family was able to provide 5 , 000 , which at first was acceptable to her captors but they later changed their minds and changed the demand to 28 , 800 they called ms gao s family , put her on the phone and began beating her , investigators said , hoping her screams would prompt the family to give in to their demands enraged when they did not receive the full amount , the captors then severed ms gao s left pinkie with a meat cleaver several days later , when they learned that the police were pursuing them in a separate kidnapping case , ms gao s captors tried to suffocate her with a plastic bag over her head , investigators said , and then smashed her skull with a television set when she still clung to life , her captors strangled her with a telephone cord and fled another woman being held in the same apartment set a fire in an attempt to draw attention , and ms gao s body was found by firefighters the woman , who has not been identified , is under police protection investigators said yesterday that the captors left behind a note next to ms gao s body taunting the police it read those who do n't pay off their kidnapping debts are bound to die the police ca n't get to us if you want to know who we are , just look for your clue among a deck of playing cards along with the note they left a drawing of the king of clubs , the highest card in the chinese playing deck the name of clubs in chinese , mei \( pronounced like may \) , is also part of the name of a village in fujian where the captors are believed to have been born the note was signed , the devils that are flouting you ! in court documents , agents from the federal bureau of investigation said they believed that the kidnapping of ms gao and the other woman was related to the kidnapping of another chinese immigrant who was held for seven days , shot in the head , then dumped near the grand central parkway on sept 1 that victim , a man who has not been identified , survived and is under police protection while held captive , the authorities said , the man was forced to call relatives in china and ask them to pay a 40 , 000 ransom the fbi said the same telephone debit card that was used to pay for those phone calls was used to pay for ransom calls made for the two women ms gao s husband , d m zhang , expressed relief yesterday at the arrest of the men , especially chen jia wu , who is known on the streets of chinatown as wu zai , or the fifth child he deserves nothing less than death for the sorrow he has caused the family , mr zhang said

ruling that new york state had violated the constitutional rights of deaf prison inmates , a federal judge in manhattan ordered the state yesterday to provide deaf prisoners with signlanguage interpreters , typewriterlike devices for communicating by telephone , closedcaption televisions and other services the ruling by judge robert w sweet came in a classaction lawsuit filed four years ago by six deaf prisoners the inmates contended that their inability to communicate had effectively isolated them from the world and had made it impossible for them to understand disciplinary , grievance and parole hearings , much less go to educational classes in an 87page opinion , judge sweet said lack of good interpreters in state penitentiaries had sentenced deaf inmates to a prison within a prison chris mckenna , a spokesman for the state attorney general s office , said the state had not decided whether to appeal a spokesman for the state department of correctional services , james flateau , declined to comment on the decision , saying that state officials have not yet read it there are at least 50 deaf inmates in the state prison system , lawyers said the judge ruled that not only had the prisons violated the americans with disabilities act , but they had also denied prisoners their right to fair hearings and ignored the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment judge sweet pointed out that some of the deaf inmates had been punished unfairly because they did not understand a guard s orders one inmate , terryton harrison , was held in solitary confinement for 15 days at attica in january 1994 after he failed to obey an order from a guard to pick up a cup in the mess hall , the judge said mr harrison had asked for an interpreter at his disciplinary hearing but none was provided janet e sabel , a legal aid lawyer , brought the suit on behalf of the prisoners in march 1991 after she discovered that one of her former clients , doris clarkson , a deaf woman who speaks little english , had been jailed in bedford hills correctional facility for almost three years without any way of communicating with officials she was absolutely living in a communications vacuum , ms sabel said in the ruling , the judge ordered the state to come up with a plan for meeting the requirements of the disabilities act and inform deaf inmates about it he also said the prisons must hire qualified signlanguage interpreters to work in the prison s offices and to translate in educational classes , at hearings and during medical visits
ossining , ny rasheed javeri had been living in the united states for six years , doing well in the jewelry business and enjoying life in the relatively fast lane skiing the mountains of utah , going to lots of parties when an acquaintance offered him a chance to pick up an extra few thousand dollars all he had to do was get a few ounces of heroin for a man halfway across the country but the transaction went sour and mr javeri landed in jail that was 11 years ago had he been an armed robber or a rapist or broken into someone s home with pistol in hand , mr javeri , who is 42 years old , would have been free long ago but in new york , under laws initiated by gov nelson a rockefeller , mr javeri , who had never before been in trouble with the police , received the same sentence for his drugdealing conviction that a bomber , a kidnapper or a murderer would have drawn although many people would argue that drug dealing is tantamount to murder , some contend that the laws that produced mr javeri s 15yearstolife sentence are the flawed relics of the nation s war on drugs in many cases punishing smalltime players rather than the kingpins that really matter , and at huge expense to the state and recently the laws' critics have found an ally of sorts in gov george e pataki , who has said he would try to soften the laws as a way of making more room in state prisons for violent criminals while the governor s motives have more to do with reducing the state deficit than easing the lives of imprisoned drug dealers , many criminal justice experts say the move is overdue these laws are not working , said robert gangi , the executive director of the correctional association of new york , a prison monitoring group we 're wasting resources and ruining the lives of many people who , at most , are marginal players in the drug trade we should be concentrationg our efforts on predatory felons the laws were meant to bury the drug kingpins and destroy the trade but experts and law enforcement officials say the drug business has hardly missed a beat and that most of the bosses are still doing well or are comfortably retired instead , the laws have swept from the streets thousands of foot soldiers like mr javeri , whose roles in the drug trade were quickly filled i was not a drug dealer my friend persuaded me to get the drugs for a socalled friend of his , mr javeri said in a conversation here at the sing sing prison every day is like pain and anxiety for myself and my family i'm alive , but it s like i'm dead it was just a matter of greed , a foolish thing to do the impact has also been severe on the state s prisons there are now more than 66 , 000 inmates in the system five times as many as when the laws were introduced more than 20 years ago and during that time the system s operating expenses have risen to about 16 billion a year , from about 100 million roughly a third of the prisoners are serving sentences under drug laws introduced or inspired by gov rockefeller to be sure , the tough drug laws have put away some serious drug criminals julio medina , who started selling drugs in the south bronx at 15 , is an example mr medina , who is also in sing sing , sold cocaine to fellow students while studying for his bachelor s degree in sociology at the state university of new york at albany , he says , and then ran an upstate drug gang but there have been plenty of people like anthony papa , who ran a small automobile radio repair shop in the bronx and says he agreed to deliver a little more than four ounces of cocaine to earn 500 he needed to get his car fixed the clients turned out to be two undercover police officers , and now mr papa is in sing sing serving 15 years to life alex okehoffurum , a nigerian businessman , says he had never had anything to do with drugs but , he says , on a flight from nigeria to new york , a flight attendant mixed up his carryon luggage and he walked off the plane with someone else s briefcase in the lining of the case , someone had hidden a pound of heroin he got 15 years to life whether there is more to their stories than mr javeri , mr papa and mr okehoffurum are saying , only they know but none of them had been arrested before they had jobs and families and homes and by all appearances were regarded as good citizens in prison they have been model inmates for that matter , so has mr medina he is now studying theology and says he regrets ever selling drugs they have taken college courses and , in some cases , gotten degrees they have worked as counselors and teachers meanwhile , the state is spending about 25 , 600 a year on room and board for each of them criminal justice experts say that a fundamental problem with the tough drug laws , which have been copied by the federal government and many states , is that they impose long , fixed sentences based on the amount of drugs involved , without regard to a person s role in a drug transaction or other aspects of his life that might argue against a long prison term for example , without exception , conviction on a first offense for the sale of two ounces or more of cocaine or heroin or the possession of four ounces of the drugs results in a prison sentence of 15 years to life

the logic is irresistible china s economy is steaming ahead like a locomotive in a nation famous for entrepreneurs , thousands of companies are clamoring to sell stock , and the lucky ones already approved to do so are making products like washing machines and refrigerators , wanted in every chinese household such businesses seem sure to grow for years to come besides , the stock market in shanghai , barely five years old , created innumerable millionaires during a boom in 1992 and 1993 it drifted downward throughout 1994 and is now near an alltime low how could it not go up \? with the curiosity of a new resident in a city reeking of opportunity and with a lurking desire to make a killing , one novice investor set out to learn how to buy some stocks there are only 34 listed stocks available to the foreign buyer , so how hard could it be to pick a few that will grow long term , riding china s economic trajectory \? the first stop was at china cathay securities , known as guotai in chinese , where , as at many of the 250 other young securities firms operating in shanghai , masses of investors jam the ground floor each day to watch share prices on a big board and jostle each other to make a trade privileged visitors are ushered upstairs to the private rooms , passing by trading desks at which brokers finish one phone call after another with the salutation , hope you get rich ! call me frank , said frank li , an earnest , shorthaired broker who speaks in a mixture of clipped , textbook english and slangy mandarin chinese with two years experience in the market , frank is considered a seasoned pro the market will definitely go up , frank said then , for good measure , he added , the question is when and by how much sign me up the sensible reaction of any eager investor in such an atmosphere of unbridled moneymaking here s where the complications begin how much will you invest \? frank asked a number was suggested 1 , 000 he frowned our normal minimum is 10 , 000 ten thousand ! that s worth a moment s reflection frank sensed the hesitation since you 're a friend , 5 , 000 would be ok in the printed regulations for opening an account at cathay , however , there is no mention of any minimum investment we would n't dare print that in the regulations , said wang hongwei , frank s colleague , so what is the rule about minimum investment \? there is none , he said not the most reassuring answer but hey , no risk , no reward let s get down to the business of picking some stocks i think you should quickly accumulate stocks that are undervalued , said frank , slipping into market jargon then you 're sure to make a profit narcissus electric is frank s first choice as a maker of washing machines , narcissus is making a product that nearly everyone wants solid management , frank said , and at 25 cents a share , a good price what did narcissus trade at the previous day \? frank shuffled through his papers and frowned again it did n't actually trade that day , he said not that it was suspended or anything , there just is n't that much demand for narcissus about onethird to onehalf of the dollardenominated stocks in shanghai do not trade on any given day , what you might call low liquidity let s look at another stock , frank said brightly lujiazui \( loojahsway \) a developer in the east shanghai area that is being built as the city s new financial district over the next five years , selling landuse rights in a real estate market that is riding high a sure thing , said frank an alarm bell might go off in the mind of even an inexperienced investor when he hears the words sure thing and one obvious question about this stock is , what happens when the land is all sold \? frank insists that it will take several years , and that his only concern is that the stock is expensive at 73 cents a share , it is near its 52week high of 74 cents for a second opinion , a visit to a second securities firm patrick chen brings potential investors into the modern office he shares with four others at shanghai international securities shanghai international was the most dynamic of shanghai s securities firms until it was hit by scandal in february it suffered huge losses in the bond futures market and was accused of trying to manipulate sales to avoid going out of business in a single day on the computer at mr chen s desk , the beginning of a company text was visible a brief introduction to the incident \( 1 \) shanghai international securities did not lose nearly as much money as has been reported in the foreign and other media \( 2 \) business is proceeding as normal
washington , oct 26 the house of representatives today approved the foundation of the republican revolution a mammoth bill that would balance the federal budget in seven years , cut the taxes of most families and significantly diminish the place of the federal government in the lives of americans president clinton has vowed to veto the legislation , so it will be weeks before it is known how many of its elements will become law but its approval today underscored the willingness of the members of the new republican majority to cast difficult votes in areas that have proved politically risky in the past spending on medicare , the popular health program for the elderly and disabled , would be strictly limited , and the program would be changed so fundamentally that no one can predict with confidence what the consequences would be the 60yearold commitment of washington to provide subsistence for the poorest in the society would be ended , with that responsibility shifted to the states the money for aid to families with dependent children , the main federal welfare program , and medicaid , the health care program for the poor , would be much less than it would be without changes in the law in both cases , the states alone would be allowed to decide who would receive benefits and how much they would get most federal standards for nursing homes would be abandoned page d20 in seven years , declared representative john r kasich of ohio , the republican chairman of the budget committee , we will balance the budget and save the country and save the next generation the sweeping legislation , called a budget reconciliation bill , was passed on a partyline vote of 227 to 203 four democrats crossed party lines to vote for the measure ten republicans voted against it earlier , a democratic alternative that would have continued federal commitments to the poor , allowed more money for medicare and abandoned the notion of a tax cut was solidly rejected , 356 to 72 the senate , meanwhile , began voting on amendments to a companion measure , rejecting by nearly straight partyline votes democratic attempts to restore money for medicare , medicaid , the earnedincome tax credit , student loans and other social programs and to reduce the size of the tax cut the senate bill , expected to be adopted friday , differs on the margins from the one the house approved today , but the themes are the same after blocking votes all day on wednesday , republican senators permitted them today in return for a promise from democrats to limit the number of amendments they offered many niggling details will have to be worked out by a housesenate conference committee , on matters like how medicaid money would be apportioned among the states and exactly who would be entitled to tax breaks but whatever comes out of the conference , no one doubts that a veto will follow leon e panetta , the white house chief of staff , criticized the budget bill , saying , it will severely harm medicare , medicaid , education and the environment , and raise taxes for working families while providing huge new tax breaks for the wealthy he added that the president will continue to insist that congress pass a balanced budget that protects seniors and working families since republicans do not have the votes in congress to override a veto , the final budget can be written only after negotiations between the president and republican congressional leaders rarely are the philosophical lines between the two parties drawn as starkly as they were in the debate in the house today for example , representative bill archer of texas , the republican chairman of the ways and means committee , declared , we believe the strength of america lies not with the government but with each of us as individuals over the last 30 years , mr archer asserted , the government spent over 5 trillion on the war on poverty , only to lose the war but representative sam m gibbons of florida , the democrat who previously led the committee , took an entirely different stance the republicans , he declared , intend to take 450 billion out of children , out of sick people , out of nursing home people this , he said , is a travesty on the american people representative martin olav sabo , democrat of minnesota , accused republicans of harboring a vision that rewards the wealthiest and most powerful interests in our society at the expense of the most vulnerable americans the democratic whip , representative david e bonior of michigan , said , this budget does n't reward the best in us it appeals to the worst in us it does n't reward our best instincts it tramples our most basic values but republican leaders were adamant that their direction was the right one for the country we do n't have a right to tell the next generation that we ca n't stop ourselves from spending that extra trillion , said mr kasich , the legislator more responsible than any other for putting together the package that was approved today we 're going to look over all the swamp , and all the muck and all the nasty rhetoric , said mr kasich , his hand over his brow like the lookout in the crow s nest of a sailing ship we 're going to look beyond that we 're going to look to the next generation we 're going to get this done for our precious nation
all sorts of things mutate at the fringe of jazz at the beacon theater on saturday night , david benoit , a pianist , and art porter , a saxophonist , performed what might be called instrumental pop music they were both playing music related to jazz , yet their conclusions were radically different one thing the two share is an ability to make some money playing music without words although mr porter was mostly playing funk with overlaid improvisations and mr benoit was playing sentimental , pianobased music , they 're both frequently on the radio , and usually on the same stations and both sell recordings fusion music , much maligned by critics , is still popular , although the fact that the beacon show was not sold out suggested that the music s commercial grip might just be slipping not that the audience did n't give the performers standing ovations mr benoit , backed by electric bass and drums , began with a piano improvisation that recalled the pianists bill evans and dave brubeck from mr brubeck came clatter mr benoit s playing sometimes sounded like dishes being dumped on the floor mr evans showed up in the form of pastel chords then mr benoit quickly moved away from the demands of the idiom and delved into music that mixed pop , a bit of jazz and classical music it was a festival of consonance mr benoit s melodies , often sequential , make easy listening , and the textures themselves were spongy and damp the music had none of the touches of sensuality it has on recordings , clearly a product of the recording studio a living room couch is the ideal place to hear the disembodied sound of this eerie but congenial music at the beacon , it was in thehands of the musicians , whose playing was not all that precise the music s antiseptic attraction vanished mr porter opened for mr benoit he s a house rocker when he s not mining the sentimental side of kenny g he shouted some blues phrases and shrieked others once in a while he unwound a line that flirted with modern harmony it all seemed cynical , as if it were taking advantage of the audience the musicians knew so much more than the people holding tickets , and were n't letting them in on anything photo david benoit in concert at the beacon theater on saturday night \( rahav segev \)
washington , sept 8 the political equivalent of applepolishing was so intense at the opening of the christian coalition s annual convention here today that senator bob dole did not even try to hide his motives i read in this morning s papers about how all these candidates were coming down here to court all of you , mr dole , the leading republican presidential contender , told a boisterous audience of more than 4 , 000 well , maybe we are what s wrong with that \? clearly , that was the sentiment among the parade of prominent politicians who came courting , not only with words of affection but by seeking to top one another over who could most passionately endorse the coalition s agenda no one heeded ralph reed , the group s executive director , who insisted that the coalition members had come not to endorse any candidate , not to anoint any frontrunner instead , the presidential candidates and the prospective candidates took to the red , white and blue platform to embrace the group s positions on issues like putting prayer into the schools , cutting taxes and opposing abortion the turnout of political might was a testament to the growing political influence of the coalition , the nation s largest group of religious conservatives , with about 17 million members as mr dole put it , you 're going to have a big , big say about what happens in '96 by injecting the surefire issue of abortion , senator phil gramm of texas made perhaps the most bald plea for coalition members to back him over mr dole for the republican nomination last may , he said , he signed a pledge , by a group called the republican national coalition for life , affirming existing republican platform language that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed waving a copy of the pledge , mr gramm won a loud ovation when he said , i signed the pledge he went on , i understand that my dear colleague bob dole is going to be here this afternoon to speak he has not signed the pledge while he is here , i want to ask you to ask him to join us when mr dole , the majority leader , ascended to the same platform hours later , he asserted that he had never wavered in speaking out to protect the sanctity of all human life but when he was taunted by scattered cries of sign the pledge , mr dole shot back , do n't look at pledges look at the record mr dole has not ruled out signing the pledge , his aides said but for now , they added , he wants to keep his options open should the committee that drafts the party s platform before the convention next summer want to alter the language , while still opposing abortion mr gramm s effort to trump mr dole on abortion did not win the approval of sandy tiller , political director of the republican national coalition for life , who told reporters she was a little annoyed because gramm has done this silly staging a challenge house speaker newt gingrich also took part in the praisefest , thanking the christian coalition from the bottom of my heart he credited the coalition with everything from helping republicans win a majority last year to support for the contract with america , the manifesto that became part of the platform of most republican candidates for the house in the last election singling out the new york times more than once , he defended the coalition from reporters and editorial writers who routinely practice christianphobia i mean , mr gingrich continued , take the last 25 new york times editorials on the phobias they care about and how passionate they can be about every american s right to be involved unless , of course , you believe in prayer every american s right to be involved unless you believe in family mr gingrich , who has been the subject of recent critical publicity about his personal life , also declared that he as well as some of the announced candidates for president had every right to speak out on family issues , even though he has been divorced i grew up in a home that had involved a fair amount of confusion and turmoil it s a normal american family , mr gingrich said as the crowd laughed i then got married when i was very young , and we have two wonderful daughters by that marriage , and i got divorced later on , i got remarried , he added , and we have a marriage which has a fair amount of stress and it s difficult and i think that s fairly typical of a lot of families it takes a lot of work , a lot of prayer although almost all the speakers were republicans , mr reed went out of his way to portray the group as bigger than partisan politics we do not seek to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the republican party , he said , or any political party that made it even more striking that beyond a passing reference by mr dole , none of the major speakers mentioned the biggest drama unfolding a couple of miles away the resignation of senator bob packwood , republican of oregon , in the aftermath of allegations about his personal and official conduct mr reed said during a break that it was not proper for the group to engage in witch hunts of public officials based on private or personal behavior he added , we 're not going to comment on mel reynolds either , or bill clinton while mr clinton s personal life was not cited directly , he was a popular target mr reed , for one , mocked the president s speeches on faith as coming not from the bully pulpit but from the pulpit of bull besides the attacks on clinton , the most dependable applause lines of the day came from speakers who advocated abolishing the education department the only major republican presidential candidate who was not invited to speak was senator arlen specter of pennsylvania , who has built his campaign around support for abortion rights and denunciations of what he calls the political extremism of religious conservatives the other candidate who favors abortion rights , gov pete wilson of california , was invited but did not attend , citing a scheduling problem rev pat robertson and ralph reed jr are trying to dictate the next president of the united states , mr specter said we talk in the republican party about a big tent , but they exclude me for only one reason , and that is that they 're afraid of my ideas the coalition s influence was also shown by the assortment of opposition groups advocating positions like abortion rights , gay rights and religious tolerance who staged competing demonstrations and news conferences american democracy and churchstate separation are illserved by this kind of religiously based politicking , said the rev barry lynn , executive director of americans united for separation of church and state photos candidates came courting the christian coalition yesterday , embracing the religious right s views on various issues senator phil gramm of texas , top , challenged senator bob dole to sign an antiabortion pledge \( pg 1 \) as politician after politician spoke to the

senate republicans shook off a democratic stall and sent a final version of a balancedbudget constitutional amendment out of the judiciary committee and toward a final vote on the floor next month house republicans were less fortunate they spent the day mending frayed relations between rival republican camps that back two versions of the proposed amendment with distinctly different approaches to the question of future tax increases the two sides seemed at an uneasy peace by day s end , but only after house leaders had warned that their fight imperiled prospects for any kind of budgetbalancing amendment this year one camp , of house conservatives including speaker newt gingrich , favors an amendment that would require future tax increases to be approved by threefifths of each house a second camp , of republican moderates as well as many democrats , balks at that , favoring a less demanding provision that was included in the version approved by the senate judiciary committee today a requirement that tax increases be approved only by a majority of all 435 house members and by a majority of all 100 senators that is less than threefifths , but more than the current requirement a majority of members who choose to vote in sheer numbers , the gap between the proposals is small but in terms of political principle , it has proved cavernous , with some in each camp openly suggesting that they cannot support the other side s amendment i'm not prepared today in any way to announce that i would consider a weaker amendment , representative joe l barton , a texas republican who is the chief sponsor of the threefifths measure , said at a rally of his supporters today that led the house majority leader , representative dick armey of texas , to tell republicans at a private meeting today that unless they hung together , each of their amendments would hang separately , several republicans said the 230 republicans need 290 votes , or twothirds of the house , to approve any kind of amendment any serious split in their ranks would probably mean that an amendment would fall short of that number , even with democratic help michael wines
music , like every other art , has its share of incomplete masterpieces , and some are better left undisturbed but mozart s requiem , the subject of two fine new recordings , was left in a particularly tantalizing state of incompleteness by now , the mysterious circumstances of its creation have been mostly uncovered in the midsummer of 1791 , mozart received a letter from an anonymous patron offering a sizable commission for a requiem mass soon afterward , a tall , grim man dressed in gray appeared with an advance he was a messenger from the patron , count franz von walsegg , a musical dilettante who presented concerts at his estate and sometimes purchased compositions to pass off as his own when mozart died that december , a third or so of the requiem was complete , but for some wind parts here and there the lacrimosa left off after eight measures for the rest , the middle third of the work contained only the parts for chorus and vocal soloists , a figured bass line and occasional sketches for the orchestral parts what would probably have constituted the final third was never composed by mozart none of it , or so it is widely believed mozart s widow , constanze , desperate for the full commission fee , turned to franz xaver sussmayr , the composer s student and sometime assistant , to finish the requiem , as he did in his dutiful way but few have been satisfied with his work at best it is uninspired , at worst seriously flawed in this form , the requiem long ago entered the repertory yet composers and musicologists have never ceased trying to improve on , or even replace , parts of sussmayr s work most have approached the task with reticence and reverence not so robert levin , the noted fortepianist and mozart scholar mr levin s edition of the requiem can be heard on a new telarc cd \( 80410 \) , performed by boston baroque , a periodinstrument ensemble , led by martin pearlman mr levin has boldly appropriated the score , recomposing sussmayr s completions and adding new material where he thinks mozart would have done so though based on scrupulous scholarship , this is an audacious creative act , and the results are engrossing by way of timely comparison , erato has released a new cd of the unaltered sussmayr completion \( 0630106972 \) , performed by the renowned periodinstrument ensemble les arts florissants , led by william christie and the sussmayr version has seldom sounded so good the mozart requiem has been a passion of mr levin s since his undergraduate days at harvard , when he prepared a critical edition of the score as a senior thesis that proved only the first stage of his investigations , which continued for 25 years mr levin is probably best known to mozart fanciers as a fortepianist able to improvise elaborate , stylistically faithful cadenzas to the piano concertos he is a fleet pianist and an insightful mozartean his performances brim over with ebullience , sometimes to a fault his playing can seem showy and egocentric but completing the mozart requiem is no job for a pussyfooter mr levin is willing to stack his fugal writing alongside the master s and take the consequences , which in this case are mostly happy in the opening sections , mr levin cleans up sussmayr s added orchestration , eliminating some of the wind doublings of choral parts in the lacrimosa , he makes his first daring addition mozart s eight measures consist of mournful , consoling music in a supple , gently rocking 12 8 meter sussmayr continues in that vein but cuts the movement off with an almost perfunctory amen on two sustained chords mr levin is convinced , on the basis of the composer s sketches and his practice elsewhere , that mozart wanted to provide an extended fugal treatment of the amen , so he offers one brilliant , rhythmically insistent and harmonically complex it is substantial yet compact exactly what seems needed at this pivotal point in the overall structure he also alters the domine jesu substantially where sussmayr s strings play in symmetrical , stolid patterns , mr levin gives the violins flight with melodic twists and swirls this added intricacy folds beautifully into the larger textures , and ironically , mr levin s varied string figurations distract less from mozart s choral writing than do sussmayr s plodding patterns mr levin agrees with scholars who believe that the final sections of the requiem , which sussmayr claimed to have composed by himself , are based at least in part on mozart s ideas , whether communicated verbally , at the piano or in sketches now lost some of the motifs are derived from earlier material , and such tight unity is wholly lacking in sussmayr s own compositions so , out of respect for the piece s 200year performance tradition , mr levin defers to sussmayr s completion when it hews close to mozartean practice but he rewrites freely when he thinks that sussmayr has gone astray in truncated developments , clunky orchestration or errors in musical grammar and where sussmayr was timid , mr levin is bold he completely reshapes the sanctus , ending it with a proper osanna fugue \( modeled after the one in mozart s cminor mass \) on a theme that echoes the syncopation of the sanctus s stately opening boston baroque s performance is incisive , nuanced and lithe , the choral singing resonant , accurate and textually clear the vocal soloists ruth ziesak , nancy maultsby , richard croft and david arnold are strong the performers' involvement with this gratifying new edition of the requiem is palpable mr christie s performance with les arts florissants is characteristic of the work that has earned this ensemble high critical praise and a devoted following every phrase and gesture has been carefully wrought , yet there is no sense of effort in the musicmaking the recordare is softspoken and tender , as if recalled from some distant time when the violins and the soprano soloist , anna maria panza rella , enter on the same c , their sounds are so ineffably blended that you can hardly tell which is which instead of ominously churning out the rumbling string figures of the confutatis \( when the wicked are confounded \) , mr christie keeps the music emphatic and grounded , making the choral pleas from on high \( voca me , call me with the saints surrounded \) seem all the more poignant the vocal soloists ms panza rella , nathalie stutzmann , christoph pregardien and nathan berg are impressive in a program note , the scholar christoph wolff writes that rejecting sussmayr s completion out of hand means nothing less than sacrificing the chance of preserving what traces there are of mozart s original material perhaps but mr levin s daring approach makes mozart s requiem sound more convincing structurally and more vibrant musically a performance of the sussmayr edition can often seem like an inexorable descent from the sublime to the ordinary mr levin sustains the highs in all probability , mozart , who even in some of his most serious work was just as much a showman as mr levin , would be delighted photo robert levinhe is willing to stack his fugal writing alongsidethe master s and take the consequences \( steve kagan \)
revelations was born on a chill sunday afternoon in january 1960 at the 92d street y created by a handsome , charming young broadway show dancer named alvin ailey , the piece was a success from the start , not only with that first , stunned audience but also with dancegoers around the world , from australia to europe to china and back today , revelations is perhaps the best known and most loved of all american moderndance classics thirtyfive years after its creation , revelations will be celebrated by the alvin ailey american dance theater with a special performance on wednesday , the opening night of the company s monthlong season for this occasion the music , haunting negro spirituals , will be performed live by singers and instrumentalists , a departure from the company s years of using taped accompaniment it will be a fitting tribute , for spirituals were the heart and inspiration of the dance in revelations , ailey looked back to the churches of his west texas childhood and to the songs' messages of faith in the opening dance , i been buked , men and women , bathed by a hot southern sun and dressed in the simplest of clothes that capture the warm browns and golds of their skin , reach up to heaven and down to the earth , longing for redemption in the dances that follow , they are exalted by the joy of a baptismal service , then reminded of the terrible wages of sin at the end , they are joined in exuberant prayer , whose power may carry them through another week on earth why did that modest dance no more idealistic than a doris humphrey piece , no funnier than paul taylor was later to be , no grander than a work by jose limon become such a classic \? much of its enduring appeal has to do with its simplicity revelations is about everyday lives the stage may be filled with black men and women portraying people in the american south , but what these homespun heroes feel and do to music that is irresistibly engaging is familiar to anyone who has prayed or hoped or been uplifted when revelations was performed on tour in the 1970 s , belgians at one theater took off their shoes and pounded on the wall during the many curtain calls in germany , members of one audience tried to pull the dancers' clothes off in the soviet union , dancegoers surged to the front of the theater and banged on the stage , yelling their thanks in japan , the dancers failed to notice the first rumblings of an earthquake as revelations ended , so accustomed were they to the abandon of the normally reserved japanese audiences and today , when revelations is performed back home , new york city schoolchildren raised on gangsta rap are almost invariably clapping along by the time the dance is over there are other reasons for its enduring appeal ailey had just turned 29 when he choreographed revelations it was a work of pentup youthful emotions springing from rich , bittersweet memories of his childhood , an impoverished , often troubled time filled with the vivid theater of the lives he observed about him in the piece , his passion for life and for dance were joined revelations is also a dance about black americans' aspirations and cultural contributions to their country and it is about a group of friends who were performing with and for a friend to dance with ailey , they say , was a labor of love and hope as dudley williams , a longtime company member , puts it , without alvin , where would we have been \? the dancers were not like the devout churchgoers they portrayed claude thompson , a new yorkborn ailey dancer who went on to other work before the premiere , recalls feeling like a catholic nun at a baptist convention in rehearsals for the dance i could n't get the shout going , mr thompson says with a laugh passing by the black church in his neighborhood , he recalls , he 'd hear tambourine music and think coolly , nice rhythm nat horne , a southernborn member of the original cast , found it troubling to dance to the songs that his father , a minister , sang at church services i felt a little sacrilegious dancing to them , mr horne says what the first revelations dancers did have in common with the people they portrayed was a history of discrimination to have been refused hotel rooms or turned away from public bathrooms , mr williams says , is to understand the piece to have gone to an audition , says dorene richardson , a member of the first ailey company , and seen a white person getting the part when you could dance rings around them is also to understand revelations ms richardson was shocked , she says , when she first saw the piece performed by blueeyed blondes in the company what do they know \? she remembers wondering in 1959 , when revelations was made , few major moderndance troupes accepted black dancers \( the martha graham company was chief among those that did \) even today , relatively few black dancers are found in most major american ballet and moderndance companies at the time of revelations , there were small moderndance groups formed by such black choreographers as talley beatty and donald mckayle but none took root as the ailey company did ailey and later arthur mitchell and his dance theater of harlem proved that blacks could indeed compete in the dance marketplace revelations was choreographed in a time of turbulent but hopeful change john f kennedy was elected president later that year lunchcounter sitins were spreading throughout the south as black americans increasingly demanded equal rights
trenton , june 26 since the modern state constitution was passed here in 1949 , new jersey democrats have largely dominated state government then 18 months ago , with the election of gov christine todd whitman , the republicans took control of the executive and legislative branches for only the second time in 45 years , leaving the democrats in search of a strategy that will give them a leg up for the state assembly races this fall but if democrats had a unified plan of action , it did not surface today during the legislature s passage of bills to cut income tax rates by 15 percent indeed , 12 of the 28 democrats in the assembly joined the republicans today in voting for governor whitman s tax cut and democratic votes were crucial to pass the incometax rate cut in the senate the bill passed on a 27 to 9 vote with 21 needed for passage republicans supplied 20 votes with democrats providing the comfortable winning margin seeing the democratic support , the republican leadership allowed two of its senators from urban areas , senator richard j larossa of west trenton and peter a inverso of hamilton , to abstain republicans hold a 52 to 28 majority in the 80member assembly and , given the popularity of the republican governor and the continued absence of any unifying statewide controversy , it is unlikely that the democrats will close the gap on their rivals , much less regain control of the house the tax cut , which is scheduled to take effect in january , will enable governor whitman to make good on her pledge to cut tax rates by 30 percent , a year earlier than her selfimposed deadline of three years completion of the taxcut program will be the centerpiece of the republican drive to retain its lopsided assembly majority , which essentially has turned democrats into spectators over the last two years assemblywoman loretta weinberg , a democrat from teaneck , who voted against mrs whitman s tax cut , saying it will lead to higher taxes in the future , said today on the floor , i regret to say there is no single democratic position on this tax cut some of my members believe that any tax cut is better than none at all others oppose this concept , she continued , but they know the realities of bigmoney politics in the media age , and they will vote yes because they know they could be unfairly branded in an upcoming election she added that still others will abstain for fear of being caught between a rock and a hard place the tax cut passed the assembly by a vote of 63 to 14 democrats provided all the opposing votes besides the 12 democrats who voted for the cut , two , including the assembly minority leader joseph v doria of bayonne , abstained with no easy response to a tax cut delivered by a popular republican governor , b thomas byrne , the state democratic chairman , said the party s candidates in the fall will have to convince voters that cutting tax rates while the budget is growing is irresponsible and certain to produce higher local property taxes in the near term and higher state taxes eventually in order to balance future budgets many people do n't realize that the budget has gone up by 1 billion during whitman s tenure , he said i 've always said we could reasonably support a tax cut that was fair and paid for , but this neither , he said each round of elections more and more democrats are coming around , and lately some republicans have been saying the latest cut should have been delayed until we have a clearer picture of the economy and state revenues the senate minority leader , john a lynch of new brunswick , has been one of the most outspoken critics of the governor s economic policies and has sharpened his attacks in recent weeks revenues are flat , spending is up 8 percent and the governor declares a dividend by pushing through a cut in tax rates , he said today how do you do that \? they 're cooking the books and the issue is , do we have the courage to go out and make that case to the public \? mr lynch and senator bernard f kenny , a hoboken democrat , have gone to court to try to force the whitman administration to release a letter from the internal revenue service , regarding some changes in the state s pension system those changes , enacted by gov jim florio with the cooperation of the republican legislature two years ago , were portrayed as an accounting change that would help the state present a balanced budget mr lynch said that the state could eventually be forced to come up with 1 billion to satisfy the irs and that legislators had a right to see the letter before being asked to vote for the budget or the tax cut mrs whitman has said the letter is merely an invitation to discuss the pension changes , and her legal advisers say the accounting procedures will pass muster but mrs whitman has refused to make the letter public and has defeated the democrats' court challenge at the trial level late last week , after reading the letter , a twojudge panel of the appellate division of superior court said it should be made public the administration won a stay of that ruling while it pursues an appeal the sevenmember new jersey supreme court conferred today by telephone and sent the matter back to the trial court for additional factfinding a decision on releasing the letter is not expected for at least few weeks mr lynch said that if the state must come up with increased tax payments to the irs , even if they are stretched out over a few years this could be the straw that breaks the camel s back he said that by the middle of 1997 the state could be looking at a budget gap of more than 4 billion when the diversion of hundreds of millions in pension payments ends and the bill for the state takeover of the court system comes due
he had to endure a management shakeup , a selfimposed holdout and a leaguewide lockout , but six days after the rangers' triumphant return to madison square garden , mark messier finally cashed in on the stanley cup championship he virtually willed into being last season the team captain and the rangers came to terms on a renegotiated contract that is believed will more than double messier s salary over the next two seasons , bringing him as much as 12 million we are very proud of mark , said neil smith , the club president , who said yesterday that messier and the rangers had accomplished everything we hoped for when the star center came to new york from the edmonton oilers in september 1991 no financial terms were disclosed , but it is believed the rangers agreed to pay messier about 6 million a year for two seasons , with a team option to extend the contract for a third year messier had been seeking a threeyear deal but apparently accepted a shorter contract with larger annual payments plus incentives whatever the amount , it was enough to cause messier to choke up during a news conference yesterday at madison square garden the commitment that the rangers have made to me is pretty overwhelming , he said messier later recalled that his first professional contract 17 years ago provided a 15 , 000 signing bonus and 35 , 000 per year under the fiveyear , 13 million contract messier signed in december 1991 , he was to have received a total of 54 million this season and the next the 1991 contract contained a number of incentive clauses , none more important than the one that allowed messier to renegotiate if the team won the stanley cup messier , who had been on five stanley cup championship teams in edmonton and who had been brought to new york with the purpose of leading the team to its first cup since 1940 , wasted little time in taking advantage of the clause after the rangers won the championship last year at first the negotiations went smoothly , but they turned bumpy after bob gutkowski was dismissed last september as president of madison square garden , the rangers' corporate parent the negotiations stalled under gutkowski s replacement , dave checketts , and messier showed his frustration by boycotting training camp the prospect for settlement seemed so remote at one point that there was speculation that messier might be traded to the st louis blues for brett hull the negotiations were further complicated by the labor dispute that delayed the start of the national hockey league season but once a settlement was reached earlier this month , talks resumed full speed , with messier s father , doug , and his brother , paul , acting on the player s behalf messier , who was technically still under contract , showed up for this month s training camp and was on the ice when the team opened the regular season last friday with the ceremony at which the stanley cup championship banner was raised messier , who made clear he regarded winning as more important than money , celebrated his done deal last night at a dinner with family and friends the party booked a table at le cirque we hear the food is good , said paul messier , noting that mark would pick up the check photo after settling his contract , mark messier hears from the knicks' patrick ewing at left is dave checketts \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg b15 \)
after more than 200 witnesses and a mindfogging flood of secretly recorded conversations , a jury yesterday began deliberating the fate of 10 men charged with a terrorbombing and assassination conspiracy in and around new york city near the end of an eightmonth trial in federal district court in manhattan , the jury is to decide not only whether sheik omar abdel rahman , a prominent muslim cleric , and his nine codefendants plotted both individual killings and mass murder , but also whether the purported crimes were part of a single fouryearlong conspiracy fueled by fundamentalist fanaticism the prosecution says it was all one overarching seditious plot the killing of a militant rabbi in 1990 , the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 , plots to blow up the united nations headquarters , the hudson river commuter tunnels and other sites , and a scheme to assassinate the president of egypt in giving the jury of six women and six men nearly five hours of legal instructions earlier yesterday , judge michael b mukasey took note of the islamic fundamentalist cause that the prosecutors said had inspired the defendants although the government may introduce proof of religious belief and argue motive from that , he said , you may not find that a defendant committed any offense charged in this indictment merely because you may disagree with or dislike his religious beliefs the jurors , who have been anonymous during the trial , deliberated for nearly two hours yesterday before adjourning for the night lawyers for mr abdel rahman and the other defendants have argued during the trial that separate crimes and charges were falsely linked to form the broad seditiousconspiracy count the count certainly appeared to strengthen the government s case , for it presented a frightening vision of a jihad army a prosecutor s description using the arabic word often translated as holy war that was embarked on a murderous march in the new york area this was combined with the secretly recorded conversations of the defendants to provide compelling evidence against at least some of them but significant problems plagued the prosecution case , the biggest of which appeared to be that the government s chief informer and prime witness was a man who had abundantly lied in the past about his background and activities and indeed , the defense vividly portrayed the witness , a former egyptian army officer named emad a salem , as an accomplished confidence man and agent provocateur the defense also charged that the federal bureau of investigation had given mr salem so much leeway that he had been able to plant evidence and destroy or alter tapes of conversations he had made with various defendants they let a monster loose , said a defense lawyer , john h jacobs , during closing arguments prosecutors derided the notion that the defendants had been manipulated or misled into incriminating situations that were secretly videotaped in one such tape , made in a queens garage that the fbi says was a bombmaking safe house , four defendants are seen helping to mix diesel oil with fertilizer the prosecution said the defendants had been hoping to intimidate the united states into dropping its support of israel and egypt terrorism in the name of jihad made itself clear on feb 26 , 1993 , when a bomb ripped through the world trade center , declared assistant united states attorney patrick j fitzgerald , referring to the attack that drew worldwide attention none of the defendants is accused in that attack but the government has called them coconspirators of the four men convicted of the bombing last year and the two awaiting trial for it also part of the conspiracy , the prosecution held , was the 1990 murder in manhattan of rabbi meir kahane , a jewish militant one defendant , el sayyid a nosair , an egyptian immigrant , is accused of that killing , as well as of participation in the purported bombing plots he was acquitted of murdering the rabbi in a 1991 state trial in addition , the seditiousconspiracy charge includes a purported plan to assassinate president hosni mubarak of egypt when he visited the united states in 1993 seditious conspiracy is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and is the most serious charge against 8 of the 10 defendants judge mukasey told the jurors they could find there was a single conspiracy , despite the differing defendants and plots , so long as you find that some of the coconspirators continued for the entire duration of the conspiracy to act for the purposes charged in the indictment
this is a tale of three bulldogs , two of them the real thing and one of them , cody sickle , an honorary member of the species , for never was there a human being this bullish on the jowly , growly and infinitely stubborn breed sickle , a banker from merrick , li , has been fanatical about bulldogs for the last 40 years he is 45 now , and when he was 5 , he began saving for a bulldog of his own it had to be a bulldog , no other breed would do , and after three years of forgoing movies and the rest of the normal juvenile pursuits of his friends , sickle piled up 60 , combed the classifieds , and found his dog it was a saturday , march 1 , 1958 , said sickle , who named his first pet cherokee and , even though she never panned out as a show dog , later named his kennel after her these days sickle , who took time off from college at northwestern to journey from chicago during a snowstorm to take his first breed best at the westminster show in 1969 , has a wife and two sons , none of whom is partial to dogs but his passion remains undiluted yesterday at madison square garden , sickle arrived with the latest , best and brightest product of his lifelong love affair with bulldogs , ch prestwick gawain , the defending champion of the breed sickle bought the dog four years ago after judging him at a show gawain was a prodigy , a champion by the time he was 7 months old , and last year he was the topwinning bulldog in the country but gawain was n't the best bulldog yesterday at westminster instead of defending his title , he was upended by a notquite2yearold upstart , ch hetherbull arrogant nigel , a white dog with a distinctive leopard marking on his right ear and when he went back to work in in the nonsporting group last night , nigel s precocity again worked wonders in a competition among 16 vastly differing breeds , a polished poodle won the blue ribbon , but the bulldog took third place the two bulldogs are rivals gawain holds a 62 edge in the competition with nigel and after the breed judging , they were only two cages apart in the congested benching area while the dogs slept off the exertion of waddling around the show ring , their owners projected an aura of mutual respect and traded a few goodhumored jibes sickle said he overheard nigel s owner , jean hetherington , referring to the judge of the bulldog class , gilbert kahn , as uncle gilbert and sickle said he was convinced hetherington , who got into the dog business full time in 1960 after bridge and golf turned out to be unsatisfactory hobbies , had the upper hand yesterday because of longevity jean s been in the breed since the 1800 s , i think , said sickle , whose dog received an award of merit , the equivalent of a consolation prize mollified by her blue ribbon , hetherington smiled politely and then began extolling the praises of her prodigy , who at 53 pounds and with two bestinshows , is 12 pounds and five bests off the pace set by gawain nigel happens to be the latest in a lengthy line of 50 champions hetherington has bred at her north carolina kennel nigel showed beautifully he was kind of asking for it , said hetherington , who was steered toward bulldogs by her husband , who owned one as a child and attended a university , yale , where bulldogs are considered top dogs despite nigel s tender age , he has sired a litter of puppies , one of whom is yale s mascot he s called handsome dan , but his real name is wizard , she said this was nigel s first visit to westminster last year he was too young but if he was awed by these surroundings , where each ring is surrounded by the hooting and hollering railbirds of this sport , he did n't let on they do n't call him arrogant , said his owner , for nothing and he s lovable and stubborn as well at home , nigel sleeps in his own canine hammock and , when asked to remove himself from the furniture , simply grins and does n't my mouth felt like cotton when he went into the ring , hetherington said he 'd never been in a ring like that before , but the ulcers around here go to the owners , not the dogs as for gawain and sickle , who described his dog as terminally rambunctious , it was home to long island the owner took care to pack his dog s squeaky pig toy after all , win or lose , the dog s a champion of course i like my kids better , said sickle , but when we go to or from shows , gawain rides in the front seat right next to me that s the way i think of him

powers to combat terrorism , including creation of a domestic counterterrorism center headed by the federal bureau of investigation the white house said mr clinton would seek new authority for federal

indicated that they were seeking new legal grounds to continue holding two brothers , terry lynn nichols and james douglas nichols , who are being held as material witnesses in the bombing the brothers are expected to be charged with minor crimes in connection with searches of their houses in decker , mich , and herington , kan , which yielded bomb materials and other contraband page b6 mr clinton s proposals would reverse a twodecade trend away from federal surveillance of government critics , which was curtailed after disclosures of widespread abuses and harassment of civil rights and antiwar protesters in the 1960 s and 70 s the new proposals seemed all but certain to raise concern among civil liberties groups indeed , some of those groups were quick to express concerns about mr clinton s remarks tonight philip s gutis , media relations director for the american civil liberties union , said his organization had not yet seen the precise proposal but had been bracing for a renewed effort by congress or the clinton administration to seek to curtail constitutional rights we are concerned about an overreaction that would threaten to sweep away the constitutional principles that have shaped our society and remain at the core of our liberty , mr gutis said but the president said , i do n't think we have to give up our liberties , but i do think we have to have more discipline , and we have to be willing to see serious threats to our liberties properly investigated he noted that metal detectors at airports had once seemed invasive but were now accepted as routine the president outlined the measures generally in an interview on the cbs news program 60 minutes broadcast from the oklahoma state fairgrounds here , and his aides provided other details mr clinton went on to chastise any groups , including militia or other antigovernment groups , that feel justified in using violence to support their beliefs they have a right to believe whatever they want , the president said they have a right to say whatever they want they have a right to keep and bear arms they have a right to put on uniforms and go out on the weekends they do not have the right to kill innocent americans they do not have the right to violate the law hours earlier , mr clinton joined the rev billy graham and oklahoma state officials at a prayer service at the oklahoma city state fair arena , eulogizing the victims of the bombing on wednesday morning of the alfred p murrah federal building here , which he promised to replace with a new building let us teach our children that the god of comfort is also the god of righteousness , mr clinton said in brief remarks at the service , borrowing words from the book of proverbs those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind justice will prevail mr clinton clasped the hand of his wife , hillary , who was seated with him in the front row of the cavernous arena he joined the crowd in singing amazing grace and swayed to a soloist s rendition of god bless america then he filled his 10minute remarks with a quiet , revivalmeeting intensity we pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured , to rebuild this city and to bring to justice those who did this evil , he said this terrible sin took the lives of our american family innocent children in that building only because their parents were trying to be good parents as well as good workers , citizens in the building and many there who served the rest of us mr graham noted the president s tone with approval , saying it could be a sermon from a pulpit anywhere , and maybe that s what he 'll do someday at that , the president and the crowd shared a laugh , before mr graham added the caveat , ten or 20 years from now later , in the 60 minutes interview , mr clinton was a bit blunter , saying , if this is not a crime for which capital punishment is called , i do n't know what is
seoul , south korea , aug 19 it all began when an american soldier put his hand on a korean woman s rump the version that has captured the local imagination is that a group of drunken american soldiers were rampaging through the subway , molesting korean women , and that the soldiers then attacked good citizens who dared protest the errant hand that episode , which is expected to lead to the public trial soon of four americans , has added to an outcry in south korea against what many koreans perceive as a wave of violence by american soldiers , and a system that is tilted to allow them to get away with it we strongly condemn us military personnel who do not repent and who continue to commit outrageous criminal offenses , declared a group that calls itself the headquarters to bring an end to crimes by us military stationed in korea the american understanding of events starts with a fact that the koreans tend to leave out the american soldier and the korean woman whose behind he patted were in fact a married couple the americans say the problems arose when some angry young koreans on the subway accused the american of sexually harassing the korean woman when the korean woman explained that she was the american s wife , the korean men allegedly spat at her and slapped her leading the woman s husband to punch the man who slapped her in any case , the result that evening in may was a huge brawl in the subway it has reverberated through the country and underscored the delicacy of the mission of the 37 , 000 american military personnel in bases in south korea south korea is an intensely nationalist country some korean and american officials alike worry that public irritation about crimes committed by american troops could undermine the public support for the american bases in south korea the korean public is led to believe that these things are getting out of hand , and it s affecting our welcome here , said the american ambassador in seoul , james t laney it s a cause for great concern mr laney says the problem is not that american soldiers are committing more crimes , but that an irresponsible korean press is portraying them in a particularly lurid way to an inflamed public many koreans say that whether or not crime is getting worse , the problem is that american soldiers get special treatment when they commit crimes the problem is not in the crime itself , but in the criminal process , said kwon suk hun , a 23yearold student council officer at yonsei university , traditionally a hotbed of social protest this process reflects the imperialist characteristics of the us government the united states and south korea agreed this summer to review the status of forces agreement , known as sofa , which governs such issues as the treatment of american soldiers charged with committing crimes in korea korean courts have jurisdiction , although soldiers may also face courtmartial and other penalties under american law the korean public s perception is that the sofa is not meeting with a sense of justice , said yim sung joon , director general of the american affairs bureau in the foreign ministry mr yim said the most important issue is to revise the agreement so arrested american soldiers may be held in korean custody while awaiting trial now they are released to the american military , although they are made available to the korean authorities for questioning if convicted of crimes , american soldiers are jailed in a special wing of a korean prison , where eight are now serving sentences if they are sentenced to death by a korean court , the americans could be executed , although this has not happened and none is on death row now a measure of the public sensitivity in south korea is that one of the bestknown americans in the country is kenneth markle 3d , an army private convicted of murdering a korean prostitute in 1992 the case led to huge demonstrations and antiamerican protests , as well as calls for the death penalty for private markle , but in the end he was sentenced to a 15year term , which he is serving while cases like the subway incident are seen by koreans as evidence of the need for protection from rampaging americans , to americans they show that they need protection from a skewed local judicial system after the subway brawl , no koreans were indicted , but four americans were these kinds of problems , of course , are neither new nor confined to south korea they were a factor in the closing of american military bases in the philippines in 1992 but in south korea , the upshot is that with the atmosphere strained because of protests over crime by american soldiers , each side is now demanding more of the other lee jang hee , one of the leaders of a group that has gathered more than 40 , 000 signatures seeking to revise the status of forces agreement , says american tax privileges in korea should be revoked the united states , on the other hand , wants south korea to pick up more of the tab for stationing troops in south korea americans see little reason why they should pay more korean taxes when they are already helping defend south korea and paying for the privilege the united states now pays not only all the dollar costs of maintaining troops in korea , like soldiers' pay , but also twothirds of the costs incurred in local currency , like payments to support staff the seoul government is willing to increase its payments , amounting to a onethird share , only by the amount of inflation but the united states argues that south korea s extraordinary economic growth means that seoul can now pay more of its own way japan , in contrast , pays all the costs incurred in local currency for maintaining united states forces stationed in japan could accusations about criminal behavior and demands for changes in the status of forces agreement lead the united states to decide that it is not worth the bother and expense of defending south korea \? the clinton administration says that despite occasional difficulties , the troops in south korea are as essential now as they ever were mr yim also said a withdrawal was unlikely keeping troops on the korean peninsula is in us interests , he added , a bit nervously so i'm sure the us wo n't bring them home photo american soldiers stroll a back alley of seoul s itaewon district

the road to kentucky may run through new york after all in perhaps the most impressive performance by a 3yearold colt this year and on the heels of his decisive victory in the gotham three weeks ago , talkin man led every step of the way to win the 71st running of the 500 , 000 wood memorial yesterday at aqueduct talkin man did it in impressive fashion , toying with seven colts before pulling away for a 7 3 4length victory over knockadoon and assuring himself a date at churchill downs in three weeks , perhaps as the favorite of the kentucky derby on may 6 the 2to5 favorite in the grade ii wood , talkin man left the rest of the field none had won a graded stakes race in the dust at the top of the stretch jockey shane sellers , riding the canadianbred horse for the first , and likely last time , because mike smith had to honor another commitment in arkansas , never used his whip as his mount covered the mile and an eighth in an easy 1 491 5 i was just a passenger out there , sellers said after talkin man breezed through fractions of 234 5 seconds for the quarter , 48 flat for the half , 1 123 5 over 6 furlongs and the mile in 1 37 even , while never being asked to run all out regardless of what the pace was , i knew what i had underneath me he was telling me , 'we ok , we ok do n't worry about nothing' coupled with the upset victory by the 301 long shot wild syn in the blue grass at keeneland a little over an hour earlier , talkin man s victory guarantees that the big , lanky , darkbay homebred will be highly regarded at churchill downs the other likely favorite is d wayne lukas s filly , serena s song , but lukas has not announced whether he will run her in the derby she s a lovely filly , said roger attfield , talkin man s englishborn trainer i would n't be at all surprised if she does n't show up now but whether she can stack up with the boys , that s always a question with a 3yearold filly , though it s been done before but history is against talkin man no horse who has won the gotham and the wood has ever gone on to win the kentucky derby and the list includes native dancer in 1953 and easy goer in 1989 , both of whom finished second in the derby and secretariat \? he won the 1973 gotham , then finished third to angle light and sham in the wood before sweeping the triple crown and establishing himself as perhaps the greatest thoroughbred of all time oh well , there s got to be a first for everything , right \? said attfield nobody is calling talkin man great just yet but he was easily the class of this field talkin man shipped in from his training base at keeneland late friday afternoon and will ship back this morning he is something of a newcomer to the short list of possible contenders for the derby despite the fact that he was named the canadian 2yearold champion a year ago that is probably because of his disappointing 10thplace finish in the breeders' cup juvenile at churchill last november in that race , won by the american 2yearold champion timber country , another possible derby favorite , talkin man pressed the pace and then tired badly , beaten by 16 lengths attfield had an excuse after the race , it was discovered that talkin man had a lung infection , and the trainer gave his star a long vacation that fourandahalfmonth layoff ended march 25 here in the gotham , where talkin man destroyed an 11horse field by 7 lengths despite going four wide that reestablished him as a serious derby contender said attfield of the derby i thought i might be there with the horse but i never thought about going into it as one of the favorites the last colt to win the wood and then go on and take the derby was pleasant colony in 1981 but talkin man is bred for the derby s mile and a quarter distance his sire , with approval , was canada s champion 3yearold and horse of the year in 1989 and talkin man s connections are perhaps his biggest asset his regular rider , smith , is considered by many to be the preeminent jockey in the nation attfield said smith will be aboard his horse in louisville and then there is the 54yearold attfield , who has trained six canadian horses of the year three of his charges have swept the canadian triple crown attfield , who trains talkin man for kinghaven farms , has also won an unprecedented five sovereign awards as canada s top trainer after watching his star today , attfield was asked how talkin man ranks with the other top horses he has trained it s early , you know , he said but he might be the best i 've ever trained photo talkin man , ridden by jockey shane sellers , leading the pack at the wood memorial yesterday he won by seven and threequarter lengths \( alan zale for the new york times \)
when mo vaughn of the boston red sox faces the yankees tonight at fenway park , the powerful first baseman will exhibit in two fashions a quality most rare in the modernday major leagues vaughn will display loyalty , unapologetic and undying , for two men he says paved the way for his unquestioned superstardom and , the red sox first baseman hopes , for his first postseason in the most visible salute , vaughn will wear his no 42 it serves as a constant reminder to vaughn of jackie robinson , who , in 1947 , joined the brooklyn dodgers and smashed the color line that had previously barred africanamericans like vaughn from the big leagues in a less visible , but equally poignant tribute , vaughn will also figuratively wear on his sleeve thoughts of mike \( the hit man \) easler , the instructor who helped turn vaughn into one of the game s most prolific run producers by introducing him to left field and the rich offensive rewards found there easler is also the one coach fired for disputing management s call to work with nonunion replacement players during the strikemarred spring training so vaughn plays for both robinson and easler , because , he said i do n't forget who struggled to get me the opportunity to play and i do n't forget who was with me when i was struggling people want me to forget , but i do n't he says i'm always in his brain , easler said friday from his home in texas , but i 've told mo , 'my parting with the club was the best thing that happened to you because you had a chance to mature and see how good you are' it shows his dedication and hard work believe me , he s done this on his own vaughn sees it the other way , though like i said at the allstar game , i would have not been here if it were not for mike easler , said vaughn , who is batting 305 , leading the american league with 88 runs batted in and ranked second with 29 home runs that emotion pours from vaughn is testament to another lesson obviously welllearned easler , too , is a mercurial man , known for an evangelical style that is in keeping with his other role as an ordained minister easler touched not only vaughn , but other noted disciples , like don mattingly when both were teammates with the yankees and dante bichette of colorado , who , like vaughn , was named his league s most recent player of the week easler , labeling his dispute with the red sox as a labor issue , refused to work with replacements and questioned why clubs planned to pay such players more money than the fulltime coaches and trainers made if the players had made it to the regular season they were getting more respect than we were , said easler , who took his fateful stance even before sparky anderson refused to manage detroit s replacement players and toronto excused its manager , cito gaston from working with the nonunion players easler recently dropped an unfair labor practices charge against the club after reaching an undisclosed outofcourt settlement but the closest he comes to baseball is as a private instructor , for players ranging from little leaguers to college women who play softball and men who play baseball without easler , vaughn struggled initially the home runs were there , but the average was not what mike and i talked mostly about when he was here was feelings , vaughn explained , and so i knew how i was supposed to feel , and i was n't feeling that fortunately for vaughn , he had matured , just as easler said , so much so that he knew how to right himself he did , using an undeniable motive i wanted to do well because i did n't want him to feel that he did what he thought was right , but i did n't go out there and do my job , vaughn said i just wanted him to know that he s my hitting coach and always will be my hitting coach , that he taught me very , very well vaughn says none of this is a reflection on jim rice , who replaced easler as coach people want to make it an issue between me and jim rice , but it s nothing that can be made an issue , he said it is just that with mike it is a relationship that comes once in a lifetime and he s got to know that easler also has to know , and see , that vaughn remembers the lessons as well as the friendship the leftfield wall at fenway , once untouched by the lefthanded hitting vaughn , is now owned by the player , thanks to easler convincing him to stop jumping around in the batter s box and plant his feet in order to unleash his power to the opposite field vaughn figures 18 to 20 of his home runs this season were hit to left easler gave more than just batting tips mike was the only one who believed that i could play , vaughn said he also taught me feelings , taught me to understand what it is to go to war for nine innings , to focus completely every day vaughn does that so well , it could translate into a championship for boston , perhaps also a most valuable player award for him should vaughn win one or both prizes , the red sox will gladly pay homage to the player ironically , the club will also have to thank a coach that only vaughn insists all remember photo as the red sox cruise toward the postseason , the slugging first baseman mo vaughn is quick to credit those who have inspired him \( associated press for the new york times \)
the 73yearold rabbi moved across the den of his house on ocean parkway in brooklyn one night last week and peered through the drawn blinds of the front windows he said he was unafraid , but it was with a certain concern that he stared out into the gathering darkness i'm a highprofile person all of a sudden , he said , managing a sort of sad wink for the last month , abraham b hecht has been the most remarkedupon rabbi in new york statements he made about the illegality of turning land in the west bank over to palestinian control and the penalty of death were seen by some as contributing to the volatile environment that led to the assassination of prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel portrayed by the israeli government as the embodiment of the farright fringe of orthodox jews , rabbi hecht has been condemned and vilified , and this week he was suspended by his own brooklyn synagogue for his part , rabbi hecht said , he has endured what he insists is his undeserved infamy with a mixture of fury and sorrow , his greatest sadness being his standoff with the shaare zion synagogue they are my brothers , my sisters , my students , he said of the congregants at the largest sephardic synagogue in the city i have been here with them for 53 years i married them , buried them , commiserated with them what did n't i do for them \? rabbi hecht said prominent members of the congregation had assured him that the paid suspension would be rescinded the president of the synagogue , morris j franco , did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment i have never accepted the suspension , rabbi hecht said and i'm not prepared to accept it i built that synagogue the last word has not been spoken the rabbi s vault into the center of the storm over violence , religion and the future of israel began in june at a manhattan conference that included 1 , 500 rabbis from israel there , as part of what he called a theoretical discussion of jewish law and the israeli government s proposal to turn over parts of the west bank to palestinian control , rabbi hecht said he cited the teachings of maimonides in asserting that the penalty for illegally endangering jewish lives or biblically ordained property was death his statement later became the subject of a new york magazine article , which identified him as the man who sentenced mr rabin to death earlier this week , after the israeli government stated that none of its officials would step inside the shaare zion synagogue on ocean parkway until rabbi hecht was removed , the synagogue s executive committee voted to suspend him for six months mr franco said last month that the statements attributed to the rabbi had horrified the congregation rabbi hecht now concedes that it was foolish and a mistake to have engaged in even a theoretical discussion of jewish law and the fate of the west bank settlers , given the charged atmosphere in both the middle east and the united states but he maintains that his intent and meaning have been grossly distorted he insists that he never spoke directly about mr rabin at the conference or with a reporter the new york magazine reporter , however , said he could produce the transcript of an interview in which the rabbi did refer to mr rabin rabbi hecht notes and produces a copy of an apology he sent to mr rabin two weeks before the assassination the letter closes we must speak and act toward each other as we would toward gd for my part , i wish to repudiate any words and actions of anger which have caused hurt of his remarks at the june conference , he said i must have got carried away i have very strong feelings about the completion of the land if god gave it to us , i do n't want to give it back rabbi hecht did concede that he had published many articles in new york that were sharply critical of the peace accords in the middle east , articles that might have contributed to what he admits was a shrill debate i made a mistake by talking , he said , but sin i did n't i , making an innocent rabbinical statement , incited an unhinged man living 10 , 000 miles away to kill \? the man tried to kill rabin eight months ago i never met the guy i do n't know who he is we 're not from the same school he probably does n't even speak english how does he know what i said \? it was n't published as a treatise where do they get off \? it is all so dishonest when asked about the congregation s decision to suspend rabbi hecht , a spokesman for the israeli consulate in new york said the government did not wish to speak any further about the internal affairs of a synagogue last month , colette avital , the consul general , said she was gratified that the congregation was considering disciplining the rabbi but she said there was no vendetta against anyone the turmoil has racked a synagogue unused to publicity the congregants of shaare zion 3 , 000 jews , mostly syrian , typically attend services each week are known for their discretion the congregation has many wealthy members , and has achieved distinction through charitable and social work rather than politics sephardic congregations , though , are traditionally reverential and deeply loyal to their rabbis , and rabbi hecht has been with shaare zion since its beginning a halfcentury ago in bensonhurst the rabbi , who is himself a hasidic jew and a member of the lubavitch sect , was born in the brownsville section of brooklyn and studied briefly in poland in 1939 he was there , he said , when the first nazi bombs fell on warsaw in brooklyn , rabbi hecht , one of seven brothers , all of them rabbis , was well known , although not remarkably so until the last several months he was a member of the united jewish coalition in brooklyn that backed the campaigns of mayor rudolph w giuliani , but he was not considered a political heavyweight he is , too , the president of the rabbinical alliance of america his sons are rabbis , his grandson the chief rabbi in thailand police officials , aware of threats against rabbi hecht , said they were monitoring his safety earlier this week , an officer checked the identification of people approaching the rabbi s house and rabbi hecht got a police escort to shaare zion on nov 25 , his first visit to the synagogue since he left for florida for a vacation before mr rabin s death i did n't run away from anything , rabbi hecht said they keep saying i am afraid but 3 in the morning or 4 in the afternoon , i walk these streets i am a strong man i have been through much i will not break and although he pledges to temper his words , rabbi hecht remains capable of making severe , unforgiving statements he says he believes the israeli government , creating what he calls a false environment of fear , has persuaded the congregation to oust him for its own protection he accuses members of his synagogue s executive committee of betraying him , and he describes members of the congregation as politically unsophisticated the rabbi will be back , he said i will go to the synagogue i will pray when it comes to religion , if i was not afraid to go into hitler s den , i will not be afraid to go into my own brothers' photo in 1993 , prime minister yitzhak rabin , left , met in new yorkwith a group that included rabbi jacob s kassin , center , and rabbi abraham hecht for a month , rabbi hecht has been under attack for remarks that some believe contributed to the volatile environment that led to mr rabin s assassination
to the editor i served as a juror on the zion v new york hospital case and have followed your coverage of the trial since the verdict i felt enraged by the views expressed by dr r gordon douglas , physician in chief of new york hospital , 198290 \( letters , feb 14 \) , portraying the standards of new york hospital as second to none if this institution represents the best , then it s a sad commentary on medical care in this country i was juror no 6 , the lone dissenting voice on the verdict i disagreed with the other jurors on many aspects of the case , mainly because of my position that , even though the care the hospital gave was in keeping with accepted medical standards , i found those standards woefully inadequate and inferior the evidence led me to believe that new york hospital failed in its care of libby zion this jury failed her too i 'd never served as a juror before and welcomed the opportunity to the times welcomes letters from readers letters must include writer s name , address and telephone number we regret that we cannot acknowledge unpublished letters those selected may be shortened for space reasons fax letters to \( 212 \) 5563622 or send to letters to the editor , the new york times , 229 west 43d street , new york , ny 10036 participate in the process i did not hold any preconceived notions about the parties involved if truth be told , i 'd always felt that physicians were a noble group bound by high moral and ethical values i was in for a rude awakening libby zion was admitted as a fever patient at new york hospital and within eight hours after being seen by three inexperienced and overworked doctors \( two second year residents and an intern \) she died did their inexperience play a part \? i believe it did throughout the trial there were efforts to discredit ms zion s character and blame her for her own demise it was argued that cocaine killed ms zion despite the fact that her postmortem blood and urine were free of the substance all other evidence presented was either suspect , inconclusive or not relevant cocaine was a red herring unfortunately , my fellow jurors were swept away by the cocaine theory , and they made further assumptions that led them to assign partial blame to libby zion for her own death they presumed a certain life style that she attended a prestigious school and came from a wealthy family do not prove she took cocaine furthermore , whether she took cocaine is actually unimportant what mattered was the quality of care she received the hospital has only admitted to wrongfully administering demerol , an error that could not be explained away by the standards of medical practice however , the abandonment of libby by the intern , the ordering of fivepoint restraints , and the administration of haldol \( a sedative meant for psychotics that interferes with the body s ability to perspire \) all considered appropriate medical practice contributed to her death this was supported by the findings of the medical examiner many feel that sidney zion has been overzealous in his efforts to pursue justice we are lucky to have a sidney zion to fight a campaign that can only mean better care for all of us loretta andrews new york , feb 15 , 1995
to the editor in reference to rentals in london mentioned in a letter from hector mackethan \( flats in london , oct 1 \) , we , too , stayed at chelsea cloisters there our experience was worse than his , if that is possible they asked for a 1 , 300 deposit in advance , and on our arrival aug 1 , demanded payment in full for all five weeks we were staying , about 4 , 500 the first flat they gave us was totally inadequate the half bath had a lavatory so small that it could not be used after one night we wanted to leave and find other accommodations we were willing to give them two weeks' rent , but they refused , insisting on keeping the full five weeks' payment they offered us a different flat , which was somewhat better but the stove would not get hot enough to cook on we had no options other than to stay or lose 4 , 500 if it is any consolation to mr mackethan for the washing machine he did not get , both our flats had washing machines neither worked the deposit of 1 , 300 , paid june 16 , was not returned to our travel agent until nov 22 jorge balot dale von ohlen fort lauderdale , fla louise harkins , the manager of chelsea cloisters , responds both the deposit and the rental for the entire stay are always paid in advance as for the size of the bathroom , in the twobedroom apartment , the second bath is normally a washbasin and toilet only , and the size is standard since mr balot and mr von ohlen were so unhappy , we agreed , and this is rare , to move them to another apartment all of the kitchens are the same , and none of our regular tenants has ever complained about the stove we do provide instructions for the washing machines , and tenants who had the flat in question before and after august did not complain about operating it we had a very busy summer , and the deposit , normally returned in three weeks , in this case was not returned for 45 days chelsea cloisters apologizes for this delay
late on friday afternoon mayor rudolph giuliani stood at the podium in the blue room at city hall and angrily defended the indefensible his choice for chancellor of the public schools it was unfortunate , the mayor said , that leon m goldstein had felt it necessary to remove himself from consideration mr goldstein , the president of kingsborough community college in brooklyn , had been badly burned during his brief foray into the spotlight he was n't prepared for the tough questioning he slipped into a humiliating minitrance when a reporter asked how old he was he seemed discombobulated when asked how long he 'd been married it was , to say the least , peculiar there were other , more serious , problems patronage , for example parts of the payroll at kingsborough looked like branches of the family trees of bigtime democratic politicians and even as mr giuliani offered his futile defense of mr goldstein , city agencies were investigating conflictofinterest allegations that had surfaced during a background check none of this mattered to mr giuliani the information about mr goldstein does n't trouble me , he said he described the allegations as largely exaggerated , although he felt it prudent to add , i ca n't say we 've looked at every one i advised mr goldstein to stay in it , the mayor said he denounced the leak of the confidential background report to the press and described the chancellor selection process as tainted the mayor was wrong at that point it was not the process that was tainted it was his candidate but soon the mayor would taint the process as well on friday evening , the board of education voted 4 to 3 to offer the chancellor s post to daniel a domenech , the district superintendent for western suffolk county mayor giuliani immediately declared war on dr domenech , proclaiming loudly that he was unacceptable , and making it clear that he would treat him as miserably as he had treated the outgoing chancellor , ramon cortines the mayor spent the next 24 hours doing all in his considerable power to sabotage dr domenech s candidacy it was an extraordinary expenditure of energy toward a negative end the board of education member from staten island , jerry f cammarata , had no idea his arm could be twisted so hard he changed his vote , which meant dr domenech was out before he ever got in the school system was once again in chaos mr cortines , who did a heck of a job under incredibly trying circumstances , is scheduled to leave within two weeks after that , who knows \? anyone who truly wants the chancellor s job under the current circumstances should be given a psychiatric examination as for mayor giuliani , his behavior has gone far beyond unacceptable try unconscionable he has no candidate and he never had a candidate who was better for the schoolchildren than mr cortines this longrunning fiasco is not about improving the schools it is about the emotional and professional immaturity of mayor giuliani his lust for absolute control , his inability to work with others , his refusal to acknowledge that there are views besides his own that might have merit there are a million pupils in the school system , but their concerns are not the mayor s his vision of the school system is roughly the equivalent of willie sutton s view of banks that s where the money is mr giuliani is already balancing a significant portion of his budget on the backs of schoolchildren who are jammed into buildings that are short on classroom space , short on books , short on computers , short on guidance counselors , short on extracurricular activities you get the idea the children need those problems addressed , but what they are receiving instead are huge doses of political cynicism mr giuliani s search is for a puppet chancellor who would be willing to bleed ever more millions from the schools increasing numbers of parents and concerned educators are catching on to the mayor s education scam he has talked constantly about change but when he offered leon goldstein as his choice to succeed ramon cortines , it became clear that what he meant was a change for the worse
five senior boys at greenwich high school in connecticut concocted a message of racial hatred and slipped it in code form into the yearbook , where its discovery has cast a pall over yearend festivities and thoughts of commencement , school officials said yesterday the five are believed to have conspired months ago to plant the message , each using a word or portion of a word , which , taken together , spell out kill all niggers the five have been suspended and , unless they successfully appeal to the school superintendent , dr john whritner , will be barred from taking final exams , which start today , and from commencement on tuesday the incident has caused outrage and sadness among the 2 , 000 students at the high school , the teachers and administrators , and in greenwich , one of the wealthiest communities in one of the wealthiest states in the nation a coeditor of the yearbook , erica friedlander , said yesterday , i would hope that no one would even think something like that , let alone put it in a yearbook all five boys denied involvement when they appeared in the principal s office yesterday to hear that they had been suspended officials said each of the five included a segment of the hate message in the material he submitted to be printed beneath his picture each of the segments appeared at the end of the yearbook salutations , not unlike those that generations of american high school students have written to one another keith dianis began his message , heaven does n't want me , and hell is afraid i'm gonna take over after other comments , he then wrote a string of initials and seemingly inside jokes , ending with the word kill the second student , patrick fox , began in similar fashion , ending his message all the next three students , ed oberbeck , robert texiere and aaron valenti , followed suit , ended their messages with the letters ni , gg and ers , respectively the message , spread out over several pages , is in alphabetical order by the students' last names dr whritner said he had heard that word of the message spread yesterday only after at least one of the boys had boasted of it it s not the kind of thing you 'd pick out , the superintendent said the school s principal , dr elaine petruzillo , said efforts were under way to retrieve the 1 , 400 or so copies of the yearbook , titled compass , and reprint them without the offending message the cost could be 20 , 000 or more , she said yesterday alluding to the sorrow the incident has caused , she said , i am sure the community will find the money teachers and staff members prepared a statement that was to be printed today in the greenwich time it reads in part , we the faculty and staff of greenwich high school share with our students the pain and anguish caused by the apparent use of our school yearbook to express racial bigotry and hate students voiced similar reactions yesterday i think people were shamed , said steve fuzesi , editor in chief of the school paper this is not the mainstream view of students at greenwich high school it s a minority it s a divisive way to end an otherwise unblemished year another student , christiana phillips , said she was so disturbed that she telephoned local television and radio stations i am outraged , she said yesterday dr whritner and dr petruzillo both expressed sadness that the incident is associated with a class that , in the superintendent s words , has done the most to work at diversity in the community and keeping people talking to each other our concern is for the 500plus graduates who had nothing to do with this and do n't find it funny , dr petruzillo said dr whritner said the graduating class had organized a diversity week earlier in the school term people from minority groups , including holocaust survivors , shared their experiences with students , the superintendent said dr whritner acknowledged the image of greenwich as an enclave of the rich , but he said that the community also has three lowerincome housing projects he added that the ethnic makeup of the town s students has changed , from about 3 percent of minoritygroup students 20 years ago to 19 percent now the proportion of black students has remained about the same , 3 percent , over the two decades , he said , but the proportion of asian and hispanic students has grown markedly , with each group making up 8 percent of the student body dr petruzillo said she met with about 25 black students , along with some staff members and teachers , yesterday in a session that produced expressions of regret and grief she declined to describe the five accused students in detail , except to say that none were outstanding and that none had had any serious disciplinary problems until now dr whritner said the suspended students could appeal to him , but that unless they could produce compelling evidence that this was some print shop accident or something he would not rescind the suspensions we 're not looking at apologies now , he said this is extremely serious , and we 're treating it seriously he said the greenwich police had been notified joyce mckenzie , a native of jamaica who formed the coalition for justice in greenwich after a police incident with racial overtones last july , said her daughter , eve , had heard that some of the five boys were bragging of the stunt , and that it tainted her daughter s joy in ending her freshman year we are for fair treatment for everybody , black , white , pink , purple , ms mckenzie said the yearbook s coeditor , miss friedlander , said she and other editors had deleted portions of some messages they considered in questionable taste , but we ca n't go through and pick everyone s quote apart as for prejudice among students , she said she had experienced some because she is jewish , but i 've also had a lot of my nonjewish friends stick up for me photo the last word or letters of the yearbook entries of five greenwich high school seniors can be read as a coded message of racial hatred \( pg b6 \)
washington , sept 20 the 52 billion tax bill that the house ways and means committee approved late tuesday was largely advertised as an effort to shut down unwarranted corporate tax breaks and , as the panel s chairman said , end business as usual in the capitol and it would , in fact , knot many loopholes but like tax measures passed by the democratic regime before it , the republican bill turns out to do a lot of other things , too the provisions will be incorporated in a larger spending bill , a reconciliation package , whose own future is uncertain nor is it clear whether many of the proposals will survive in a conference with the senate to resolve differences with its reconciliation bill well over half of the billions of dollars that the measure would raise , for deficit reduction and other purposes , come not from closing business loopholes but from elsewhere about 19 billion comes from trimming the earnedincome tax credit for poor working households about 10 billion stems from a change in pension law that critics say would actually give corporations a windfall of 20 billion or more many of the remaining changes would end tax breaks that affect uniquely democratic constituencies they include trial lawyers , hollywood movie makers and even a onetime political supporter of president clinton , tyson foods , an arkansasbased chicken empire and while a handful of other provisions would eliminate tax breaks for certain businesses , they have the practical effect of benefiting those businesses' competitors in particular , the legislation would wipe out tax breaks for several competitors of the petroleum industry the artful craftsmanship of the tax measure , which was debated and approved mostly in evening sessions , left democrats sputtering in anger representatives sam m gibbons of florida and charles b rangel of manhattan , the panel s two most senior democrats , charged that the real targets of the bill were middle and lowerincome working americans , not businesses and president clinton said the measure was inconsistent with those basic , bedrock values this country should be standing for but representative bill archer , the texas republican who heads the committee , dismissed those accusations during and after hearings on the bill this week his spokesman , ari fleischer , said today that mr archer had drafted the tax provisions with an eye to updating and modernizing the code , not to political loss or gain i 'll tell you this , he said none of those changes were the result of lobbying mr archer sprang those by surprise he did indeed when republicans began writing the legislation earlier this summer , its biggest provision would have pared about 14 billion from the earnedincome tax credit for the working poor when mr archer , a solid defender of corporate tax preferences , announced last week that he had also included 27 tax changes that would raise 30 billion from corporations by the year 2002 , it created a minor sensation but along the way , the reduction in the earnedincome credit grew by 5 billion , to 19 billion , mostly by phasing out the credit more quickly as poor families' incomes grow democrats have focused their attacks on that rise but mr fleischer said today that republicans chose to reduce the credit by a greater amount rather than raise money in two other unpleasant ways requiring spouses to help pay the cost of tracking down fathers who do not pay child support , or reducing unemployment compensation in truth , he said , the reduction in the tax credit is not a change in the tax code , but a spending cut , because almost all the credit goes to families in the form of checks , not as breaks on their taxes the bill s greatest effect on taxes , he said , is in those changes that apply to corporations the bill approved by the ways and means committee does attack some breaks that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past for instance , it would raise 31 billion over seven years by gradually eliminating a credit that benefited pharmaceutical and electronics companies that established plants in puerto rico and it would raise another 7 billion by ending a fiercely defended tax deduction for loans on corporateowned lifeinsurance policies but democrats see another method in the committee s actions today they noted that the bill would eliminate several tax credits and breaks for ethanol , wind energy , biomass and energy conservation , while leaving untouched the volumes of tax preferences enjoyed by the oil and gas business that is centered in mr archer s home state mr fleischer rejected any implication that mr archer had played favorites , arguing that petroleum companies enjoyed no tax credits like the ones mr archer targeted democrats also argued that the measure unduly affected their political allies the bill would raise some 390 million over seven years by taxing all punitive damages and emotional distress awards in lawsuits , a provision that the association of trial lawyers of america , a bedrock supporter of democratic causes , labeled an attack on ordinary americans' legal rights it would eliminate the tax credit for construction of lowincome housing , a democratic cause , saving 35 billion it would raise another 204 million by tightening the rules by which some businesses many of them entertainment companies calculate their depreciation of the costs of products like movies whose profits must be estimated and it would gradually eliminate a tax break for certain large farm corporations , including major poultry producers like tyson the single largest moneyraiser , however , does not close a corporate tax break it would relax rules that allowed corporations to withdraw excess money from employee pension accounts only for specific purposes , and often after paying a 34 percent corporate tax and a penalty of up to 50 percent

art for the olympics as director of the national gallery of art in washington for 22 years , j carter brown earned a reputation for staging blockbuster extravaganzas crowdpleasing exhibitions like 1492 art in the age of exploration and treasure houses of britain now mr brown , who retired from the national gallery in 1992 , is bringing this same popular approach to the olympics with just his personal charisma instead of the loan leverage he had at the national gallery , he has put together a huge exhibition that will be the linchpin of the 1996 olympics arts festival in atlanta more than 125 paintings and sculptures spanning 75 centuries will represent every major part of the world details of the show were announced at a news conference at the united nations on monday evening using the olympic rings as its symbol , rings five passions in world art will focus on five universal emotions love , anguish , awe , triumph and joy the concept was to find a subject that would be truly global , mr brown said the show , with a 3 million budget , will run from july 4 through sept 29 at the high museum of art in atlanta rather than simply hang an exhibition of greatest hits , mr brown is mixing wellknown and obscure objects from diverse cultures and times in the section about love , for example , works like rodin s kiss \( 1886 \) from the rodin museum in paris and brancusi s kiss \( 19071908 \) from the museum of art in craiova , romania , will be displayed with the cleveland museum of art s 11thcentury relief sculpture from the khajuraho area of india , depicting a man and woman in a passionate embrace , and a 10thcentury chinese hand scroll from the palace museum in taipei in addition to littleknown works like polynesian spirit figures , eskimo art and mexican ceramics , there will be many familiar images , among them munch s scream \( 1893 \) , monet s woman with a parasol \( 1875 \) and matisse s dance \( ii \) , the 19091910 version that is in the state hermitage museum in st petersburg rather than the conventional audiotape guide to the art , the show is to have its own soundtrack , prepared by leon botstein , the conductor and president of bard college in annandaleonhudson , ny there s no stronger way of reinforcing emotions than with music , mr brown said the details have not all been worked out yet , he added , but the hope is that the catalogue and free pamphlets will provide visitors with enough information to view the art , so that rather than preaching , as he put it , the museum will offer a tape of the soundtrack for rent \( not surprisingly , the soundtrack will also be for sale \) bamboo and peace an eightmonth fight over the fate of the public atrium in the former ibm building at madison avenue and 56th street has ended the 10 , 000squarefoot space , known for its bamboo trees , reopened yesterday as a sculpture garden edward j minskoff , the developer who acquired the building from ibm last year , received approval from the city planning commission to convert the space into a public sculpture garden , managed by pace wildenstein , the madison avenue gallery pace will organize the shows and collaborate with an advisory panel that includes susan k freedman , president of the public art fund , and michael govan , director of the dia center for the arts \( ibm provided the public space when it erected the building , in exchange for zoning concessions from the city \) some groups , like the municipal arts society , opposed the plan , arguing that having a commercial gallery organize the shows would compromise the public nature of the space , even with the stipulation that none of the art is for sale it s a tough pill to swallow , said brendan sexton , the new president of the municipal arts society this was one of the few successful public spaces in the city why destroy it \? why encourage public spaces with such a commercial operation \? what s next , someone who wants to display their fall clothing line in public \? but for mr minskoff , himself a collector of contemporary art , the city planning commission and pace wildenstein , it s an opportunity for the public to enjoy art the space , which was renovated by the architect robert a m stern , now has eight works , including pieces by alexander calder , roy lichtenstein and jean dubuffet this is a very good thing for the city , said joseph b rose , the city planning commissioner only three trees came down , and there s more seating than there was before mr minskoff , who said that 60 million people a year pass by the building , has also placed saurien , a 1975 calder sculpture , on the corner outside the atrium marc glimcher of pace wildenstein , who said the gallery was planning four exhibitions a year , pointed out that not all the artists involved were represented by pace wildenstein marc di suvero and mr lichtenstein , for instance , are represented by other manhattan dealers this is a great opportunity for dealers to work together , mr glimcher suggested it s great public relations in the longterm sense many of these works have been sitting in warehouses , so it s wonderful that the public has the chance to enjoy them it s also important to stress the education component here educating the public is the very foundation of the art market americana in brooklyn the brooklyn museum has received a grant of 50 , 000 from the museum program of the national endowment for the arts , the largest of 88 awarded this month , to support the reinstallation of the museum s collection of american painting and sculpture the money will also help develop educational programs and a catalogue this takes the sting off the terrible feelings of depression and pain from the severe cuts the nea has suffered , said robert t buck , the museum s director photo a detail of matisse s dance \( ii \) , which will be on view inatlanta during the 1996 olympics \( high museum of art \)

ilidza , bosnia and herzegovina , nov 26 the redrawing of the boundaries of sarajevo , clean and neat on the conference table , is the most contentious part of the balkan peace agreement , one that threatens to draw nato troops into the kinds of firefights american officials desperately hope to avoid demoralized bosnian serb leaders said today that the united states sponsored agreement , initialed in dayton , ohio , last week , had led to a disintegration of their authority over a bitter , wellarmed populace that regards the accord as a betrayal in sarajevo , angry groups of young men have started to stone and flip over united nations vehicles passing through serbian sections of the city police and security forces prevented one public demonstration today in this serbian suburb , fearing that it could turn violent , but said they were not sure that they could prevent another protest called for tuesday and senior serbian leaders said that if the multinational force tried to carry out the agreement , which calls for serbs in several sarajevo neighborhoods to disarm and accept bosnian government rule , they would be unable to prevent bloodshed what is wrong with the dayton agreement , the bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , said today , is that it has created a new beirut in europe it is going to bleed for decades top serb commanders and political leaders have been holding daily meetings with dr karadzic , including one that ended at 4 00 am today , in a desperate bid to find another way to redraw the city boundaries we will still fight , said nedjeljko prstajevic , the mayor of ilidza , his voice quivering with emotion and if the multinational force tries to drive us from our homes , or take away our right to defend ourselves , there will be no authority on earth , including the serbian authorities , that can stop us we will not leave we will not withdraw and we will not live under muslim rule the city , carved up between serbian and government troops , has seen some of the most vicious fighting in nearly four years of war the housetohouse battles , deadly sniper fire and heavy shelling have consumed thousands of lives just as the palestinians and the jews claim jerusalem as their capital , the serbs and the muslims are locked in a deadly fight for sarajevo , a symbol of national identity to both sides today , sarajevo s confrontation lines are marked by gutted homes and factories , rusted hulks of cars and buses , and other dreary debris of war and the hundreds of graves that dot many neighborhoods like open wounds are a powerful and irrational draw toward more violence and intolerance the nato operation is billed as one in which superior western firepower will obliterate any obstacles but it increasingly appears that the 60 , 000 troops of the natoled force will not be threatened by organized resistance , but by angry women and children , lone snipers and renegade bands of armed men determined to thwart a plan that would drive them from their homes and negate all they have fought to achieve most of the resistance will probably come from the serbs , who have lost the most territory with this agreement , united nations peacekeepers said the problem is that the best plans on paper have to be implemented on the ground , said michael clark , director for the center for defense studies , in a telephone interview from london and there , things never seem as clean training can never anticipate the unexpected what are these troops going to do when an old lady in a house refuses to leave to make way for its original residents \? we are talking about a west bank scenario people will have to be physically moved there will be a lot of problems the ohio agreement permits those who were driven from their homes to return but there is no mechanism for determining who will gain property rights or how disputes will be settled when the war broke out in 1991 , many muslim families who lived in the outlying districts of sarajevo were driven into the city as serbs grabbed their homes while the bosnian government never unleashed a campaign of ethnic cleansing in sarajevo , many serbs nevertheless fled the city under the peace agreement , many people will be allowed to return to their original homes , but it is unlikely that the serbs will agree to live under bosnian government rule or that muslims will want to move back into areas that are predominantly serbian united nations officials said that they expect nato to initiate regional or neighborhood meetings to try to settle the complex claims and counterclaims that are sure to complicate the agreement but as yet no mechanism has been established to sort out property disputes serbian forces are scheduled to begin a monthlong retreat from their strongholds around sarajevo after the natoled operation takes over operations in bosnia , probably in middecember if the agreement takes hold , the approximately 60 , 000 serbs living in central suburbs of grbavica , ilidza , hadzici , vogosca , and ilijas , will find themselves , within 120 days , governed by the muslimcroat federation that they once fought the surrounding towns of lukavica , kasindo and pale , the serb s selfstyled capital , will remain in serbian hands
the images of arthur fiedler that endure , more than 15 years after his death , are not those of a veteran conductor standing before an august orchestra , wielding a baton they are those of an avuncular santa claus leaning on a mantel , a highstepping cancan dancer flanked by gartered women , a goldsuited toreador with a scarlet cape , a minkcoated rake posing before 1920 s flappers , a red , white and blue uncle sam with top hat and cane vaudevillian images of mr pops at play , on the jackets of the more than 50 million of his records that have been sold it may have been such images that prevented me from ever giving mr fiedler s boston pops recordings more than a casual glance kitsch and camp , they seemed to proclaim , with choices of repertory to match copland s hoedown , mozart s sleigh ride , puccini s humming chorus , the pizzicato polka , stars and stripes forever , give my regards to broadway and moon river it did not help that fiedler appeared to cultivate a costumeparty approach toward music and life he loved dressing up as a fireman , was an honorary fire chief in 300 cities around the world and had a hookup at home so the boston fire department could notify him of major blazes now , in honor of fiedler s 100th birthday last december , bmg classics has released 100 fiedler favorites , on seven cd s arthur fiedler the collection , on three cd s , and a disk featuring the fiedler sinfonietta , a chamber orchestra he founded in 1924 and recently his daughter , joanna fiedler , wrote a wry , unsentimental and revealing book , arthur fiedler papa , the pops and me so it is time for a critic once blinded , like so many others , by what fiedler called damned snobbism to give him his due fiedler s financial and popular success was inarguable he was probably the profitmaking arm of the boston symphony , which somewhat reluctantly renamed itself the boston pops after completing its classical season his ideas about programming helped create the pops industry in this country but his musical achievements set a high standard , one that no contemporary pops conductor can match none of this will come as news to those who followed fiedler s career with the boston pops , which began in 1930 or attended the outdoor esplanade concerts in boston , which were among his pioneering efforts in alfresco symphonic music , or sipped drinks during intermissions of pops concerts , which were broadcast on public television from 1970 on he was a remarkable musician in his hands , waltzes , polkas and marches breathed with life \( he toured europe in 1912 as a violinist in an orchestra conducted by johann strauss 3d \) he obsessively studied scores and achieved absolute clarity as a result even the most over orchestrated pop song is performed with astonishing transparency in the context of pops concerts , fiedler was also adventurous , leading the american premieres of walton s facade and khachaturian s violin concerto , and the boston premiere of a shostakovich piano concerto for a time , he programmed more mozart piano concertos than the boston symphony did individual disks in 100 fiedler favorites are devoted to the classic fiedler genres orchestral spectaculars \( including rossini s william tell overture \) , quiet classics \( brahms s lullaby \) , viennese waltzes \( tales from the vienna woods \) , marches \( victor herbert s march of the toys \) and american classics \( copland s salon mexico \) the music is played with great affection and technical accomplishment little is overstated or made unduly sentimental only the disk of popsong transcriptions offers reasons to cringe the early fiedler recordings with his sinfonietta are also impressive restrained , finely shaped and insightful the problem is that fiedler stepped over a fault line in american culture that is still in place once he took on the pops , ms fiedler writes , he forfeited any hope of being regarded as a serious musician a guestconducting stint with the boston symphony was canceled in 1944 , when serge koussevitsky , the orchestra s music director , heard that fiedler had taken part in a concert by frank sinatra michael steinberg , a former program annotator of the boston symphony , told boston magazine in 1973 that the orchestra treated fiedler as a sort of lowlife who had to be taken seriously only because he was a cash cow ms fiedler argues persuasively that the symphony management let papa go out on a limb and earn a fortune for the orchestra , but they scorned him for the way he earned that money , and he understood how they felt fiedler himself was torn , at one moment defending the virtue of the pops \( do we all have to face music with our hands in our hair and bowed down with eyes closed \? thank god i have a taste for everything \) , at another yearning for more \( i suppose every clown wants to play hamlet \) in ms fiedler s account this conflict led to tragic unhappiness but fiedler s achievement should have been sufficient he did not condescend to his audience he took the music seriously , which is to say , he took it playfully the pops repertory , almost by definition , consists of music in which roleplaying , masquerade , dance and sensation are the focuses of attention fiedler understood his costumes verged on kitsch , but often enough they served the art photo arthur fiedler , shown circa 1974 , yearned for more i suppose every clown wants to play hamlet \( tony esparza \)
for much of its history , college point was an underdeveloped community off flushing bay , with many vacant , swampy sections its corporate park , along the whitestone expressway , was always searching for tenants despite its proximity to highways and bridges for years , we waited for people to discover it , said the queens borough president , claire shulman now everyone wants to locate there at least six companies are vying for the space left over inside the park , and sites elsewhere in the community have also attracted a variety of development plans but not all the plans are enjoying a warm reception in particular , a recent proposal by the city s department of corrections to open a center where 80 , 000 meals a day would be prepared and shipped to the city s jails has stirred up serious opposition 1 , 000 people showed up at a public meeting recently to protest locating the mega kitchen in college point two other sites are also under consideration the opposition underlines the tensions brought on by the area s swiftgrowing popularity until the late 1980 s , college point and its corporate park \( once called an industrial park \) were home to light industries and warehouses then offices began locating there , including a postal office and an office of the department of motor vehicles retailers arrived besides waldbaum s , home depot is preparing a site now , and shopping clubs , like pricecostco , are lobbying for spots unfortunately , all this development came piecemeal , and no one looked at the entire impact , said tony avella , president of the joint community council of college point , an umbrella organization of 24 local groups the result is that you have terrible traffic in college point , no buffer zones separating residential from commercial areas the food preparation center , mr avella said , was especially troublesome because it would not be in the corporate park , but in college point s western section , far from the expressway to make deliveries breakfast , lunch , dinner trucks would have to go through narrow , residential streets , he said the site being considered is on 111th street , north of 14th avenue , at a plant now owned by edo corp , a military supplier of sonar equipment and ejection systems for jets because of defense budget cutbacks , the company is reducing its operations and would like to sell its center to the food contractor , said michael hegarty , edo s vice president of finance by september , the city must comply with a 1979 federal consent order and improve the food served to jail inmates the corrections department is reviewing proposals by independent contractors at three sites college point and jamaica in queens , and hunts point in the bronx tom kelly , a spokesman for the corrections department , said that none of the three sites is yet favored meanwhile , officials in the bronx have been lobbying hard for the food preparation center the executive director of the hunts point local development corporation , josephine infante , even attended the college point public meeting , at st fidelis church , to tell residents that the bronx wanted the center she explained that a contractor has proposed transforming a vacant alexander s distribution center in the hunts point industrial park although the meat and produce markets in hunts point are full , the industrial park suffers from a rising vacancy rate the rate is now at 15 percent , she said , because hunts point has lost corporate tenants to new jersey and westchester we already have the food suppliers , the trucks and the paper products suppliers , everything you need for the food center , ms infante said and hunts point needs the 400 new jobs from the food center this would be a tremendous benefit to our area norimitsu onishi photo the neighborhood around the edo corp is quiet for now \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)
nine months after governor whitman presented a plan to withhold state aid from school districts that overspend on administration , the state department of education has announced a new round of penalties unless they cut administrative costs by july , 73 districts will lose a combined 103 million in the 199697 school year under the governor s school efficiency program , any district that spends more than 29 percent above the state median on noninstructional costs including administrators , clerical staff , professional services and building maintenance is penalized some districts have protested the penalties , but the response has been muted compared to what happened last january , when the program was introduced so many districts complained about the short notice that mrs whitman agreed to delay the program until the 199697 school year she also changed the definition of administrative expenses to exclude librarians , guidance counselors and nurses but the adjustment did not decrease the number of penalized districts in fact , it increased by 10 the penalties ranged from 2 , 440 in mannington , a tiny salem county district , to 39 million in newark bergen county had the largest number of penalities , while other counties , including mercer and middlesex , had none many on the first list found themselves in trouble again this month , despite efforts to cut spending others that evaded penalties earlier this year were not so lucky this time here , administrators from three districts facing penalties discuss their efforts to cut costs and their opinions of the program hudson county vocational vocational districts were among the hardest hit in this round of penalties , with five districts facing a combined 14 million loss the hudson county vocationaltechnical district stands to lose 515 , 000 but frank gargiulo , the district superintendent , said that amount is totally out of line when the state calculated the district s perpupil spending , he said , it did not count the 1 , 800 adults who attend night school there those students make up 60 percent of the district s 3 , 000 students , he said every other year , those pupils were counted , mr gargiulo said all of a sudden , trenton decides they should n't be included last year , the district s spending was well below the state median , mr gargiulo said he has already appealed to the education department , and he seemed confident that the district would not lose the entire amount even if that s true , why penalize us in the first place and embarrass the district \? he said this suggests to me that the people in trenton do n't see the urban vocational schools as being worth anything livingston this affluent essex county district , with 4 , 100 students in kindergarten through 12th grade , would have lost 12 million in the first round of penalties this time , the news was better livingston s penalty was reduced by almost half , to 685 , 000 but it was still the thirdhighest penalty in the state , and as a suburban district that has already lost state aid , livingston faces a struggle daniel swirsky , the assistant business manager , said the district cut administrative spending by about 600 , 000 this year by eliminating and consolidating several positions he said livingston s penalty remained high partly because the state median for administrative spending in k12 districts dropped this year from 1 , 700 to about 1 , 000 \( livingston , with a 50 million budget , spends about 1 , 600 per student on administrative costs \) the district has not decided whether to appeal the penalty , but dr swirsky said it would be hard pressed to make further cuts red bank this monmouth county district , with 900 students in kindergarten through eighth grade , has scrambled to reduce administrative costs since february its penalty for next year is 53 , 000 , compared to about 150 , 000 last time bruce quinn , the acting superintendent , said the district would probably qualify for a refund in the 199798 school year , because it has cut 70 , 000 from its administrative budget red bank changed a fulltime administrative position to two parttime jobs , saving 25 , 000 since the district superintendent left last spring , mr quinn has acted as both superintendent and business manager , saving another 45 , 000 mr quinn said the adjustments were fairly painless , but he contended that the penalty system was unfair and that forced regionalization of small districts would be a better solution red bank has tried to regionalize with two neighboring districts , but its large population of poor students has scared off the other , wealthier districts , he said if the legislature had the political courage , they would take the bull by the horns and mandate regionalization , mr quinn said chart the bad news under the school efficiency program signed into law by governor whitman , all districts whose administrative spending is more than 29 percent above the state median will suffer a loss of aid in the 199697 school year here are average fines for districts in each category kindergarten through 6th grade 17 districts 22 , 809 average penalty kindergarten through 8th grade 36 districts 34 , 284 average penalty kindergarten through 12th grade 12 districts 384 , 791 average penalty vocationaltechnical districts 5 districts 280 , 950 average penalty average does not include newark \( 3 , 962 , 226 \) or atlantic city \( 1 , 091 , 896 \)
newington , conn , july 28 ten casino operators and development groups passed easy tests this week in the competition for rights to build a casino in bridgeport , filing notice that they intended to bid , and showing up today for a conference with the state officials who will review the bids the real test , stock analysts say , comes in three weeks , when bidders must submit their proposals along with letters of credit for 610 million to cover the revenue the state would lose over the next three years if the mashantucket pequots carried out their threat to cut off payments from their foxwoods casino as soon as a bridgeport casino is authorized several analysts predicted that unless the state relaxes that steep financial requirement , it will end up with no bids but developers , given the opportunity today to question state officials about the credit requirement and other aspects of the bidding , offered no clues to their concerns carloads of lawyers and executives arrived for the meeting eight people from mirage resorts , seven from carnival hotels and casinos , three each from trump hotels and casino resorts and the pequots 33 in all from the 10 potential bidders but after the state s evaluation team announced that it would respond to all questions in writing , not one was asked what i think happened in the room was a bit of a poker game , joseph p ganim , mayor of bridgeport and a strong casino advocate , said afterward the developers felt that if their questions were n't going to be answered immediately , why give away their concerns to the competition \? i think that s a good sign standing in the searing parking lot of the division of special revenue after the fiveminute meeting , none of the developers would comment on the state s request for the 610 million letter of credit , an amount that would , for example , lock up 60 percent of mirage resorts' current billiondollar credit line while it is proceeding with new projects in atlantic city and las vegas they wanted the questions in writing , richard d bronson , a mirage resorts director , said simply as he hurried out he had complained earlier that the credit requirements were too stringent john f droney jr , a hartford lawyer representing donald trump , said only the trump organization is looking at the situation very closely obviously it s a lot of money , and there s always the specter of lawsuits that might hold the casino up stock analysts said gov john g rowland s insistence that the winning bidder guarantee the state 610 million over the next three years while a bridgeport casino is built could kill the interest of everyone except the pequots who could guarantee that revenue simply by not cutting off their payments from foxwoods tom shandell , an analyst with bear stearns in manhattan , said you have 150 million payable in the first year , 230 million a year after that , and those are minimum requirements the developers have to meet without any guarantee as to when they can open the casino if a lawsuit delayed construction , mr shandell added , conceivably the developers could find themselves writing checks for a whole lot more than 610 million , and that s something they ca n't live with if the governor sticks to his guns , you probably wo n't find any proposals at the end of the day once a bridgeport casino was operating , its revenue would be taxed at a rate of 16 percent to 21 percent , the highest casino tax in the nation mr rowland s goal of fully guaranteeing connecticut s casino revenue , which the pequots agreed to pay in return for a monopoly on slot machines , overlooks the needs of casino operators , who must finance other projects while also satisfying shareholders , said david liebowitz , an analyst with burnham securities in manhattan the corporations that have expressed interest would find it very difficult to meet the state s requirement while putting the numbers up on the board for their shareholders until the casino opens , he said the 10 potential bidders are mirage trump carnival bally entertainment circus circus itt sheraton the pequots mamaho international , a combine of connecticut tribes the golden hill paugussett tribe , and a connecticut businessman , joseph e lazeren earlier this year , when governor rowland asked the pequots if they were interested in building a casino in bridgeport , a world away from their rural reservation in eastern connecticut , the tribe said no today , however , they sent three representatives , including michael brown , foxwoods' chief executive asked why the pequots might now be interested , he said , connecticut is a wonderful state and bridgeport is a wonderful city , and kept walking
moscow , june 6 the west has the impression that russia is rancid with crime , that gangs rule the streets , that few people are safe from a postsoviet horde of muggers , murderers , racketeers and thieves in moscow , where gangland killings have a cinematic brutality , russians have the same impression , and the perception of growing criminality , corruption and instability is associated in many minds with democracy and a market economy the reality , however , is less nightmarish than the perception but that does n't stop tatyana fyodorovna , a 41yearold businesswoman , from walking home from the subway at night with her keys between her fingers like brass knuckles or viktor klimenko or his wife from meeting their 17yearold daughter at the subway station at dusk to walk her home or irina dezhina , a 32yearold scientist , from bolting her new steel door with five locks people have to protect themselves , said oleg brukhis , 30 , who works at a moscow barber shop the police occasionally round up a few hooligans and detain them overnight , but our police are lawless have you once heard of any big criminals being apprehended here \? attitudes like these have important political consequences for russia s future , giving the old communist days a retrospective soft focus of stability and order although crime went up sharply after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , as it did throughout the countries of eastern europe , it is now leveling off or falling here the important exceptions are murders , new economic crimes like bank fraud and protection rackets , and official corruption with officials often suspected of complicity in covering up major crimes compared with new york , moscow is not especially crimeridden but there have been more spectacularly violent crimes the russian murder rate has surged , largely because of gang shootouts and contract killings of prominent businessmen and criminal leaders , and there has been an increase in crimes committed with a firearm before , we confiscated a handgun once a week , said mikhail p andreyev , head of the investigation agency for organized crime of the interior ministry now we confiscate arsenals most of these big crimes involve businessmen fighting over territory or settling scores , officials say the situation is exacerbated by a weak legal system and the lack of a body of corporate law the killing in march of a beloved television host and executive , vladislav listyev , brought thousands of muscovites into the streets as a protest against crime three members of parliament have died in businessrelated killings , in addition to 35 bankers and at least one prominent journalist , dmitri kholodov in april , in another especially horrible case , the 6yearold daughter of a leading russian stockbroker , andrei orekhov , was killed on her way to kindergarten when his car was riddled with machinegun bullets by two gunmen in broad daylight mr orekhov , 29 , the general director of a major brokerage house , was seriously wounded his bodyguard and driver survived with minor injuries none of these prominent killings have yet been solved , even though the federal counterintelligence service , formerly the domestic side of the kgb and now renamed the federal security service , with new powers , says it knows some of the culprits of the 47 contract killings last year in moscow alone , the police say they have solved only 11 but number of reported murders was the only category of crime in which this capital of some 10 million people outranked new york city , a city of more than 7 million , in 1994 last year , compared with moscow , new york had 83 times the number of reported rapes and 131 times the number of reported assaults after having quadrupled between 1988 and 1992 , the total of all crime in russia went down 6 percent last year by far the largest number of crimes involve property , but the police are making some inroads , helped by new precautions , like better locks , steel doors and car alarms thefts were down 17 percent , thefts from apartments were down 14 percent , and robberies in general were down 19 percent in moscow , incidents of rape , assaults , robberies and property crimes were all down last year crime figures in general are viewed with skepticism throughout the world , and some experts on russian crime , like joseph d serio of eurasian business services , suggest that russian statistics are massaged to make them seem better russian officials , like aleksandr y birin , director of the inspection section of the investigation department of the interior ministry , reject the notion , while acknowledging that figures were heavily doctored in soviet days of course , this creates a problem of perception , mr birin said the soviet days were not as calm as they seemed , and by comparison , today is not as awful yuri levada , director of the center for the study of public opinion , said of course people are concerned with crime , even more than in past years but when we do our polls and ask people whether they or any family members have been victims of crime , they tell us , no more sometimes even less than in the past the images of violent crime come mostly from the mass media
to the editor mr deutch gets cabinet rank \( editorial , march 14 \) stresses the need for the president to be provided with disinterested intelligence analysis we agree one of the bases of solid analysis is knowing the facts and doing one s homework indeed , that s not bad advice for those in the world of intelligence , law or , for that matter , journalism your editorial is replete with statements that are inaccurate , misleading and dead wrong you imply that not much has changed in the world of intelligence , either in reductions or missions for the record , by 1993 the central intelligence agency allocated 13 percent of its resources to the former soviet union that figure will decline to less than 10 percent by fiscal year 1996 in terms of overall reductions , former director r james woolsey , in his last appearance before the senate select committee in january , reiterated that the cia will reduce personnel by 23 percent in this decade , nearly double the target that most of the rest of the government has been striving to reach under the national performance review i assure you that none of our analysts could ever get away with using numbers the way you have done we agree that the cold war is over , the soviet union has imploded , and the pieces of the berlin wall are scattered in museums throughout the world can we agree that the time has come for your caricature of the intelligence community to be left behind as well \? i am convinced we would all benefit if the spirited and public debate about the role of intelligence were freed of the pat phrases and stale musings that unfortunately still dominate your coverage of intelligence \( adm \) william o studeman acting director of central intelligence washington , march 21 , 1995
phil jackson stretched his long legs onto the court from the front row at madison square garden and wondered out loud what the fuss was all about you got these chairs that are right on the floor , said the chicago bulls' coach you got this place filled every game it s a hot ticket i remember we won our first playoff series here five years ago half the place was bulls' fans well , michael jordan fans , in those prechampionship days but jackson s point was that the prepat riley garden was a place where the opposition typically supplied the fireworks , where one playoff series was a deep religious experience , where the most fascinating matchups usually involved the warring knicks' general manager and coach jackson was saying that while riley s knicks certainly could be better , they could also be much , much worse jackson was , in effect , defending riley , his foremost coaching rival and favorite human dartboard these last few years my , how the mighty have mellowed it s been nice to come back here and see the game doing so well , jackson , the old knick , said when he obviously was in a benevolent mood , before his fading bulls blew a 22point lead and lost to the knicks , 9389 jackson , of course , has his own doubleedged sword , his own mediation between the forces of expectation and reality a rich recent past , a new soldout arena , but no more jordan , no more horace grant , no more championship dream , even if hue hollins should grant scottie pippen a thousand makeup calls for hubert davis last spring that wo n't happen either and last night , davis did n't need charity , as his 3pointer from the top of the key , set up by a crunching charles oakley screen on pete myers , helped silence , temporarily , the knicks' prophets of doom at least jackson and the bulls have three championship banners on which to cushion their fall riley s knicks have none , and the panic is setting in now that they will never deliver the title they apparently owe new york like some kind of monthly mortgage payment they are n't good enough , or they 've never been good enough , or they would 've been good enough if the coach was n't such a tyrant the knicks , it was reported yesterday , have even been passing the word around the league that riley works them too hard , makes them play hurt , does n't care if he shortens their careers , as long as they bleed to the last drop it was time to see if riley could practice selfdefense , as well as he preaches team defense when i came here , i did expect at times personal criticism and a lack of appreciation for what the team has done , so that does n't bother me , riley said in his office before the game but then ridicule becomes part of the whole thing , and i do get upset by things that are blatantly and flagrantly untrue i do care about my players i do n't play people hurt i care about their careers as for working them too hard , he added if i'm classified as a dinosaur and i'm an oldschool coach , i wo n't even stand up and defend that , one of the great principles of this country it s entirely possible that horace grant and chuck person , two prominent free agents said to have spurned the knicks , did so because they could n't fathom a life of riley they could just as easily have based their decisions on money , or the weather , and that s no flippant cliche besides their contracts , all pro basketball players seem to talk about these days is their woeful golf games it should shock no one that last summer s prime free agents grant , person and danny manning wound up in orlando , san antonio and phoenix it is also no secret that rileyball ca n't go on much longer it s shelf life is for as long as the knicks think they can win it is history the moment the collective realization sets in that there s no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , which will be the moment after the knicks are eliminated in this year s playoffs all or nothing riley has said so himself if it comes up nothing , that wo n't mean the last four years will have been a failure riley has at times been tough to take , especially for his players but if they are honest , then they , like the rest of new york , have to admit that riley , more than anyone , has been responsible for putting the knicks in business until orlando or indiana beats them in late may or early june , then , as riley said , business is good jackson , his new friend , had to agree a lot of people say , 'orlando s had the good run , ' jackson said no one s quite got the youth and power they 've got but this is a secondseason sport the last year we won , phoenix i think lost twice at home during the regular season , and then we beat them three times there in the finals now people forget that last year indiana was a 500 team until the last two months , and then they ran the knicks to the seventh game jackson was n't quite rapping , go new york , go new york he was just saying that he thinks the knicks , against whom a 22point lead was not enough last night , still could be magic come late spring photo hubert davis and anthony mason collaborating last night on tight defense on chicago s scottie pippen , which helped knicks rescue the victory last night \( barton silverman the new york times \)
conventional wisdom in queens when i was growing up in the 50 s was that bullies would always back down if you stood up to them this was simply not true most bullies had their own pride and constituencies to satisfy and they would n't have picked on you in the first place if they were n't sure they could beat you up but it was a necessary lie that parents and older siblings had to tell if we were ever to lose our fears the important lesson was not about beating the bully , but about finding out that the beating he gave you was bearable , that he could n't kill you simply by standing up to him and surviving , you won a small victory that would give you the courage to keep challenging , to keep standing up , until he left you alone i 've been having these thoughts since revisiting my old junior high school , stephen a halsey , in rego park oh , there were bullies on the earth in those days ! roger and willie and crazy jay , who hung from the chainlink fence with one hand , throwing punches and snarling but none fought with anything but fists and feet i never saw weapons at jhs 157 , and there is still no metal detector at the door i can only imagine what it means to stand up to a bully at some other schools in a city where a bully might shoot you no wonder a boxcutter is the least of standard protections these days the chance to learn to fight back without dying is yet another loss in this time of the betrayal of children the schoolyard bully is never hard to spot he s not necessarily bigger than the other kids , but he s always more physical , rolling his shoulders , moving his hands , getting up just a little too close you talkin' to me , he says , before you have cleared your throat that usually shuts you up and it never ends think of mario cuomo or george steinbrenner or mayor giuliani in the larger schoolyard at halsey , i belonged to a group targeted by bullies the members of the special progress class had been selected primarily by their aboveaverage iq scores \( 120 was supposedly the cutoff \) , a fact we flaunted like a varsity letter not only were we smarter , but we were too cool for this school we would leave for high school after completing the threeyear curriculum in two we were easy to resent we attended classes as a group and were individually identified by heavy brown leather briefcases filled with books the other kids made a sport of trying to kick them out of the hands of sp boys they called our briefcases fag bags that was the killer word in my neighborhood fag , in those days , had far less of a specifically homosexual connotation than one of sissy , or worse , girl in the 50 s , as we believed then , women had no real futures they might become teachers or even writers , but they would never get to fly planes , build bridges , kill bad guys real man s work and this was n't just schoolyard talk one of the books in my bag , the new you and heredity , had a chart that measured a man s masculinity by his line of work the top of the chart drummed with test pilots , engineers , explorers on the bottom , clearly my future neighborhood , were clergymen , teachers and writers bookish boys believe what they read , and that chart burned into my brain like a diagram left too long on a computer screen it was superimposed on everything that life scrolled up i was a particular target of the bullies because i was a compulsive smart aleck who was also too fat to run away \( my iq was considerably less than my weight \) while the school tended to isolate us from the general student population , it did n't protect us the principal , dr nussey , who taught latin to the sp class and ran the schoolwide softball tournament , apparently believed in survival of the fittest he would allow a little roughhouse so long as his authority was n't challenged boys will be boys our sp homeroom teacher , mrs mcdermott , made an effort to stop fights before we were hurt , but she could n't be everywhere the school enforcers , the burly gym and shop teachers , would wait until the fight was nearly over , then peel the bullies off their victims and boot them down the street in a humorous , bullying way that did nothing to condemn the ritual in fact , probably reinforced it the bullies loved the attention , the contact with bully teachers we victims dusted ourselves off and slunk home i hated getting beaten up i hated having friends feel sorry for me , hated feeling my scabs harden while i listened to the conventional wisdom but it seemed preferable to shutting up or to making peace with the bullies one of my sp classmates was famous for cozying up to the bullies we called them the hoods even holding their jackets while they beat us up he went on to become a famous television mogul at 12 and 13 in my halsey days , i took as my major role model \( i have yet to find a better one \) the lone ranger he protected people from bullies without ever being a bully himself the westerns we saw at the trylon , the drake , the midway also tended to send the message of standing up to bullies or forever living in cowardice and shame there was much more movie fistfighting in those days , and usually only one major gunfight , the last resort , at the end
washington , sept 14 now that the scandal over bob packwood is fading quickly , there is a sort of human letdown , which comes as no surprise to readers of another womanizing diarist , samuel pepys , who jotted on oct 13 , 1660 , after witnessing the crown s hanging , drawing and quartering of major general harrison he looked as cheerful as any man could in that condition he was presently cut down and his head and heart shown to the people , at which there was great shouts of joy hours later , pepys was back to routine a plate of oysters at the sun tavern , a quarrel with his wife similarly , routine is resettling upon the senate senator packwood has survived the political drawing and quartering he finally accepted a week ago in resigning live before the electronically gaping people and workers in the senate now find no match for him on the horizon for the generation of sheer human interest , anger and titillation across the work day a loftier debate over the nation s encrusted welfare system is under way , and some keep talking of that longthreatened train wreck in the annual federal budget fight that is lumbering into view , timely as the autumnal hobgoblins but this stuff is hardly as engrossing as the human debacle that mrpackwood made of his senate career with his serial woman mashing and compulsive diary writing like so many others , edmund morris , the historian currently residing near the capitol as he works on a biography of ronald reagan , found the episode phenomenally distracting , particularly in the odd way that mr packwood treated his diary , as much as he mistreated women the senator made the journal process a sort of neurotic conversation rather than an attempt to be honest about oneself in private , mr morris said a written diary an honest one , that is presupposes only some general reader far in the future , mr morris said , finding the senator s tape recording of his supposedly private notions for immediate transcription by an intermediary a bad way to treat history time will test whether the tale of senator packwood and his diary remains engrossing precisely because it is so vainglorious he showed none of the classicist s instinct that has made the truly private diary of james v forrestal , the nation s first secretary of defense , an enduring labor of grandeur and tragedy immediately before his suicide 46 years ago , mr forrestal , warweary and depressed , closed out his mortal notations with sophocles s dark chorus from ajax comfortless , nameless , hopeless save in the dark prospect of the yawning grave in contrast , mr packwood indulges the mundane , forthrightly opining about such issues as which supermarket , safeway or giant , pleases him most inside the beltway who is to say his pathetically detailed experiment with blowdrying his hair will not some day prove to be a pepysquality revelation about the deeper concerns of working politicians of the late 20th century \? if anyone can learn a lesson from the packwood scandal , it should be the senate historian , richard a baker , but it seems that , in his own obstinately professional way , he just does n't get it i always tell each new senator who arrives here , 'be sure to keep a diary , ' mr baker said , hoping the packwood affair will not further inhibit this city s badly crippled instinct for candor i will keep saying it keep a diary senators really do have a ringside seat to history but the risk of diary writing in this leering city has never been clearer if you 're thinking about it , do n't , advises senator william s cohen , republican of maine , a practiced writer of novel , screenplay , muckraking tract and , for one year , a diary that he found too burdensome a balance of candor and diplomacy last year , joshua l steiner , a 28yearold chief of staff in the treasury department , made an agonizing appearance before a senate whitewater hearing to recant some swaggering notions he had penned in his diaries , about a furious president clinton mr steiner might better have heeded lord byron s diary admonition i fear one lies more to oneself than to anyone else in this , mr packwood s observations of life in washington bear a special quality of callowness that seems sadly definitive of the place oh , it had 100 purposes , the senator had privately told the ethics committee , trying to explain why on earth anyone would keep such a damning record of foibles and excesses some people stop and talk to themselves i talk to the diary at least he was revealing about the compulsion of the federal city , and the mendacity on occasion , mr packwood testified , i discovered that i would recount conversations that simply did n't happen as he leaves office in two weeks , mr packwood can accept as advice the entry pepys made in closing out his diary three centuries ago with open doubts about its value whatever comes of it , i must forbear
none of the nation s most prominent forecasters was more pessimistic about what 1994 would bring for the american economy than irwin l kellner , senior economic adviser at chemical bank everything pointed to weakness , he recalled recently mr kellner said he thought a year ago that the clinton tax increase for the wealthy would inhibit spending among the rich , and that would have a ripple effect on the less affluent neither happened mr kellner also thought low inflation would hold back spending after all , why hurry to buy to beat price increases if none is on the horizon \? people bought anyway and he never dreamed that the money many homeowners saved by refinancing their mortgages would be spent so lavishly on consumer goods in retrospect , mr kellner said , he underestimated the power of low interest rates and plentiful credit , not to mention the pentup demand for new cars and the cleverness of the auto manufacturers in designing leasing plans to move cars from showrooms to the nation s garages finally , european economies recovered more strongly than mr kellner had expected as a result , europeans bought ever larger quantities of american goods a weak dollar helped by making united states goods more competitive in price in sum , whatever could converge to boost the economy in 1994 converged , including the california earthquake , which resulted in billions of dollars in spending for reconstruction , he said but anyone who was right about the economy in 1994 was right for the wrong reason we were wrong for the right reasons mr kellner , who is , as he puts it , always on the lookout for what could upset the apple cart , decided a year ago that 1994 would produce a rise in the nation s output of goods and services of only 17 percent among the 50 forecasters surveyed by blue chip economic indicators in december 1993 , his estimate of the growth in gross domestic product was the lowest even the most optimistic forecasters , however , fell short of the approximately 4 percent that has turned out to be the actual growth rate in calendar 1994 the average forecast of 29 percent growth was way off the mark as well but the blue chip forecasters , as a whole , were much closer to the actual 26 percent inflation rate this year mr kellner gave the lowball estimate there too 15 percent none of the forecasters expected the federal reserve to raise interest rates as much as it did the expectation that jobs and incomes would stagnate shaped mr kellner s thinking this has been a successful theme of his for years like a modernday cassandra , mr kellner was almost alone in the late 1980 s in forecasting the recession that finally appeared in the summer of 1990 and that summer , mr kellner was among the first to recognize that a recession had begun he urged the federal reserve to ease up on interest rates , which it finally did in the early fall for the first year of this recovery , employment declined and the unemployment rate kept rising , he said i was impressed with the lack of job creation in 1992 and 1993 , and i was also impressed with the low quality of pay but people are sophisticated they have found offsets , although one wonders how long they can continue to do so all of which brings mr kellner to 1995 his forecast is for economic growth of 25 percent to 3 percent , which puts him close to the consensus forecast of 29 percent in the blue chip survey the economy has a lot of momentum , mr kellner said , and we do n't think the federal reserve will create a recession by raising interest rates too much in this case , we are optimistic in our forecast that the fed can engineer a slowdown drawing
if college football games were any longer , they would be miniseries bowl games , for osborne s sake , last long enough to roast a 12pound turkey everything lasts longer now , said espn s beano cook college games used to be three hours the only thing that does n't last as long is marriage none of last weekend s four national football league wildcard playoff games took more than 3 hours 15 minutes to complete but sunday and monday s bowl games turned into marathons the citrus bowl weighed in at 3 55 the rose bowl came in at 3 49 , as did the sugar bowl , which left abc s air at 12 35 am the orange bowl lasted 3 46 , the fiesta bowl a minute less the cotton and carquest bowls ended after a zippy 3 30 the bowls averaged 167 plays , 215 more than the nfl s 1455 all this after a season in which the average abc college game lasted 3 26 , and the average espn game required 3 23 according to national collegiate athletic association figures , the average televised division ia and iaa games in 1994 went from 2 50 to 3 37 the games are way too long , said nbc s cris collinsworth , an nfl analyst who worked sunday s orange bowl they have to get the game back to three hours you have to make it more watchable on tv said espn s mike patrick , after three and a half hours , you 're in the ludicrous zone even as the nfl has sliced time off the average game from a high of 3 11 in 1989 , to a low of 2 58 in 1990 and 1992 , to 1994 s 3 05 there is no such impetus at the ncaa we have long discussions every year , said john adams , the secretaryeditor of the ncaa s football rules committee , but it always comes down to the game being a onceaweek event and fans do n't care how long it is adams added there are two ways to cut a game you can shorten halftime , or take plays out of the game to keep the clock moving but the rules committee thinks things are fine the way they are tv ratings are not displaying viewer fatigue regularseason and bowl ratings remain robust we 're concerned , but we have n't thrown the penalty flag on it , said david downs , a vice president of abc sports i 'd hate to decry the length of games when we 're getting such good ratings if a game is meaningful even one that ends past midnight viewership tends to remain strong nbc s overnight orange bowl rating rose from 183 from 10 30 to 11 pm , to 211 from midnight12 16 am the clock stops when the vendor runs out of peanuts , joked dick ebersol , the president of nbc sports but we do n't care about the length of the game it s part of the college atmosphere it s accepted college games were n't always so acceptably long in the mid1960 s , adams said , games lasted 2 20 but that was when halftimes were 15 minutes and teams ran the ball relentlessly and passed reluctantly but the nature of the game has changed teams pass far more rules changes initiated since the late 1960 s require the clock to stop at first downs and changes of possession and extended halftimes from 15 to 20 minutes and networks added more commercial spots in addition , bowl games are lengthened by more commercials and halftimes lasting up to 35 minutes were those bowl games long ! said chuck neinas , an executive director of the college football association added ebersol halftimes have gotten out of hand , especially in an era when oldfashioned variety shows are n't what they used to be otherwise , we 'd still have 'the ed sullivan show' so can college games be made noticeably shorter \? collinsworth suggested ending firstdown timeouts patrick said the rule should be employed only in the last five minutes of each half neinas said the clock should keep moving if the first down comes on a 1yard quarterback sneak , but the referees would have the discretion to stop the clock if first down comes on a 45yard pass changing the rule would anger coaches the rule was implemented to increase scoring and plays \( which average 162 a game compared with 1547 in the nfl \) it contributes to records , said adams taking it away would be unfair len deluca , a vice president of cbs sports , said those timeouts are a lot of fun you get that extra shot to throw the ball to the end zone it s plays , it s action without that , you do n't get the doug flutie pass cut halftimes to 15 minutes \? advocates say school bands need all 20 minutes to perform neinas agreed , but said the bowls' halftimes should not expand , mainly to keep players from risking injury by cooling down too long what s left \? not much , deluca said , except tinkering with increasing the number of tv timeouts but reducing the length of each commercial break or perhaps teams can learn to love the wishbone again and run , run , run
facing a cold shoulder from city hall and hot competition from managed care , highlevel executives are deserting new york city s public hospital system in large numbers , leaving a leadership vacuum when the system is struggling with a 25 percent budget cut and a fastchanging marketplace while the vast majority of those who have departed doctors , nurses and administrators among them have retired or taken new jobs for personal reasons , many said in interviews that they left , at least in part , because they felt the city had abandoned the hospitals corporation , leaving their future uncertain the hemorrhage of top executives , many of them stalwarts who have worked in city hospitals for over a decade , has crippled the fledgling efforts of the health and hospitals corporation to develop managed care systems the loss of executives has created organizational chaos when public hospitals should be streamlining to survive in a market dominated by managed care all the uncertainty and agitation going on within the system have made many people think about leaving many have left , said dr wayne cohen , who resigned as medical director of jacobi medical center in the bronx in september it s a tragedy for the system , and the real victims are the patients executive directors at 6 of the system s 11 acute care hospitals have left this year , as well as the executive director of its flagship nursing home nursing directors at 6 of the hospitals have changed as well , mostly because longtime employees took severance packages offered to shrink the system s staff and more than half a dozen top officials in the central office are gone as well health care experts say it will be difficult to fill these jobs since the corporation s very existence is now in jeopardy the mayor has said he would like to get the city out of the business of owning hospitals and has already placed three public hospitals up for longterm lease and in labor agreements brokered last week , hospital workers were the only union members not to receive a twoyear promise of job security last week executive directors at three hospitals announced they were leaving , including lorraine tregde , the widely praised executive director of jacobi , a hospital that the accounting firm of kpmg peat marwick recently ranked as one of the 10 most costefficient hospitals in the nation none of the executive directors who left this year has been permanently replaced in some cases chief operating officers have taken on the responsibility of running the hospitals in others officials in the central office have assumed the title of executive director , if not the daytoday responsibilities as a result , the organizational charts at some city hospitals have many blank spaces within the past four months employees at jacobi have watched three of their leaders resign ms tregde , the executive director dr cohen , the medical director , and mary dougherty , the nursing director to critics of city hall the loss of leadership is the final nail in the coffin for the health and hospitals corporation , insuring that the system will be dismantled just as mayor rudolph w giuliani s handpicked advisory panel has recommended there s such an exodus that at the rate we 're going there will be no need to have fights about privatization , because they 'll be no infrastructure left , said david r jones , a corporation board member who has clashed frequently with the mayor some even suspect that the current corporation leadership has been intentionally lackadaisical about retaining or replacing leaders , since it may be politically simpler to let the system die a death of attrition than to actively dismantle it but dr luis marcos , the mayor s newly appointed president of the corporation , said the spate of resignations resulted from a combination of young people moving to more lucrative jobs and the expected departure of oldtime loyalists who did not share the mayor s vision he said the gaps they had left while causing some shortterm problems offered further opportunities to transform a dysfunctional system we are committed to downsizing and privatizing , and some people have been here a very long time and are consciously or unconsciously attached to the old mission of this corporation , he said in an interview it might not be a bad idea to recruit new people with fresh ideas , who can jump in with enthusiasm what is more , he said , he and the mayor agree that the public hospital system had too many managers anyway , and that , for example , some hospitals might not need both an executive director and a chief operating officer james r tallon , the president of the united hospital fund , a research group , said that despite the attrition , the system is still meeting its obligations to patients on a daytoday basis and while he generally praised the city for being willing to make some very significant changes in public hospitals , he nonetheless predicted a difficult time ahead he predicted that the corporation , which has always been hampered in job searches by belowmarket salaries , would now have great trouble filling vacant highlevel jobs
the captain is pouring wine but he halts , his hand poised above a glass , to appreciate the person who has brought conversation at la cote basque to a standstill a voluptuous old woman swathed in yards of red satin and draped in diamonds stands near the front of the restaurant her whiteblonde hair is pulled back and her face is painted so that she looks like an 18thcentury english portrait she smiles a little , enjoying the attention , inclines her head , gathers her dress in folds and slowly lowers herself onto a banquette as the conversational buzz resumes , i think , that is why people go to la cote basque i look around at the people seated in the soft light of the oldfashioned table lamps it is not for the classic french food or the fine service or even because this is one of the few restaurants where you can enjoy a comfortable seat and a quiet conversation people go to la cote basque because they know that if they want to make an entrance , attention will be paid for 36 years la cote basque was a bastion of civility on east 55th street when the restaurant lost its lease last year , there was much mourning it looked like the end of an institution even if a new home could be found , what would la cote basque be without its famous murals \? in the end the murals turned out to be surprisingly portable \( they are painted on canvas \) , and the restaurant turned out to be more movable than anyone suspected it sashayed across fifth avenue and settled gracefully into intimate new quarters there is a new buzz in the resurrected restaurant people are happy to be there they look around , wave , notice one another s clothes do they notice what they are eating \? for the most , part i doubt it good as it as , the food seems little more than an excuse for this institution to exist the food is wellprepared and well presented , but it is rarely so unmannerly as to call undue attention to itself the new menu is much smaller than the one in the old restaurant , more modern and much easier to read first courses are listed down one side there are few missteps among them the daily seafood special is often a discreet heap of fresh crab meat and lobster daintily topped with grains of black caviar more lobster and crab meat are sprinkled atop the veloute of potatoes and leeks , a soup smooth and rich enough to recall another era the other soup is even richer just saying the words delice de foie de canard dans son consomme aux morilles you know it is going to be good the impeccable broth , which tastes as if a million beasts were sacrificed to make it , is topped with two generous slabs of foie gras if a more luxurious soup exists , i have not had it but not everything is so extravagant wild mushrooms sauteed with oxtail and wrapped in cabbage leaves is a robust little packet of food , filled with flavor and oaksmoked salmon is served with toast and capers , grated onion , chopped egg white and a piece of lemon , a reminder of how elegant a simple dish can be none of these dishes are surprising or exciting , but they are extremely well executed and large each plate is piled with food , making the 56 prix fixe menu not only a good deal but also a reminder that the rich did not get that way by squandering money the most exciting entree is cassoulet , a splendid pile of white beans cooked with pork loin , duck confit and fat chunks of garlic sausage until each bean bursts with fat and flavor i liked the duck , too , the oldfashioned kind with crisply lacquered skin and sweet cherry sauce and i liked watching as it was carved at the table i also appreciated the captain s response when one friend ordered the sweetbreads pointing out that the dish is called , roasted loin of veal and sweetbread , he asked , would you like the loin of veal as well \? that , of course , is another reason people go to la cote basque they also go to see the dover sole expertly filleted a frequent special , it is the best of the fish the fillet of black bass wrapped in scales of potato and served in a classic red wine sauce is a close second roasted cod is overembellished , served on a mound of truffled mashed potatoes , topped with a small haystack of fried leeks and surrounded by a quartet of fried calamari cod , never the world s most flavorful fish , fades into the background the thrills are saved for the end of the meal the restaurant s owner , jeanjacques rachou , has hired pastry chef richard leach , who last appeared at symphony cafe it was an unusual choice although mr leach has tamed his more extravagant urges , his desserts seem like creatures from outer space in this sedate venue but those who are shocked when a pumpkin custard lands in front of them with a small flaming lantern made of thinly sliced pumpkin are soon seduced by the flavors and no matter how outre mr leach s chocolate cube may appear , the flavors are superb skeptics can always stick with mr leach s classic creme brulee or a small souffle afterward , plates of delicious little cookies and candied fruits are set on the table , followed by a box of handmade chocolates delicious excess then the women walk toward the coat room to reclaim their furs , moving slowly , loath to leave the beautiful room la cote basque 60 west 55th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 6886525 atmosphere if edith wharton were around , she would want to dine in this elegant setting filled with welldressed people is n't it nice that the famous murals look lovelier than ever in their new venue \?

for some residents of the quaint shore community of ocean grove in neptune township , governor whitman could hardly have picked a better time to visit they are pleased that she will attend a memorial at the great auditorium on may 23 honoring police officers who have been killed in the line of duty but they also hope she notices the tealandblack ribbons that represent some residents' dissatisfaction with the state s recent decision to close the marlboro psychiatric hospital , 15 miles away it s a silent protest we 're putting them on trees , businesses , houses , cars , everything , said patricia iadanza , the wife of the mayor of neptune township and the coordinator of the ribbon campaign it s a matter of survival for our communities fear runs deep in asbury park , long branch and other shore communities , where residents say the state has a poor record in upholding promises to provide mental health services the shore became a magnet for the mentally unstable in the 1970 s , when the state released patients from psychiatric hospitals as a result of court decisions and budget cuts many patients ended up in boardinghouses along the shore , where owners were able to convert them to statelicensed homes for the disabled but without medication and treatment , the released patients' behavior sometimes became unmanageable anger about the closing goes beyond those who live in shore towns families of those hospitalized at marlboro and other institutions , as well as people who work there , say they fear that local services wo n't match the needs of the mentally ill state officials say they understand these arguments but they say people are reacting on the basis of emotions , not facts what this plan is doing is taking money out of an aging , antiquated institution and putting that money into community services , said alan kaufman , director of the state s division of mental health services under the plan , marlboro would be phased out over three years , starting in july its 760 patients would be transferred to other hospitals in the state , and its 68 million budget would be shifted to community mental health programs to accommodate the influx of marlboro patients , three other hospitals trenton psychiatric , ancora psychiatric in camden county and greystone park psychiatric in morris county would release 300 patients and place them in residential programs none would be moved to ocean grove or asbury park , according to john mckeegan , a spokesman for the state department of human services about 3 million of the marlboro budget would be earmarked for mental health programs in what mr kaufman called overly impacted communities like ocean grove and asbury park the debate is far from over last tuesday , legislators questioned william waldman , the state s human services commissioner , on the closing the same day , 1 , 500 workers from the institutions and representatives of patients there staged a demonstration outside the governor s office governor whitman has said she will meet soon with local officials to try to minimize the impact on communities where former mental patients live photo hotels and boarding houses line main avenue in ocean grove \( frank c dougherty for the new york times \)
the house will decide as early as today whether to take back twothirds of the money it previously voted to spend this year on americorps , president clinton s national service program the slashing attack on a worthy program can only be interpreted as an effort to humiliate the president in its first year , americorps has placed 20 , 000 participants more than the peace corps at its peak with nonprofit organizations to do valuable community work with minimal bureaucracy and overhead , participants have cleared crack houses , taught ghetto children and built lowcost housing the 400 million cut looms small in the context of this week s vote on a 17 billion package of midyear spending cuts , known as rescissions the decision to rescind 17 billion is the gop s the budget law required almost none of the cuts why , then , the budget ax \? the obvious explanation is that the gop is out to slay political symbols , not government waste president clinton proudly points to americorps as a high point of his administration a program that reflects his deepest values about public service the gop wants to chop mr clinton s pride to bits but in the service of presidentbashing , the republicans would renege on promises made to thousands of participants the rescission would send many home in the middle of their service never mind that they put off college or other commitments to work for minimum wages and a voucher , worth about 5 , 000 a year for up to two years , for college or vocational training the republicans have a right to challenge the value of americorps but the proper time is when congress deliberates next year s budget the haste to gut the program immediately reflects political animus carried to an extreme
amherst , mass it s right there in the bible it s in shakespeare , in sophocles and in dostoyevsky , of course murder , it turns out , is not only a recurring theme in the great works of literature , but is proving to be a crafty way to lure students to class at amherst college this spring semester , a new course , murder , has become the most popular in the school s history , with more than 300 students enrolled , a fifth of the 1 , 570 student body that breaks the record , held by human sexuality , which was offered in the 1970 s the turnout for murder surprised even the professor , austin sarat , the william nelson cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science amherst , a small , prestigious liberal arts college of red brick buildings in western massachusetts , prides itself on its tiny class size and individual instruction by senior faculty members the median class size is 15 students a wiry , energetic man with steel gray hair , professor sarat attributes the large enrollment in his class to america s fascination with murder we are a killing society , awash with violence , he said i told the students the first day , murder is a window into american culture professor sarat readily acknowledged that sometimes murder becomes a glamorous , pop culture attraction the strategy is , give them a hook the hook is murder , he said but this is also a way to teach them the great books and moral reasoning you ca n't read your favorite greek play or shakespeare or russian novel without confronting murder , professor sarat said , his words pouring out at assaultrifle speed and these days , it is hard to avoid confronting the issues surrounding o j simpson s murder trial so i tell the students , 'you think you understand o j , but you do n't if you want to understand o j , come with me on a strange journey you 've got to read sophocles s 'oedipus rex , ' and 'macbeth , ' and 'crime and punishment' by dostoyevsky' also on the reading list are truman capote s in cold blood , about the brutal murder of a farm family in kansas a mystery by agatha christie , and hannah arendt s eichmann in jerusalem there are a number of legal cases on the required reading list , too one is a 19th century murder from britain , queen v dudley and stephens , in which two starving men adrift in a lifeboat were charged with eating a companion and , students say , the course s list of required movies which are shown on campus is the best at amherst they range from the recent hits pulp fiction and natural born killers to the silence of the lambs and alfred hitchcock s psycho television and music also come into play one week the students were required to watch a geraldo program about the killing of doctors who perform abortions , and snoop doggy dogg s gangster rap video murder was the case snoop doggy dogg , who records for death row interscope records , is awaiting trial in los angeles for a gangrelated driveby shooting elizabeth delsman , a freshman from brooklyn , said her mother was taken aback when she found out what courses her daughter was taking this semester ms delsman said she told her mother , 'that s ok , mom , it s a law class' but none of the students say they regard murder as a snap course professor sarat is a notoriously tough grader , said gui victor jr , a junior who lives in the brownsville section of brooklyn it is the one course , even if you do all the reading and have all your papers proofread , you 're still not going to get an a why take the course then \? it s about murder , it s easy to read , said josh kushenbaum , a freshman from new city , ny , a suburb of new york and it s the best way to get murder on your transcript in addition , mr kushenbaum said , professor sarat is an entertainer , the most popular faculty member at amherst he teaches like a talk show host , a phil donahue with brains , mr kushenbaum said professor sarat , who has both a doctorate in political science and a law degree from yale , does bound around the lecture hall , sometimes running up or down the aisles , stopping dramatically to call on a student by name it is a really socratic method , to capture the students on the field where they live and play , said tom garrity , the president of amherst , who himself has a doctorate in philosophy and a law degree he has captured the students' imaginations and used that capture to get at some fundamental thinking back in class , professor sarat has stopped his pacing what is the difference between capital punishment and murder \? he asks a student one has the sanction of the state , the other is considered illegal , the student answers very good , the professor goes on , waving his arms but what about hitler killing the jews did n't that have the approval of the state \? professor sarat offers the class a theory about why americans are so fascinated with murder it is the one experience of our lives we ca n't experience , so our interest is narcissism , he explains besides , he says , much great literature is about murder , so to understand this literature you will have to drop your moral scruples , to look at style in killing after class , mr victor , from brownsville , said he was unsure how to explain that at home , where last summer a man was shot dead three feet in front of him how can i go home and say that murder was aesthetic , was beautiful \? mr victor asked i guess the professor is just trying to get us to think photo the most popular course ever at amherst college is a new offering called , murder , taught by prof austin sarat , who teaches jurisprudence and political science more than 300 students enrolled in the class \( keith meyers the new york times \) chart syllabus murder , they wrote lists the books students required to purchase for the murder course additional readings listed on the syllabus include selections from the bible , various legal cases and excerpts from the writings of the marquis de sade , michel foucault and edgar allen poe students are also required to view films , like body heat , and alfred hitchcock s classic strangers on a train \( source professor austin sarat , amherst college \)
washington , dec 12 president clinton sent a letter tonight to republican leaders that appeared to give them the written assurances they sought that the united states would lead an effort to arm and train the bosnian muslims the assurances that arrived on capitol hill tonight were meant to pave the way for the senate to offer the president its grudging support for deploying american troops in bosnia mr clinton heads to paris wednesday to sign the bosnian peace accord as of early this evening , senator bob dole , the republican leader , had not commented on the letter but senator john mccain , the arizona republican who has been working closely with mr dole in trying to forge an agreement with the white house , said he was satisfied with the president s commitment earlier in the day , senator dole said he had talked with the president on the telephone , adding , i think they are going to come our way formal debate on the bosnia mission began in the senate tonight , just as the president sent the letter voting on it is expected on wednesday action in the house is not expected at least until later this week and at this point , even though americans have already begun landing in bosnia , it is not clear whether the house will support the mission the president says he does not need congressional authorization for the mission , but he wants it the president s letter said in part that the united states will take a leadership role in coordinating an international effort to insure that the bosnian federation receives the assistance necessary to achieve an adequate military balance when the peacekeeping force leaves the balkans administration officials had said they wanted third parties to oversee the military training of the muslims so that the united states could maintain a neutral stance it was the assurance that the united states would lead the effort that senator dole and senator mccain had demanded in return for their support the president had sent a letter two days ago that was vague on this point today , the senators wrote back to the president , saying , we are seeking your confirmation that the united states will lead in coordinating and providing the bosnians with the means for selfdefense the senators' letter added to state that no us military forces will be involved as your letter does is a guarantee that such a program will be wholly ineffective and may not even occur the president responded tonight that he would do nothing that i believe will endanger the safety of american troops , and added , in the view of my military advisers , this requires minimizing the involvement of us military personnel , but we expect that some individual military officers would be involved , including , for example , those from the defense security assistance agency his letter also said that training the bosnian government s forces could begin immediately after the accord is signed on thursday and that they could receive small arms after three months the senate is expected to vote wednesday on the dolemccain resolution , which approves of the american deployment under the condition that the united states would lead the effort to arm the bosnian government troops although two other resolutions will also be voted on wednesday , it is the this one that was hammered out with the administration and that the administration most wants in hand as the president flies to paris the senate was feeling some pressure to act as the clock ticked toward the president s departure if we want to be relevant , we have to do it , said senator mccain with such severe reservations about the balkan mission on capitol hill , it is not certain whether mr dole and mr mccain can muster enough republican support to pass their resolution earlier today , when senator mccain was asked how much support he had , he joked none except blood relatives and staff the resolution has strong democratic backing , but senators dole and mccain are still buttonholing republicans to come aboard one resolution already passed by the house would cut off funds for the mission that is not expected to pass the senate another resolution sponsored by a group of republicans led by senator kay bailey hutchison of texas would support the troops but not the president s decision to send them i am urging the president of the united states to reconsider his decision , she said tonight on the senate floor she said in an interview earlier that she had about 48 votes for her resolution and was not sure whether it would pass senator hutchison said that she was not worried about sending a mixed message to the troops , some of whom she talked to saturday night at fort hood they 're with me , she said they 're mixed they know i'm for them , and i'm trying to keep them out
opening day in congress could produce more baseball than opening day of the 1995 baseball season but while washington lawmakers introduce three bills today aimed at baseball s antitrust exemption , a committee of owners and club executives will discuss matters that will have an impact on their opening day spring training and replacement players on the first day of the 104th congress , senator daniel patrick moynihan , democrat of new york , and representative michael bilirakis , republican of florida , will initiate action in their respective legislative bodies on bills that would strip baseball of its exemption from antitrust laws in addition , bilirakis will introduce a bill that would void baseball s exemption under the sports broadcasting act it seems like things are percolating along and people are beginning to understand what happens when you let cartels act like cartels , donald fehr , the head of the union , said yesterday as he departed for washington for a meeting today with secretary of labor robert reich striking players and union officials will watch developments on capitol hill eagerly and carefully they believe that action by congress and the national labor relations board will enhance their chances of gaining an agreement with the owners that would be more equitable than the salary cap the clubs have implemented unilaterally the owners , on the other hand , have chided the players for looking anywhere but the bargaining table , saying that is the place where a deal has to be reached their 10man operations committee , headed by john harrington of the boston red sox , will meet today by telephone conference call on which they will begin serious discussions about having a season without the striking players harrington said he will have two calls , speaking first with the general managers on the committee about replacement players , then with the full committee we do not have some particular method of recruiting replacement players in mind , despite what has been said about our planning to implement , harrington said by telephone from boston tomorrow will be our first indepth discussions along those lines we 've had a lot of peripheral discussions about how the clubs would go about that we have to move ahead with planning to use replacement players if we are going to be deadlocked going into spring training and the start of the season harrington said the desire among owners is to open spring training on time , perhaps bringing in minor league players earlier than usual that is n't to say we would use minor leaguers as replacements , he said the notion is that we would spend more time developing those younger kids we may have major league managers and coaches who would have more time to work with them another topic of discussion for the committee , which has n't talked since early last month , is the price of tickets for regularseason and exhibition games if teams use replacement players , harrington said the owners have to make these decisions as the next step in their implementation of the salarycap system their implementation , at the same time , has caught the attention of congress , prompting interest in some quarters where none had existed moynihan had previously been silent on the subject of baseball s antitrust exemption , but today he will introduce legislation entitled the national pastime preservation act , calling for full repeal of the exemption major league baseball has had since 1922 john warner , republican from virginia , will sponsor the bill major league baseball is in grave peril , moynihan said in a statement the antitrust exemption allows the owners to act as a cartel moynihan said he would work closely with senator orrin hatch , republican of utah and incoming chairman of the senate judiciary committee , to enact this legislation and bring our national pastime back to the field hatch , who has become an outspoken critic of the owners over their actions , is expected to hold a hearing on the bill later this month it proposes that congress find that the business of organized professional baseball is in , or affects , interstate commerce the united states supreme court ruled in 1922 it was n't and that the antitrust laws should be amended to reverse the result of that decisions as well as supreme court decisions in 1953 and 1972 the exemption , the moynihan statement said , has given the owners substantial powers over wages and work rules repealing the exemption , the statement said , would help equalize bargaining power between the two sides and will permit unfair labor practices to be challenged in federal court the first bilirakis bill in the house is written along similar lines as moynihan s , dealing with interstate commerce and having the antitrust laws apply to the business of providing for profit public baseball games involving teams and leagues of professional players his second bill would remove baseball from the 1961 act that permits sports entities to pool television arrangements congress passed that bill so that antitrust laws would not apply to teams in professional leagues selling television rights to their games bob meyers , a spokesman for bilirakis , said the congressman favored full repeal of the antitrust exemption but he noted that bilirakis previously cosponsored a bill that would have eliminated the exemption as it applied to labor negotiations and said he would support that limited version again if that move became necessary this week s baseball schedule , while devoid of negotiations , has one other matter union officials will begin a series of regional meetings with players friday in chicago and a similar series of meetings with agents there saturday
maurice eason , a 19yearold from the housing projects of east new york , walked into the central jury room at state supreme court in brooklyn slightly after 9 am one morning last week it was his first experience as a prospective juror also arriving was marie mcelwan , a 68yearold woman who had spent her life in flatbush it was her seventh trip to jury duty however different their backgrounds , the young black man and the older white woman came to room 261 of the brooklyn courthouse with a shared sentiment a distrust of the city s police officers the potential impact of their skepticism regarding the honesty of police officers is easy to appreciate in brooklyn , nearly 40 percent of criminal prosecutions involve drug or gun cases , and the vast majority of those cases are built exclusively on the testimony of the police i live in the projects , and so i know the reality of having seen the police in action day after day , mr eason said and i know that , depending on what s at stake , the police will lie mrs mcelwan , her experiences different in their details from those of mr eason , had arrived at roughly the same conclusion i wo n't turn against them all , she said but you have to understand i have lived long enough to have seen corruption problems come and go several times over they clean it up and it gets dirty again it looks like it s dirty again mr eason and mrs mcelwan , then , are the faces of the nightmare that law enforcement officials have dreaded ever since the latest police corruption scandals in the city that dread that a collapse of confidence in the integrity of the police would compromise the ability of prosecutors to convict criminals was only deepened in the aftermath of the taped bigotry of mark fuhrman , the former los angeles police detective who is at the center of the o j simpson murder trial interviews of several dozen prospective jurors in brooklyn , queens and manhattan , conducted over two days last week at the central jury rooms of each borough , reflected widespread concern about the believability of police officers in brooklyn , a black bank employee said that he would never again believe any officer , and that he would try to get dismissed from any jury involved in a case that included police testimony a white 23yearold office manager of a bridal shop said she would reserve judgment about an officer s testimony until she had determined just how bogus a story he was telling in manhattan , a 29yearold graphics designer , who said she had many friends who were officers , said she would not take police testimony any more to heart than i would anybody else i have a big problem with the police force in general , the designer , joann pittelli , said in queens , a 23yearold physical therapist from springfield gardens said he would listen to the facts offered by police , but that somewhere in the back of my mind i would be skeptical in queens and manhattan , a halfdozen people said they would naturally trust the testimony of officers but in brooklyn , none of the people interviewed , even those who said they would not instinctively disbelieve officers , said they would begin their jury service assuming that the police were going to be truthful the willingness to believe that police officers will commit perjury or doctor records or falsely arrest people is one of the highest costs the city has had to pay as a result of police corruption , said daniel j castleman , chief of investigations for the manhattan district attorney s office once you have people believing cops routinely lie , what is that going to bring about \? among other things , there are going to be a lot of acquittals of guilty people a mayoral commission that spent two years investigating police corruption , for all its sordid tales of extortion and brutality , concluded that perjury by officers was the most widespread form of wrongdoing in the police department , and was a practice often condoned by superiors in 1994 , 14 city police officers were arrested for perjury , and last year another group from the 48th precinct in the bronx were indicted for lying under oath officers convicted of perjury in recent months include a decorated officer from the 34th precinct , and an integrity officer in harlem s 30th precinct who was charged with monitoring the honesty of the precinct s force consequently , prosecutors have been forced to consider throwing out hundreds of convictions generated by the corrupt officers and corruption problems have cropped up elsewhere , too in philadelphia , six officers have pleaded guilty to criminal charges as part of a growing corruption scandal , and federal prosecutors have subpoenaed the records of 100 , 000 police department arrests for review the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , said that weeding out jurors with a prejudice against , or distrust of , police officers has become the single most important part of the prosecutor s job while saying he believed the phenomenon of prejudiced juries predated the latest corruption scandals , mr hynes said he believed that the problem had been worsened by convictions of officers and by the simpson trial he asserted that his office s identification of the problem and aggressiveness in jury selection had helped it achieve an 83 percent felony conviction rate for 1995
washington , april 11 each had a reason for giving up american citizenship , and each says it had nothing to do with taxes one man wanted to be a citizen of israel , the land of his birth another was a global marketer who could live anywhere and now calls belize his home still another so loved the balmy bahamas that he preferred a bahamian passport to an american one but each of these expatriate americans also avoided paying millions of dollars in united states taxes a loophole in the tax law , one that congressional democrats have been trying to close , allows noncitizens to avoid taxes on capital gains and estates that , critics point out , has permitted a handful of very wealthy americans who have renounced their citizenship to save millions some say billions in taxes reached in nassau , michael d dingman , chairman of abex , a new hampshirebased maker of aerospace and industrial products , said his expatriation had nothing to do with taxes i decided to become a bahamian , and you ca n't be a bahamian and a us citizen at the same time , mr dingman said it s an honor to be a bahamian citizen they have to want you you ca n't buy your way in this is not st kitts the change had nothing to do with taxes a halfdozen or so of the superrich , including mr dingman , have been identified over the last six months by the wall street journal and forbes magazine as among the tax expatriates ted arison , founder of carnival cruise lines , who now lives in israel john dorrance 3d , campbell soup heir , who has irish citizenship kenneth dart , president of the foam cup company dart container , now a citizen of belize j mark mobius , a leading international money manager , who has german citizenship and lives in hong kong and singapore frederick krieble , a director and former treasurer of the hartfordbased loctite corporation , a maker of sealants , who has moved on to the caribbean , taking up residence in the turks and caicos islands expatriation is the ultimate estate plan , said william zabel , senior partner at schulte , roth zabel of new york , who is one of the nation s foremost authorities on trusts and estates and is author of the rich die richer and you can , too \( william morrow , 1995 \) it s not a complete solution but if you structure it right , the very few people it affects can save a bundle fewer than a thousand americans a year give up their citizenship , most for reasons that have nothing to do with taxes but a dozen or more of those who leave are multimillionaires aiming at them , president clinton proposed an expatriation tax in his 1996 budget the congressional joint committee on taxation estimates that the tax would raise 36 billion over the next decade but republicans opposed the provision and succeeded in killing it before congress began its spring recess last weekend now democrats are eager to revive the issue , and one of them , senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york , introduced a revised version of the proposal last thursday and vowed to work for its passage a genuine abuse exists in this area , said mr moynihan , who noted that some wealthy expatriates , while avoiding taxes , maintained families and homes in the united states by staying within a 120dayayear limit on vists here if you 've gotten your riches from america , you should pay your fair share of taxes , said leslie b samuels , assistant secretary for tax policy at the treasury department these expatriates are really like economic benedict arnolds they should n't have an unfair advantage over other citizens because they 're superrich unlike other countries , which tax on the basis of residence , the united states taxes on the basis of citizenship thus , americans are subject to united states taxation on their worldwide income in addition , the estate of an american pays taxes at a marginal rate of up to 55 percent of the assets that the citizen owned at death if you have 50 million , you could certainly potentially save a lot of their estate taxes if you are n't us citizens , said rich kohan , director of the personal financial services group of price waterhouse that s not small change when you 're talking in the neighborhood of an estate tax of 55 percent but mr kohan said that although he had received many queries about the tax benefits of expatriation , none of his clients had decided to divest themselves of their citizenship as a way of avoiding taxes it s pretty dramatic to give up your citizenship , he said first you have to leave the country , and then there is pretty intensive questioning about the purpose of the expatriation under current law , a citizen who is even suspected of expatriating for tax reasons can still be taxed for up to 10 years but the law is like a sieve and has proven largely ineffective , because departing taxpayers have found ways to restructure their activities to avoid those rules , and compliance is difficult to monitor , a recent treasury report said in my case , said mr dingman , who gave up his citizenship last june to live in the bahamas , i 've been living here in one form or the other since 1964 , and that s a long , long time this is a beautiful place , it does n't have big social problems , and you do n't have big taxes my wife and i moved here to live a little bit over five years ago , because we wanted a gentle , thoughtful , pleasant place to raise our three children his wife and children retained their american citizenship , which allows mr dingman to travel freely into and out of the united states while mr dingman insisted that taxes had played no role in his decision , he said he was sympathetic to those opposed to an expatriation tax
fort monmouth the pentagon s efforts to reduce the size and cost of the united states military have cast a shadow over the future of an unusual prep school here with a long and proud tradition the united states military academy preparatory school , which traces its own history back to 1916 , has been housed at this base for 20 years its assignment is to give promising candidates many of them from the army s enlisted ranks 10 months of training that will help them succeed at the united states military academy at west point , ny officials at the school said that on the average about 60 percent of students in each starting class go on to west point besides giving soldiers a route to the academy , the prep school , which now has 177 students , also sends west point potential varsity athletes and serves the goal of greater diversity among cadets by preparing minority students and women for the academy students who are not already in the army must join the service before enrolling at the tuitionfree prep school among the many proposals to trim military expenses is a plan to shut down the prep school here as well as those operated by the navy in newport , ri , and the air force in colorado springs and send their students at government expense to independent prep schools , private military academies or junior colleges an experiment with privatizing the prep schools' duties will begin in july , when 60 students 20 from each of the service schools will be sent to civilian institutions , said col charles a henning , chief of the officer division of the deputy chief of staff for personnel at the department of the army in washington but there is no immediate plan to close the army school or to move it from fort monmouth , if the base continues to operate , he said none of us knows or is privy to how fort monmouth will fare in the 1995 round of base shutdowns , colonel henning said fort monmouth , headquarters of the army s communicationselectronics command , is one of seven military installations in new jersey that are under a threat of being closed by the pentagon hearings on the closing are scheduled to start march 1 , with final targets recommended by october the program at the rigorous prep school is intended to give students a taste of west point life cadet candidates , as the students are called , start their day at 5 30 am and complete it at 11 pm , after a threehour study period in their barracks like the military s other prep schools , the fort monmouth program includes remedial mathematics and english instruction graduates go on to west point , where they join the students nominated by a variety of federal officials and members of congress half of the current class here came from the regular army , many with airborne , ranger and air assault combat training the 177member class includes 23 women , about the same percentage as at west point , and 61 members of minorities , a far higher percentage than at the senior academy , where about 18 percent of the students are from minorities the class began in july as a group of 213 , down about 100 from the year before because of army cutbacks students left the current program because they or the school s staff determined that they could not handle the academic work and tough discipline of those who leave , students who come to the school from within the army must return to their units others are separated from the service and go back to civilian life we do everything we can to keep the candidates here , said maj patrick j teifer , the school s assistant commandant , who grew up in edison he graduated from the fort monmouth program in 1977 and from west point in 1981 he commanded an armor unit in germany before coming here a year and a half ago every opportunity for additional instruction is offered , major teifer said some leave here because they realize the life is not for them three of the current fort monmouth students are from new jersey two antonio vega , 20 , of north plainfield , and jeremy r hudgin , 20 , of mount laurel are regular army troopers the third , michael l mccaffrey , 18 , of glassboro is a recruited athlete he averaged 22 points a game as a shooting guard at gloucester catholic high school in gloucester city and is a star on the prep school basketball team the ranking woman among the prep school students , kimberly a taft , 18 , of bacliff , tex , the battalion executive officer , said women more than hold their own and have distinguished themselves in the classroom , on the athletic field and in military training she is impressed with the mutual respect shown among her male and female peers , she said when i give an order , i expect it to be followed , she said and it is by everyone , men and women in december , the navy prep school , in newport , came under attack from a former teacher there who was critical of the emphasis on sports he said the school was the navy farm team a holding tank for the naval academy varsity hopefuls , particularly in football navy officials denied the charge citing the academic progress made by the midshipmen candidates and their high graduation rate at the academy does the army school have a similar problem \? absolutely not , said capt timothy a decker , an armor officer who has been director of admissions here for two years he was graduated from west point in 1989 after completing the prep school course we cap our recruiters' sports admissions at 25 percent , he said , adding that athletes usually are outstanding leaders whose talents go beyond the playing fields timothy a nelson , of shrewsbury , the prep school football coach , said of the 150 players on the army football team 65 came from here his team finished its season with a 72 record and a 243 victory over the navy prep team captain decker said that of the prep school students who make it to the military academy , about 70 percent will graduate that is about the same percentage as the cadets who arrive at west point by the other nomination routes , he said the prep school , with an operating budget of about 69 million a year , has a fourbuilding campus tucked away on about 10 acres of this sprawling 1 , 384acre post it is run by a staff of 62 14 officers , 25 enlisted personnel and 23 civilians , the majority of whom are instructors with master s or doctoral degrees the school was shifted here in 1975 from fort belvoir , va , where it had been for 18 years but its history goes back to 1916 , when president woodrow wilson was authorized by congress to appoint enlisted men to the military academy a year later , the school was in operation on the battlefields of france under the personal supervision of gen john j pershing since that time , it has graduated about 10 , 000 students the school s commandant , col guy a berry , an alumnus and a 1971 west point graduate who holds the bronze star medal for artillery service in the persian gulf war , said there was an abundance of tradition and accomplishment to be observed at the 20th anniversary but the most memorable will come when we start to recall and salute with admiration and respect some of our greats , he said , referring to 93 officers who were killed in action and four wars , 3 medal of honor winners , 67 generals and 2 astronauts since 1947 , nine of the school s graduates went on to become first captains , the highest cadet rank , at west point photos cutbacks by the pentagon may affect the future of the united states military academy preparatory school in fort monmouth , which prepares many of its students for the rigors of west point \( julio a ibarra jr for the new york times \)

lakeland , fla , feb 17 saying there s no place in our game for replacement players , sparky anderson , the dean of major league managers , took an unpaid leave of absence from the detroit tigers today with no guarantee that he will be asked back when the striking players return anderson s decision to turn his back on what he views as fraudulent major league players did not seem likely to prompt other managers to follow his lead , based on the mixed reaction of his colleagues but it did tarnish the owners' strategy to play a replacement season please let s do n't think of such a horror story that we 're going to have baseball with replacement players , anderson said as the tigers began spring training under an interim manager , tom runnells if our game does that , there s going to be a lot of us who have been in this game a long time that are going to be truly , truly hurt his integrity , the whitehaired anderson said , would not allow him to manage the replacement tigers even though he has a 12 million contract , the richest of any manager , that presumably would obligate him to the detroit tigers are not going to play in 1995 , up to this point , he said at a news conference at marchant stadium i do n't like my intelligence insulted by telling me this is the detroit tigers i have to think the college national champions who would you like to match up \? donald fehr , the union leader , applauded anderson s courageous decision , and bud selig , the acting commissioner and leader of the owners' strike strategy , declined to criticize him for it selig , in fact , did not try to change anderson s mind when the two close friends spoke by telephone for 45 minutes thursday evening we had an intense but sensitive conversation , selig said by telephone from milwaukee i did not try to talk him out of it the only thing i can say is i have a lot of respect for him everybody in life has to do what he thinks is right he s a man who has strong opinions on many things he acts with the courage of his convictions selig said he did not believe anderson s move would have any impact on replacement baseball , but he said , trying to cover up all dissent on either side is silly cito gaston and phil regan are the only other managers who wo n't be managing replacement players the toronto blue jays have relieved gaston of that duty , while the baltimore orioles have not burdened regan , their rookie manager , with the chore because their owner , peter angelos , has refused to field a replacement team but neither of those managers' jobs are in jeopardy anderson s is anderson said he did n't think that john mchale jr , the tigers' new president , would fire him , but he acknowledged that mchale had told him only to call him when the strike ended he did n't say i 'd be coming back , the manager said mchale , speaking by telephone from detroit , said the tigers would be interested , given the right set of circumstances , in having him back but he added there was a chance they would n't return anderson to the job he has held for 16 years there seems to us to be circumstances that could include the passage of time where it might not be in our interest to have him back , mchale said i do n't know what those would be right now , but it seemed like we could n't make an openended invitation the tigers , he added , were not thrilled with the way he s come down on this , but we understand the depth of his feeling fehr said union officials feel certain his job will be available when he comes back it would be a tragedy if it were not anderson , at dinner with mchale last monday , suggested he could work with minor leaguers , which is gaston s temporary assignment with the blue jays my thing was i would be at the minor league camp , but none of those replacement players would be there , he said they ai n't coming over i 'll work with the minor league kids , but you ai n't bringing none of those guys over to me but mchale vetoed that idea , explaining that it was not an alternative consistent with the spring training plan designed by general manager joe klein anderson , who will turn 61 years old next wednesday , has managed in the majors for the past 25 years his total of 2 , 134 victories with the cincinnati reds and the tigers ranks him fourth on the career managing list bucky harris is ahead of him with 2 , 159 i need 26 more wins to be third on the alltime list , he said you mean you want me to accept those wins \? i ai n't accepting nothing tony larussa , the oakland manager , said he thought the milestone might have played a significant role in anderson s decision i 'd hate to break into that top three without it being with legitimate major leaguers , larussa said by telephone from phoenix larussa said he was not surprised about the decision because he knew that anderson had been real bothered about the issue but larussa added , while i respect what he s doing , i do n't agree buck showalter of the yankees , on the other hand , spoke simply of respect when a man with his experience and his background makes a decision like that , i think everybody looks at it with a great deal of respect , said showalter , who has struggled with his own position on managing replacements i 'd feel that way about any decision he made on any subject jim fregosi of philadelphia said he did n't think other managers would follow anderson , but acknowledged , i do n't think there s any manager who s happy about the situation dave johnson of cincinnati echoed that view , saying , i know for sure none of us want to after hearing details of the anderson development , tom lasorda , manager of the los angeles dodgers since 1976 , spoke of anderson almost in the past tense it s too bad , lasorda said i'm sorry to see that happen to sparky he s been a teammate , a friend , a great manager it s sad to see him go out this way but , lasorda was reminded , anderson has acted with his eyes open yeah , he replied , but who would have thought that would happen he himself would not refuse to manage the replacements he said he told peter o'malley , the dodger owner , i 'll manage whatever you want me to manage anderson said he decided two months ago he could not manage replacements he did n't disclose his decision earlier , he related , because me and my wife continued to think all along that it would be settled now that replacements are here , anderson said i , as a human being , must live under my rules if i set these rules down , i have to live by them i ca n't be two people i cannot speak one way to my players and then do another way photo tiger manager sparky anderson waving as he left the locker room yesterday the team gave him an unpaid leave because he refused to manage replacement players \( associated press \)
point lookout , li the lowly surf clam , burrowed in the sandy murk of the sea and the sound , is not an inspiring poster creature for an environmental crusade its image is dull , its personality flat and its meat too tough to serve raw on the halfshell about all that can be done to the surf clam is to catch it and chop it into chowder , a ritual carried out with such ruthless efficiency that the mollusk has quietly vanished without much public mourning from long island sound the clam beds that remain in the atlantic have naturally become more exalted and precious the booty in a struggle that pits veteran native clammers against outofstate fishermen who , locals claim , set up corporations in new york just so they could troll the waters in large , hightech clam boats the stakes are high will these clams also vanish \? i have two sons who also want to go into clamming , but i do n't know whether there are going to be any clams left for their generation , said curtis smith , an islip terrace clammer , bronzed by the sun and weathered by 13hour days searching for the maximum catch of 14 bushels the bluegray waters of the atlantic used to be the lonely territory of clammers like mr smith or robert doxsee jr , who at 64 is old enough to remember the clickclack of the first long island shucking house in a freeport garage , the clam meat so plentiful that it filled huge sugar barrels layered with ice those were years when the surf clam was as abundant as bluefish and porgies and winter flounder , popular species that , like the surf clam , are declining in number because there are too many powerful boats chasing too few fish nothing kills fish quicker than a hook or a net , said william wise , director of the living marine resources institute at the state university of new york at stony brook and the chairman of a surf clam advisory board and we just have to come up with a mechanism of controlling ourselves this requires people to buy into a notion that fish are a limited resource until 1991 there were only five local boats trolling in the statemonitored fishery zone of the atlantic , where the majority of clam beds are scattered from rockaway point to fire island inlet but by 1993 the fleet had multiplied to 25 vessels many of them boats idled in other states by new federal regulations that enabled fishermen to consolidate their fleets as more hardshelled clams were blasted from the sea with highpowered jets of water , some clammers started to worry about the future they noticed that it took longer hours to catch fewer bushels of clams when the boats started crowding each other at the clam beds , there were curses and jeers , and jockeying for position 90foot boats lumbering within 50 feet of each other but there was no violence , just anger there s been heated arguments , said joseph edgar , a clammer from northville , li i 'll tell you that emotions are running high in my case , i got a big boat and i can run them off , but i do n't think that is the problem emergency regulations were imposed by the state department of environmental conservation in 1993 to limit total clamming to a maximum of 500 , 000 bushels a year state surveys showed that the clam population in the prime clamming area dropped from 89 million to 51 million from 1993 to 1994 it was like golddigging and you go in and strip the mine , said mr doxsee , who helped found a group of concerned clammers and hired a lawyer to lobby albany for stricter controls some clammers called for even tighter restrictions they were mindful of the lesson of long island sound , where a bountiful clam harvest in the mid80 s and in 1990 drew a fleet of some 50 local and outofstate boats that methodically cleared the clams boat hoppers were so overloaded that clams tumbled over the side to be crushed by dredges the seed stock of new clams was killed along with the old there was no limit , recalled charles sidorwicz , one of the last clammers who vainly searched for surf clams in the sound last spring we used to go out twice a day because there was no limit we thought , why should we allow these outofstate boats to get it all \? after the long island sound clam beds vanished , the question remained the same were there too many boats \? six boats in the atlantic fishery of long island are owned by two new york corporations called winter harbor brands and bay head inc , which have consistently pushed for permission to increase the harvest quota set by the state both companies have shareholder ties to two brothers , martin and leroy truex , who run a large shellfishing fleet near atlantic city in new jersey , said david h wallace , a consultant who represents the two companies mr wallace conceded that the truex brothers are shareholders of some distant corporation if you go way , way through , that s true the state of new york restricts surf clam permits to new york residents but the names of the truex brothers do not appear on the corporate application for a clamming permit the permit lists their lawyer as the applicant for winter harbor brand and his residence in hampton bays , li , as the company address there is nothing in the record that indicates anything wrong as far as we are concerned , said richard fox , a marine resources specialist with the state s bureau of shell fisheries the fact of the matter is that in all legal respects these two corporations are both duly organized new york state corporations filed with the secretary of state but there is no doubt where the truex brothers reside oh , they 're definitely jersey boys , said james joseph , chief of the new jersey bureau of shellfisheries , who noted that the brothers hold 15 of the 57 clamming permits in new jersey leroy \( barney \) truex , 43 , is presently incarcerated at a federal prison in fairton , nj , with a scheduled release date of 1997 he was convicted in florida in 1991 of conspiracy to import more than 150 , 000 pounds of marijuana on boats bound for the clamming docks of virginia the state is working on regulations that would tighten the residency requirement for clamming permits so that corporate shareholders would also have to establish legal residency in new york individuals who grew up in new york state , who were born and raised on the water , mr edgar said , are entitled to the resource that they have worked for and to give these resources to outofstate vessels , to condone these licenses through post office boxes is a fraud and should not be condoned by state officials the clammers themselves have formed a management advisory board to come up with a plan to protect and manage the clam beds the board was scheduled to complete the plan by september , but none of the 10 members consider that target realistic , and the board is still trying to come to some agreement on strategy many observers are waiting for the outcome of the state s new survey of the clam population the department of environmental conservation has agreed that next year it will not use winter harbor brands' boat to conduct the study some already think they know the future without benefit of a scientific count i'm in this to stay , said leann smith , who helps run ocean fresh sea clam with her husband , curtis i have a boat and two sons , but when they 're old enough to work i do n't think there s going to be anything left map of long island
boston in 12 years as president , franklin roosevelt vetoed 635 bills a rate of one a week in his two plus years , bill clinton has vetoed none those figures tell us a good deal about the two men s views of the office during fdr s entire presidency the democrats controlled congress but with his vigorous conception of executive power , he did not hesitate to assert what he deemed to be the national interest against members of his own party his veto was overridden only nine times from the start president clinton took a far more emollient stance , pulling back from conflict with congress he went so far , especially in failing to stand up for his nominees when they were attacked , that he suffered serious political damage congress concluded that this president could be rolled this year , with republicans in control of congress and radicals in the house pushing ripper bills through one after the other , the time seemed to have arrived for mr clinton to use the veto power but when the first clear occasion for a veto arose , he whimpered out the occasion was a bill that repealed a law giving preferential tax treatment to the sale of radio and television stations to minorityowned businesses the repeal was made retroactive but an amendment stuck on by senator carol moseleybraun , democrat of illinois , allowed one sale already made to keep the tax break the seller was rupert murdoch , who thereby pocketed upward of 30 million the buyers included a black group and the chicago tribune mr murdoch is the artful dodger of the media world he somehow persuaded margaret thatcher s conservative government in britain that no antitrust problems were raised when he acquired a huge slice of the british press then he made his newspapers a claque for mrs thatcher president clinton can hardly expect political support from the conservative mr murdoch but he signed into law the bill giving mr murdoch the tax break why \? was he afraid that the murdoch press would savage him even more cruelly if he vetoed it \? mr clinton s explanation was that he had to sign the bill because it also gave selfemployed people the right to deduct part of their healthinsurance costs on their tax returns but the explanation amounted to a pathetic statement of political weakness if the president had vetoed that legislation , congress would surely have passed the healthinsurance provision without the murdoch rider the demand from selfemployed farmers and entrepreneurs was irresistible and what a wonderful target the bill was for any president ready to appeal to the country over the head of congress it was a case of serving special interests carried to the extreme serving one billionaire franklin roosevelt would have waged that fight with delight in recent days president clinton has shown signs of new vigor in opposing congressional republicans he made rousing speeches against the socalled legal reform act and in defense of medicare and abortion rights he stood fast behind his nomination of dr henry w foster jr to be surgeon general he threatened to veto legislation he criticized but if he wants his new resolve to be credible , mr clinton will have to not just threaten but use the veto power and legislation is moving toward him that will be a tough test of his willingness to do that the legislation is the appropriations rescission bill in both houses timber interests have had tacked onto it a rider allowing clearcutting of trees in public forests that are imminently susceptible to fire or insect attack that sweeping language could cover just about any tree and the rider goes much further it provides that any cutting shall be deemed to satisfy environmental statutes in short , that those protective laws are suspended last , and most devastating as a precedent , the bill would restrict the right to challenge timbering plans in court it is tough to veto an appropriations bill but this one is a dramatic case of narrow interests using appropriations as a tricky way to gain their end will bill clinton have the backbone to say no \?
washington , feb 25 they might be flustered by the daily news conferences , the constant drumbeat of talk radio and all the bright young freshmen with their laminated copies of the contract with america but james madison and the rest of the framers would understand very well the underlying dynamic of the first two months of this 104th congress , scholars say after years when the house and the senate seemed to be growing more and more alike , the institutions have reverted to classic and very distinctive form in recent months the house , claiming a populist mandate , is roaring through legislation at an astonishing pace the senate , with a new democratic minority embracing its deliberative tradition , has spent the past month debating one measure , the constitutional amendment to balance the budget capitol hill has become , in other words , a case study in bicameralism fit for the federalist papers , revised and updated for the age of gingrich senator robert c byrd , the 77yearold democrat from west virginia , stood on the floor of the senate this week , where he has seemed to be rooted of late , and scoffed at the fact that the house had spent just two days on the balancedbudget amendment i thank god for the united states senate ! mr byrd declared across the capitol and a world apart , representative jon christenson , a 32yearold freshman republican from omaha in his first elective office , said of mr byrd , the senate needs to change its rules so we do n't have people like the king of pork thwarting the will of the american people ross k baker , a political scientist at rutgers university , said if james madison were to come back and sit in the gallery of the house and senate , he 'd be pretty pleased with the way things are working the house is responding to the shortterm influences of the election and the senate is taking a longer and more measured and typically a broader view of the contract this dynamic is of more than scholarly interest it affects lobbying decisions , democratic strategy in the white house and on capitol hill , even the behavior of some moderate republicans in the house who may privately see the senate as a safety net as they vote for legislation they might otherwise have qualms about \( representative barney frank , democrat of massachusetts , says the senate has become the moderates' enabler \) representative sherwood boehlert , a republican from upstate new york , said he cautioned against that temptation at a recent meeting with fellow moderates i expressed the concern that a lot of republicans are going along with the idea that the senate will save us from ourselves , he said for their part , many house democrats , who as a class rarely saw much virtue in the senate in the past \( when it was blocking their legislation \) , now often view it as a last , best hope to temper the spending cuts and government rollbacks being pushed through a republican house democrats in the senate , particularly mr byrd , are capitalizing on the ample prerogatives afforded the minority party by senate rules and its traditions of largely unlimited debate and amendment none of this means , of course , that the senate , in the end , will produce vastly different legislative results from the house \( after a month of debate , for example , the senate vote this coming tuesday on the balancedbudget amendment is still considered too close to call \) conservative republicans are in the majority in both chambers for the first time in 40 years , and their leaders are determined to make the most of this moment senator pete v domenici , republican of new mexico and chairman of the budget committee , argued that although the senate might be moving slowly , it could still end up in the same philosophical place as the house moreover , the contrast between the two chambers may be at its peak at the moment because of speaker newt gingrich s commitment to bringing the entire contract with america , the house republican platform from the 1994 campaign , before the house in the session s first 100 days along the way , he is demonstrating just how quickly the house can move when there is a majority party with discipline and a leadership willing to muscle bills through at a recent republican meeting , according to a participant , the house majority leader , dick armey , toldthe senate majority leader , bob dole , that although both chambers were legislating , the house was making sausage while the senate was curing ham still , the sweeping turnover in the house has highlighted the more fundamental , institutional and intentional differences between the two chambers the senate was always intended to be the more deliberative body , said charles jones , a political scientist from the university of wisconsin the provision that onethird of the senate stands for reelection every two years \( compared with all of the house \) means it s unlikely to ever reflect a great big mass movement out in the country , mr jones added \( not until 1913 were senators even directly elected by voters before that , they were chosen by state legislatures \) as warren b rudman , a former republican senator from new hampshire , put it , you 've got a huge number of new people in the house , and they 're voting on a number of things they just do n't have the time or the background to evaluate the senate has much more of an institutional memory on things like wic and the school lunch program this institutional identity some would call it superiority runs deep after the house roared through the national security provisions of the contract with america last week , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said in an interview what you will see come out of the senate will be a much more mature version , if i may be so condescending i expect more indepth debate , in hearings and on the floor analysts like mr jones note that the house is rewriting fundamental policies on poverty , crime and the legal and regulatory systems at an extraordinary rate in january , mr jones said , the house was in session 16 days and held 143 committee meetings during the same month two years ago , it was in session seven days and held 39 committee meetings the idea that you 'd do all these fundamental things fast is a little scary , the political scientist said so here comes the senate , like the manager in what we used to call baseball , coming out to slow things down or , in a renowned \( and perhaps apocryphal \) metaphor used by george washington , as he supposedly defended the creation of the senate to thomas jefferson we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it an administration official said the housesenate dynamic has much to do with when the president speaks out on a measure there s so much going on now you have to pick your spots , he said the official described many of the initial battles in the house , where democrats lack the protections afforded the minority in the senate , as a time to tell a story , through their amendments and their floor fights , about who the republicans are and what they 're trying to do the democrats' hope , of course , is that in the senate and in conference committees they can more effectively shape the legislation but ed gillespie , a spokesman for mr armey , said that while the pace of the two chambers might be quite different , we think in the end , most of what we pass here will prevail there the case study , in other words , continues
washington , march 20 in an embarrassing setback , the clinton administration has abandoned a lengthy effort to install its candidate as head of the new world trade organization and will announce on tuesday that it is endorsing europe s choice , renato ruggiero of italy the move ends a divisive deadlock involving countries on three continents and assures that mr ruggiero , a longtime diplomat who was once italy s trade minister , will take up the post this spring but under conditions negotiated by the clinton administration in recent days , mr ruggiero will be limited to one fouryear term , and the major trading partners have agreed that his successor will not be a european , senior administration officials said until just a few weeks ago , american officials argued that mr ruggiero was a glorified bureaucrat who embodied the protectionist leanings of european governments on agriculture and a range of other issues they asserted that he lacked the influence to shape the first years of an organization that is to become , in essence , a united nations of international trade , with broad authority to set rules and arbitrate disputes between nations the candidate favored by washington , former president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico , dropped out three weeks ago , after it became clear that he bore some responsibility for mexico s economic crisis and when the arrest of his brother in connection with a political killing made his candidacy untenable the white house , after unsuccessfully searching for an alternative and dismissing the idea of supporting the third candidate , kim chul su , a south korean economist , concluded that it had no choice but to back mr ruggiero the race for director general became a hemispheric conflict that was not in the interest of the united states or the wto , a senior official said today we have worked diligently for the past 10 days to get the assurances that we need about the direction of the organization , and in the end we got those assurances , which were critical the move will undoubtedly anger south korea and other asian allies , who have promoted mr kim s candidacy but the key to his candidacy was the support of japan , and in recent days japanese diplomats , sensing the way the argument was going , have begun to sing the praise of mr ruggiero as a man who had opened some of italy s most protected markets mr ruggiero , a big man with a deep laugh and skills in half a dozen languages , has campaigned for the job since last june he quickly secured the support of all the european nations and most former european colonies but under the illdefined electoral rules of the new organization , which is the successor to the general agreement on tariffs and trade s secretariat , the director general had to be elected by a consensus that was led by the world s largest trading nations at a lunch with american reporters several months ago , mr ruggiero cast himself as an honest broker among the competing interests of the trade organization s more than 120 nations he talked extensively of the need to bring developing countries and emerging markets into central roles in the new , genevabased group , which will possess , at least on paper , far more power to administer world trade rules than any international group since the end of world war ii but mr ruggiero spoke of the need to build an efficient bureaucracy rather than to bring about revolutionary change that was exactly what had the clinton administration worried he s a glorified bureaucrat , an administration official said several weeks ago today , though , the administration tone had changed , and mr ruggiero was hailed by a senior official as a man who certainly has the experience another official involved acknowledged , however , that the united states had to give ground because we were the ones who came up with the candidate who did n't make it several diplomats here who have monitored the uneasy talks among the united states , europeans and asians said today that they expected mr ruggiero to bend over backward in the next year or so to accommodate american interests in some ways i think the administration is better off this way , an ambassador from a pacific region nation said today he knows that everyone is going to be looking for any evidence that he s protecting european farmers or helping to keep american movies out of france he s going to be careful the world trade organization s first responsibility , and mr ruggiero s , will be to apply the complex provisions of the new gatt accord , which embraces more than 20 , 000 pages and a score of subagreements the accord was approved by congress last fall , but only after a lastminute compromise with senator bob dole , the republican leader , to establish a commission of american judges to review decisions by the trade group that go against american interests if the panel finds a pattern of such judgments , congress must review american participation in the organization the race for director general came , over time , to reflect three very different visions of the future of the world economy the united states pressed for deregulation and change toward the principles of a market economy the europeans seemed to seek an organization that gave greater attention to protecting farmers and to individual national sensitivities asian nations pursued an asian model of development strong central government leadership of industry , often with a detailed industrial policy in the end , the race turned into a power struggle , in which none of the three regions wanted to give ground clearly , we were headed for an indefinite deadlock unless someone took the initiative , a senior administration official said mr ruggiero s first test will probably come tuesday in washington , where he is expected to appear with mickey kantor , the united states trade representative , for the formal blessing of his candidacy he will also attend meetings with other american officials , who are expected to describe their expectations for the trade organization s early days and the informal agreements worked out among trade ministers lately in some detail mr ruggiero will be required to walk a fine line between accommodating those in washington who view the organization as antiamerican , and those elsewhere who say that the united states has dominated international economic organizations he will also have to try to persuade the united states to give up the tactic of trade retaliation against individual rivals in favor of multilateral rules , something the administration has sometimes been loath to do , especially given the visible success of its threats against japan and china in the last year chart renato ruggiero born april 9 ,

washington , jan 27 the house majority leader , representative dick armey of texas , set off a dispute on capitol hill today when he referred to representative barney frank , one of several openly homosexual members of congress , as barney fag mr armey said later that he had simply mispronounced mr frank s name first privately and then in addressing the house , he apologized to mr frank for the remark , which he had made in an interview with a group of radio broadcasters in his statement on the house floor , mr armey also attacked the news media for reporting the remark , whose disclosure he had tried to squelch he said news organizations were casting it as an intentional personal attack on mr frank , a massachusetts democrat who has emerged as an effective floor leader for his party in the house mr frank did not take the floor himself but , in an interview with reporters after he and mr armey had spoken privately , seemed clearly upset he said the remark reflected a climate of meanness and intolerance with the republicans while he declined to undertake a fullfledged attack in response , he also refused to wholly accept mr armey s apology i do n't think it was on the tip of his tongue , but i do believe it was in the back of his mind , mr frank said there are a lot of ways to mispronounce my name that is the least common mr frank said the comment would not affect his working relationship with mr armey but other democrats , in a week when political feelings in congress were already raw , seized on the episode and tried to turn it to their advantage this republican leadership seems to have a habit of calling its political opponents names , representative john lewis of georgia said at a news conference where at least 12 democrats took turns attacking mr armey and the republicans there is no place for this kind of behavior in our political discourse and representative carolyn b maloney , democrat of manhattan , said i think they are attacking barney because he is such an effective spokesperson for the democratic party it goes beyond the pale the remark by mr armey , a sixterm conservative who is second in power in the house only to speaker newt gingrich , also brought a host of denunciations by groups representing homosexuals they said it not only was offensive but also encouraged a climate of antigay violence the events began at a weekly briefing that mr armey holds in his office for radio broadcasters preparing weekend programs at the briefing today were four reporters , representing the associated press , abc , cbs and standard news , an independent radio news service during the interview , mr armey discussed a book , to be published in april , that he has written about freedom at one point in the discussion , he turned to the recent house furor over mr gingrich s own book deal newt s a very patient fellow and able to handle a harangue going on around him better than i , mr armey said i like peace and quiet , and i do n't have to listen to barney fag barney frank haranguing in my ear because i made a few bucks off a book i worked on in what remained of the interview , none of the reporters commented on the remark but later , after reviewing their tapes , they called mr armey s office to ask about it the episode escalated from there first mr armey moved quickly to try to head off any adverse effects he implored the reporters who had been in his office for the taping not to broadcast the remark , but by then , word of it had already begun circulating he then sought out mr frank on the house floor to explain what had occurred and to apologize on a day when republicans had expected to bask in the glory of the house s passage of a balancedbudget amendment on thursday night , mr armey s comment quickly became the talk of the capitol and forced him to address the matter publicly on the floor mr frank was not on the floor at that point but watched on a television set in his office as mr armey spoke to the members i take strong exception to the airing of the tape and even the transcribing of a stumbled word as if it were an intentional personal attack , the majority leader shouted during a speech in which he was flushed with anger and his lips quivered and i take this exception especially in light of the fact that i went to the press that had the tape and explained to them in the best humor i could that i had simply mispronounced a name and did not need any psychoanalysis about my subliminal or about my freudian predilections mr armey chastised some democrats as well , saying that with all the issues the new republican majority are bringing to the floor of this house , they chose instead to focus on what he called an innocent mispronunciation it is regrettable , he said , that the mangling of a name in a way that would be clearly offensive had it been intended should shift the public debate away from issues like balancing the budget , cutting taxes and reforming our failed welfare system a fuming ed gillespie , mr armey s chief spokesman , said the democrats' attacks were motivated by nothing but a desire to gain partisan advantage photos representative dick armey \(

washington , june 22 in a gambit to build support for tight curbs on federal environmental regulations , senator bob dole , the majority leader , today published a new draft bill that preserved the probusiness heart of his legislation while conceding enough in details to satisfy a crucial democratic ally while mr dole won over senator j bennett johnston , a louisiana democrat who has long crusaded to reduce the costs of environmental regulations , other influential democrats continued to hold out , and clinton administration officials and environmentalists strongly criticized major elements of the dolejohnston deal the bill would sharply limit the federal government s authority to enforce regulations under laws that protect health , safety and the environment at the same time , it would give businesses new opportunities to appeal rules in court and would increase the burden on agencies to prove , through extensive studies , that their rules reduce environmental risks at a reasonable price this maneuvering in the senate brings the most significant environmental issue to come before the congress since the republicans took power to a crucial juncture mr dole wants to begin debate on tuesday , but only if he believes he has enough votes to thwart a filibuster the jury is still out on that , said senator john glenn , democrat of ohio , who has prepared an alternative bill i think bringing it to the floor next week is optimistic scheduling , if they want to make it bipartisan greg wetstone , legislative director for the natural resources defense council , said the group was urging democrats to oppose this , to fight it every way they can but it is moderates like mr glenn , not the environmental groups , who hold the most influence over the democrats in the current senate mr dole s tactics in reaching out to mr johnston , and the reception their joint proposal received , suggested that he might not yet have enough support to pass a bill that businesses enthusiastically support , but that environmentalists have said would undermine an entire generation of protective regulations a similar bill rolled through the house of representatives like a bulldozer during the first 100 days of the 104th congress , as part of the republicans' contract with america but in the senate , despite broad sentiment for some kind of regulatory relief for businesses , the threat of a filibuster has stymied those who want radical changes in how regulations are written both mr dole and mr johnston described their latest version of the bill as a discussion draft and promised to negotiate further with democrats during the weekend but as leading democrats and environmental lobbyists paged through the new draft today , they said that its central provisions , and some of its concessions to particular interest groups , were still profoundly troublesome as just one example of the bill s farreaching effects , the critics pointed out that it could bring to a halt hundreds of major projects to clean up hazardous waste dumps under the superfund and other laws while regulators reconsidered the risks presented by the pollution at each site , and sought cheaper and more flexible ways to clean it up three features of the bill are at the heart of the debate how it tries to balance the costs and benefits of rules how it allows regulated industries to appeal rules in court , and how it requires federal agencies to review and amend regulations that have long been on the books while senators dole and johnston agreed to changes in all three areas , none of the changes completely addressed the problems that the clinton administration has long seen in mr dole s approach , an administration lawyer said the administration s strategy for now is to bolster democratic senators' opposition to the dole bill , and to hope that an acceptable compromise can occur , rather than to threaten a veto on an issue that enjoys broad support in congress but as the dole bill stands , the administration would probably find it unacceptable in the end , no less so after it is reconciled with what has already passed the house the bill would fundamentally alter the calculus used to enforce a wide range of laws affecting health , safety and the environment it would affect rules governing air quality , toxic wastes , food additives , workplace safety , automobile standards and more the bill would reopen thousands of existing regulations to review , and would raise the burden of proof on federal agencies when they are taken to court to justify their regulations even though the bill states that its intent is to supplement and not supersede existing laws , it would give extraordinary weight to enormously complex calculations of costs , benefits , and risks while proponents say that approach is just common sense , opponents say that it guts the central premise of many environmental laws that protecting the public s health is the paramount consideration the legislation has become the highest priority for a broad coalition of industries , which have been pressing for the most farreaching version possible but the bill s momentum has been slowed to the stately deliberative pace of the senate , with three different committees drafting variations on the theme also , mr dole knew he needed time to gather the 60 votes to avoid the filibuster that liberals have threatened if the measure favors business groups too much on wednesday , informing the senate that the full text would be published in the congressional record this morning , mr dole said he would like to begin debate on the bill on tuesday , possibly incorporating further changes during the weekend but he cautioned that i do not want to suggest we are going to rewrite the whole thing mr glenn responded that he had a proposal of his own , based on a bill that passed the governmental affairs committee on a unanimous bipartisan vote earlier this year he said he would like to find a compromise between the two approaches whether that can be done in time enough to bring a completed form to the floor by next tuesday , i do not know , mr glenn said but we can sure take a crack at it and see mr johnston said that in negotiations with mr dole during the past two weeks the complex bill had been changed more than 100 times he called it an excellent bill that i can enthusiastically support , but he also suggested that there are a lot of things i would like to change
none of the nation s most prominent forecasters was more pessimistic about what 1994 would bring for the american economy than irwin l kellner , senior economic adviser at chemical bank everything pointed to weakness , he recalled recently mr kellner said he thought a year ago that the clinton tax increase for the wealthy would inhibit spending among the rich , and that would have a ripple effect on the less affluent neither happened mr kellner also thought low inflation would hold back spending after all , why hurry to buy to beat price increases if none is on the horizon \? people bought anyway and he never dreamed that the money many homeowners saved by refinancing their mortgages would be spent so lavishly on consumer goods in retrospect , mr kellner said , he underestimated the power of low interest rates and plentiful credit , not to mention the pentup demand for new cars and the cleverness of the auto manufacturers in designing leasing plans to move cars from showrooms to the nation s garages finally , european economies recovered more strongly than mr kellner had expected as a result , europeans bought ever larger quantities of american goods a weak dollar helped by making united states goods more competitive in price in sum , whatever could converge to boost the economy in 1994 converged , including the california earthquake , which resulted in billions of dollars in spending for reconstruction , he said but anyone who was right about the economy in 1994 was right for the wrong reason we were wrong for the right reasons mr kellner , who is , as he puts it , always on the lookout for what could upset the apple cart , decided a year ago that 1994 would produce a rise in the nation s output of goods and services of only 17 percent among the 50 forecasters surveyed by blue chip economic indicators in december 1993 , his estimate of the growth in gross domestic product was the lowest even the most optimistic forecasters , however , fell short of the approximately 4 percent that has turned out to be the actual growth rate in calendar 1994 the average forecast of 29 percent growth was way off the mark as well but the blue chip forecasters , as a whole , were much closer to the actual 26 percent inflation rate this year mr kellner gave the lowball estimate there too 15 percent none of the forecasters expected the federal reserve to raise interest rates as much as it did the expectation that jobs and incomes would stagnate shaped mr kellner s thinking this has been a successful theme of his for years like a modernday cassandra , mr kellner was almost alone in the late 1980 s in forecasting the recession that finally appeared in the summer of 1990 and that summer , mr kellner was among the first to recognize that a recession had begun he urged the federal reserve to ease up on interest rates , which it finally did in the early fall for the first year of this recovery , employment declined and the unemployment rate kept rising , he said i was impressed with the lack of job creation in 1992 and 1993 , and i was also impressed with the low quality of pay but people are sophisticated they have found offsets , although one wonders how long they can continue to do so all of which brings mr kellner to 1995 his forecast is for economic growth of 25 percent to 3 percent , which puts him close to the consensus forecast of 29 percent in the blue chip survey the economy has a lot of momentum , mr kellner said , and we do n't think the federal reserve will create a recession by raising interest rates too much in this case , we are optimistic in our forecast that the fed can engineer a slowdown drawing
mexico s surprise devaluation of the peso last dec 20 was not altogether a surprise around washington , economists who were watching mexico had been warning that such a step was all but inevitable sometime one prominent advocate of devaluation said , the day it was announced , that it was time for the smart money to move into mexico but what the economists failed to anticipate was the financial explosion that followed a free fall of the currency a mass exodus by investors from markets as farflung as buenos aires , bangkok and new delhi , and a very dark cloud over the previously bright prospects of a halfdozen latin american countries referring last week to the biggest financial meltdown in recent memory , stanley fischer , the deputy managing director of the international monetary fund , admitted to a crowd of 150 economists who wanted to know what had gone wrong everybody underestimated the reaction of the capital markets not quite everybody guillermo calvo , an economist at the university of maryland and a former senior adviser to the imf , was the most prominent of the pessimists for most of last year he had , in fact , been issuing dire warnings mexico was sitting on a financial powder keg , he argued , and america s firefighting equipment a 6 billion insurance fund was woefully inadequate more a softspoken theoretical economist than a policy showboat , professor calvo has spent much of his career , as one admirer put it , thinking beyond the conventional wisdom at a seminar at the brookings institution last april , for example , professor calvo argued that a devaluation would shatter confidence devaluation may sow the seeds of destruction authorities would have revealed their taste for discretionary policy and people may come to believe that it could happen again if a devaluation became unavoidable , he added , how it was handled would be paramount devaluation taken without prior consultation and support from mexico s nafta partners , may prove to be a poison pill the only way to prevent an allout run against the peso , he said , was to obtain the full backing of the united states in advance it is imperative that mexico obtain ample support from the us treasury \( the numbers recently seen in the press look rather small \) , making it perfectly clear that the support would be automatic like federal deposit insurance in the united states , the professor reasoned , a big credit line backing the mexican government would reassure investors if the line were big enough , a run would be averted and the line would never have to be tapped otherwise , he said , investors whose faith in the mexican government had already been shaken by the chiapas rebellion would take a devaluation as a sign that the government could n't be trusted to defend the currency in the future the fear of further declines in the peso would become a selffulfilling prophecy only a few people like professor calvo anticipated the magnitude of the change in confidence and that s the magnitude of the risk , says nancy birdsall , executive vice president of the interamerican development bank everybody talks about volatile financial markets , but we were all surprised by the complete collapse of confidence she adds people were listening to calvo , but they were n't listening hard enough before the devaluation announcement , there was apparently little advance consultation between mexico city and washington the imf the world s watchdog for exchange rate crises was notified only hours before the backup credit , 6 billion , turned out to be a fraction of the size the united states treasury later decided it needed to be 60 billion it took weeks to appreciate the sheer scale of the problem professor calvo s pessimistic view was based largely on two observations first , there were huge pools of highly liquid capital that could leave mexico at a moment s notice the money supply had increased tremendously since the beginning of 1990 , when the reforms began , says professor calvo in an interview i found that very suspicious and dangerous in principle the peso did not have enough backing he adds it s like taking the dollar off the gold standard second , mexico s government did not have anywhere near the credibility with investors of , say , an italy or a britain the relatively large difference between yields for dollar and peso

when robert wilson and tom waits were conferring about how to follow up on the success of the black rider , the pop opera they created with william burroughs , they hit upon the idea of adapting the alice in wonderland stories by charles l dodgson , better known as lewis carroll then , casting about for a literary collaborator , mr wilson decided against mr burroughs , even though the wilsonwaitsburroughs team had proved a publicity bonanza burroughs and waits are very much alike , mr wilson explained recently by telephone from france this time i wanted to do something different and i was looking for someone who would be a good complement between tom and myself that is , someone to serve as a bridge between his own austere visual orientation and mr waits s carnivalesque poprock so for alice , which had its premiere in 1992 at the thalia theater in hamburg , germany , and which opens on friday at the brooklyn academy of music , mr wilson called on his old friend paul schmidt , a new yorker whose resume zooms from russian scholarship and translations of french poetry to acting jobs in everything from classical repertory to all my children paul s a scholar who knows theater , and his background in literature helped a lot , mr wilson explained it s very difficult to do 'alice' because it s one episode after another , and the characters often do n't reappear how do you structure the story to make an evening of theater \? because paul saw lewis carroll not just as a writer but as a man of letters , as a mathematician , as a priest , we hit on the idea of seeing the show through the eyes of charles dodgson i put together a storyboard , and paul helped me fill it in mr wilson was not the first major theater director to come calling on mr schmidt , a 61yearold brooklyn native who now lives in manhattan in fact , although he earned degrees from harvard university in slavic languages , as a theater artist mr schmidt has majored in oddball projects by eccentric geniuses for the wooster group s brace up ! \( 1990 \) , the director elizabeth lecompte asked him for a translation of chekhov s three sisters that could incorporate dance sequences , television technology and japanese theater techniques and by the way , would he play dr chebutykin as well \? translating the complete works of velemir khlebnikov , a littleknown poet who died of malnutrition in 1922 at the age of 37 , has been a lifelong passion for mr schmidt , and he talked the adventurous peter sellars into staging khlebnikov s zangezi \( seen in los angeles in 1986 and at the brooklyn academy of music the next year \) subtitled a supersaga in 20 planes , this idiosyncratic stage poem required mr schmidt to write scenes in english that simulated the languages of birds , of gods and of what the poet called beyonsense when i went to school in the 50 s , mr schmidt said the other day at a coffeehouse near his chelsea apartment , there was much talk about being a renaissance man the ideal was to be wellrounded but the same people who were telling you this , whether they knew it or not , were training to make good insurance salesmen out of you in american terms , there s no point to being wellrounded it was silly on the other hand , i did it mr schmidt first pursued an academic career , partly because his father disapproved of theater as a profession but at harvard , while finishing his phd \( he wrote his dissertation on the russian director vsevolod meyerhold \) , he fell in with a nowlegendary circle of friends who produced summer seasons of plays at radcliffe s agassiz theater this group included the future star actors lindsay crouse , tommy lee jones , john lithgow and stockard channing \( to whom mr schmidt was later married for seven years \) , but its strongest personality was timothy mayer , a fiercely talented and chronically underachieving writerdirector who died of cancer in 1988 from meyerhold and mayer , mr schmidt acquired the principles that he would apply throughout his work in the theater mayer stressed the importance of speaking to an audience in its own language meyerhold envisioned a theater of spectacle in which the primary creator is the director , whose design and staging essentially rewrite the play meyerhold s example has fueled the work of many of contemporary theater s most imaginative directors , and none more so than robert wilson mr wilson may be the latest theater giant mr schmidt has worked with , but he is the one mr schmidt has known the longest they met on a street corner in austin , tex , in 1960 when mr wilson , just out of waco high school , was studying business administration at the university of texas mr schmidt , just out of the army , was teaching french there they have remained friends since with bob , the genesis is always visual , mr schmidt said he said 'all i know is i want there to be two acts and we should have either five and seven scenes in each act , and somehow i see the middle scene in each act as different from the scenes around them but very similar to each other' i went home with the alice books and quickly saw there s not much to dramatize she just goes from one incident to another we picked out the scenes we thought would work best and tried to find a scenario to hold it together the scenario mr schmidt presented to mr wilson pivoted on dodgson s obsession with photographing girls nobody really objected to his wanting to take pictures of them in their underwear , mr schmidt said , but there was a point at which alice liddell s mother said to him it would be better if he did n't write her any more love letters for the acts' centerpieces , mr schmidt wrote monologues for alice and dodgson , who reflect years later on their relationship and circle closer to the subject of pedophilia than lewis carroll ever did i was wide with my dreams that s what he hated , mr schmidt has alice say he wanted to keep me away from my dreams with his cardgames and wordgames , and the pitiful monsters who lived in his head to fit mr wilson s visual scheme , mr schmidt used familiar scenes from alice s adventures in wonderland , like the mad hatter s tea party carroll nonsense verses , and even some of his word puzzles one thing that s special about paul is he knew my work from the beginning , mr wilson said i started out with works that were silent then i did plays that were texts of nonsense , where the words were just sounds later i did texts that made sense but paul has always been fascinated with the integrity of the word , not only with its meaning , but with its sound and its musicality that s something we share so in creating a text for alice , mr schmidt knew how to feed mr wilson flavors that he liked \? exactly photo paul schmidt , scholar , actor , writer in american terms , there s no point to being wellrounded on the other hand , i did it \( chang w lee the new york times \)

when aunt chiche went for her checkbook , i thought i had it made there i was , a young playwright home for the holidays , watching my 86yearold great aunt , my family s final link to old money , teetering toward her purse with a pen in her hand i could barely contain my joy i had just laid bare my ambitions and neediness and she 'd bought it i envisioned my actors getting paid , my fourcolored posters plastered on the walls of soho and my production heading straight to i saw a 50 bill for the taxi back from the airport , honey said my dear old aunt welcome to the sordid world of off off broadway it is a world where actors and stagehands are more likely to be paid with brunch than cash where day jobs and conflicting schedules make for midnight rehearsals , where investors want more letters home here , the constant groveling for help and money is considered an art form and legions of young unknowns hurl themselves into outrageous projects , desperate to avoid that most insidious of poison anonymity unfortunately , it has been my world but after six years of storing up favors , building sets , raising money for others , sweeping up rubble backstage , this month , at age 24 , i finally got my chance my own play on stage in the process of getting it to its feet , i turned an art gallery into a parking lot , pushed good friendships to the limit and spent a good portion of my life savings why i and so many others go through and try to buck the odds is no mystery we have no choice in america s theater scene , all roads lead through new york but beyond the professional necessity , there is something else i left kansas city when i was 18 , and came to new york to go to acting school , fully expecting to be a star it did n't work out that way i became a clerk i remember after i arrived , watching the speed and flow of the city s pedestrians , and now i feared becoming another piece of that mass new york is oppressive that way in my mind , the play was my chance to show the world that i was more than a paper pusher every night , all over the city , you 'll find an off off broadway production , put on by the same people who serve your meals , deliver your messages by bicycle or sell you theater subscriptions over the phone the creations from their minds include the stories of cannibalistic biker girls , pajamaclad postapocalyptic wanderers , singing and dancing lizzie bordens and stagings of more traditional fare , like brecht , chekhov and shakespeare i finished my play in august the product of sporadic obsession , it had taken four years to write it was a dark comedy based on shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream entitled quick bright things i placed updated midsummer s players in present day nevada , and set the whole thing at a stripbar bordering a nuclear test site in the play , a rock 'n' roll cowboy returns after a decade , intent on reassembling the family he left behind it was a stretch but that was the idea my first draft included 146 pages , 3 acts , 21 characters , and too many subplots i gathered some friends for the first readthrough , to hear the words that had sat on the page for so long it took place on oct 17 , lasted threeandahalf hours and cost me a case of beer by the end , the compliments were flowing so were suggestions for cuts before the play went into production problem was , there was no production getting the space i had a play but nowhere to put it there was one hope i had been promoted in june to managing director of teleotheater , a small threeyearold company teleotheater had just got its first break a residency at here , a performance space in soho for normally transient off off broadway companies , residencies are golden , providing office space and a place to perform being the managing director was a glorified way of saying i handled the business side of things the position was unpaid and largely bureaucratic but i thought it would give me a chance to get my work produced but by the time i had finished the play teleo had booked its two slots for the season and the schedule at here was full rental fees for another theater would be prohibitive but then , the god of bankruptcy stepped in 3 bill , another resident company at here , hit hard times and forfeited its three week slot in january in the main theater at here i asked whether the slot might be available randy rollison , coartistic director of here and a mentor of mine , warned me that eight weeks was n't a lot of time to prepare a new play i did n't care he warned me of problems getting rehearsal time i still did n't care he warned that very loud shows might go on in the other theater i wanted my show up barbara busachino , another artistic director , said , if you 've got the gumption , it s yours i had the gumption and then , i had the space getting the money i decided to act as producer of my own play for two reasons one , i had produced before , and two , i was so much of an egotist that i felt only i would get it just right and everything needed to be just right
barbra streisand spoke out for the national endowment for the arts at harvard madonna and rem have hit the radio with publicservice ads extolling the nea but it was garth brooks , kenny g and michael bolton pop stars ranging from middleoftheroad to muzak who stared down the republican majority in the 104th congress last week and it was congress that blinked the three musicians lobbied the hill for the arts endowment on tuesday on thursday the house voted 260 to 168 to defeat an amendment tripling the cut in the 1995 nea budget with 75 republicans , newtish freshmen among them , in the majority it s not in the bag by a long shot , rightly cautions christopher reeve , the most persistent showbiz lobbyist for the endowment this year the agency could yet be killed outright but mr reeve is not alone in feeling nascent optimism after last week for the first time in the culture war of '95 , the antinea forces were thrown on the defensive newt gingrich , who has called the endowment art patronage for an elite group and has refused to meet with its chairwoman , jane alexander , could not resist sitting down with mr brooks , the multimillionaire countrywestern icon who is , of course , no elitist one witness to the meeting described the speaker as eagerly expressing affection for his hometown atlanta ballet and high museum , both nea grantees subsequently , he waffled to the press about the agency s fate kenny g , meanwhile , politely chastised steve gunderson , the wisconsin republican floating an nea privatization scheme , for refusing to go to the mat for the arts i told him his proposal was wimpy , mr g explained on the phone later , though i did n't use the word wimpy none of these encounters happened by chance the pronea troops have found a general michael greene , ceo of the national academy of recording arts and sciences a georgian who overlapped with mr gingrich at west georgia college , mr greene first took command at the grammy awards on march 1 , when , in defiance of cbs dictums , he gave an endowmentadvocacy speech with an 800 number \( 6511575 \) calls and telegrams have flooded congress ever since when mr greene brought his pop threesome to washington on tuesday , he did so in sync with a mass lobbying day organized by the american council for the arts , an association of the nation s highculture institutions the powerhouse kickoff speaker was a conservative republican winton blount , the alabama industrialist and arts philanthropist who partially privatized the postal service when in the nixon cabinet but who dismissed rhetoric about privatizing the nea as demagoguery mr greene cast his star lobbyists as shrewdly as the arts council chose mr blount neither garth nor i am particularly liberal , mr greene explained in an interview , adding that he decided to avoid hollywood s stereotypical personalities in picking the cadre that stormed the hill should he just happen to help orchestrate an nea pitch at the oscars , do n't expect the spokesperson to be susan sarandon yet mr greene does n't pull punches about his enemy in this war noting that the endowment s annual 167 million is too small to contribute to serious budget balancing , he adds this is n't about mapplethorpe or serrano , either it s about the political agenda of the religious right their minions are spending millions and millions of dollars trying to smudge the political reputation of people who do n't think like they think or believe what they believe that is mccarthyism , and that is frightening as exhibit a , he cited a newly circulating fundraising letter from the christian action network , promising to hold mr gingrich s and his congress s feet to the fire to eliminate this hateful , blasphemous and prohomosexual federal agency but the political lesson of last week is that moderates are finally mobilizing to hold the republicans' feet to the fire on this issue , too , just as they are starting to do on other religiousright crusades like abortion and school prayer it will take a grotesque brand of mccarthyism indeed for the gop s extremists to portray federal arts funding as an assault on mainstream american values when the likes of garth brooks is loudly singing the nea s praises from the middle of the road
fort lauderdale , fla , march 27 george steinbrenner swooped into the yankees' spring training complex here today sounding extremely edgy about voting to lock out major leaguers if the national labor relations board obtains an injunction that would prompt the players to scrap their strike it s not like i'm after a lockout , steinbrenner said sharply although the yankee owner did not make a definitive announcement , his hints of doubt were intriguing because only 8 of the 28 owners need to vote against a lockout to prevent one there is a growing feeling among some owners opposed to a lockout that there would be enough votes to block one , and steinbrenner is counted among those who would most likely vote against it more than one owner said the yankees , the mets , the orioles , the dodgers and the blue jays would be likely to resist a lockout one of the owners added san diego to that list and speculated that cleveland and colorado could also join the group if it came to a vote steinbrenner said he did not know if the owners would get the votes for a lockout and indicated he was as curious as anyone about how the other owners might react i have n't talked to many of them , he said i do n't know what would happen i'm not sure i'm for a lockout i have no idea how a vote would go i'm not predicting what the guys would vote one owner widely believed to be against a lockout , fred wilpon of the mets , declined to discuss his view today i have a view , and it s a very strong view , and i 've articulated that view very strongly within the walls of the meeting room , he said but i do n't think it s appropriate to express that view publicly right now when the vote is taken , i think it will be clear where we stand but the mets' position on using replacement players is no secret they dislike them intensely and they are almost certain to vote against a lockout if steinbrenner is indeed against a lockout , that would align the two new york teams with the dodgers , the blue jays and the orioles as the core of resistance the possibility of a lockout has been discussed since the players announced that they will return to work if the nlrb gains the injunction , which would force the clubs to restore salary arbitration and competitive bidding for free agents steinbrenner is trying to gain support for his feeling that a settlement can be reached if the sides stop posturing i'm not sure that i would vote for a lockout , he said i think the way to settle this whole dispute is through negotiation for whatever reason and for whoever s fault it is , the negotiations have not been productive and , to me , it s an embarrassment i'm embarrassed for the players and the owners when it was suggested to steinbrenner that allowing major leaguers back under the rules of 1994 would ruin what the owners had been trying to accomplish in negotiations , he disagreed not if we continue negotiating , steinbrenner said it would have to be with a nostrike clause and nolockout clause we 've got to get negotiating while steinbrenner was chatty about the elements of a lockout , he was quiet when asked about his decision to pay bigger salaries to the eight mostly nondescript minor leaguers who joined the replacement team today the yankees will mimic the dodgers in guaranteeing the four pitchers and four outfielders jobs for the season and paying them monthly minor league salaries of 3 , 000 at class a , 5 , 000 at class aa and 7 , 000 at class aaa if they spend 30 days at that level the average salaries for minor leaguers are about 1 , 200 at class a , 1 , 600 at class aa and 2 , 000 at class aaa presumably , the 10 minor leaguers who have been with the yankees since camp opened will also earn the higher salaries other teams are doing it , said general manager gene michael , who was unable or unwilling to attract more highly regarded minor leaguers we think this will improve the caliber of play among those who were induced to join the replacement team were pitcher mark carper and outfielder bubba carpenter , who were sent home feb 23 for refusing to be replacement players carpenter , a 26yearold with a 280 career batting average , hit 288 with 13 homers and 51 runs batted in for class aa albany last season the 26yearold carper , a righthander who was 86 with a 436 earned run average for class aaa columbus and could be the ace of the staff , has a career record of 2731 with a 399 era those two are the cream of a group that includes al drumheller , tom carter and john sutherland , none of whom has pitched above class aa , and outfielders shane spencer , richard barnwell and lew hill , who have combined for 112 atbats at the class aaa level there s no doubt the financial side comes into it , said carpenter , who made 2 , 100 a month last season and said his decision was endorsed by some major leaguers carper , who had once said he did not want the stress and burden of being branded a scab , conceded that when he was offered a salary of 7 , 000 a month , the financial considerations for his fiancee and 1yearold daughter altered his thinking i'm willing to take that chance now , carper said if major leaguers ca n't understand the difference between me making 2 , 400 a month as opposed to the money they 're offering me to take care of my family , that s their problem
austin , tex , aug 23 of all the rugged souls who roamed the vast and bloody frontier of texas , none are more storied than the texas rangers , the lawmen who patrolled the prairie and quelled mass disturbances by their lonesomes , giving rise to the laconic motto one riot , one ranger and no figures could be more macho the rangers were a completely masculine society , with a deep camaraderie born of open spaces and the campfire , wrote t r fehrenbach in lone star , the encyclopedic history of texas now , 172 years after the founding of the texas rangers , having improbably survived into the modern era as a kind of superelite squad of state troopers whose dress code calls for jeans , western shirts , white cowboy hats and no facial hair , the 100member force is in turmoil over a phenomenon that must have legendary rangers like big foot wallace and lone wolf gonzaullas rolling over in their graves lady rangers acting under heavy political and legal pressure , the rangers announced two years ago that they had selected the first two women rangers in history , an occasion that moved the husband of one , steve steadman , a highway patrolman , almost to tears when you are children playing cops and robbers , you always wanted to be a texas ranger , he said , and now my wife is one but a year after joining , his wife , cheryl campbell steadman , 33 , quit in disgust , saying her career went to hell in a handbasket she complained of routine discrimination and said she had been harassed at an overnight rangers outing in east texas at that event , she said , male rangers drank to excess , gambled and recited a poem about the sexual prowess of a ranger predecessor another woman turned down a promotion into the rangers after clashing with her male superiors over everything from where she would be assigned to just what kind of cowboy hat she could wear on the job a third woman , who is black , says she is still a happy ranger even though two male colleagues were reprimanded by the state last year after they were accused of referring to her with sexual and racial slurs in a private conversation a precedent and a protest the first two women rangers were sworn to duty in august 1993 , and several longtime rangers quit the force within weeks some expressed their dismay that neither woman had any experience as a criminal investigator , while others aired a broader disgust joaquin jackson , a west texas ranger with 27 years on the force , described the hiring of women rangers as to put it in more polite terms than he used ill conceived things are going to have to change a hell of a lot more in this world before a female can ride into some little texas town and tell the sheriff , 'i'm the resident ranger on this case , ' the 6foot5 mr jackson said in a telephone interview from his home in the highdesert town of alpine i do n't care if she s 9 foot tall and meaner than a barrelful of snakes he s not going to talk to her the whole ruckus has prompted some reexamination of just why the texas rangers still exist , long after every equivalent force , including the arizona rangers , has bitten the dust but no one seriously expects the rangers to disband , in part because they remain such a distinctive and almost mythical presence in a state that dearly clings to the idea that texas is dramatically different from the rest of the nation the rangers themselves savor their old west image , even into retirement a caller who gets the answering machine of glenn elliott , who retired from the texas rangers eight years ago , gets the following message hello , this is the ranger speaking old shep and i are out riding the trail , doing what retired rangers do we may be back in three minutes or it could be three days a texas legend in many hearts in fact , all of texas celebrates the legend gov george w bush is partowner of major league baseball s texas rangers , probably the only professional sports franchise in the world named after a lawenforcement agency even the lawmakers who have been the driving force in recent years in the rangers' decision to hire female , hispanic and black rangers would never seriously suggest disbanding the agency i'm a texan , and obviously we 're proud of our texas rangers , said state senator mario gallegos jr , a houston democrat it s just that part of it i'm not proud of the nonrecruitment of minorities and females the classic image of a texas ranger is of a figure riding across the plains on horseback , collaring cattle rustlers or clashing with indians they were not the first rangers in the nation a group in georgia that came out of the scottish tradition of highland rangers flourished in the 1700 s but these guys looked more like rob roy than john wayne , stephen l hardin , a professor at the victoria college in victoria , tex , and the author of a book on the texas rangers , said of the georgia group so it was the texans who became a symbol , in song and on screen , of frontier toughness today s texas ranger is just as apt to be a concrete ranger as a country ranger , cruising the interstate freeways of houston or dallas to pursue leads about drug dealers , conceded

it may seem foolhardy to write again about a socalled emerging market when blood is running all over the floor of latin america s stock exchanges , but then is south korea really an emerging market , given that the term is virtually synonymous with being a developing country \? the international finance corporation , the world bank s business promotion arm , coined the emerging market designation and includes south korea in its index of such markets , as do other financial houses tracking these new and relatively undeveloped stock exchanges yet south korea , along with taiwan , is very close to joining the industrial world and there is a case for saying that its stock market does not deserve to be tarred with the mexican brush in the worldwide flight to quality now under way , seoul may have more to offer than intrinsically weaker emerging economies with an average income of 7 , 670 in 1993 , according to the latest world bank figures , south koreans earn twice the income of workers in malaysia , mexico or indonesia and south korea should cross the 8 , 356 barrier sometime this year , becoming a highincome country instead of a middle income one later this month south korea is due to apply formally to join the organization for economic cooperation and development , the rich countries' paris club south korea , which already has the world s secondlargest steel manufacturer , traditionally vies with japan to be the world s top ship builder last week , it became the 26th country to graduate from the world bank , and is now an aid donor rather than a recipient south korea is on the borderline of becoming a high capital , knowledgebased economy , although its leaders still often see themselves as third world , said robert g rich jr , a former united states ambassador to seoul and head of the korea economic institute of america , which is based in washington south korea s stock market , which peaked last november , has not escaped the emergingmarket selloff brought on by the mexican fiasco , falling about 20 percent since then however , the decline is certainly being aided and abetted by a tighter monetary policy as the central bank fights economic overheating by attempting to slow last year s 9 percent growth rate asia s fastest to a target of 7 percent for 1995 the case for remaining bearish on south korea is essentially political kim jong il s communist state in north korea could implode if it does , the argument goes , south korea would face even greater budgetary strains in taking over that impoverished country than the collapse of east germany placed on west germany after the berlin wall came down since seoul would be forced to pump resources into the north to avert an economic catastrophe there , deficit spending and inflation would rise the bullish case , on the other hand , rests on the premise that none of the above will happen , allowing south korea to gradually expand its business links with the north , effectively taking over north korean economy without undermining the longtime communist state economic integration followed by slow political integration is what the south wants and what would reassure china , said michael porter , an analyst who follows south korea for smith barney inc some south korea watchers expect the present phase of tight liquidity and market weakness to give way to easier conditions later this year , with interest rates coming off their present 15 percent peak and stock prices strengthening according to this view the strength of the japanese yen will help south korea s chaebol , as its dynastically controlled conglomerates are called , to remain competitive , allowing them to cash in on the heavy investments they have made recently in new japanese capital equipment analysts say june s regional elections should encourage monetary easing meanwhile , both domestic and foreign interest in the stock market ought to pick up plans to raise taxes on bankdeposit interest and to make it harder to conceal real estate ownership should push funds toward stocks at the same time , the seoul government plans to raise the 12 percent limit on foreign holdings in any quoted company to 15 percent this year , thus creating more space in the market for foreign investors for all these reasons we expect to see the market rise again later this year , said john bai , the korean expert for baring securities investing in the south korean market is not easy , however individual foreign investors face a regulatory obstacle course , so country funds make the most sense the two oldest , the korea fund and the korea investment fund , traditionally command a premium because they hold blue chips now closed to foreigners the fidelity advisor korean fund and the korea equity fund are more recent , while january saw the creation of the mathews korea fund by the mathews international fund group in san francisco
belfast , northern ireland , may 10 for the first time in 23 years a british government official sat down today for formal talks with standins for the ira , the organization waging a long and violent struggle to unite ulster with the rest of ireland the news was in the event itself , just that it was happening , rather than in any hope that the tortuous , eightmonth peace effort would succumb to a sudden breakthrough none was expected and afterward none reported for more than three hours , each side read statements to the other and laid out longstanding and opposing positions the british government restated its insistence that the irish republican army begin handing over weapons before fullbodied peace talks involving all the parties to the conflict can begin britain says these talks are merely exploratory i was able to explain to them that if we got to the roundtable talks it would have to be on the basis that all parties went there armed only with their mandates , said michael ancram , the northern ireland minister at a news conference and representatives from sinn fein , the ira s political wing , repeated their demand to put demilitarization a code word for the withdrawal of british troops at the top of the agenda in their search for what they call equality of treatment , they asked for a meeting between the sinn fein president , gerry adams , and the top british official responsible for the province , the northern ireland secretary , sir patrick mayhew on tuesday mr mayhew met with leaders from the largest protestant party , the ulster unionists , who advocate staying part of britain , as part of an ongoing effort to sooth fears that the british are not going to force them to join the predominantly catholic irish republic to the south most people would accept it s not unreasonable now for us to want to meet with patrick mayhew in the course of bilateral discussions to which he s invited other parties , martin mcguinness , the chief sinn fein negotiator , said the british team passed along the request but made clear to reporters later that no affirmative answer was to be expected soon not since 1972 when the british government secretly flew mr adams and mr mcguinness to london for talks has a top british official sat facetoface with bargainers from what it regards as a terrorists today mr adams and mr mcguinness are the no 1 and no 2 in the group so there was a sense of historical moment when the five sinn fein delegates arrived at 11 15 am under drizzly skies at the stormont parliament the gigantic columned building was constructed on a high bluff outside belfast in 1928 to house ulster s own assembly its monumental bulk seems to serve as an architectural statement that the province intends to remain separate such an anathema is the building to northern ireland s catholic nationalists , who recall discriminatory legislation passed by the assembly when it was dominated by the majority protestants , that the sinn fein delegation refused to allow television cameramen to use it as a backdrop to its news conference this had not been a problem during half a dozen lower level meetings between sinn fein and british civil servants those sessions have not made progress in resolving any of the key issues that include decommissioning of ira weapons , withdrawal of british troops , release of prisoners and ways to reform the the royal ulster constabulary , which is 97 percent protestant the lowerlevel meetings ended feb 7 , when sinn fein asserted it had found a bugging device inside an electrical apparatus in a discussion room it used near the conference hall the british government insisted it was not a listening device no one expects much headway to be made anytime soon since both sides have dug in on points they care about prime minister john major has lately emphasized his demand that sinn fein agree to get rid of the ira weapons stockpile , which british intelligence experts say includes at least 1 , 500 rifles and machine guns , more than a ton of semtex plastic explosive and perhaps one million rounds of ammunition and sinn fein is insisting it should be allowed to join in the allparty talks there was a touch of symbolism in today s opening handshakes since the sinn fein delegation included gerry kelly , who was convicted of planting bombs , and mr ancram escaped assassination in an ira bombing in 1984 he was trapped for some time in the rubble from a devastating blast at a brighton hotel where margaret thatcher and other conservatives were meeting
last month deputy secretary of state strobe talbott , on a visit to cambodia , said the united states was willing to consider lethal military aid to the cambodian army in its struggle against the khmer rouge given the traumatic history of american involvement in the region , and virulent corruption in the cambodian government and army , this is a questionable idea , at best the khmer rouge insurgents are the remnants of a movement that killed an estimated one million cambodians when it held power during the 1970 s it has little hope of regaining leadership of the country but it is still capable of causing much misery in the countryside and draining away resources that would be best used to rebuild the struggling nation the government s amnesty policy has encouraged hundreds of defections from the khmer rouge , whose former fighters have been integrated into the army last week the rebels' top financial officer , sar kim lemouth , switched sides there is no point in providing lethal aid to an army topheavy with officers and bloated with phantom troops created by officers to enrich themselves on the nonexistent soldiers' salaries the government , although democratically elected , condones the intimidation of members of parliament and journalists the united states is already helping with tasks like mineclearing and roadbuilding the most important foreign presence in cambodia is australia , which is providing military training and extensive help with everything from rebuilding the university to communications the cambodian government is not in imminent peril china has stopped supporting the khmer rouge , and there are signs that thailand is making at least a minimal effort to stop the lucrative smuggling along its border that sustains the insurgents lethal military assistance must be a last resort , provided only if the khmer rouge is resurgent and the cambodian government and army are free of corruption and undemocratic practices none of those tests are likely to be met any time soon
easton , pa , oct 8 tom and evelyn dinan stood in a drizzle outside this city s center square the other day trading names of prospective presidents but like many other voters here , they were more certain of whom they did not want in the white house than whom they wanted certainly not dole , said mrs dinan , who , like her husband , is a democrat who sometimes backs republicans she thrust both hands out as if she were trying to stop senator bob dole , who leads in the polls for the republican nomination i just ca n't stand dole yet the dinans looked just as pained at the mention of president clinton mr dinan , a 73yearold retired construction worker , suggested a thirdparty candidate , as long as it was not ross perot or gen colin l powell finally , he came up with a name i 'll vote for harry truman where s harry truman \? the 75yearold mrs dinan concurred , saying , that s what we need the republican presidential competition is in full tilt in iowa and new hampshire mr clinton has amassed millions for his reelection drive mr perot is hurriedly putting together a third party as he mulls over running himself and general powell , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , is basking in the willheorwo n'the speculation but in this oncethriving industrial city of 27 , 000 in the lehigh valley of eastern pennsylvania , now best known as the home of the former heavyweight boxing champion larry holmes , voters are only beginning to sort through their choices for president in dozens of random interviews , easton residents did not sound particularly thrilled with their options not one voter said he or she had decided to back one of the major republican candidates in fact , most said they were not sure who was in the race and who was out and even those who have closely followed the parade of candidates and wouldbe candidates insisted that they had not settled on a favorite and were in no rush to do so nestled among hills and ridges at the confluence of the delaware and lehigh rivers , this city was heavily democratic in its industrial glory days , when the steel mills were dominant and the city s factories were in full force , cranking out crayola crayons and dixie cups as easton has struggled to diversify its economy by attracting new businesses , its partisan makeup has also grown more mixed voters in the 15th congressional district , which extends beyond easton to the larger cities of allentown and bethlehem , backed george bush for president in 1988 , then bill clinton four years later nowadays , many voters here say they are not wedded to one party or another and they hardly seem wedded to any candidate lee clewell , 38 , who works in the crayola factory , said that he usually voted republican but that none of the contenders struck him particularly favorably asked about mr dole , he said he would vote for him only as a last resort when you mention that name , mr clewell said , it sends chills up my spine but he could not cite any specific concerns about mr dole , saying just the way he presents himself that turns me off mr clewell said that speaker newt gingrich , who is not running but has not completely closed the door on a bid , is pretty much all republicans have going for them right now but several other voters , including some republicans , registered doubts about mr gingrich , particularly over whether he was presidential timber adolf klova , a 63yearold semi retired advertising executive , said he was pleased to see republicans controlling congress , explaining that mr gingrich lends balance where there never has been any before that said , mr klova does not want the speaker to run for president he s a little quirky in some cases , the executive said i could never see him as president , he s too erratic but then mr klova put down the republican contenders one by one , saying , we need someone with new thoughts and new ideas as for another noncandidate , general powell , voters here were not as infatuated with him as might have been expected given that thousands of americans have been lining up to buy copies of his memoirs while diehard backers said they would vote for general powell no matter whether he ran as an independent or a republican , others vowed never to support him virginia taylor , a 33yearold housewife who backed president bush in 1992 , said she hoped that general powell , who is retired , ran as a republican she said she would favor him by far over the current field he gives heroism back to america , mrs taylor said he s done a job and proven he can do a job if general powell runs as in independent next year , she said she would still vote for him mrs taylor offered a dream ticket powellperot powell s stability would help to balance perot , she said such a ticket was also suggested by a handful of other easton residents , including julio rivera , 23 , who voted for mr clinton in 1992 colin powell can be the president and ross perot can be the vice president , said mr rivera , a nursing home aide ross perot can give him ideas about the economy and powell knows the ins and outs of washington , dc but i do n't know if he 'll ever get elected being the first black guy several white voters said they hoped general powell would run to help smooth racial divisions rubbed particularly raw in the aftermath of oj simpson s acquittal on murder charges i 'd love to see the guy get in , said al manazer , 62 , who runs the easton bus terminal he s been a military man a career man he might be able to do something with this racist thing but a block away , larry kinchen , a 42yearold black foundry worker , said he would stick with mr clinton even though he thought the president had let down the poor and elderly why vote for colin powell \? mr kinchen asked he does n't have the experience whatsoever gerald stern , 70 , a poet , also prefers mr clinton , but for different reasons what is it with america that we 're in love with a military person \? he asked is what s attractive about him that he s an enigma \? are we going to vote for another puzzle \? mr stern said it was only with great reluctance that he expected to vote again for mr clinton what troubles me about clinton is what makes him successful , he said an extraordinary politician is one who can change his position in an instant and pretend he s always had it the media saturation about general powell has apparently not touched everyone here the name drew several blank stares do n't know of him , said samuel nutall , 25 , a crane operator explaining that he voted for ross perot in 1992 , and wants to do so again next year , mr nutall said he made himself a billionaire and i like the way he speaks but mostly , the mention of mr perot was greeted with snickers he wants attention , a little bit of love , mr stern said jim vones , 76 , a landlord who voted for mr perot in 1992 , said he was not eager to do so again perot knows how to make money , mr vones said but what good does that do you \? when you get in there , you make more money having soured on the candidates now running , mr vones also put in a plug for an old favorite you know what you need \? he asked you need a farmer with some good common sense a guy like harry truman
at the end of a television season , almost any network can come out a winner , provided one looks at the numbers the right way any network , that is , except cbs this year s season ended only yesterday , but it has been clear for weeks that abc , nbc and fox broadcasting would all be able to extract positive news from the ratings abc was the overall ratings winner for the first time in 15 years , and was also the winner in the demographic group that counts the most 18 to 49yearolds nbc posted significant gains to finish the season second and fox , for the first time , beat one of the established networks in the 18to49 age group cbs , in contrast , toppled from the no 1 position it held last season and lost ground in almost all categories so much so , in fact , that it pulled down the fournetwork proportion of the television audience to its lowest level ever the networks finished the season with a 65 share , down from a 69 share last year this means that an average of 65 percent of the people tuned in during prime time were watching the networks the overall network decline was really a cbs decline , said steve sternberg , senior vice president for broadcast research at bozell inc passing up the usual attempts to find some subcategory in which the network could claim victory , david poltrack , senior vice president for research at cbs , said it was a very tough year for us we 're in a rebuilding mode the final numbers for the season will not be tabulated until tuesday , but preliminary figures give abc an average primetime rating for the season of 121 nbc had an average rating of 116 , cbs an 112 and fox a 77 each rating point represents 954 , 000 homes even though it won the season , abc s household numbers are down slightly from last year , while those of nbc and fox are up slightly cbs s numbers have fallen more than 20 percent from last year among 18 to 49yearold viewers , the group most coveted by advertisers , abc as of last week had an average rating of 73 , nbc a 69 , fox a 55 and cbs a 53 increasingly , networks are boasting about ratings among this group , rather than overall household ratings in an interview last week , ted harbert , president of abc entertainment , stressed abc s win among viewers under 50 in that group , he noted , abc shows beat the other networks' programs in fully half the primetime hours we really dominate , he said mr harbert acknowledged that nbc , which finished the season last year in third place , was gaining fast on abc among younger viewers but he attributed most of the growth to nbc s blockbuster thursday night schedule , which includes seinfeld , the season s toprated program , and er , the season s thirdmostpopular show this is a sevennight job , he said fox was also crowing over its finish among 18 to 49yearolds for the first time in our history we knocked off one of the big three , said john matoian , president of fox entertainment , referring to cbs for the little engine that could , it s a great story just as produce flown in from south america keeps asparagus on shelves all year long , a steady stream of new shows introduced in the spring and summer has nearly eliminated the seasonal nature of television , making programming essentially a yearround enterprise indeed , many network executives say it makes little sense even to speak of the season s end any more still , the official close of the season , which formally began sept 19 , remains a time for contemplating the state of television and industry trends analysts pointed to several lessons from the season that just ended for one thing , past rumors of the death of television drama are greatly exaggerated nbc s hospital drama er was the surprise hit of the year , and abc s nypd blue continued to gain ground , finishing the season in seventh place fox s xfiles was the returning series that showed the most improvement from last season , increasing its household ratings by more than 40 percent in addition , shows produced directly by the networks are no more likely to succeed than those produced by studios with the regulatory barriers that long prevented networks from owning their own shows now coming down , many studio executives and advertisers had feared that inhouse productions would be given preferential treatment and , in fact , some inhouse shows were given better time slots than they seemed to merit but of the seven networkowned productions on the fall schedule , including nbc s martin short show and abc s me and the boys , none is still on the air the experience shows that being produced inhouse does n't guarantee success , said betsy frank , executive vice president of zenith media services it does n't even guarantee survival the final lesson is that it only takes a few hits for a doomed network to thrive again , and a few flops for a thriving one to appear doomed a few years ago , nbc , a unit of the general electric company , was mired in third place , its management was viewed as bungling and the whole network was rumored to be for sale today , nbc is poised to become no 1 , its management is hailed for its savvy and cbs has become the candidate for most likely to be sold with all the talk in the press this season about cbs falling apart , we should keep one thing in mind , mr sternberg of bozell said they were saying the same thing about nbc three years ago this is a cyclical business these days it only takes one or two successes to turn a network around
new orleans after a lifetime of itinerancy , living in 9 states and some 14 homes , the novelist richard ford knows the language of real estate by heart i try to be someone upon whom nothing is lost , he said the other day in his present hometown , new orleans , borrowing a phrase from henry james richard watches everything , said his wife , kristina in independence day , his sixth work of fiction , mr ford has tapped into the imagination of his contemporaries in their late 40 s and early 50 s who are obsessed with real estate and the buying and selling of houses it is a generation for whom real estate has become a metaphor for human fulfillment he takes frank bascombe , the main character from his third novel , the sportswriter \( 1986 \) , and transposes him to another time , about five years later , where , having failed in his career as a writer , he is now selling real estate in haddam , nj , a fictional town that bears many similarities to princeton frank , charles johnson wrote in the new york times book review , is a character we know as well as we know our nextdoor neighbors frank bascombe has earned himself a place beside willy loman and harry angstrom in our literary landscape he is a survivor of the 1960 s and all its enthusiasms holding the line on the life we promised ourselves in the 60 s is getting hard as hell , frank muses in the space of four days over a fourth of july weekend , he carries on a love affair , longs for his exwife and drives his son a 15yearold who has been arrested for shoplifting condoms and has taken to barking like a dog in memory of a dead pet on a trip to the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown , ny he also tries to sell a house to an unhappy couple , the markhams he has shown them 45 , none of them right frank is a forgiving man with a saintly patience mr ford makes virtual poetry out of realestate nomenclature in independence day 1 , 900 sq ft including garage , he writes , in a kind of song , threebedroom , twobath , expandable , no fplc the words unsolvable structural enigmas , castiron piping with suspicions of lead take on a gently ominous tone grounded wall sockets and tenfour on a 30year fixed , plus a point , plus an application fee , have a kind of melody he meditates lovingly on belvedere , oriel , aluminum flashing and soffit vent for mr ford , these are words you can roll your tongue around and relish mr ford is 51 , tall , with longish , straight , thin gray hair , pale blue eyes and a high domed forehead at the moment , he owns a town house here with an interior courtyard and a gallery overlooking bourbon street sometimes he works in a room that was part of the residence s old slave quarters he also owns a bungalow in montana , where his 1988 collection of short stories , rock springs , was set a native mississippian , he leases a big white plantation house in the mississippi delta as well so he can stay close to his roots whenever we go to a town , said mrs ford , a 49yearold urban planner and former model , richard really likes to go to the real estate office we 've lived in so many places that our best friends are realtors mrs ford is executive director of the new orleans city planning commission her interests made it seem to me that the business of how land is used is a fit subject for one s concerns , mr ford said some people think of real estate salesmen as sleazeballs and shysters , he went on a profession in which a human being finds shelter for others is in fact important real estate agents are in the business of helping us all find ways to realize our dreams i'm also sensitive to the fact that these are desperate human situations , he added if you have a balloon mortgage , it s a nightmare ! at one point in mr ford s book , frank bascombe observes , you do n't sell a house to somebody , you sell a life it was in 1991 , when he had just finished two novellas , that mr ford realized from his notebooks that frank was speaking to him again i was on the sniff of a book , he said a feeling about the northeast overtook me it seemed fragrant in a way i took a month and went up to princeton and rented a room in a bedandbreakfast he had lived in princeton from 1976 to 1982 , while mrs ford was teaching at new york university and rutgers he had worked as a sportswriter then and taught writing at princeton university to research independence day , he drove around new england and new york state registering his impressions in a tape recorder he made numerous trips to cooperstown because i wanted to see it in different seasons my job as a writer was to find language for that which did not seem to invite it , mr ford said to describe connecticut route 9 was the challenge of a lifetime to describe us route 7 between north ridgefield and danbury as seen at night , in the work of a writer , is equal to edward hopper painting , he said with a laugh itinerancy is in his blood his father was a traveling salesman for a starch company , and mr ford was born in the middle of his route , in jackson , miss he grew up across the street from a house where eudora welty had lived when he was little , his mother pointed ms welty out to him i could tell from the tone of my mother s voice that being a writer was something estimable mississippi is very kind to its writers , he said today he and ms welty are close friends
gov george e pataki s choice of a conservative party leader to head the port authority of new york and new jersey is facing growing resistance from the commissioners of the powerful agency , signaling that the muchcriticized nomination may have to be withdrawn , or at the least delayed nearly a month after mr pataki indicated that he would name the conservative politician , george j marlin , to the influential post , few of the 12 commissioners who must approve the selection have spoken out in support of him and gov christine todd whitman of new jersey , whose views will be carefully weighed by the commissioners , continues to withhold her endorsement the collapse of mr marlin s nomination would embarrass the new administration of mr pataki and could strain his relationship with mrs whitman mr pataki seems to have been repeatedly tripped up so far in his dealings with the authority , which plays a dominant role in the metropolitan region , operating the three major airports , bridges , tunnels , the path commuter trains , the world trade center and the seaport several commissioners , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that after meeting mr marlin and looking into his background , they remained troubled by his lack of experience and by his political views unlike most past executive directors of the agency , mr marlin , a longtime executive in the municipal finance industry who ran for mayor of new york city in 1993 , has never managed a large corporation or government agency if marlin had any political savvy , he would take pataki off the hook and say , 'hey , i have decided to follow a different career , ' one commissioner said but he is not doing that would you want to run a company where out of a 12member board , only three members really wanted you \? the commissioner said he and others on the board were hoping that mr marlin would withdraw to prevent a protracted behindthescenes battle over the nomination mr marlin has not spoken to reporters since he first came under consideration for the post another port authority commissioner said it is a very accurate statement to say that many of the commissioners are uneasy about this nomination the uneasiness has been there from day one because of complicated rules governing the authority , as few as three of the 12 commissioners could block mr marlin s appointment , authority officials said two of the six from new jersey are leaning against the nomination , and the rest are apparently waiting for a cue from mrs whitman on the new york side , two commissioners have said they would vote for mr marlin , but it is difficult to predict where others' loyalties might lie , because all were appointed by mr pataki s predecessor , former gov mario m cuomo the only commissioner to attack mr marlin publicly so far is robert c janiszewski , the hudson county \( nj \) executive , a democrat who was appointed to the board by former gov james florio mr janiszewski said he had very serious reservations about the nomination , and it appears very unlikely that he will vote for him echoing the views of some other commissioners , mr janiszewski said he was particularly concerned that mr marlin , who has opposed affirmative action , might try to dismantle the agency s programs that steer business to companies run by women and members of minority groups to be sure , the nomination is by no means dead , and mr pataki is expected to put strong pressure on the commissioners and to lobby mrs whitman to back his choice the two new york commissioners who have announced their support for mr marlin are tonio burgos and vincent tese , who have said that mr pataki deserves to have his own person in the post in albany , mr pataki s aides dismissed the notion that the nomination was in trouble , expressing confidence that it would be pushed through and they implied that the new jersey side had held back its support as a bargaining ploy , seeking to force mr pataki to yield concessions that would bring more port authority projects and jobs to new jersey but the aides acknowledged that there was some dissension on the board about mr marlin and they also said mr pataki had not yet decided when to present the nomination officially the port authority board meets next on thursday , and the executive director s position is not on the agenda the nomination is likely to go to the board only if it has the votes to pass mr pataki has repeatedly hit snags in trying to fill the executive director s spot the governor first said he would nominate guy v molinari , a republican who is staten island borough president but some officials in the whitman administration said there was never a serious offer , and the suggestion was just intended to flatter mr molinari as thanks for his help during the campaign nevertheless , other new jersey officials were stunned , and wondered how a man whose experience was mostly political would handle running an agency with a 26 billion budget and 9 , 000 employees
miami as the only owner of three consecutive super bowl rings , ken norton jr was glowing and after having been on the twotime champion cowboys , he understood better than anybody why the 49ers now reign and threaten to reign again once i saw the writing on the wall in dallas , the 28yearold linebacker was saying , once i saw the balance change a little bit , i said i better jump on over here the way the organization respects the players here is second to none it s the best in the league as far as the players and the fans are concerned , as well as the ownership yes , balance and ownership it can be more important than offense and defense only a year ago on the morning after , jimmy johnson , the cowboys' coach , looked around a hotel ballroom in atlanta and sneered that jerry jones , the cowboys' owner , must be lurking behind a potted plant divorce was inevitable egonomic incompatibility when jones told listeners that 100 guys could coach the cowboys , johnson departed in a huff jones s coachonstandby , barry switzer , turned out not to be among those 100 after the jonesjohnson clash of egos , the cowboys would lose their balance in the recent national conference championship game while the 49ers soared to a record fifth super bowl title with their 4926 rout of the chargers if the 49ers repeat , one reason will be egonomic balance in the front office and the coaching staff eddie debartolo jr , the lavish owner carmen policy , the swami of the salary cap george seifert , the cool coach if they did n't have egos , they would n't be doing what they 're doing but because none craves the credit , their egos have n't disrupted the delicate balance within every sports franchise this is n't any single person , debartolo said sunday night it s not steve young it s not jerry rice it s not debartolo it s not policy it s the 49er franchise debartolo could have preened about how he inspired the 49ers with a surprise pep talk after a 408 embarrassment by the eagles dropped their record to 32 , but he did n't i think eddie debartolo brings something special because he treats everyone with respect , jerry rice said the players really respect him because he s behind you 100 percent he s not the type of owner that s going to go off on you if things are not going right he leaves that up to the coaches the coaches do it calmly , especially george seifert , whose 8424 wonlost record over his first six seasons is better than that of any other coach in national football league history he s secure enough to acknowledge that the current 49ers are an extension of bill walsh s 1981 team that won the franchise s first super bowl but it s not whose team it is , seifert said it s our team now our team will be trying to win a sixth super bowl despite the salary cap that will monitor the millions offered to deion sanders , the tapdancing cornerback , and ricky watters , the running back who scored three touchdowns sunday one of my biggest jobs , policy said , is not to let the rabbit get out of the hat the rabbit s name is deion we want to keep him comfortably caged up in the bay area we 'll feed him well , make sure his coat is shiny asked if he will feed the rabbit lettuce and carrots , policy smiled especially lettuce , green lettuce he said that s the secret as for watters , policy said , i think he will be very appropriately treated and will find himself with a longterm contract playing for the 49ers , where he belongs even if the 49ers lose a few free agents , others will be available , as sanders , norton and linebacker rickey jackson were last year i 'd like to think , policy said , that the situation that caused a lot of free agents to come to san francisco would be infectious the 49ers are likely to lose their offensive coordinator , mike shananan , expected to be the broncos' new coach , and maybe the defensive coordinator , ray rhodes , possibly the rams' next coach but they once lost mike holmgren , now the packers' coach as good as shananan and rhodes are , as good as the 49er system is , their pro bowl talent makes it hum and win or lose another super bowl , without the egos that undercut the cowboys , the 49ers wo n't lose their balance photo eddie debartolo , left , hugging steve young after 49ers' victory \( mike powell allsport \)
washington , april 9 for much of his life , franklin delano roosevelt struggled to play down the fact that he could not walk unaided for four decades , his relatives and admirers have worked to create a monument here to his memory now , construction is well along , but the monument is suddenly caught up in controversy over its builders' decision to continue to veil the disability roosevelt tried to disguise the national organization on disability and some historians are voicing concern that none of the memorial s three sculptures and basreliefs of roosevelt will show him with the wheelchair , crutches , braces or cane he was forced to rely on for most of his adult life the dispute touches some of the same issues of revisionism and accuracy as a recent disagreement involving the smithsonian institution s exhibit of the enola gay , the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima that exhibit was painfully redesigned after its script was criticized by veterans mike deland , a board member of the national organization on disability , has tried unsuccessfully to persuade the franklin delano roosevelt memorial commission to depict roosevelt s disability without question he is the role model for the 50 million disabled people living in this country , said mr deland , who uses a wheelchair he lived his life in a wheelchair , and history should record it others argue that whatever the public perception was during his lifetime , roosevelt s battle with his disability is an important part of his memory on wednesday , for instance , the 50th anniversary of his death will be marked by a ceremony in warm springs , ga , at the resort that he converted into a treatment center for people with polio president clinton plans to attend but the memorial commission maintains that any portrayal of roosevelt s disability would be historically inaccurate , not to mention an affront to his memory david b roosevelt , a grandson of franklin roosevelt and a member of the commission , asserted that the memorial should not be a vehicle for making a social statement mr roosevelt added that he would oppose any changes that would alter , delay or add cost to the memorial the memorial has already had its share of delays in 1955 , congress established the memorial commission , and it has been a rocky road ever since the first design , which called for eight towering slabs of marble , was approved in 1960 and then laughed out of construction by an article in the washington post , which characterized it as instant stonehenge in the years that followed , other designs were approved and then rejected finally , in 1978 , a san francisco architect , lawrence halprin , produced the winning formula , but congress did not appropriate the money for his design until 1990 construction finally began last october at a site in west potomac park , a sevenandahalfacre sliver beside the tidal basin the memorial is to be washington s last grand presidential monument , adding roosevelt to the ranks of jefferson , washington and lincoln mr halprin s rambling outdoor design departs from the classic style of the other three presidential monuments visitors will enter a sequence of four outdoor rooms , interspersed with gardens , waterfalls and pathways the gallery s pink granite walls will be inscribed with quotations and historical text from roosevelt s four terms in office eleanor roosevelt , his wife , will be commemorated by a bronze sculpture portraying her as the first united states ambassador to the united nations an earlier design , which depicted the first lady with her trademark fur piece , was rejected after the commission anticipated protests from animal rights groups apparently , they 're not afraid of disabled people , said hugh gallagher , author of fdr s splendid deception \( vandamere , 1994 \) , a book portraying roosevelt s struggle to disguise his disability mr gallagher and doris kearns goodwin , author of no ordinary time franklin and eleanor roosevelt the homefront in world war ii \( simon schuster , 1994 \) , agree that to not reflect roosevelt s disability would be denying history roosevelt was not embarrassed by his disability he simply made a political decision , mrs goodwin said times have changed , and now there would be such strength and inspiration from just one sculpture of him in his wheelchair but despite recent criticism , the commission is standing fast , as is the designer while the commission cites cost and delay as its reasons for rejecting suggested changes , the designer , mr halprin , argues that to represent roosevelt s disability would be to betray his memory cost is n't the point , mr halprin said roosevelt was very desirous of keeping his disability out of the limelight we 're not trying to hide it , but it would be going against his desire to evidence it in a sculpture as an example of the memorial s historical integrity , mr halprin pointed out the words etched in granite in the memorial s final room 1921 , stricken with poliomyelitis he never again walked unaided robert and mary gill , visiting from harrisburg , pa , noticed the construction as they strolled past the cherry blossoms on saturday toward the end , fdr was n't ashamed of his disability , said mr gill , who at 61 remembers the last years of roosevelt s presidency i do n't know why anyone building a statue should be ashamed of it photos a memorial to president franklin d roosevelt is being built in washington , but some say it should do more to reflect his disability \( karin anderson for the new

who would want to know years or decades in advance that he or she had as much as a 90 percent chance of getting alzheimer s disease , given that there is no cure , treatment or prevention \? the new york city chapter of the alzheimer s association asked members whether they would take a genetic test that could make such a prediction and , in survey results being released today , 63 percent of respondents said yes doctors , researchers and the association itself are struggling with many ethical and practical issues surrounding the simple blood test , for a gene believed to cause 40 percent of all alzheimer s cases the gene , called apo e4 , was first linked to the degenerative brain disease two years ago inheriting one copy of the gene , as 27 percent of americans have , results in a threefold to fivefold increase in the risk of getting alzheimer s inheriting two copies , as 2 percent to 4 percent of americans have , increases the risk sixfold , to as much as a 90 percent chance of getting it by the age of 80 the recent survey was prompted by a meeting in chicago two months ago at which the alzheimer s association and the national institute on aging recommended that the test not be used to predict the risk of alzheimer s disease for people without symptoms until more research was done to clarify the gene s role the test can help doctors diagnose the disease in people who show signs of dementia , the association said in a statement this month john a jager , executive director of the new york city chapter of the association , said , the alzheimer s association does not recommend that people run out and have the test , since there s no treatment or cure for alzheimer s another concern is that the test results are not conclusive someone who inherits two copies of the gene may not get alzheimer s , but someone who does n't inherit any copies may get it , he said the association is also worried about possible job and insurance discrimination the dilemma over the test is especially complicated because the test is also used to predict heart disease two copies of the apo e4 gene increase the risk of heart disease by 30 percent to 50 percent long before the connection to alzheimer s was known , the test was given to people with alarmingly high cholesterol levels to identify those who needed aggressive treatment to prevent heart disease most doctors who test heart patients do not tell them that the gene also causes alzheimer s disease for fear of alarming them with news they can do nothing about but as word about the test has circulated among relatives of alzheimer s patients , interest has grown i 've had a lot of families and doctors inquiring about the test since the chicago meeting , said dr samuel evans gandy 3d , laboratory director of neurology and neuroscience at new york hospitalcornell university medical center in new york doctors want reliable information on how to interpret the test i tell them that the test result assigns patients to a group at risk , but there s no result that guarantees that patients will get the disease and none that guarantees protection from it in the recent survey , which involved 146 people in the new york area with at least one close relative who has alzheimer s disease or who died of it , 92 said they wanted the test eightyone said they wanted to make plans for the future and 73 said they wanted to get early treatment when it becomes available but not all these people wanted the test now people realize that it s an agerelated illness and want to put off having the test until they 're old , mr jager said of the respondents , who were in their 40 s and older of the 54 people who said they did not want the test , 37 gave as a reason that there s no treatment or cure , 29 said they do n't want to know and 10 said they were concerned about job , health insurance and other discrimination chris macleod , a manhattan resident whose mother and aunt had alzheimer s disease , said she wanted to have the test to clarify her own risk and because i'm a great believer in science , and this test represents a breakthrough but doctors warn patients not to have the test without having psychological counseling before and afterward the results can be psychologically traumatic , dr gandy said
lawrenceville entropy is usually defined as the measure of disorder in a system or substance that increases as available energy diminishes it may take a physicist to grasp the full significance of this , the second law of thermodynamics but there is no missing its most visible symptom the decay that overtakes all things , with the possible exception of the plastic harnesses on sixpacks a show that addresses entropy is barely conceivable , yet at rider university here , james dickinson , an associate professor in the department of sociology , has staged just such a show at the gallery in the student center the title is entropic zones buildings and structures of the contemporary city the installation is as plain as the republican cloth coat of myth and legend , and the show closes on tuesday the drawbacks itemized , it remains only to say that the display is well worth visiting , not only for its paintings , prints , photographs and video films , but also for the curator s catalogue essay , illuminating a condition that seems as bleak as it is irreversible though obviously fascinated by decay , professor dickinson writes as if he were immune to its romantic charm and also , it seems , to art that , as he puts it , is not an effective instrument for the investigation of reality thus when commenting on robert nesbit s shell , a 7by9by8foot hut made of drywall attached to beams and located outside the center , the curator asks , who wants art that is just beautiful illusions \? one thing is certain the vandals who assaulted mr nesbit s structure did not want art that bucks convention , however predictably as a result of their efforts , the hut is the clearest example of entropy in the show , but of course it cannot compare with the real , involuntary thing while professor dickinson notes that this exists in all cities with an industrial past , he singles out the american street corridor in north philadelphia , saying it is not a natural wonder like the grand canyon or yellowstone but something that comes close a decaying industrial zone of unprecedented magnitude such entropic tracts stand out , the curator explains , because they are often surrounded by areas of hypergrowth office towers , industrial parks , shopping malls and the like and because decay , he adds , produces the ruins and monuments of tomorrow , the curator envisages a coast left clear for many tourist attractions , of which the reviewer s favorite is eastern state penitentiary museum of punishment in philadelphia given his gallows humor and something bordering on outrage , it was inevitable that professor dickinson would be his own biggest star still , the seven artists he has chosen plus a group of videoists manage to get their licks in , especially michael frechette , who paints precise black silhouettes of industrial buildings mr frechette does this on rectangles cut from old cotton conveyor belts , observing in his statement that the soiled fabric reminds him of the skies over north philadelphia , where he lives were it not for the intensity projected by these stark images , together with the implications of the truthtomaterials philosophy , mr frechette would qualify as a minimalist he is , however , a painter of talent and originality ruth humpton proclaims herself an unreconstructed romantic by photographing a group of smokestacks and , by means of kodalith , transforming them into the bars of a cage , behind which flutters an angel reproduced from an old engraving treacy ziegler , another romantic , produces de chiricolike etchings of empty streets in saturated colors whether or not surrealism marks the age of entropy in art , there is no doubt that a pinch of it conveys the alarm and fascination aroused by the condition and , if not surrealism , then a touch of the romantic sublime this is where the realistic canvases of thomas parker williams come in paintings of structures like the wall with barbed wire that is illustrated in monoprints that look more like monotypes , jennifer baker focuses on factory buildings , derelict cars and vacant lots this , too , is north philadelphia , but it has been transformed by good design , attractive colors and lively brushwork that leaves aubrey kauffman , who , lacking a political or sociological ax to grind , concentrates on what he calls the immanent esthetic properties of structures as in the pattern made by two stories of windows in a building that is definitely not entropic mr kauffman is the one true minimalist in the group , although there may be others among the videoists to judge from the titles , their films are mainly about demolition viewers may leave the show none the wiser about entropy , but they can hardly fail to be impressed by its relentlessness the gallery is open monday and tuesday from noon to 2 pm and 6 to 8 pm photo more dangerous times , acrylic on canvas by thomas parker williams , from the ruins series , on view in lawrenceville \( rider university \)
nearly two years after prudential securities agreed to repay every customer it cheated in the biggest investment fraud in history , the firm has been forced to open its wallet again a federal judge in manhattan has granted preliminary approval to a 110 million settlement of a classaction lawsuit that accused prudential of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy in its fraudulent sale of limited partnerships in the 1980 s , according to court records filed yesterday the settlement shows that prudential , despite hopes of putting the partnership scandal behind it , is still haunted by the scandal the continuing problems come despite its 1993 accord with securities regulators to compensate clients who were defrauded in the partnerships and its agreement last year to accept a form of probation to settle criminal charges the firm s total projected cost for the debacle has reached 15 billion , executives at the firm said yesterday , making it the costliest scandal in wall street s history in essence , the 110 million proposal would be used to compensate investors who did not submit a claim to the regulatory compensation fund , or participate in some of the other thousands of pieces of litigation stemming from the partnership fraud prudential is not happy about paying this kind of money out when they thought they had resolved this situation by giving an open pocketbook to the regulators , said lawrence a sucharow , one of the plaintiffs' lawyers but we will give something to everybody who has not had their claim resolved through that process mr sucharow and joel bernstein , another lawyer in the class action , estimated that between 80 , 000 and 100 , 000 investors never filed claims to the regulatory compensation fund and as a result would qualify for the latest classaction settlement for many of these people , this settlement will be the last chance to recover any of their losses from the prudential partnership fraud charles perkins , a prudential spokesman , said in a statement , we believe that this is a fair resolution to resolve remaining claims from investors in limited partnerships limited partnerships , which invest in assets like real estate and oil wells , were sold in the 1980 s to investors seeking tax deductions and profits from asset appreciation the investments were highly risky but at prudential , partnerships were sold to almost 340 , 000 investors , often with little attention to suitability many of those sales were achieved though lies and deceptions , often in sales material distributed to brokers by the firm while investors suffered huge losses , the senior partnership executives with prudential gained great personal wealth from the sales indeed , despite the investor losses , james j darr , the former head of the division , continues to be paid millions of dollars by prudential out of the cash flow of the partnerships , as part of a contract he struck with the firm , court documents show the class action charged that the firm and its executives engaged in a racketeering conspiracy with the partnership sponsors , known as general partners the lawsuit contended that the general partners were selected by prudential not for the quality of their investments , but rather for their willingness to grant favors and investment deals to the firm s officers indeed , throughout the 1980 s , the investor money for the partnerships was used to pay for limousines and fancy parties for company executives , as well as for exotic overseas trips none of these payments were ever disclosed to investors by charging racketeering rather than fraud , the plaintiff s lawyers in the case effectively sidestepped some of the strict statute of limitations requirements that usually apply in securities cases this vindicates the concept of using civil racketeering in these cases , said clinton krislov , one of the plaintiffs' lawyers in the case the settlement was reached only with prudential and its former officers the case against a number of other plaintiffs , including the sponsors of the limited partnerships , remain unresolved in his preliminary approval of the deal , judge milton pollack of the federal district court in manhattan , who is hearing the case , praised the resolution the 110 million settlement represents an outstanding achievement , judge pollack wrote the financial recovery is among the largest securities classaction settlement ever achieved still , the settlement has several hurdles to clear before completion investors , who will soon be receiving notices about the settlement , have the right to opt out of the deal moreover , any objectors who wish can make a case against the settlement at a fairness hearing which will be held before the final approval but either way , lawyers say , this final agreement may well mean that the consequences of the scandal are drawing to a close hopefully , this signals the end for one of the darkest eras in wall street s history , said bradd milove , a plaintiffs' lawyer with a number of prudential partnership cases
in the fall of 1991 , a new novel by cormac mccarthy arrived on chip kidd s drafting table with some serious history to overcome despite spectacular reviews , none of mr mccarthy s previous books , all published by random house , had ever sold more than 2 , 600 copies so mr mccarthy decided to try his luck with alfred a knopf , random house s sister publisher at advance publications mr kidd s job was to create a dust jacket that would seduce readers into at least picking up the novel so , in a single afternoon , using a blackandwhite photo from his oddsandends collection , mr kidd , who was then 26 , produced a stark but evocative jacket for all the pretty horses , a story of a teenager crossing the border between texas and mexico the book was a critical success , winning the national book award for 1992 but it was also a popular hit , selling half a million copies in hardcover and paperback i think chip kidd is a genius , said amanda urban , mr mccarthy s agent what he is so good at better than almost anyone is capturing the soul of a novel dust jackets , first used in britain in the 1830 s , were once simply papers slipped around books to keep off dust and soot but as bookselling has become more competitive , jackets have taken on an increasingly important role in the life of a book no longer dowdy sheaves , jackets have metamorphosed into fullfledged artistic statements that use a wide palette of styles and colors , images and typefaces to grab attention indeed , book jackets have evolved from the paper equivalent of trench coats into sexy boleros , elegant capes and silk dinner jackets , striving to be at once provocative , tasteful and mysterious a bold player in this evolution is mr kidd , who is considered one of the best graphic designers around what makes chip different is how literate he is in a fundamental way , said william drenttel , who is president of the american institute of graphic arts he can tap into a very large visual vocabulary to create really stunning work since he began at knopf in 1986 after graduating from pennsylvania state university , mr kidd has become the designer of choice for some of knopf s most noted authors like martin amis , michael crichton , james ellroy , anne rice and john updike , to name a few two chip kidd designs adorn books on the current new york times bestseller list being digital \( knopf \) by nicholas negroponte and quivers \( regan books harpercollins , a unit of the news corporation ltd \) by robin quivers his dinosaur drawing that adorned the cover of mr crichton s jurassic park and later the theme park gates in the steven spielberg movie has become embedded in pop culture and , in his spare time , mr kidd , who can command up to 3 , 000 for freelance designs \( twice what other designers make \) , has also redesigned the paris review and produced several album covers the most important thing is that my work reflects what the author s work is about , mr kidd said clearly , a jacket alone does not make a best seller but with the emergence of book superstores , the number of browsers has grown , meaning books that catch a buyer s eye are more likely to be taken to the checkout line consequently , in the last 10 years , publishers have begun hiring prestigious designers and spending large sums on book jackets interest in distinctive jackets at knopf began under the founder , alred a knopf in his 1965 memoir , portrait of a publisher , mr knopf said , i 'd sooner have good , straight 12yearold bourbon in a plain and ugly bottle than 2yearold neutral spirits in one designed by norman bel geddes , dressed up like mrs astor s horse but he prefaced that remark by writing a goodlooking and wellmade book will never do its author any harm at any time and it may do him some good sonny mehta , now president of knopf , approaches the matter just as aggressively he is the sole arbiter in the final selection of jackets he makes sure that his designers read the books they design and in his smoky corner office , bookshelves display knopf s latest books face out the idea , mr mehta says , is to see if a jacket wears well carol devine carson is the director of knopf s design department , for which mr kidd works under her , the department is credited with helping overhaul old ways of using type , artwork , photography and color on book jackets the spine designs are particularly distinctive on quivers , which mr kidd did freelance for another publisher , part of the face of robin quivers appears at the top of the spine the knopf jackets not only stand out , mr drenttel said , they have also had a huge influence on what other publishers' dust jackets now look like earlier this year , the knopf design department won a literary market place award for the best jackets for inhouse designers as for mr kidd , whose wirerimmed glasses , slickedback hair and tweed vest cast him as a figure more from this side of paradise than from reading , pa , where he grew up , his designs are considered as memorable as the authors whose works they adorn watching the body burn , a novel by thomas glynn , featured a cartoonish laughing boy and a disembodied arm and leg \( the whole thing kind of jumps out at you , startles you , shocks you , mr glynn said \) mr negroponte s being digital is black and white with an acetate cover a computer code of 0 s and 1 s runs the length of the spine on a cool spring night , with billie holiday crooning from the cd player , chip kidd revels in the reams of batman memorabilia , comic books and tattered scrapbooks that dominate his penthouse apartment on the upper east side of manhattan the onebedroom flat , with its electrolux vacuum cleaner and hollywood liquefier blender , is a study in yesterday s americana , a trip into pop culture s past but it is these things , he says , that inspire what he hopes are timeless designs and while success has been sweet , with it has come the stress of keeping ahead of the copycats the pressure is really that once you do a book jacket a certain way , you can never do a jacket that way again , he says you 're always starting from scratch photo

mary lou rinaldi , having lived in the neighborhood all her life , can attest that many things about the west side of stamford have gone unchanged for example , a lot of people still have gardens and vineyards , said ms rinaldi , who is the president of the stamford board of representatives , the city s governing body but ms rinaldi , who lives in a house her grandfather built in the 1920 s , knows well that some things have changed for the worse in a corner of the city , bordered by affluent greenwich and by the high rises of stamford s business district drug dealing , for instance , has become commonplace in much of the area , particularly on the two main thoroughfares , stillwater avenue and west main street in addition , many of the neighborhood s older buildings have deteriorated and the crime rate has risen considerably , with occasional outbreaks of violence , including several shootings in the last few years now , a group of residents and businesspeople have taken to the streets in an effort to drive out the purveyors of crack cocaine and other illicit drugs and , after a month of trying , their efforts appear to be bearing fruit it had reached the point where it was almost intolerable , gilbert ginyard , a longtime resident of the west side , said on a recent night as he marched through the neighborhood with his wife , pam , and about 75 other neighbors , most of whom he and his wife had not met until the thriceweekly marches began early in march we 've even had to be concerned when our kids , who are 14 , and 10 , were out , mr ginyard said but there are a lot of good people in this neighborhood , and we had to make a start somewhere accompanied by several police officers and on at least one occasion by mayor stanley esposito dozens of a people , including some from other parts of stamford , have been not only parading through the west side with signs denouncing the drug dealers but also confronting dealers directly these people are trying to reclaim their streets and bring back the neighborhood to its former prosperity , said mr esposito as he sat in corelli s pastry shop on stillwater avenue just before the start of a recent march and we in the city government are going to try to help by turning a part of the area into a little italy similar to the one on arthur avenue in the bronx , with a focus on all of the good things , including a number of excellent restaurants , that the neighborhood has that the marches begin at corelli s pastry shop is appropriate , since lucy corelli , who , with her husband , peter , owns the bakery , was one of the organizers of the antidrug crusade mrs corelli is the chairwoman of the west side business council , set up a year ago by the stamford chamber of commerce as a first step in a planned revitalization of the west side businesses in the area had been suffering and the perception of the west side had become negative , said mrs corelli , who is a member of the stamford board of representatives and so we decided to unite as a group , and we 've already seen the results there are definitely fewer drug dealers on the streets , and not only when we march similar demonstrations of anticrime unity also have been staged over the last few years in neighborhoods in hartford , bridgeport and new haven , all of which have been plagued by drug trafficking and gang violence for about three hours , three nights a week , residents of the west side march on a recent thursday night , a group of about 25 people of varying ages set out from corelli s pastry shop at 7 pm by 9 pm the group had grown to twice that number , and by 10 pm , to about 75 marchers though the weather was relatively mild , they encountered few loiterers and saw no evidence of drug dealing they hear that there s a vigil going on and they get off the streets , said patrolman richard phelan , one of the two officers accompanying the marchers but they 're back the next day several marchers who live in the neighborhood , however , were quick to challenge patrolman phelan about the effects of the vigils one , carl washington , said the vigils have already accomplised a lot there s definitely been a decrease in drug dealing mrs corelli agreed no doubt about it there s been a big difference , she said as the group moved onto west main street deputy police chief john f perrotta , who has observed some of the vigils , said he thought the marches had had a salutary effect the drug dealers are totally bewildered , deputy chief perrotta said they 're seeing the community take a stand and they 're nervous because they do n't know when they 're coming next so they 're losing business and they 're being displaced deputy chief perrotta , a former resident of the west side , said the police department welcomed the vigils these people are sending a message that they 're sick and tired of the drug traffic in their neighborhbood , he said and we welcome their support because the cops ca n't do it alone but he also conceded that the vigils were not enough there has to be a concerted process , he said we need community policing , so that there can be foot patrolmen in the area , and we 're hoping to do that and the people involved in the vigils have to target all parts of the criminal justice system to make sure that the drug dealers we arrest are punished that may mean coming into court to see that that s done joseph coscarelli , who has lived on the west side for 25 years , agreed that judges have to come down harder on drug dealers none of this is going to do any good unless the law punishes them , he said
frankfurt , feb 2 in an extraordinary sign of the european uneasiness over president clinton s plan to rescue mexico s economy , financial officials disclosed today that six european countries withheld their support from an americanbacked loan package approved by the international monetary fund although the 178 billion package was accepted late wednesday , the fact that six key western nations britain , germany , denmark , the netherlands , belgium and switzerland abstained from approving the clinton plan was taken as a rare rebuff of american leadership in the handling of an emergency the six countries complained that they had not been consulted on the 10 billion increase in loans to mexico , which was announced by president clinton on tuesday evening as part of an emergency package to bolster confidence in the falling peso there is a feeling of unease among europeans that the whole thing was not handled very well at all , said one european official whose country abstained european financial officials , none of whom wished to be named , said the plan was pushed through too quickly , without regard to whether it might dry up imf funds , including those for big developing countries with debt problems and the formerly communist countries of east europe we think the package was put together with too much haste and that the member countries did not have enough time to evaluate it , said a german government official some european financial officials said france would also have abstained were it not that the managing director of the fund , michel camdessus , is french european officials said that not only were they caught by surprise on tuesday when president clinton announced the increase of imf aid , to 178 billion from the previously announced 78 billion , but that they received the documents detailing the agreement less than an hour before the meeting on wednesday to vote on the package for many countries , this package came out of nowhere , said one french official there was no prior consultation this was done totally outside standard procedures no one wanted the package to collapse , but countries wanted to make a point a german official added we normally have two to three weeks to approve such aid packages when there is an emergency , we usually have two to three days on this one , we had less than an hour an american official at the imf acknowledged that the united states had not consulted its european allies before announcing the decision to go ahead with the mexico plan there was n't really time for consultation , said karin lissakers , the united states executive director at the imf the europeans are n't wrong about the lack of consultation and we understand fully their frustration she said the administration made the decision in order to stop what was clearly a growing crisis of confidence in mexico she added that despite criticism that too much money was offered in the package to mexico , it was better to err on too much rather than too small european officials said the size of the imf loan for mexico left them concerned about aid requests from other countries , particularly russia , which is currently negotiating a 15 billion package they said such a huge injection of funds into the mexican economy , while not jeopardizing the liquidity of the institution , would make it more difficult to provide loans to other countries the officials also warned that as a result of the mexican crisis , countries like brazil may need additional assistance and will come to the fund expecting larger loans the 178 billion is part of a package of about 50 billion in assistance for mexico announced by president clinton after he failed to muster support in congress for 40 billion in united states loan guarantees european central banks will put up 10 billion in loans from the bank for international settlements , based in basel , switzerland , and the united states has promised 20 billion from its exchange stabilization fund of concern to european financial officials was the fact that such large loans represent a change in the fund s lending policy usually , approval of imf assistance along with agreement by the receiving country to institute fiscal and monetary reforms is meant to cover a small portion of the monetary needs of a country in financial straits then the country can seek more help from commercial banks or other countries this amount greatly exceeds what would traditionally be the amount of imf lending , and we think it is a bad precedent , said a dutch official the fund is supposed to play a catalytic role european officials said the 178 billion was several times what mexico would qualify for under normal circumstances fund officials said no formal vote is normally taken on such loans , and none was recorded wednesday night but several european countries warned ahead of time that they would abstain and formally made that position clear today european officials said that despite their ire at what they regarded as being railroaded , the aid was needed and thus they did not vote against the program assistance packages like the one for

if bryant park can go from nickel bags to designer rags , how farfetched is the idea of a runway in hunts point \? look at it this way some of the trendiest downtown fashions and music have origins in the south bronx and other hiphop hothouses somebody else usually gets rich and famous the real auteurs get called bridge and tunnel people now a group of artists , organizers and entrepreneurs have come together to bring money and respect to hunts point , a peninsula long dominated by food distributors , auto parts stores and assorted hustlers working in an annex of the old american bank note building , the group , the point , is building a marketplace for fashion , food and books commerce will be next to culture when the group inaugurates its gallery and theater this summer , complete with a runway for fashion shows featuring the work of a local designer compared to a decade ago , hunts point has bounced back , with more housing and less crime but the founders of the point realized there were few ways to spend leisure time and money in the community not too long ago , the biggest attraction in the area was a new laundromat where you could watch movies and order food you can do housing , but if you do n't create a quality of life in the neighborhood , you 'll still have the turnover that got this place into the trouble it had in the first place , said paul lipson , one of the group s founders housing is just a vessel unless you make something to get people to stay the point s founders used to work at a nearby youth center that provided counseling , job training and other social services to the community but some had a broader vision borne of their own involvement in theater and dance others thought they could also attract new businesses they had already captured the attention of young people with programs in which the youths could make money selling homegrown herbs , firewood salvaged from scrap heaps and tshirts bearing original silkscreen designs the plan was a small business center with a theater program that would teach youths about everything from acting to lighting several foundations and corporations gave them money to get off the ground but to keep going , they needed tenants to share the cost of the space and free them from the vagaries of the box office they were first joined by unitas , a local counseling group that was looking for a lessclinical setting the point s founders then canvassed the neighborhood for budding businesses and found vance skerritt , a leather clothing designer edwin thomas , a hiphop barber , and belinda arroyo , a bookseller we wanted businesses that dealt with the arts as well , said mildred ruiz , a founder of the group we did n't want a mall atmosphere the synergy they envision goes beyond generating customer traffic they also want the business owners to be role models and sounding boards for the young people and their ideas they see it as the perfect blend of community , culture and commerce mr skerritt , who has been designing clothing since the early 1980 s , said it was about time he could have a real fashion show in the bronx until the point , he had dealt with customers in his garage workshop or visited them at their jobs i used to be in a lot of fashion shows but none of them were ever in the bronx , he said everything was in manhattan , queens or brooklyn but there s a lot of people here edwin thomas stood in the halffinished space where he 'll be giving haircuts in a few weeks , craning his neck as he decided where to put the video monitor that will show off the palmtree , panther and tiger designs he can shave into a hairstyle anything that can be done on paper , he said , i can do on the head granted , he had to work on his own head awhile before deciding to take a chance on moving to the point from his current warehouse space when you 've lived in hunts point all your life , you earn the right to wonder if you or your neighborhood will ever get a break i guess i was wrong this time , he said with a rapidfire laugh proving the critics wrong about the neighborhood wo n't be easy , but ms ruiz and her colleagues think there is enough talent and drive to fuel their quest for respect raised on the lower east side , she was won over when she arrived in the bronx a few years ago to work in a community dance program i used to talk about the bronx and be afraid of coming here , she said i 'd like to tell you that as someone from the lower east side , involved in our culture and art , i'm now here because this is the place a lot of it is coming from downtown , there are cliques , you 've got to sing a certain way and fit in here it s a different vibe people are ready to start something new
united nations , oct 5 following are excerpts from the address by pope john paul ii to the united nations general assembly today , as recorded by the associated press he spoke in english , french , russian , spanish , arabic and chinese , the official languages of the united nations mr president , ladies and gentlemen it is an honor for me to have the opportunity to address this international assembly and to join the men and women of every country , race , language and culture in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the united nations organization on the threshold of a new millennium we are witnessing an extraordinary global acceleration of that quest for freedom which is one of the great dynamics of human history this phenomenon is not limited to any one part of the world nor is it the expression of any single culture men and women throughout the world , even when threatened by violence , have taken the risk of freedom , asking to be given a place in social , political and economic life which is commensurate with their dignity as free human beings this universal longing for freedom is truly one of the distinguishing marks of our time it is important for us to grasp what might be called the inner structure of this worldwide movement it is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and confirms that there are indeed universal human rights , rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law these are not abstract points rather , these rights tell us something important about the actual life of every individual and of every social group they also remind us that we do not live in an irrational or meaningless world on the contrary , there is a moral logic which is built into human life and which makes possible dialogue between individuals and peoples if we want a century of violent coercion to be succeeded by a century of persuasion , we must find a way to discuss the human future intelligibly the universal moral law written on the human heart is precisely that kind of grammar which is needed if the world is to engage this discussion of its future the fall of communism the moral dynamics of this universal quest for freedom clearly appeared in central and eastern europe during the nonviolent revolutions of 1989 unfolding in specific times and places , those historical events nonetheless taught a lesson which goes far beyond a specific geographical location for the nonviolent revolutions of 1989 demonstrated that the quest for freedom cannot be suppressed it arises from a recognition of the inestimable dignity and value of the human person , and it cannot fail to be accompanied by a commitment on behalf of the human person modern totalitarianism has been , first and foremost , an assault on the dignity of the person , an assault which has gone even to the point of denying the inalienable value of the individual s life the revolutions of 1989 were made possible by the commitment of brave men and women inspired by a different , and ultimately more profound and powerful , vision the vision of man as a creature of intelligence and free will , immersed in a mystery which transcends his own being and endowed with the ability to reflect and the ability to choose and thus capable of wisdom and virtue a decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man s historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit the rights of nations the quest for freedom in the second half of the 20th century has engaged not only individuals but nations as well fifty years after the end of the second world war , it is important to remember that war was fought because of violations of the rights of nations unfortunately , even after the end of the second world war , the rights of nations continued to be violated to take but one set of examples , the baltic states and extensive territories in ukraine and belarus were absorbed into the soviet union , as had already happened to armenia , azerbaijan and georgia in the caucasus at the same time the socalled people s democracies of central and eastern europe effectively lost their sovereignty and were required to submit to the will dominating the entire bloc the result of this artificial division of europe was the cold war , a situation of international tension in which the threat of a nuclear holocaust hung over humanity it was only when freedom was restored to the nations of central and eastern europe that the promise of the peace which should have come with the end of the war began to be realized for many of the victims of that conflict a study of these rights is certainly not easy , if we consider the difficulty of defining the very concept of nation , which cannot be identified a priori and necessarily with the state such a study must nonetheless be made , if we wish to avoid the errors of the past and insure a just world order
as a unique custody battle raged round him late last week , ch tobe s return of the jedai , the most decorated but grizzled of veteran akitas in the dog show business , found himself a sunlit patch of snow in his lido beach , li , backyard and slept right through the family fireworks after all , this constituted normal behavior for the canine who snoozed in the same spot last september while a thief removed his master s lincoln from the driveway the 8 1 2yearold pinto akita , who goes by the more informal monicker of ben when he s hanging out with his owners , jay and ruth winston , is apparently thickskinned as well as thickcoated he will put his gray muzzle back in circulation today and take a dogtrot around madison square garden to attempt a record eighth bestofbreed victory at the westminster kennel club dog show ben , who spent most of 1994 in semiretirement after he tied a garden record for all breeds by capturing the akita crown for the seventh consecutive year , is a stranger to stress but the same ca n't be said for his quartet of human caretakers as the animal who is the apple of their collective eye slept on , the winstons , along with ben s longtime handler vic capone and ben s longtime groomer sue capone , vic s wife , stood locked in controversy over whether the dog should return to the garden one last time and try to break his own record the parameters of this particular battlefield were initially demarcated by gender it was spouse against spouse , and once that squabbling got too tense , the winstons decided to leave the decision to the capones , and vice versa the women , fearful of disappointment , wanted ben to doze on undisturbed the men wanted to take the risk of putting him back into the ultimate dog show ring against the ultimate competition among the 35 other champion akitas entered this year loomed the formidable ch chiheisen s take it to the maxx a k a mad maxx , a californian who won the breed s national specialty last september and the pride of las vegas , nev , ch the joker is wild o'bj , a dog whose most visible fan is betty white , a perk in a business where celebrities crop up like pedigrees nobody put the question directly to ben , but everyone agreed that he 'd never turn down a last chance to show off at the garden after all , he would n't even know if he lost , said his handler , who has paced ben to 23 allbreed bestinshow honors over the years i never let him know until wednesday evening , ruth winston and sue capone , backed up by several sympathetic show judges of their gender , had the upper hand regarding ben s already prolonged career the dog s sevenyear stretch run was not to be blemished by a potential defeat although ruth winston had dutifully entered ben at westminster , she 'd spent the past two months convincing her husband it was wiser to let the dog retire an undisputed winner at the garden and her logic seemed to be working instead of spending his winter at the capone kennel in pennsylvania getting groomed and revved up for westminster as he had in past seasons , there was ben , with his ruddy fur unbathed and his toenails unclipped , lounging in the backyard sue made a promise to god last year that if ben won , he would n't have to show again , said ruth winston neither of us wanted to see him get beat the way we saw it , another win would be nice , but a loss would be devastating devastating to ben \? no , admitted his cautious owner he could n't care less as crunch time approached , jay winston , who 'd had visions of racing home from a blacktie dinner in manhattan sunday night and sneaking ben out of the house and into the ring this morning , chipped away at his wife s resolve he reminded her how wonderfully their red , white and slightly gray dog still moved , how his coat still gleamed even without a shampoo , how happy he was in the cacophonous garden show ring after a flutter of telephone negotiations with the capones , jay winston and ben headed for pennsylvania late wednesday night , and by thursday afternoon , the dog had already had the first of two baths and was waiting for his combout we raised five sons , and none of them got better care than ben did , but then again , none of them ever went best in show , said an elated jay winston winston is , in fact , so enamored of this dog that he forgave him for not waking up the household the night his car was stolen the way i figure it , ben was protecting me he did n't want to see me come running out of the house in my underwear and into a dangerous situation in the middle of the night and , besides , i did n't really like that car , anyway , he rationalized in pennsylvania , as sue capone fretted over ben s gray hair , vic capone checked out the dog s fitness and was pleasantly surprised he was also encouraged by an offhand comment he 'd heard from a judge a week ago he told me there was nothing out there that can beat him , capone said of course , i do n't want to see ben lose , but i have faith in him back home on long island , ruth winston remained apprehensive but took care of the other details this sudden decision to show her dog mandated , which included hiring a guard for ben during his garden stint the tonya harding syndrome , she said , has always existed in the shadows of the dogshow circuit sometimes the top dogs have cosmetic accidents , like the newfoundland who was recently shaved in the dead of night , and some dogs actually receive death threats three or so years ago , when ben kept winning at westminster , i got a phone call that warned me against taking ben back to westminster the person said i 'd go home with one less dog if i did , she said but this year , ruth winston s biggest worry is n't over unsavory competitors it s over the younger , stronger , strapping competition facing ben , who will soon appear in a coffeetable book dedicated to the great dogs it s scary to see him possibly leave westminster on a loss , that s a problem for me , she admitted it s also a problem if the judges are tired of seeing him some of them think the older dogs should make way for the new upandcoming dogs lester mapes , the judge for the akita class , promised he would n't be prejudiced for or against ben , a dog he regards as the best mover the breed has seen it s true that judges get excited when they see a new dog , but they also get excited by quality , said mapes , who has been certified to judge since 1971 i 've judged ben before i 've put him up and i 've put him down i'm an old man , too , and i 'd have to say if the competition was between me and some young studmuffin , i 'd say go ahead and pick the studmuffin but what if the old guy had more class \?

jeremie , haiti , jan 13 when american troops first arrived here in september , the local population greeted them as liberators but for many in this isolated town of 25 , 000 at the tip of haiti s southern peninsula , the americans have turned out to be not saviors of the haitian people , but rather allies of the paramilitary groups that oppressed haitians for a generation human rights groups say that while reports of collaboration between the united states military and such groups have been rare in portauprince , where most of the 6 , 000 american troops still in haiti are deployed , such accusations are often heard from provincial centers and the countryside in those areas , where 70 percent of the population lives , small units of the united states special forces and international police monitors have been sent to keep order and supervise the transition to democratic rule after restoring the country s democratically elected president , jeanbertrand aristide relations in jeremie , where the american contingent has been cut from 20 down to 8 , have frayed to the point that an american soldier aimed his rifle and bayonet at angry aristide supporters protesting against the fact that the paramilitary forces still controlled a large number of local government offices this is not your country , they chanted go back home the people of jeremie are anxious because it is not just that they are walking hand in hand , hugue leopold , the local representative of the aristide government , said of the relationship between the american soldiers and the paramilitary groups it s a marriage between the two residents have similar complaints in neighborhoods where the haitian army and allied groups like the front for the advancement and progress of haiti , or fraph , preyed on residents after president aristide was overthrown in 1991 he was a roman catholic priest when elected in 1990 , but since his restoration to the presidency he has tendered , and the vatican has accepted , his resignation from the priesthood people here cite a series of incidents over the last four months in which they say the international force of american soldiers and australian police monitors appeared to be acting in concert with fraph and the haitian military in jeremie on oct 15 , the day president aristide was restored to power , haitian soldiers shot and killed a 15yearold boy at a street celebration in a nearby town they were given refuge with the americans at the barracks here and were later freed without charges the shooting was declared accidental two weeks later , four supporters of president aristide were arrested without a warrant by a police squad apparently under the command of a leader of the local fraph office and taken to police headquarters , where they said they were threatened and harassed witnesses said american soldiers , who had accompanied the fraphled squad , had not stopped the illegal arrest a fraph leader , jean bonhomme , accused of numerous killings , kidnappings and beatings under the military dictatorship , including the murder of a poor radio repairman and father of 15 children named jeanclaude dimanche , was taken into custody in october by haitian officials working under american supervision he then mysteriously disappeared from prison in late november , a respected roman catholic priest who had long worked with the poor to oppose human rights abuses and corruption was arrested by haitian police and australian monitors based on a warrant drawn up by fraph leaders the cleric was freed only after a large and indignant crowd marched to police headquarters and demanded his release when the haitian people ask the americans to arrest the macoutes , they pay no attention , or they arrest them and then release them , said renel jean , 32 , a teacher the tontons macoute , the enforcers for the former duvalier dictatorship , set the standard for political thuggery in haiti , and the term is now used generically here but when the fraph asks for a person of the people to be arrested , it happens right away , mr jean added we are really disillusioned chief warrant officer byron sevario , who leads the small special forces detachment here , acknowledged that there was a perception that we 're associated with or are buddybuddy with the macoutes but mr sevario said that impression was mistaken , since we 're here to assure that the laws of haiti are being carried out regardless of whoever is in charge at the time he also expressed reservations about the behavior of some of aristide supporters , contending that at the demonstration in which one of his soldiers drew his gun , the protesters were all drunk and there was a tremendous amount of young fit men , which throws up a red flag in my mind the gradual deterioration of confidence here is a reminder that although the clinton administration achieved a quick victory in haiti in september by persuading the military to step down , this country remains a political minefield officials in portauprince say the tensions illustrate the dangers that can arise when soldiers are asked to perform the duties of diplomats and administrators

morioka , japan he is a cheerful old farmer who jokes as he serves rice cakes made by his wife , and then he switches easily to explaining what it is like to cut open a 30yearold man who is tied naked to a bed and dissect him alive , without anesthetic the fellow knew that it was over for him , and so he did n't struggle when they led him into the room and tied him down , recalled the 72yearold farmer , then a medical assistant in a japanese army unit in china in world war ii but when i picked up the scalpel , that s when he began screaming i cut him open from the chest to the stomach , and he screamed terribly , and his face was all twisted in agony he made this unimaginable sound , he was screaming so horribly but then finally he stopped this was all in a day s work for the surgeons , but it really left an impression on me because it was my first time finally the old man , who insisted on anonymity , explained the reason for the vivisection the chinese prisoner had been deliberately infected with the plague as part of a research project the full horror of which is only now emerging to develop plague bombs for use in world war ii after infecting him , the researchers decided to cut him open to see what the disease does to a man s inside no anesthetic was used , he said , out of concern that it might have an effect on the results that research program was one of the great secrets of japan during and after world war ii a vast project to develop weapons of biological warfare , including plague , anthrax , cholera and a dozen other pathogens unit 731 of the japanese imperial army conducted research by experimenting on humans and by field testing plague bombs by dropping them on chinese cities to see whether they could start plague outbreaks they could a trickle of information about the program has turned into a stream and now a torrent half a century after the end of the war , a rush of books , documentaries and exhibitions are unlocking the past and helping arouse interest in japan in the atrocities committed by some of japan s most distinguished doctors scholars and former members of the unit say that at least 3 , 000 people by some accounts several times as many were killed in the medical experiments none survived no one knows how many died in the field testing it is becoming evident that the japanese officers in charge of the program hoped to use their weapons against the united states they proposed using balloon bombs to carry disease to america , and they had a plan in the summer of 1945 to use kamikaze pilots to dump plagueinfected fleas on san diego the research was kept secret after the end of the war in part because the united states army granted immunity from war crimes prosecution to the doctors in exchange for their data japanese and american documents show that the united states helped cover up the human experimentation instead of putting the ringleaders on trial , it gave them stipends the accounts are wrenching to read even after so much time has passed a russian mother and daughter left in a gas chamber , for example , as doctors peered through thick glass and timed their convulsions , watching as the woman sprawled over her child in a futile effort to save her from the gas the origins ban on weapon entices military japan s biological weapons program was born in the 1930 s , in part because japanese officials were impressed that germ warfare had been banned by the geneva convention of 1925 if it was so awful that it had to be banned under international law , the officers reasoned , it must make a great weapon the japanese army , which then occupyied a large chunk of china , evicted the residents of eight villages near harbin , in manchuria , to make way for the headquarters of unit 731 one advantage of china , from the japanese point of view , was the availability of research subjects on whom germs could be tested the subjects were called marutas , or logs , and most were communist sympathizers or ordinary criminals the majority were chinese , but many were russians , expatriates living in china takeo wano , a 71yearold former medical worker in unit 731 who now lives here in the northern japanese city of morioka , said he once saw a sixfoothigh glass jar in which a western man was pickled in formaldehyde the man had been cut into two pieces , vertically , and mr wano guesses that he was russian because there were many russians then living in the area the unit 731 headquarters contained many other such jars with specimens they contained feet , heads , internal organs , all neatly labeled i saw samples with labels saying 'american , ' 'english' and 'frenchman , ' but most were chinese , koreans and mongolians , said a unit 731 veteran who insisted on anonymity those labeled as american were just body parts , like hands or feet , and some were sent in by other military units there is no evidence that americans were among the victims in the unit 731 compound , although there have been persistent but unproven accusations that american prisoners of war in mukden \( now shenyang \) were subject to medical experimentation
when it comes to the intersection of high and low culture , the designer elsa schiaparelli is one of the century s preeminent crossing guards schiaparelli , who was born in rome in 1900 , gave the world shocking pink and was the first haute couture designer to use zippers \( for decoration as well as function \) but she mainly thought of herself as an artist and actively sought collaboration with other artists , be they surrealists like salvador dali and jean cocteau , jewelry designers like jean clement , or albert lasage , who ran paris s most prestigious embroidery house according to a slice of schiaparelli , the small , delightful , aptly titled sampling of her strange and rich output at the brooklyn museum , schiaparelli definitely favored surface over structure , usually approaching clothing as a kind of canvas on which to paint her beautifully colored and detailed garments are amazingly , amusingly and sometimes obviously representational , possessing a flair and inventiveness that can be visually irresistible the clothes and accessories in this show date from schiaparelli s best period , the 1930 s , when she was establishing her couture house in paris and was in thick with the surrealists included here are the stylish cardigan sweaters that first brought her attention , enhanced by clement s sculptural buttons also on view is an unusually plain red evening coat whose gold , shelllike buttons were the work of cocteau unfortunately , none of schiaparelli s collaborations with dali are represented here \( these included evening dresses made of fabrics designed by dali , and a hat in the shape of a woman s pump \) nonetheless , one still gets a taste of the skill with which schiaparelli translated some of surrealism s shock tactics , displacements and trompe l'oeil effects into her own work most startling is an insect necklace that creates the discomfiting illusion , because of the use of clear perspex , of lifelike beetles sitting directly on the wearer s body also strange are jacket fasteners in the shape of small hand mirrors that would reflect the faces of their wearer s admirers more gorgeous than shocking is a white dress embroidered in metallic threads with musical scores , which was worn with a belt whose buckle included an actual music box the show s standout is the black velvet zodiac jacket , elaborately embroidered with astrological signs and shooting stars in heavy gold and dotted with crescent moons in rhinestones , constellations and little galaxies in rhinestones also here are a number of trompe l'oeil hats in which the artificial flowers , leaves and berries often involved in ladies' millinery are exaggerated into profuse little cornucopias what s most fascinating is schiaparelli s clear desire to exaggerate the garment as an object of delectation , and the contradictions inherent in the way she expressed this desire her playful pictorialism turned women into walking works of art , in a sense objectifying them more than ever at the same time , this pictorialism was made manifest in imagery that continually deflected thought and vision away from the female body beneath the garments and toward the world at large the results often feel strangely liberating , almost in spite of themselves a slice of schiaparelli surrealism in fashion from the brooklyn museum remains at the brooklyn museum , 200 eastern parkway , at prospect park , through march 24 photo two designs by elsa schiaparelli a winter dinner jacket \( 193839 \) , above , and a 1937 butterfly evening dress with matching parasol , at the brooklyn museum \( william palmer brooklyn museum \)

washington , dec 22 two hours of budget talks between president clinton and republican congressional leaders ended today without the kind of rancor that has so far characterized these negotiations , but it remained clear that the standoff that has closed much of the government for a week is nowhere near ending indeed , the principals said after the white house meeting that they would not even meet again until next friday , making it almost certain that many federal parks and many government offices will remain closed , at least until the new year little was revealed about the discussion by the participants , who included mr clinton , vice president al gore , speaker newt gingrich , senator bob dole and the chairmen of the two congressional budget committees but people on both sides , all of whom demanded anonymity , said that the two sides had examined the barriers that have so far blocked an agreement , including the important issues of spending for medicare and medicaid but they said they had reached no major decisions the most heartening accomplishment , one said , may well have been an agreement to tone down the caustic attacks each side has lobbed during the last month of bargaining we discussed some very difficult issues , admitting the hard decisions have n't been made yet , mr dole said later without being too specific , it s fair to say that at least right now , the attitude of everyone is very positive beyond a joint statement that pronounced today s meeting good , the white house had little to say the president wants , above all , to see the restoration of the government services , said mr clinton s press secretary , michael d mccurry but everybody here knows that s not going to happen republicans insisted that they would continue to block temporary spending legislation that would allow government offices to reopen until the white house agreed to a sevenyear plan to erase the federal deficit but even as the republicans did so , they moved to ease the effect of the shutdown on their constituents , many of whom are voters both chambers approved a resolution today freeing money to back a flood of government benefit checks for constituents they include 33 million veterans and their families , 13 million recipients of aid to families with dependent children and others receiving adoption and fostercare assistance congress also approved money for a pending medicare payment to the states and a temporary stipend for the district of columbia , whose budget comes in part from the federal treasury mr dole said the white house and congress had also agreed that federal workers who have been furloughed without pay during the current government shutdown would be paid in full when the crisis ended , if not before as the two sides bargained , the scope of the government shutdown now one week long , a record widened a bit two more federal agencies , the forest service and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , ran out of money that had been saved from the previous year s budget and closed that increased the number of outofwork federal employees to 280 , 000 from 260 , 000 the budget impasse had already forced the closing of nine cabinet agencies and a slew of other offices , including nasa and the environmental protection agency in contrast with the seething disputes that have marked earlier negotiations , the atmosphere at today s white house meeting apparently was friendly and businesslike perhaps underscoring that , the republican at the meeting who has adopted the toughest negotiating stance , representative dick armey of texas , the majority leader , said later that we have reason for optimism that a budget accord could be reached we had a sense of a very cordial , workmanshiplike rapport that should give us some confidence progress will be made , he told the house the negotiators did make a speck of progress aides said the two sides had ratified a proposal made on thursday in lowerlevel talks to pare about 40 billion from spending in the next seven years on federal employee benefits and on veterans , energy and banking programs those cuts , none very controversial , leave a gap of about 250 billion between the administration s most recent sevenyear budget proposal and the latest republican plan by republican reckoning , that is a quarter of the 1 trillion or so that must be saved to balance the budget by 2002 in an indication of just how hard it will be to bridge that gap , the principals at today s meeting effectively decided to give themselves a week , and everyone else a fiveday holiday break , before congressional aides and white house spending experts resume the stoop labor of rooting for compromise that came as a surprise , given the breadth of the federal shutdown and the urgency of the government s fiscal situation the government has reached its debt ceiling its borrowing limit , in other words and is financing part of its operations by dipping into internal accounts how long that can go on is not clear nevertheless , mr mccurry told reporters that it would n't be a fruitful exercise for the president and congressional leaders to plunge into talks when such deep divisions over issues like medicare had not been thoroughly analyzed republicans seemed to agree mr armey told house members to go home and to expect that they would not be called back into session until at least next saturday , and most probably after that the senate also quit , and neither side is officially scheduled to return until jan 3 before the senate adjourned , it tried to engineer a quick legislative fix that would effectively allow federal employees to return to work and open their offices while the formal shutdown continued the fix , approved on a voice vote , would temporarily deem every federal worker essential for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property all such workers are already required by law to stay on the job even during federal shutdowns the fix would also temporarily erase another clause in existing law that bars those employees from receiving pay those changes were proposed by mr dole , clearly a reluctant ally of mr gingrich and other conservatives in keeping the federal government closed down my view is , they ought to go back to work , he said they 're the victims they 're the pawns in this struggle for a balanced budget but the proposal was approved after the house had left for the holiday , and it could not be taken up until wednesday , when a handful of legislators will gather for a pro forma session the plan is given little chance in the house , where fiscal conservatives believe that the shutdown is the only club they have to force mr clinton into serious budgetcutting the house s republican freshmen , among the most impassioned advocates of fiscal balance , underscored that today at a news conference the freshmen understand there has to be negotiation , said representative mark e souder of indiana , one of the class leaders , at the event , but you have to have something from which to negotiate photo the budget talks ended with less bitterness than usualyesterday , but without much progress on the issues \( paul hosefros the new york times \)

after a twomonth investigation into a drunken spree by new york city police officers through six washington hotels , police officials said yesterday that no more than 7 of the 942 officers in the capital at the time faced serious departmental charges the small number of officers identified stands in sharp contrast to initial reports from washington , which indicated that dozens upon dozens of drunken new york officers were grabbing women , spraying fire extinguishers , pulling fire alarms and prancing about nude washington hoteliers estimated at the time that up to 100 new york officers were involved but as police officials yesterday discussed the results of the investigation , it remained unclear just how many new york officers committed serious offenses speaking of the seven officers identified so far , one senior police official said , these were the only ones we could catch police commissioner william j bratton and mayor rudolph w giuliani also conceded that some officers likely escaped punishment either because investigators could find no photographs or videotapes of the wild behavior or because other officers who witnessed the spree refused to identify their colleagues but in his official accounting of the incident , mr bratton also suggested that the original reports from washington exaggerated the involvement of new york officers some offenders , he said , were actually officers from other cities who wore new york police caps and shirts in addition to the charges against the seven officers , mr bratton said , 2 captains , 9 sergeants and 18 other members of the force disobeyed direct orders against taking their firearms to the capital for what was supposed to be a solemn trip to commemorate fallen officers from around the country one captain faces possible loss of his command for his lack of candor in interviews with investigators , but the others will simply receive disciplinary letters for their permanent personnel files mr bratton s comments were based on an internal report by the internal affairs bureau , which investigated the incident the department refused to release the report mr bratton characterized the investigation as one of the most significant and massive ever conducted by this department at a news conference at police headquarters , mr bratton walked a fine line between downplaying an incident that he suggested was overblown in news reports and condoning behavior that he said was an arrogant display by officers who thought they were above the law the behavior this year may not have been as bad as previous years , he said at one point but later he said , any nitwit who slides down a bannister in the nude in front of 150 people is a moron , guaranteed an angry reference to two officers who have been suspended from duty for doing just that in the lobby of the hyatt regency hotel not a single officer is expected to face criminal charges , despite two initial reports of theft and shooting of guns from a hotel window that police investigators could not substantiate one of the thefts involved a rack of lights from the top of a massachusetts police car according to the police , 24 fingerprints lifted from the vehicle did not match the prints from any members of the new york force police investigators also said that one rowdy party in the bellevue hotel that disturbed guests was attended by new jersey correctional officers and not by new york police officers investigators also said they could find no ballistics evidence or eyewitnesses to corroborate reports of gunfire at the bellevue hotel paul delaney , general manager of the hotel , said yesterday that the blasts might have been firecrackers , but he added , guests were reporting gunfire to the overnight desk person , and i'm sure they did n't invent it out of whole cloth at 3 or 4 in the morning but it was the incident in the lobby of the hyatt regency that best highlights questions about how many officers were involved in serious misconduct and about the investigation that followed mr bratton said officers wayne j hagmaier and james j morrow were the only officers who poured beer down a metal strip between two bannisters , took their pants off and then glided down before scores of cheering hotel guests and conventioneers at 2 35 am but susan jacobsen , a spokeswoman for the hotel , said that according to a report by hotel security , two men poured beer down the escalator railings while a total of six men took off their pants and promptly slid down she said the six officers were escorted to their rooms by washington police officers tom kelly , the deputy police commissioner for public information , said the hotel had never shared the report with new york police investigators he said the discrepancy in accounts might be explained by the fact that officers hagmaier and morrow slid down the escalator three times each we are comfortable it is these two , mr kelly said critics quickly found fault with the department s handling of the incident , with some saying the department did not pursue all its leads while others complained that officials prematurely stoked expectations that many more officers would be punished
news that the spirits and beverage company seagram wants to sell its 25 percent stake in du pont for nearly 10 billion may be a good move for du pont investors , who showed their interest yesterday by nudging up the chemical company s shares 50 cents but a deal may go down less easily for shareholders of the seagram company , whose president , edgar bronfman jr , is said to be interested in using the money to buy all or part of the film and entertainment company mca inc according to several people close to the negotiations , as soon as the deal with du pont is completed , seagram will try to complete an offer for control of mca and has already held discussions with mca to that end making an offer for mca would be in keeping with a longheld dream of mr bronfman , scion of a wealthy canadian family , who has long had an affinity for the entertainment business and sees the communications industry as a good longterm investment but selling the stake in ei du pont de nemours company , whatever the reason , could antagonize a lot of seagram shareholders they might sorely miss the steady stream of nearly taxfree dividends from the du pont stake , which has helped offset seagram s otherwise lackluster financial performance yesterday , seagram s stock fell 1375 a share to close at 30375 in seagram s recently concluded fiscal year , du pont s dividends and equity income accounted for nearly threefourths of seagram s pershare income of 241 , according to martin romm , who follows seagram for the first boston corporation selling the du pont stake would be disappointing to seagram investors , mr romm said , because it represents an important part of their earnings and their financial stability spoiled by the performance of the du pont holding , which has also grown more than three times since seagram acquired it for 328 billion in 1981 , seagram investors may have little stomach for the vagaries of the entertainment industry that may be especially true of mca , which would be coming on the market primarily because its japanese owner , the matsushita electrical industrial company , has been unable to make much money from it and has a sour relationship with mca s american management but to those who know mr bronfman , the company s interest in selling off its 249 percent stake in du pont , comes as no surprise the 39yearold president of seagram is responsible for the company s acquisition of beverage and spirits properties like tropicana products inc and martell sa , and for its acquiring nearly 15 percent of time warner inc but mr bronfman is said to be unhappy with du pont s main business he views the chemical industry as too cyclical , too capital intensive and too fraught with potential environmental problems although mr bronfman did not return phone calls yesterday , several associates said he had been seeking to sell the du pont stake back to the company for several months and yesterday a du pont spokesman said the company would not have a philosophical problem with buying back the seagram stake there would be serious tax implications in any stock buyback because it would represent a substantial capital gain for seagram and even if seagram did devise a way to circumvent a substantial capital gains tax , any such move could create a political backlash in washington as viacom inc recently learned when it tried to avoid a capital gains tax by agreeing to sell its cable properties to a minorityowned investment partnership that moved was blocked by congress the senate yesterday passed the final bill to eliminate the tax breaks in such media deals , sending it on to the white house one way seagram might circumvent problems in washington would be for du pont to acquire the mca stake and then swap it with seagram for seagram s stake in du pont , according to people familiar with the negotiations indeed , that strategy is already being contemplated , these people said not all seagram shareholders would necessarily oppose the du pont sale , or even the purchase of mca at least one large institutional holder , who insisted on anonymity , said yesterday that he thought such moves would be peachy keen this person shares mr bronfman s view that the chemicals business has too many problems ahead and that the communications industry has far better longterm prospects this large shareholder conceded that investors who look solely to earnings are likely to disagree but he said that those who believe in building longterm asset value are going to side with mr bronfman , even if seagram s pershare earnings are hurt in the short run other members of the bronfman family , which owns roughly 32 percent of seagram , might very well share the assetbuilding view , though none would comment mr bronfman s grandfather , a russian refugee , founded the company in toronto in 1924 today , mr bronfman s father , edgar sr , is chairman , and other family members are also on the board the family s piece of seagram is worth an estimated 36 billion just how , or precisely why , seagram might be willing to pay the 8 billion or 9 billion it could take to acquire mca , remains unclear but seagram may not need to buy all of mca to gain control according to several people familiar with the negotiations , matsushita hopes to keep some stake in mca while selling a controlling block to a buyer mr bronfman has already edged seagram into the entertainment field by buying the stake in time warner in the last two years that 2 billion investment so far shows a slight loss , but mr bronfman s enthusiasm for the entertainment business is no passing fancy he once worked as a script writer for the movie producer david puttnam and when mr bronfman agreed to join the family business in 1982 , at the urging of his father , he brought with him a lasting conviction that these days , movies , music and television can hold out the same sort of longterm business prospects that his immigrant grandfather saw in scotch and other whisky more than 70 years ago photo edgar bronfman jr , the president of seagram , has long had an affinity for the entertainment business \( the seagram company \) graph where the profits came from

washington , aug 11 four highranking officials of the federal bureau of investigation were suspended today after the justice department opened a broad new criminal investigation into the possibility of a highlevel coverup of what really happened during a deadly 1992 standoff with a white separatist in idaho among those suspended today by the fbi director , louis b freeh , was larry a potts , mr freeh s close friend whom he had made the bureau s no 2 official before demoting him recently because of his role in the idaho shootout on thursday night , the justice department forwarded new findings on the incident for possible criminal prosecution to eric holder , the united states attorney for the district of columbia , department officials said the documents sent to mr holder , the chief federal prosecutor in the capital , raise the possibility that the four officials , and a fifth who was suspended earlier , may have committed obstruction of justice in the form of false testimony and destruction of documents the fifth fbi official , e michael kahoe , was suspended last month after justice department investigators uncovered evidence that he may have destroyed an fbi analysis of the siege we know that kahoe destroyed documents , said one justice department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity the question we have to logically ask is whether he did it on his own in addition , justice department officials said the new report also concluded that other fbi officials besides mr kahoe appeared to have lied about what had occurred one senior justice department official said that mr freeh and deputy attorney general jamie gorelick were furious upon learning from the report that they may have been deceived by senior fbi agents the official said there was far less evidence that mr potts and one of the other suspended officials , danny o coulson , participated in a coverup than the other three officials but the official said that mr freeh wanted to include all possible suspects in the investigation in addition to mr potts , who was head of the bureau s criminal division at the time of the idaho standoff , and mr coulson , who was his deputy , the others suspended today are gale richard evans and anthony a betz , who at the time were unit chiefs in the criminal investigative division mr freeh said in announcing the suspensions that he remained committed to finding out the full truth about what occurred during and after the tragic events at ruby ridge , idaho on aug 21 , 1992 , mr potts dispatched the fbi s hostage rescue team to a remote mountain top in ruby ridge after a shootout in which a federal marshal and the 14yearold son of the white separatist , randall c weaver , were killed the next day , an fbi sharpshooter killed mr weaver s wife , vicki , who was unarmed and standing in the cabin doorway holding her infant daughter the fbi marksman said he was aiming at another person , who was armed longstanding fbi policy allows agents to shoot only in selfdefense but a looser set of rules of engagement were adopted during the siege allowing agents there to shoot on sight virtually anyone who was armed and the fbi has been roiled ever since by a series of investigations into who approved the change the latest justice department investigation was begun early this year after the commander at the scene , eugene glenn , who was suspended and transferred after the incident , charged that he was being punished unfairly during the earlier inquiries , mr glenn said mr potts had authorized the change , while mr potts had said that mr glenn had acted on his own in january , mr freeh laid the blame for the faulty rules of engagement mostly on mr glenn and the head of the hostage rescue team , richard rogers mr glenn s complaint was that it was unfair for him to have been suspended and transferred by the director , who had handed out lighter punishments to officials like mr potts who were based at headquarters in washington mr potts had been given a letter of censure , the mildest available punishment in the letter , mr freeh criticized mr potts for what he called his management oversight in failing to supervise properly the onscene commander s alteration of the rules of engagement mr glenn s persistent complaints resulted in an investigation by the office of professional responsibility at the justice department dan k webb , mr potts s lawyer , issued a statement saying there was absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing by larry potts and this suspension by the fbi is completely unwarranted none of the other suspended officials could be reached for comment mr potts was demoted last month to the training division mr coulson is now chief of the bureau s dallas office mr evans is assistant chief of the salt lake city office , and mr betz is assistant chief of the baltimore office all were suspended with pay mr kahoe , who had been the special agent in charge of the bureau s jacksonville office , had been assigned to review the bureau s conduct in ruby ridge a senate committee is planning to open hearings on the ruby ridge incident in september the incident has come to symbolize the arrogance of government officials along with the disastrous events near waco , tex , two years ago in which the fbi s 51day siege of the branch davidian compound ended in a fire which killed about 80 members of the cult a 1994 justice department report on the ruby ridge incident , which has never been officially released but which was provided to news organizations by government officials who believed the idaho operation needed a fuller public airing , shows that the fbi fought to keep its files closed to outsiders , even federal prosecutors after mr weaver surrendered , the united states attorney s office in boise obtained a broad conspiracy indictment against him and an associate but the prosecutors were stunned to find themselves in a confrontation with their usual ally , the fbi , in trying to investigate the events as maurice o ellsworth , who was the united states attorney in boise in 1993 , described it in the report we felt like we were battling on two fronts , the defense counsel and the fbi
there was a time when black music was expected to supply black audiences with all the plots , characters and dramas , all the distinctions of class , region and style that in a reasonably integrated america would have found their way into white mainstream plays , movies , novels and television shows that may be one reason the music took so many forms \( jazz , blues , gospel \) , and why the offshoot of each form had its own name \( rhythmandblues , doowop , soul \) , and its own musical , and social , twist but none of these forms had lived an entirely segregated life to one degree or another they had all taken what they wanted or needed from white music with its youthful postwar brashness , aimed at teenagers , rockandroll sped up this process the black pioneers of rockandroll were not giving america unfettered race testimony or selfexpression they were giving america calculated entertainment in bright racial technicolor rockandroll was show business to secure a mass audience it had to appeal to young blacks across class lines be funky but suave too primal , then languid , then ironic and it had to lure young whites across both class lines and the great racial divide it had to be exotic enough to thrill them but familiar enough to make them feel at home no one managed this feat with more efficiency or more panache than berry gordy he started motown records in detroit in 1959 , called it hitsville and went on to generate an unbroken string of hit records , beginning in the early 1960 s and extending into the early 70 s , a decade when the youth culture was in flower some black performers like ike and tina turner and etta james played rhythmandblues rock , with its aura of back roads and mean streets and rough sex others like otis redding , wilson pickett , aretha franklin and curtis mayfield played soulrock , with its melodrama \( i yearn , i burn , i cajole , i tease , i strut , i conquer , i beg , i weep , i curse \) and its love of latintinged beats and gospel phrasings motown groups like the supremes , the temptations and the miracles drew on these styles but they drew on the pop song conventions of tin pan alley streamlined emotions , stories told in crisp rhythms , clean patches of melody and neatly resolved rhymes and images memoirs , histories and exposes of motown have been appearing since the late 1970 s now the music is reappearing , in handsome boxed sets \( the politics of the 1960 s are taking a beating right now , but 60 s clothes and songs are all the rage \) and so , mr gordy has finally stepped forward to tell the story his way in november , he canonized himself with an autobiography called to be loved and an album called the music , the memories , the magic of motown a tribute to berry gordy has just appeared the autobiography takes its title from a hit he wrote for jackie wilson fair enough , but it is hard not to roll one s eyes heavenward when he declares that being loved is the key to who he is and what he has always longed for oh , please , mr gordy , you want to say you were the founder and ruler of motown you oversaw the invention of an american sound and style , you made millions of dollars doing it , you made and unmade careers as you saw fit in your way you were as important as that other assemblyline autocrat from detroit , henry ford you have been revered , obeyed and imitated must you insist on being loved as well \? as for the album , it contains 14 gordy tunes three of them , lonely teardrops , to be loved and money \( that s what i want \) , were hits , and deserved to be the others were not hits , and deserved not to be mr gordy will be remembered as a producer , not a songwriter but after all these years , the original motown sound is still lovable all the elements were there in just the right balance insolence and innocence , earthiness and pithiness , sly touches of individuality within a sleek massproduced whole mr gordy s memories of his own magic are pious and sentimental nevertheless , he has earned his spot in rockandroll history he had learned the basics of musical miscegenation from the rambunctious black fathers of rockandroll one was bo diddley with his leather vests , bigbrimmed western hats and feathers , he was an urban cowboy , an outlaw and roustabout whose songs were tall tales set to a rolling bass in 19thcentury songs and stories , davy crockett boasted i can walk like an ox , run like a fox , swim like an eel , yell like an indian , fight like a devil , spout like an earthquake , make love like a mad bull and swallow a nigger whole without choking onehundred and twentyfive years later , bo diddley sprang forth boasting i walked 47 miles of barbed wire , i use a cobra snake for a necktie , there s a brandnew house on the roadside made out of rattlesnake hide there s a little bitty chimney built up on top made out of a human skull come on , pretty baby , take a walk with me and tell me , who do you love \? along with liberace , little richard was an advance man for mass culture s acceptance of camp his look the pompadour , the lipstick and false eyelashes , the big suits was outrageous and aggressive , but his sexuality was too selfabsorbed to be threatening black male heterosexuality seemed safely channeled not only into homosexuality \( which dared not speak its name in rock then \) but into zany parody selfcongratulation side by side with selfmockery
glen cove , li , march 1 for 71 straight games , the story of basketball at the webb institute of naval architecture has been depressingly the same webb sinks baskets the other team sinks more a lot more the school , in fact , has not won a game in seven years the last college it beat no longer exists defeat is such a tradition that the streak is not even a record for webb , a fouryear marine engineering school on long island sound that has just 75 students the previous string of 139 consecutive losses began in the early days of the ford administration , and was not broken until the end of ronald reagan s first term given the paucity of euphoric moments in the locker room , it would be understandable if the basketball powersthatbe at webb just gave up but that is not the way at webb forget that webb players perform on the court like fine naval architects forget that the team s star forward has to miss the last two games of the season because he is doing an internship on a ship in the middle of the atlantic ocean forget even that the coach , at just over 6 feet , towers overs most of his players the simple fact is that the webb players , who have never known the pleasure of looking up at the scoreboard at the end of a game and seeing a bigger number on their side , love playing ball and they plan to keep doing it , they say , until they get it right playing college basketball , mused gene miller , the team s center and cocaptain i can think of a dozen guys i 've known who 'd kill for the chance to get their brains beaten out like this it is not that the webb clippers are gluttons for punishment they would probably trade all the kind remarks about their grit , about how courageous it is for a school of 75 students to compete against colleges enrolling thousands , for one cathartic moment of triumph the team got achingly close to that feeling during a game against pratt institute earlier this season , when , in the second half , webb found itself in a wholly unaccustomed position ahead by a point they called a time out , mr miller recalled i could n't believe it we forced a time out ! eventually , pratt came back that night , overwhelming the clippers , 7345 when they went into the locker room , there were no recriminations in fact , the coach , richard harris , an adjunct english professor at webb , was downright proud you can never question their effort , mr harris said the other day as he watched the 11man squad work out in the webb gymnasium we have guys , even 40 points down , diving for the ball they hated having lost to pratt , but they felt good about playing well webb , one of the most academically selective schools in the nation , entertains no dreams of becoming a powerhouse in basketball , although coach harris keeps alive his own little fantasy i'm looking for a 6foot7 guy with great sat s and a messiah complex , he said the school offers no athletic scholarships and allows any student , regardless of ability , to join the team there is none of the typical bigschool pressure to win from the alumni , many of whom , after all , had a hand in that 139game losing streak still , losing takes its toll a few years ago , player availability was so low that during one away game , the coach had to ask a student who had traveled to the game as a spectator to don a uniform so he would have a substitute but this year s crop of players , webb officials say , are among the most highly motivated they have seen in years , resurrecting hope that the string of disconcertingly perfect seasons might soon come to an end we 've cut 30 points off the average margin of defeat , coach harris said and we 've had a number of games where we 've been in it for twothirds of the game one of the team s top talents is john mixon , a sophomore from portland , ore , a mainstay of webb s soccer team , which had a winning season like many of his basketball teammates , he cannot stand the idea that people might be snickering i go out every game to win , he said , sitting in a common room in webb s main building when he gets wind of a cynical comment , he finds it hard to hold his tongue i 'll say , 'last night i scored 18 points what were you doing \? ' he said this week , after the school s traditional hiatus in january and february , when webb students go off for internships around the world and the basketball team must interrupt its 13game schedule , the squad was back in action for two final games on tuesday , the clippers faced the state university at purchase in a tournament for the hudson valley men s athletic conference , of which webb is a new member it is not a member of the national collegiate athletic association , or any other national athletic organization on friday , they play their season finale at cooper union in manhattan the webb clippers travel light for the purchase game in pratt s athletic center in brooklyn during the conference tournament , the only refreshment they brought was a large box of oranges and the only webb fans were two sophomores videotaping the game and a freshman who serves as scorekeeper let s watch the turnovers , mr harris lectured his men in their blue and gold uniforms their necks and thighs looked about half the size of those of the players from purchase , a school of 2 , 400 students that had beaten webb twice this season , by margins of 35 and 36 points from the opening jump ball , it was clear that two months off the court had not done anything for the clippers' skills they did not score for the first five minutes , and managed 9 points the whole half it s a nightmare , muttered mr mixon as he hustled onto the court for the second half he added that his feet were blistering inside his sneakers to no one s surprise , purchase won handily some webb players winced at the final score , 8024 \( gene miller had 14 points \) pete caruso , the purchase coach , said i have a lot of admiration for them what are there , 75 people in the school \? and they go out and have fun and compete \? i really admire it mr harris and scott bodamer , webb s athletic director , ventured into the locker room and told their players as much good effort , mr harris said after the game , the players and coaches got into vans for the ride back to long island one more game to go this season it could be the one to break the streak and if not that one , well , maybe the first game next fall and if not that one these guys really want to win , mr bodamer said we know that it s going to happen photo the basketball team at the webb institute of naval architecture has lost 71 games in a row , including one this week to the state university at purchase , 80 to 24 after the game , the webb coach , richard harris , had praise for the players to assuage the dispiriting if accustomed defeat \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
conventional wisdom in queens when i was growing up in the 50 s was that bullies would always back down if you stood up to them this was simply not true most bullies had their own pride and constituencies to satisfy and they would n't have picked on you in the first place if they were n't sure they could beat you up but it was a necessary lie that parents and older siblings had to tell if we were ever to lose our fears the important lesson was not about beating the bully , but about finding out that the beating he gave you was bearable , that he could n't kill you simply by standing up to him and surviving , you won a small victory that would give you the courage to keep challenging , to keep standing up , until he left you alone i 've been having these thoughts since revisiting my old junior high school , stephen a halsey , in rego park oh , there were bullies on the earth in those days ! roger and willie and crazy jay , who hung from the chainlink fence with one hand , throwing punches and snarling but none fought with anything but fists and feet i never saw weapons at jhs 157 , and there is still no metal detector at the door i can only imagine what it means to stand up to a bully at some other schools in a city where a bully might shoot you no wonder a boxcutter is the least of standard protections these days the chance to learn to fight back without dying is yet another loss in this time of the betrayal of children the schoolyard bully is never hard to spot he s not necessarily bigger than the other kids , but he s always more physical , rolling his shoulders , moving his hands , getting up just a little too close you talkin' to me , he says , before you have cleared your throat that usually shuts you up and it never ends think of mario cuomo or george steinbrenner or mayor giuliani in the larger schoolyard at halsey , i belonged to a group targeted by bullies the members of the special progress class had been selected primarily by their aboveaverage iq scores \( 120 was supposedly the cutoff \) , a fact we flaunted like a varsity letter not only were we smarter , but we were too cool for this school we would leave for high school after completing the threeyear curriculum in two we were easy to resent we attended classes as a group and were individually identified by heavy brown leather briefcases filled with books the other kids made a sport of trying to kick them out of the hands of sp boys they called our briefcases fag bags that was the killer word in my neighborhood fag , in those days , had far less of a specifically homosexual connotation than one of sissy , or worse , girl in the 50 s , as we believed then , women had no real futures they might become teachers or even writers , but they would never get to fly planes , build bridges , kill bad guys real man s work and this was n't just schoolyard talk one of the books in my bag , the new you and heredity , had a chart that measured a man s masculinity by his line of work the top of the chart drummed with test pilots , engineers , explorers on the bottom , clearly my future neighborhood , were clergymen , teachers and writers bookish boys believe what they read , and that chart burned into my brain like a diagram left too long on a computer screen it was superimposed on everything that life scrolled up i was a particular target of the bullies because i was a compulsive smart aleck who was also too fat to run away \( my iq was considerably less than my weight \) while the school tended to isolate us from the general student population , it did n't protect us the principal , dr nussey , who taught latin to the sp class and ran the schoolwide softball tournament , apparently believed in survival of the fittest he would allow a little roughhouse so long as his authority was n't challenged boys will be boys our sp homeroom teacher , mrs mcdermott , made an effort to stop fights before we were hurt , but she could n't be everywhere the school enforcers , the burly gym and shop teachers , would wait until the fight was nearly over , then peel the bullies off their victims and boot them down the street in a humorous , bullying way that did nothing to condemn the ritual in fact , probably reinforced it the bullies loved the attention , the contact with bully teachers we victims dusted ourselves off and slunk home i hated getting beaten up i hated having friends feel sorry for me , hated feeling my scabs harden while i listened to the conventional wisdom but it seemed preferable to shutting up or to making peace with the bullies one of my sp classmates was famous for cozying up to the bullies we called them the hoods even holding their jackets while they beat us up he went on to become a famous television mogul at 12 and 13 in my halsey days , i took as my major role model \( i have yet to find a better one \) the lone ranger he protected people from bullies without ever being a bully himself the westerns we saw at the trylon , the drake , the midway also tended to send the message of standing up to bullies or forever living in cowardice and shame there was much more movie fistfighting in those days , and usually only one major gunfight , the last resort , at the end

reading his newspaper and sipping his orange juice on the 6 42 train from chappaqua , earl g graves jr looked and felt like the briefcasetoting businessman he is but when the train arrived at grand central terminal at 7 35 and he stepped onto the platform , he was transformed in the eyes of two metronorth police officers , he became , at least for the moment , a suspect the two grabbed his elbows , showed their badges and escorted him to a nearby wall they lifted my arms in the air , relieved me of my briefcase and frisked me from top to bottom , said mr graves , senior vice president for advertising and marketing at black enterprise magazine metronorth has begun an inquiry and even plans to run newspaper advertisements apologizing to mr graves but this much seemed clear yesterday officers on the lookout for a man with a gun stopped and searched mr graves because he is a black man and he said that while the encounter , on may 1 , was his most galling ever with the police , it was not the first as mr graves tells it , the officers , who were soon joined by two others , asked him whether he was carrying a weapon and whether he was on the job , police talk for , are you a cop , too \? mr graves answered no to both questions and continued to stand there with my arms in the air like a common criminal as other commuters , many from the same train , streamed by he asked the officers what kind of man they were looking for and was told a black man with short hair well , that narrows it down to about six million people , mr graves replied , his anger beginning to overcome his embarrassment the officers , he recalled yesterday , were not amused but they let him go on his way mr graves did not know it yet , but his embarrassment stemmed in part from the railroad s attempts to find a man who had been described in an anonymous letter to metronorth as black , athleticlooking , welldressed and carrying a gun the gun carrier was said to be a regular on a train that went through white plains , and he was said to be carrying a briefcase much of the time none of that was in mr graves s thoughts as he shook off the humiliation that morning and went to the office when he got to the magazine s offices at 150 fifth avenue , he discussed the incident with his father , who is chairman and chief executive of black enterprise and a nationally known entrepreneur , and with his mother , barbara graves , the vice president and general manager they have the kind of connections not available to many people , mr graves acknowledged yesterday , and it was not long before he was hearing from donald n nelson , the metronorth president , and chief dean m esserman of the metronorth police the two officials met with mr graves and other representatives of black enterprise last thursday to discuss the incident , and to apologize mr graves said yesterday that he was pleased with their response if the officers had had the same level of respect and sophistication , there would be fewer problems for africanamericans , he said he added that he was pleased that metronorth said it would run advertisements in the new york times and several westchester newspapers explaining the incident and apologizing for it in addition , mr nelson sent a letter to mr graves in which he expressed his personal apologies for what happened it is essential that our officers conduct police business with full knowledge and sensitivity to the diverse population we serve , he said mr nelson said the officers , while in the wrong , had acted on information that raised a legitimate and serious concern for the safety of metronorth customers that information , the agency said yesterday , was the anonymous letter , received on april 24 the letter described the guncarrying black man as about 5 feet 10 inches tall , wearing a mustache and with a trim or athletic build mr graves , 33 , certainly has that kind of build he was a star on the yale basketball team and lasted a few seasons in the national basketball association but he is 6 feet 4 and weighs about 225 pounds and he does not have a mustache metronorth said yesterday that it was still looking for the gunman , if there was one , but it acknowledged in a written statement that mr graves could not be the man the agency said it is considering disciplinary action against the officers who initiated the stop of mr graves , both of whom are white officers mr nelson and chief esserman said they would review procedures used by metronorth officers to insure that all of its riders are treated with respect and sensitivity mr graves said he had briefly considered legal action but he said the officials' attitude , the promise of a review and the planned acknowledgment of wrongdoing in the newspaper advertisements pleased him more than any monetary settlement could have as for the two officers , he said i would probably have preferred to see them face to face i want them to be able to look me in the eye they 've got to look beyond black mr graves said he has had contact with police agencies a dozen or so times he recalls being pulled over and questioned when he was growing up in scarsdale \( he does not count the time he got a speeding ticket \) and he remembers being questioned one night while walking on a bridge across the charles river when he was at harvard business school mr graves said he knows in his heart he would have had less contact with the police if he had been born white as were many of his friends i'm as comfortable with white people as i am with black people , he said yesterday photo earl g graves jr , a senior vice president for black enterprise magazine , was frisked in public by metronorth police officers looking for a gunman \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
one of 11 defendants in a terrorism trial pleaded guilty yesterday to a bombingconspiracy charge in a deal with prosecutors under the deal , the defendant , matarawy mohammed said saleh , would most likely not be sentenced to much more time beyond the two years he has served since his arrest mr saleh was one of the lesser defendants in the sevenmonthlong trial in federal district court in manhattan , where the prosecution charged that he had joined a conspiracy in its last moments only hours before it was smashed when federal agents began arresting the defendants in june 1993 the prosecutors had accused mr saleh only of having agreed to provide cars that were to be used to carry bombs to blow up major buildings and transportation links like the united nations headquarters , the lincoln and holland tunnels and a federal building in lower manhattan in his guilty plea before judge michael b mukasey , on a day when the trial was not in session , mr saleh , a 39yearold immigrant from egypt , admitted that he had agreed to supply stolen cars to the alleged plotters and knew the vehicles were to be used to transport explosives the charge he pleaded to is punishable by up to five years in prison and 250 , 000 in fines , but one of his lawyers , thomas h nooter , noted that under federal sentencing guidelines the actual prison sentence could be a little more than two years , and by the time mr saleh is sentenced on nov 1 , he will have served 27 months as part of the plea deal , the prosecution agreed to drop an attemptedbombing charge against him that is punishable on conviction by up to 10 years in prison earlier in the trial , judge mukasey had dismissed the most serious charge brought against mr saleh , seditious conspiracy , which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison this charge , of having engaged in a war of urban terrorism against the united states , is at the heart of the case all the remaining defendants face the charge the most prominent is sheik omar abdel rahman , the militant muslim cleric from egypt the prosecution says all the defendants were motivated by their opposition to united states policies in the middle east matarawy mohammed said saleh , also known as wahid saleh , is not related to another defendant in the case , mohammed saleh , who remains on trial marvin smilon , a spokesman for the united states attorney s office in manhattan , which is prosecuting the case , declined to comment on the plea deal but mr nooter said that as part of the process for determining sentencing guidelines for his client , the prosecutor s office had agreed that he was a minimal participant in the purported conspiracy other lawyers said that no other plea negotiations were going on in the case , which is believed to be within a month of jury deliberations aside from aborted plots to bomb the united nations and the commuter tunnels , the prosecution is focusing on the 1993 bombing of the world trade center , charging that it was part of the overall conspiracy nevertheless , none of the men now on trial are accused of having helped carry out that attack , for which four other men were convicted in a previous trial

the kitchen can be a dangerous place especially when food preparations for weddings , corporate dinners and museum benefits are simultaneously under way and such activity is the norm during the halcyon spring days at abigail kirsch at tappan hill in tarrytown , said james a kirsch , president of abigail kirsch culinary productions spring is always chaotic , he said besides weddings , social functions and business meetings we host at tappan hill , our kitchens in tarrytown are used to prepare most of the food served at our offsite events , which are held in all sorts of interesting locations , including tents , museums , piers and parks with such diverse activities and a demanding schedule , mr kirsch said prompt communication between staff members is absolutely essential at tappan hill we have a large hispanic work force , and we have a language barrier in our kitchens lack of communication has caused problems in a kitchen , where stoves and knives and machines are always in use , if employees do n't understand each other , it s very difficult so , last fall , mr kirsch and his tappan hill partner , the executive chef alison awerbuch , in discussing the problem decided to look for help what we were doing was playing charades and show and tell in the kitchen , ms awerbuch said not only was it dangerous , it was inefficient something had to be done here we were with a hardworking hispanic staff who was doing a terrific job but because they could n't communicate they also were n't able to advance on the job ms awerbuch said she was aware that several prep cooks one who prepares vegetables and the people on the ware washing staff utensils , pots and pans were not only being denied upward mobility , but we were failing to utilize their talents to the fullest in their native country , she continued , many of our hispanic employees had the benefit of higher education , but here in america they were n't getting anywhere enter arlen gargagliano ms gargagliano , an assistant professor of english as a second language at concordia college in bronxville , had just formed a languageinstruction company called onsite language in mount vernon with another concordia professor , patricia capobianco onsite designs language programs to be given at work sites we got the idea after talking to people in industry who said they were having problems with employees who could n't communicate because of language barriers , ms gargagliano said it showed us there was a need for language classes tailored to specific industries the partners were then put in touch with score , a volunteer group of retired executives who counsel wouldbe entrepreneurs we met with murray maizen , and he was terrific in showing us how to take the first and second steps to starting a business , ms gargagliano said then we did some market research on our own we made cold calls to 10 hotels and country clubs in the county to see what sort of demand there would be for our services eight out of the 10 were enthusiastic , and that was the push we needed michelle orpaz , an administrative assistant at abigail kirsch and an acquaintance of ms gargagliano , then arranged for ms gargagliano to meet with chefs at tappan hill alison awerbuch and the other chefs told me exactly what they needed , and we went back and custom designed an eightweek course tailored to their specific needs the class material , ms gargagliano said , stresses vocabulary that is most used during the workday in tappan hill kitchens phrases like the pen of my aunt is on the table are never heard using props from the kitchen and photographs taken of everything from whisks to watermelons , ms gargagliano said she designed a curriculum that focuses as much on learning about different cultures as on the language of the workplace we never understood the extent of the cultural differences here , ms awerbuch said for example , whenever i would ask one of our hispanic workers if they understood an instruction i was giving them , they always promptly said , yes , yes , even though they did n't understand it at all why \? because in their country it is considered not polite and very bad form to say no now they know it s ok to say no if you do n't understand , with the result that the work goes faster and much more efficiently the class is divided into two separate fourhour weekly sessions , which meet in a vacant room at tappan hill english is taught two mornings a week before employees begin their shift , and spanish is taught two evenings a week after the day shifts are ended , ms gargagliano said we start with the basics i will hold up an apple and say , apple ideally , when english is taught as a second language , the teacher does n't have to know the other language i do know spanish because i studied in spain and taught english in peru for a year , but at concordia , i may have students in one class who speak eight different languages , none of which i know patricia guardino , a chef who attended a spanish class , said it was more valuable than any other spanish course she had studied people in the hospitality industry are always told to take a course in spanish so that they can communicate with hispanic employees , she said but the courses i took were n't really very useful because they were too general we do n't have to know how to say such things as 'where is the train station \? ' but we do have to know how to give directions quickly and verbal commands like , 'watch the oven , ' 'be careful , this is hot' you 're under a lot of pressure in a busy kitchen everything has to be done fast we prepare , for example , 50 to 100 different appetizers alone for one wedding calling the language classes a great idea , ms guardino said she had already seen a great improvement in job performance among hispanic employees who attended the english course i recently assigned a group of women in the course to prepare empanadas , those spanish appetizers that have a lambandonion filling and are baked in puff pastry for the first time i only had to explain things once , and the work went more smoothly , quicker than ever before jose raul rivera is a banquet cook mr rivera , who is from el salvador , said the class has helped him speak english more fluently everything was explained very clearly , he said i know i need to understand english to be able to get different jobs i think the studying has helped me to prepare for a better job onsite language programs cost 65 an hour for each student , regardless of class size there is a twohour minimum for an eightweek program photo arlen gargagliano , a teacher of english as a second language , conducts a course for chefs at abigail kirsch at tappan hill \( claire yaffa for the new york times \)
los angeles , july 16 hideo nomo , rookie pitcher and sudden icon , sat before his locker thumbing through a japanese paperback , headphones plugging his ears , and succeeded , once again , in sealing himself from the mounting frenzy around him upstairs in dodger stadium , young men and small children in nomo tshirts and nomo caps hurried past pockets of middleaged japanese tourists who hovered close to their tour guide , getting directions to their seats in this desultory baseball season , the personality of the moment is nomo , who is the first japanese pitcher in 30 years to pitch in the major leagues and who , in a scant two months , has forever destroyed the image of the male asian athlete as a slight and polite young man who can win by smarts but never by strength the dodgers may love nomo for packing the house , and japanese may adore him for showing what a local boy can do against the big leaguers but for japaneseamericans like brian niiya , nomo is the best thing to come along since bruce lee martial arts movies even if nomo remains aloof part of it , for asianamerican men , not just japaneseamericans , is that there s a definite stereotype of not being athletic , said niiya , a thirdgeneration japaneseamerican and a columnist for rafu shimpu , a japaneseenglish daily in los angeles a guy like nomo , he s the first guy since bruce lee to present a different kind of image , a very masculine , macho image nomo is succeeding in ways that transcend his leading the national league in strikeouts and earning the coveted start in last week s allstar game his presence on the mound every fifth day has lured busloads of japanese tourists to dodger stadium and given rise to a cottage industry of nomo tours , which offer fourday trips to los angeles , dodger tickets included on friday night , one fan bought 3 , 800 worth of nomo memorabilia his games are carried live in japan , where crowds gathered in front of giant outdoor television screens to witness his allstar start here , men in groups of four each paint a letter of his name on their chests young women race down the aisle as he ambles to the dugout after a third out , in the hope that he might glance up for a snapshot the new and growing crowds of japanese and japaneseamericans applaud each strike he throws and gave him a standing ovation saturday night when he singled for his first major league hit but the object of this adoration , niiya and others have begun to discover , is either uninterested or simply unmoved by all the fuss nomo is a tall and broadshouldered 26yearold man with a remote affect and a particular aversion to the press , especially the 80 or so reporters who have followed him from japan nomo refuses to grant them interviews , still feeling burned , the reporters say , by the experience of his rookie season in japan when , as is traditional in covering celebrities , a pack of journalists camped out in front of his house and left virtually no aspect of his life , or new marriage , unchronicled here the reporters have been instructed to monitor his movements in the ball park but to leave him alone at home , where his wife and young son have just joined him photographers arrive hours before game time between his starts , if only to capture him taking batting practice and bantering , through his interpreter nomo speaks virtually no english with dodgers manager tom lasorda nomo , meanwhile , has revealed little , if anything of himself he has expressed scarcely more than a desire to help the team and do his best he is also not averse to making a reporter hover near his side for hours before answering a single question his distance is not merely a matter of stereotypical japanese reserve nomo is of a generation of japanese to grew up in comfort , and unlike their parents and grandparents , to display a certain confidence in encountering the world outside of japan he is of a generation of ballplayers that , in the late 1980 s , began showing such small acts of independence as arriving at the ball park in red sports cars , which fairly screamed rebellion in parking lots filled with their elders' requisite white sedans i think this is the start of a young generation of japanese who are not afraid of anything , said ichiro takeda , 39 , a japanese businessman who has lived in los angeles for 15 years they do n't have an inferiority complex what this nomo was doing was breaking all the beliefs of the past japanese mentality had to accept somebody out of the norm , a nonjapanese kind of japanese for his part , nomo feels none of the burden of other peoples' expectations i do n't think i'm a hero , he said in japanese , with a look of profound indifference whatever they think is ok but i do n't feel that pressure nomo s decision to leave first his team and then japan was greeted with the chilly response reserved in japan for those foolish enough to reach beyond their station his decision was , in a japanese context , an act both of unusual bravery and unspeakable gall , a social offense punishable by quick banishment to the frosty periphery of japanese life that was , assuming , as many did , that he would fail , and embarrass not only himself but the nation
berlin , oct 18 underscoring the difficulties prosecutors face in winning convictions of former east german leaders , the country s top appeals court today threw out a guilty verdict against the east german spymaster markus wolf , and ordered a new trial mr wolf , who headed east germany s foreign intelligence service for more than 30 years , was convicted of treason in 1993 and sentenced to six years in jail the federal criminal court ruled today that he could not be jailed for directing operations that were permissible under east german law mr wolf s case is one of several that are going poorly for prosecutors , leading many germans to conclude that their legal system is incapable of redressing injustices committed in east germany even many of the prosecutors who try these cases acknowledge that there is little hope that courts can provide much justice to victims of repression in east germany the law is simply not written for crimes like these , said uta folster , a spokeswoman for berlin prosecutors laws are designed to punish individuals , not regimes or governments but especially in light of the fact that so little was done in this country to prosecute criminals from the nazi period , we feel obligated to make at least an effort but some people question whether the cases were a good idea these trials reek of politics , of the desire of a winner to punish a loser , said uwe wesel , a law professor at free university here what the defendants did may have been repugnant , but almost all of it was legal under east german law perhaps the bestknown east german figure now on trial is alexander schalckgolodkowski , who was the communist government s bestconnected financier and currency trader the case against mr schalckgolodkowski , who used his wide network of western contacts to convert east german assets into hard currency , charges him with the relatively petty crime of importing 246 nightvision lenses and 169 hunting rifles and flintlock pistols into east germany many experts argue that the 1949 law under which he is being prosecuted , which was decreed by the allied powers then occupying berlin , no longer has legal force as is generally known , i was for years in close contact with senior west german politicians , including many who are still in office , mr schalckgolodkowski said dryly as he entered the courtroom at the opening of his trial last month none of them ever mentioned to me that they thought the arrangements we made were illegal the berliner zeitung asserted in an editorial , behind this currency juggler s considerable bulk are hidden arms producers like heckler koch , which supplied weapons to the security police and the east german army the managers of siemens , which supplied equipment for building rocketlaunchers and spying on dissidents and the politicians who received generous contributions for their cooperation with the trade in human beings that flourished between east and west germany more than 300 cases have been brought against east german officials and soldiers , but the large majority of defendants have either been found not guilty or have received suspended sentences erich honecker , the longtime east german leader , was declared too ill to stand trial , and died last year in chile his secret police chief , erich mielke , was convicted of a murder committed in 1931 , before east germany even came into existence , and was released in august after serving five years in jail former defense minister fritz kessler and two of his aides were convicted of allowing wouldbe refugees to be shot as they sought to flee westward , but they are free pending what promise to be long appeals hans modrow , the last communist leader of east germany , was convicted of falsifying election results , but given only a suspended sentence the trial of wolfgang vogel , a shadowy spytrader who helped thousands of east germans to leave the country after pressing them to sell their homes and belongings at far below their true value , has dragged on for 10 months without any of the spectacular revelations that prosecutors promised when it opened he is charged with extortion despite the legal and political problems , berlin prosecutors recently announced plans to try seven members of the former east german politburo on charges of falsifying elections , repressing free speech and ordering border guards to shoot at fleeing refugees the most prominent defendant , egon krenz , who succeeded erich honecker as east germany s top leader , has asserted in an open letter to prosecutors that courts are not empowered to punish people for carrying out acts that were part of the cold war he added a government that once worked so closely with east germany now presumes to judge and condemn that country it has no legal , moral or political right to do so photo germany s top appeals court yesterday overturned a treasonconviction for the east german spymaster markus wolf , pictured second from right with the poet gunther manga as he promoted his russian cookbook last month the court ruled that mr wolf acted legally under east german law \( hansjurgen horn for the new

paris , june 6 when the match was over , he simply left his racquets behind and , expressionless and emptyhanded , trudged away from the center court of roland garros like a sleepwalker i'm a neurotic athlete whose worst nightmare is to become injured you need your body , said andre agassi , who was betrayed by his body on what for him was the gloomiest of quarterfinal days at the french open with his body and his psyche at halfstaff , agassi , the no 1 player in the world , saw his worldbeating 1995 grand slam streak come to a crashing halt today in the quarterfinal round of the only grand slam tournament he has not yet conquered stung in the right hip by a painful strain to the flexor muscle that settled in after he stretched and slid for a ball early in the first set against the 21yearold yevgeny kafelnikov , agassi fell to russia s top prospect , 64 , 63 , 75 when andre came to the court , i felt i had no chance , basically , said kafelnikov you must realize how hungry he is to win this tournament he wanted to win the whole grand slam i thought i 'd just give up the french open , give up the wimbledon , and just prepare for the us open , but then my coach told me , stay cool and your time will come , ' and here is my time , the ninthseeded kafelnikov said upon reaching his first grand slam semifinal there , he will face the reigning maestro atop red clay , thomas muster , who needs just one more victory to tie bjorn borg s 34match unbeaten streak that stands as the open era s thirdlongest winning streak on clay today , the fifthseeded muster secured his 33d consecutive victory on clay the hard way , with a 62 , 36 , 67 \( 68 \) , 75 , 62 marathon against 61stranked alberto costa of spain the match required 3 hours 17 minutes of muster s signature grunts , groans and gasps and put the austrian into his third french open semifinal the elimination of agassi guaranteed that for the second straight year , none of the top four seeded men would advance to the semifinals that pattern was not followed on the women s side , where the defending champion and topseeded player , arantxa sanchez vicario , secondseeded steffi graf and fourthseeded conchita martinez all remained in contention for thursday s semifinal round ninthseeded kimiko date , who became the first japanese semifinalist in 20 years at roland garros , was the only outsider in the group kafelnikov s unanticipated victory over agassi curtailed an enviable 18match grand slam undefeated streak by the las vegan that commenced with his 1994 united states open title run and picked up the pace this year with his victory at the australian open here at the french open , the 25yearold agassi had been an unhappy runnerup in 1990 and 1991 , but he felt poised to reverse his fortune this year and possibly put himself halfway to a 1995 grand slam it crossed my mind when i won australia , agassi said of his designs on the paris title i was definitely feeling confident and i felt like all the pieces were slowly falling into place with his big brown eyes brimming and his downy head bowed , agassi said he could n't remember being this dejected since he submitted to jim courier here in the 1991 final the final in '91 was disappointing for me , said agassi , who thought he turned tentative in that match but it s a different disappointment , to come close and not win , and to get injured i certainly had a tough match today regardless of how i'm feeling , said agassi , who was beaten by kafelnikov in their only other meeting on clay but when your chances to win a tournament like this are taken away because you ca n't be at your best , it s extremely disappointing although the shooting pain in his right hip was inhibiting his movement and service motion , agassi said he played through the first set , changing his strategy in order to finish points more quickly i slid out and felt my hip strain , and i pulled up on it and kind of kept waiting for it to ease up , said agassi i did n't call for the trainer until i was convinced it was getting worse after the third game of the second set , the trainer bill norris talked with agassi on the changeover , and the pair left the court on a threeminute injury timeout norris gave the player aspirin and antiinflammatories and , upon further examination , some bad news when i tried to stretch it , that s the exact position that made it hurt so much , and when bill knew that , it was kind of written on his face to just do the best i could , agassi said although he decided to try to complete the match , agassi admitted that he gave up any thought of winning it , and he said he would probably have defaulted if this had not happened at a grand slam tournament anywhere else , i certainly would n't have risked myself to further injury , he said that s always the first thing that goes through your mind , except when you 're in a grand slam first thing through your mind is to lay it all out there and hope for the best when agassi sealed a 41 thirdset lead with an ace , there was a glimmer of hope in the stadium , where the spectators started chanting , allez , andre but agassi lost his edge and most of his willpower when he dropped his serve in the seventh game , then used up most of his energy reversing a 040 deficit in the ninth game three poorly selected forehands cost him his serve in the 11th game , and although he saved one match point with a backhand winner as kafelnikov served for the match , he surrendered with an overhit forehand on the russian s second match point while agassi prepared to fly home and begin a 10day healing process to prepare for wimbledon , kafelnikov prepared to take on muster thomas it s amazing he s won 33 matches in a row , said kafelnikov , who is 11 against muster on clay , so he must be tired we 'll see i still have nothing to lose today i was running so fast around the court that i never had that feeling before , and if i'm going to play the same way i played today , he might fall down match points in a lopsided quartet of women s quarterfinals played on court a , arantxa sanchez vicario defeated the only remaining american , chanda rubin , 63 , 61 graf trounced gabriela sabatini , 61 , 60 conchita martinez ousted 88thranked virginia ruano pascale , 60 , 64 , and komiko date downed iva majoli , 75 , 61 photo yevgeny kafelnikov celebrating his

new york may be a funny place , but it s not that easy to set the town laughing the producers of the toyota comedy festival have been working at it for two years on friday they will mount their third annual offensive , hoping to make the kind of impact that will turn a young , struggling festival into a fixture over 10 days , the festival will present about 80 acts at clubs , theaters , parks and even bookstores all over manhattan by design , it s a mixed bag audiences can hear younger , littleknown comics free in bryant park or known commodities like steven wright , who has not done a oneman show in new york in nine years , at the beacon theater the festival also includes a command performance in honor of carol burnett at carnegie hall and a friars club salute to henny youngman , as well as an evening of young hispanic comics at the nuyorican poets cafe the festival s three producers , george wein , alan king and john schreiber , are seeking a blend of headliners and upandcomers , concept shows like the one devoted to the political standup of lenny bruce , and intimate or offbeat offerings that will put a festival that has passed mostly unnoticed for the last two years on the map it has n't yet had the acceptance i hoped for , said mr wein \( pronounced ween \) , who , as a founder of the newport jazz and folk festivals , ranks as the grand old man of popular music festivals in the united states the whole concept is to create an event that lasts , but comedy is different the public is not as attuned to what s happening the origins of the toyota festival go back to 1964 , when mr king , the comedian , and mr wein crossed paths at the newport jazz festival mr king was producing a series of barbra streisand concerts mr wein had a stage and 20 , 000 empty chairs available the two struck a deal , and somewhere along the way , mr wein remarked that new york should have a comedy festival i shrugged it off , said mr king four years ago mr king was invited to perform at the just for laughs comedy festival in montreal , comedy s equivalent of the cannes film festival now in its 13th year , just for laughs , which began as a small frenchlanguage event , has grown into an important talentscouting and dealmaking festival for television and film producers , network and cable executives and talent agents i woke up one morning and thought , since when did montreal become the comedy center of the universe \? mr king said new york has been the incubator , the training ground , for every comedy star in america he and mr wein cast their lot together , attracted sponsorship money from the toyota dealers in new york , new jersey and connecticut and put together the first festival in 1993 at the time mr schreiber was a partner in mr wein s company , festival productions he has since started his own company , the john schreiber group the three men chose a tough town and a tough time to create a comedy festival the comedy explosion of the early 1980 s , when clubs like catch a rising star , the improv and caroline s seemed to be turning out brilliant comedians every week , has since imploded many of the top names have fled the field and gone on to make careers in television and film cable television , quick to pick up on a hot trend and desperate for cheaply produced entertainment , overfished the talent pool that remained in so doing , they helped put all but a few of the comedy clubs out of business potential customers began wondering why they should spend time and money at a club when comedy was offered free on latenight television especially if the comics were as mediocre as many of the ones on cable even if the talent pool were richer , new york s entertainment calendar sets very high hurdles for anyone attempting to organize a festival on any given day in new york , you 've got the makings of a better festival than most festivals , said andy nulman , the director of just for laughs ours works because it s a real focal point in montreal , and it s bigger than anything else that happens mr schreiber said that a comedy festival in new york makes sense , and the current malaise of standup actually offers an opportunity comedy is all around us , but it is an art form that has gone unexamined in this country in a festival format , he said a lot of people , mostly younger , believe comedy is standup and nothing else this is an opportunity to say , let s look beyond that and ask , what else does this universe consist of \? in an effort to cover more territory , and to take a few more risks than they did in the first two editions of the festival , the organizers put together a reunion of the national lampoon radio hour and an evening devoted to the political humor of lenny bruce that will include a showing of a 1964 appearance on the steve allen show that was never broadcast the festival includes a series devoted to literary humor , with readings by george plimpton and christopher cerf , as well as short underground films and an evening of hispanic humor still , the lampoon reunion suggests that the festival has a way to go before it can draw top talent the show , which was syndicated to 600 radio stations in the early 1970 s , was a breeding ground for the likes of john belushi , chevy chase , richard belzer , gilda radner , bill murray and michael o 'donoghue ms radner , mr o 'donoghue and mr belushi are dead , and none of the other performers will be on hand to recreate sketches from the original broadcasts , either getting the giants to come , unfortunately , is n't easy , said mr wein mr wein said he takes the long view the festival has run a deficit its first two years and will do so again this year it receives a subsidy from toyota in the sixfigure level , he said right now , this is only the sketch of a great festival , he said but if we can keep it alive , eventually we 'll make money with time , who knows \? the big names might follow we hope people like billy crystal and robin williams will want to be involved , he said he drew a comparison with the new orleans jazz and heritage festival , which he started in 1969 the first year we had more people selling food than we did customers , mr wein said over the years , the festival has developed into a raging success , putting to rest doubts about the wisdom of presenting jazz and blues to a city that had plenty of both year round the producers of the toyota comedy festival have learned a few things along the way there are more performances in small clubs and theaters , fewer multiartist shows those did not work , said mr schreiber what we 've done , in larger venues , is build around individual headliners or strong concepts i think we 're better now at fitting events to venues mr king said he only gradually came to the conclusion that small events were important to creating a festival atmosphere also , i had to learn how to price myself , and to give away a lot , he said about half the festival s events are free or have lowpriced tickets anyone who goes free , that s another body , mr king said , and maybe the next year he 'll be able to pay photo john schreiber , left , and george wein of the toyota comedy festival \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

a group of politicians , business operators and development officials gathered in harlem yesterday to condemn the violence that killed seven employees in freddy s clothing store last friday they also sought to portray the community as a place where businesses can operate safely no matter the race or ethnicity of their operators just hours later , a collection of ministers from harlem and beyond met 10 blocks away and while they , too , condemned the violence , their aim was clearly to rally support for the rev al sharpton , who participated in protests against the store before it was set afire there have been so many misrepresentations , particularly by the mayor and his police commissioner , said the rev wyatt walker , the pastor of the canaan baptist church , a large harlem congregation where the meeting and news conference were held we think it is not alone an assault on rev al sharpton it is an assault on all black people the two meetings illuminated the two sharply different public responses to the events of last week on one hand , the elected officials and business representatives stressed the need for the community to support all the businesses in harlem , be they white or blackowned the ministers , on the other hand , sought to defend mr sharpton , saying that government officials specifically mayor rudolph w giuliani were trying to establish a link between the minister and reports of racial and antisemitic slurs by the pickets , who have been accused of stirring up racial tensions before the burning of the store , whose owner is jewish mr walker was joined by about 20 clergy members , including ministers from harlem s shiloh baptist church , mt nebo baptist church minister conrad muhammad of the nation of islam s mosque in harlem and the rev herbert daughtry of the house of the lord pentecostal church in brooklyn the ministers' meeting came the same day mr giuliani blamed the violence and racial slurs at the clothing store on people from outside the harlem community the mayor , in a news conference , mentioned mr sharpton by name , saying that he does not live in harlem mr sharpton s office is on 125th street , and he has homes in brooklyn and in new jersey at the earlier news conference , representative charles b rangel was surrounded by more than two dozen people , including korean merchants who operate on 125th street , representatives of the american jewish congress , the uptown chamber of commerce , black , white and hispanic elected officials as well as arthur rosen , owner of the bargain world clothing store , which was singled out by pickets before and after the deadly inferno at freddy s on friday none of us will tolerate the threats and the violence , mr rangel said , and the attacks that say that to make room for minorities , you have to be killed , you have to be threatened and you have to be sent out of town mr rangel said the group of officials had decided before the news conference to urge shoppers to bring their business to 125th street this saturday we 're going to bargain world , mr rangel said we 're going to make certain that we all go to 125th street we 're doing this for ourselves to say let us heal and learn from this tragedy before yesterday s news conference , many of the elected officials had been the subject of criticism from some quarters particularly from mr sharpton and morris powell , the head of the 125th street vendors association they charged that the officials ignored the requests of the owner of the record store next to freddy s to help mediate his pending eviction a dispute that was the genesis of the protests , which were attended by the man who the police say later started the fire in which he and the clothing store s employees died those criticisms seemed to have dissipated , however in fact , mr rangel attended the meeting of the ministers , although he said he had not been invited i know that rev sharpton is a controversial figure , mr rangel said i know that the mayor would like from time to time to see people he dislikes in a manner that s controversial but let us not condemn in their news conference , the elected officials said yesterday that they had been largely unaware of any threats of violence against the store or any racist slurs being hurled at freddy s they said they had simply seen the matter as a dispute between a landlord and a tenant photo the rev herbert daughtry , the pastor of the canaan baptistchurch , spoke to reporters as the rev al sharpton , left , and other clergy members awaited their turns to speak at a meeting in harlem yesterday \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
vryheid , south africa first , the police went to the local school and took the children from their classrooms then they stood by as a crew tossed the khulu family s meager belongings into a truck and drove off with them after that the white landowner , andrias scheep ers , hitched his tractor to a chain strung around the family s mud and cowdung huts and pulled them down by the time the eviction was over , the police had used tear gas on other black tenant farmers who came to see what was going on and someone had lit a fire that burned the fields for as far as the eye could see , forcing people to run in all directions hours later , in the chill of sunset , the khulu family , without enough clothes or blankets , was huddled in the charred grass near the side of the road the rolling hills and tidy fields of this area 200 miles southeast of johannesburg , where cattle graze and corn is grown , hardly suggest the anger and violence that is to be found these days as south africa struggles to redistribute land that for decades could be owned only by whites legislation has been drafted that would give many black tenant farmers the right to buy the fields they have farmed for generations in immobilizing poverty but parliament has yet to vote on the bill so as politicians talk and interest groups negotiate , many white farmers have taken defensive maneuvers , officials say they have evicted thousands of tenant farmers , hoping to be rid of them before any new law takes effect they think that they will be able to preempt the law , says geoff budlender , who as special adviser to the minister of land affairs helped draft the legislation it s vicious , but it s not irrational even if the law gives retroactive rights , the families will be scattered and their homes destroyed , and maybe they wo n't come forward in a country that has never taken a reliable census of its black population , no one has any statistics on the evictions but government officials say they started in 1990 , after nelson mandela was released from prison many white south africans realized immediately that mr mandela would be the country s next president and that land redistribution would be on his agenda many of the towns near vryheid the word for freedom in afrikaans have an area set aside for the displaced , most of whom were evicted in much the same way as the khulus were on a hill a few kilometers from the scheepers farm are perhaps 100 evicted families , many of them in leaky white tents handed out by the municipality but no agency is giving them food with their livestock impounded for trespassing and most of their belongings destroyed , many of them are barely avoiding starvation , tenant advocates say tenant farmers are among the poorest south africans , driven by apartheid policies to accept brutal conditions in exchange for the right to stay on the land of their ancestors farmers in remote areas sometimes provide schooling for the youngest children , but most end up illiterate they live in mud huts without electricity or running water their wealth is a few fruit trees , a small crop of corn and cattle thus the evictions which usually begin with the shooting or poisoning of the blacks' dogs strip them of their land and all their savings a few days after being evicted in september , the khulu family was still on the side of the road without any way to get to the hill where the other families were nakeni khulu , tending eight grandchildren trying to stay warm on a windy night , said the farmer had simply left them there after demolishing their home they had recovered some valuable bits of corrugated tin from the rubble , and with a tarpaulin for a roof , had built a small box that the entire family crawled into in the night none of the khulus knew about the legislation asked why they had been evicted , mrs khulu , a frail , barefoot woman , said she thought it was because they had asked mr scheepers to pay 3 a month for the labor of the children , so they could buy soap we had not refused to work , she said we had just asked for the money everything would have been all right if we had not asked for the money nomusa masuku , who lives on another tenant farm that belongs to mr scheepers , said he was a very hard man miss masuku is among the six women working in his modest home , which in any american suburb would be called a tract house they work from 6 am to 6 pm , seven days a week , except for a few hours off on sundays there is no cash wage they get one meal a day , she said they share half a plastic milk carton of porridge , which each woman dips into with her own spoon because they are not given bowls when the farmer s wife recently tried to give them tea , mr scheepers got mad and would not let her speak to them anymore even before mr mandela s election last year , he promised to redistribute 30 percent of the country s farmland within five years it is not hard to see why more than 70 years of racist policies left 80 percent of south africa s farmland in the hands of just 60 , 000 white farmers
there seldom passes a day in the life of buck showalter when he is not asked about the progress of a power hitter by the name of strawberry in columbus it s odd , of course , because what the yankees need to cultivate is pitching , and lots of it yesterday , showalter s yankees did get to reap some of what they need most mariano rivera , the young righthander whose entrance into the 1995 season was not the most smashing , turned in a third straight impressive outing the 25yearold threw sixplus innings of onerun ball against the minnesota twins to earn a 51 victory when rivera was forced from the game by badly split nails on the index and middle fingers of his pitching hand , the bullpen took over and the relievers , most specifically bob wickman , came back strong after being badly mauled by kirby puckett company the night before the yankees' offense , spurred by a pair of runs batted in each from wade boggs and mike stanley , also did its part in a neatly turned victory that enabled the club to come away with a split of the fourgame series with the major leagues' losingest club the yankees are still stuck in fourth place in the american league east , barely within sight of firstplace boston but , said a relieved wickman , it was a big win the only thing we can try to do is put pressure on them conversely , the yankees ease the pressure on themselves whenever a rivera steps up and impresses , as he did july 4 at chicago \( eight innings , no runs , two hits , 11 strikeouts \) and on july 9 at texas \( six innings , three runs \) yesterday , the good numbers continued to flow as rivera distanced himself all the more from his initial stint with the yankees early this season , the youngster was 12 with a 1020 earned run average in four shaky starts since his recall from columbus on july 4 , he is 20 with a 180 era rivera was given a huge reprieve in the very first inning of play chuck knoblauch , the first hitter , appeared to hit the ball off the concrete facing behind the rightcenterfield fence for a home run the umpires ruled , however , that the ball did n't clear the wall so knoblauch settled for a double i got a break , rivera acknowledged he also got the next three twins out , striking out the dangerous puckett as well as marty cordova to end the firstinning threat by the time rivera was charged with a run , he had pitched six scoreless innings and had the luxury of carrying a 40 lead into the seventh , thanks to a tworun , basesloaded single by boggs in the second , an rbi single by tony fernandez in the third and a sacrifice fly by stanley in the fifth rivera s good run of luck ended right there in the seventh , though after he allowed a leadoff single to scott leius and a walk to scott stahoviak , rivera was rushed from the game because of the fingernail condition it s happened to me before , but not like this , said rivera , who admitted after the game that the fingers hurt a lot neither he nor showalter seemed concerned that the digits would cost rivera further chances at solidifying a hold on a starting job i proved to myself i could pitch here , rivera said i got to keep it going mariano had as good a fastball as i 've seen him have , said showalter , who said the pitch routinely traveled at better than 93 miles per hour with two on and no outs , wickman came on and managed to strike out matt walbeck on three pitches then he allowed a runscoring double to the twins' no 9 hitter , pat meares knoblauch then coaxed a walk after nine pitches to load the bases rich becker , one of the many new faces in the twins' lineup , then grounded back to the pitcher the ball hit wickman s wrist , spoiling any chance of a double play but wickman reacted quickly enough to throw home for a forceout the missed doubleplay opportunity extended the inning for none other than puckett , who had hit his 11th home run and notched three of his 44 rbi here saturday and puckett represented the heart of the lineup that had treated wickman so roughly the night before \( two innings , six hits , three runs \) it s a situation where you 'd almost rather walk him instead of giving him something to drive , said showalter , who admitted flirting with the idea before letting wickman proceed with the duel it lasted six pitches then wickman , who admitted being kept awake to 5 30 in the morning as the result of his saturday night failures , got puckett to swing through a high fastball on a 32 count to end the inning i think earlier in my career i never would have succeeded today , wickman admitted yet he did and the yankees won , not only in the battle against minnesota , but in their effort to cull some good outings from pitchers they wish to groom or who are still grooming themselves inside pitch paul o'neill , 0 for 5 , saw a 14game hitting streak end don mattingly has hit in eight straight , thanks to a fifthinning double wade boggs , 3 for 4 , has hit in five straight \( 10 for 19 \) and is up to 313 melido perez threw in the bullpen and his effort was declared to be so good by showalter that he might start as early as saturday perez , disabled since july 5 with a stiff shoulder , is next scheduled to throw wednesday the yankees traded infielder dave silvestri to the expos for the minor league infielder tyrone horne silvestri , 27 , hit 095 with one home run and four rbi horne will be assigned to a yankee farm club photo mariano rivera turned in six shutout innings yesterday at yankee stadium before leaving with fingernail problems in the seventh \( alan zale for the new

big east conference for the first time since the big east started playing football in 1991 , the conference has no teams in the top25 polls of writers broadcasters or coaches for the first time in 10 years , miami , the big east s annual champion , is not ranked in the top 25 does this mean the decline and fall of eastern majorcollege football \? does it mean the big east should forget football and return to its basketball roots \? does it mean miami , a perennial contender in the nationalchampionship polls , has become a team of the past and not of the future \? the answers , according to big east coaches , are no , no and no i'm not sure the league is struggling , said don nehlen , the west virginia coach when you look around , everybody is struggling ucla beats miami and then they get whipped there are still those teams that are way better than everyone florida , florida state , nebraska , ohio state , michigan but after that , it gets kind of competitive paul pasqualoni , the syracuse coach , said it was too early in the season to worry whether the big east was slipping i think we have a very tough conference , he said , and that will play out by the end of november and as dan henning , the boston college coach , said , by the end of the season , there will be a few teams from the big east in the top 25 miami s 12 season has not been impressive a 318 loss to ucla , a 493 victory over division iaa florida am , a 137 jolt from virginia tech the hurricanes have this week off , then go to florida state next week for an ostensible execution virginia tech is one of several good teams that will vie for the big east title but its coach , frank beamer , is not writing off miami some people say they 're not as good as they have been , beamer said i'm not sure of that anytime you go through coaching changes , there is a certain adjustment period their quarterback was injured in the second quarter , so now you have a quarterback who has n't played before but they 've got some real players i think miami will be right back where they were but for now , miami is struggling , and its new coach , butch davis , says he knows why his entire team has only five seniors three on offense , none on defense and two kickers of the 16 new starters , he has lost five he says he is playing too many freshmen and sophomores , guys who have no business playing at this stage of their careers , but they have to play against virginia tech , his team suffered through 10 penalties , six sacks , two turnovers and a blocked punt still , henning is wary of the sleeping giant do n't look down your nose at miami , he said miami will be in the race , and if not , it will be a shock to anyone coaching in this conference doug graber , the rutgers coach , found a communal positive in miami s decline there may not be a dominant team in the conference , he said , but there are a lot of good teams and i consider us to be one of those syracuse is , too they all are top matchups this week next up for the big east are saturday s two conference matchups \( syracuse at rutgers and virginia tech at pitt \) and rehabilitation for two injured quarterbacks \( ryan collins of miami and ray lucas of rutgers \) collins , who passes righthanded , separated his right shoulder against virginia tech if the separation does not heal naturally , he will undergo surgery and his season will be over miami s quarterback against florida state next week will be ryan clement , a sophomore players are interchangeable , davis said at rutgers , the quarterbacks are not interchangeable lucas is the starter and robert higgins the backup even though higgins , as a relief passer , passed for 281 yards and 3 touchdowns in saturday night s 5934 loss to penn state , lucas owns the job if healthy but lucas is not healthy when he was knocked to the artificial turf in the first quarter against penn state , he suffered a deep laceration between the left thumb and index finger the hand became swollen , discolored and ugly it s not his throwing hand , graber said i do n't know what his status will be he was not only cut , but he did some damage to the knuckle our biggest concern is taking snaps and ballhandling it s not an injury that will keep him out for the season , but his left hand is just a mess we probably wo n't know until later in the week exactly what our situation is at quarterback we may not even know until game time players of the week big east offense tight end marco battaglia of rutgers \( 13 catches for 184 yards and 3 touchdowns \) and tailback duane thomas of virginia tech \( 25 carries for 165 yards and tech s only touchdown \) defense tackle j c price of virginia tech \( 9 tackles , including 3 sacks for 24 yards \) special teams marvin harrison of syracuse \( 94yard punt return for a touchdown in a 2717 victory over minnesota \) patriot league offense quarterback bob aylsworth of lehigh \( 381 yards and 2 touchdowns passing in 2110 victory over yale \) defense back mark miller \( 14 tackles and 4 pass breakups against yale \) rookie john green of lafayette \( a sack and 2 tackles for losses , one for a safety , in a 288 loss to penn \) frank litsky
washington , march 9 consistency has never been senator larry pressler s strong suit two years ago mr pressler , the south dakota republican , broke ranks with republican leaders in congress to help pass a law regulating cable television prices today he is sponsoring a bill to eliminate those same price regulations mr pressler , having now served 17 years in the senate , is a proud cosponsor of legislation that would limit senators' careers to 12 years but not for him the bill would only affect people elected in the future in our little state , he said in a recent interview , the only card we have to play is seniority but for all his changeability , mr pressler is edging closer to the center stage and one of the most serious undertakings of his career as the new chairman of the senate commerce committee , he is taking the lead in overhauling the nation s creaky communications laws it is an immense undertaking , one that would affect every corner of the 250 billion communications industry and depending on the way the new legislation is written , it could either help or hinder the construction of the socalled information superhighway it is also politically treacherous territory , pitting powerful industry interest groups against each other , in what is almost certain to be among the heaviest lobbying battles of the year there is no doubt that mr pressler is earnest about his mission , but not everybody is sure that he is up to the job his opposite number from south dakota , senator tom daschle , a democrat , once asserted that mr pressler s seat was empty , and quipped that a senate seat is a terrible thing to waste besides the telecommunications bill , mr pressler s committee is also drafting legislation that would make it more difficult to sue companies over defective products , part of a broader effort in congress to overhaul the nation s tort laws but mr pressler has deferred to others on his committee about that legislation , and endorsed a bipartisan bill drafted by senator jay rockefeller , democrat of west virginia , and slade gorton , republican of washington during the years mr pressler has come under attack in south dakota newspapers as a lawmaker who put out thousands of news releases but accomplished little sensing his vulnerability , democratic leaders see his seat as one they will fight to capture in 1996 indeed , mr pressler got off to a rough start this year while trying to attack federal financing for public broadcasting , he submitted a questionnaire to the corporation for public broadcasting , in which he asked to know about the sex and ethnicity of the employees at national public radio as well as the number of people there who had worked for either christian fundamentalist stations or pacifica radio , a leftleaning radio service after an uproar ensued , mr pressler , insisting that he had been misunderstood , said public broadcasters could ignore those questions but some industry officials warn that such distractions can sidetrack the bigger issues he s losing valuable time , one washington lobbyist said when you embarrass your party , it diminishes your ability to lead on other issues but none of that will matter much if mr pressler can push a successful telecommunications bill through congress his proposal , similar to the one the democrats tried to pass last year , would let the regional bell telephone companies enter the longdistance industry and cable television , while forcing them to open their own monopolies it is more hawkish , though , about deregulation , and would also eliminate price regulations for cable television and rules that restrict the ownership of television and radio stations the turf battles in the industry are intense , particularly between the bell companies and longdistance carriers like the att corporation and the mci communications corporation republican leaders say they are confident about passing a bill this year , and mr pressler has scheduled a committee markup session and vote for march 21 but industry experts and many lawmakers say the chances of final passage this year are at best about even this is sort of playing a chess game with several senators , each of whom can have a checkmate , mr pressler said if lyndon johnson were alive in the senate today , i do n't think he would be able to pass this by armtwisting if this passes , it has got to be with a consensus for the moment the ball is in his hands the clinton administration strongly supports the telecommunication overhaul , but is too burdened by other problems to take a strong role house republicans are also gearing up for their own bill , but are moving more slowly in order to act on elements of the contract with america first no one doubts that mr pressler , the youthfullooking , blueeyed lawmaker , is extremely serious about his agenda or acutely aware of the need to generate support from both democrats and republicans born in humboldt , sd , he won a rhodes scholarship to oxford , served in vietnam and then went on to earn both a master s degree and a law degree from harvard he was elected to congress in 1974 , one of only a handful of

white plains it is a time for rejoicing , religious faith , of friends and family , warmth and comfort , delicious food , gift giving and celebrating well , bah ! humbug ! for many people , this norman rockwell vision of happiness is as much an apparition as the ghost of christmas past for them , the holiday season is a time of profound difficulty , a period experienced as a relentless assault of false bonhomie , rampant commercialism , obligations and stress , marked by feelings of loneliness and being overwhelmed in fact , the phenomenon is so widespread that mentalhealth professionals have given it a name the holiday syndrome the syndrome , informally known as the holiday blues , has a definition and symptoms there are even suggestions for weathering the condition , which usually starts when halloween costumes begin to appear in store windows , persists through thanksgiving , hanukkah and christmas and passes once the new year celebrations are over it s a remarkably long and stressful period , said beth harris , a psychiatric nurse and director of patient education at the westchester division of the new york hospital cornell medical center here for many people this is a difficult time freefloating anxiety is extremely common you do n't even know what you 're anxious about is it about finding the right gift \? finding the money to pay for it \? the line at the post office \? or who you 're going to spend new year s with \? mrs harris recently gave a community lecture on the subject she told the audience that the syndrome was a normal condition , which was different from other forms of sadness and not the same thing as a severe or clinical depression nonetheless , it can be debilitating despite the fact that so many people do feel sad around the holidays , many feel isolated in their feelings feelings of guilt and rejection are very common at this time of year , mrs harris said you see the parties being formed , you see people in restaurants , people with christmas trees or menorahs in their windows , she said and then you think , maybe if i were funnier or maybe more attractive , i would have been invited maybe it s because i do n't measure up a woman at the lecture raised her hand and said there s such a feeling of inadequacy if you are lonely , it s because no one wants your company maybe you 're just not up for decorating like someone else does , or cooking like you should a man who had retired from his job several years ago said when i was working , there were so many parties , and suddenly you 're in a position where that just does n't exist anymore it takes a number of years to adjust for the first few years , you get five or six cards , then it dwindles and then there s none after awhile , it does n't matter the grip of loneliness , bad enough on christmas or hanukkah , is particularly powerful on new year s eve at midnight you 're supposed to kiss your honey , mrs harris said what if there is no honey \? there s a feeling you should be with someone , and the feeling that everyone else has someone that can be a tremendous burden several people suggested that the commercialism of the holiday season had robbed it of it s true meaning , and therefore enjoyment i tend to feel this big obligation to fulfill something for someone else , said tom bitondo of yonkers instead of thinking about the birth of christ , you 're thinking , 'is the house decorated right \? ' i have a problem with the false hype and the feeling of good will that is n't real , said pamela nathe of mamaroneck the first catalogue came in august and the christmas music all the time it s sickening people keep asking me , 'where s your christmas spirit \? ' an elderly woman said and i want to say , 'just leave me alone' mrs harris said that compounding the conscious feelings of sadness and alienation are subconscious forces at work many of the symbols of the holidays concern parent child relationships for christians , the son of god is born santa claus , mrs harris points out , is a father figure even at the new year , there is imagery of father time , birth and death an old man representing the year passed dies , and a baby representing the new year is born at this time of year there s a lot of hovering unconscious business , mrs harris said the images represent our relationship to our parents , the symbols have to do with birth and death these feelings run deep , and they stimulate us , even though it s not in our awareness how do we react to all this stimulation \? often with regression , mrs harris suggests we start to think like we 're 4 years old again , she said we start thinking this should be a magical time , and everything should be wonderful , joyful and you should get what you want inevitably , this sets us up for disappointment some people also react with fewer inhibitions , eating and drinking too much and engaging in the kind of childish acts like wearing a lamp shade on one s head that they would do at no other time of the year others simply retreat i go into hibernation from dec 15 to jan 15 , ms nathe said this time of year i turn off the television and the radio i have videos and music cd s i totally withdraw i try to ignore it while everyone is susceptible to holiday blues , those most vulnerable are people who have experienced a significant loss during the season miriam poole of white plains said that her mother s funeral was on christmas eve , and that every christmas brought back painful memories i hear her favorite christmas carols and it all comes back , mrs poole said ms harris said that when she was a child , her aunt was killed in a car accident on the way to christmas dinner there is not a christmas that goes by that i do n't think of my aunt , she said death , divorce , any major disintegration or loss of an important person at that time makes us vulnerable mrs harris did suggest a number of ways to combat feelings of sadness at this time simply talking about the emotions , and acknowledging that the holidays are not always marvelous , is beneficial planning how to handle the stress is also helpful she noted that the entire season can be broken down into workable components gifts can be approached as a category , and then options reviewed do you want to give gifts at all \? if so , will they be made or bought \? if buying , will i shop from catalogues or go to stores \? will i handle the outoftown gifts first \? new year s eve plans can be handled as an entirely separate category volunteering for others can also help someone weather a difficult season and if one is feeling overwhelmed , mrs harris suggested that they ask for help she also stressed the importance of what she called the triad of health adequate sleep , well balanced meals and exercise in short , take care of yourself most of all , keep the holidays in perspective try to remember that everyone is not having a christmas like 'miracle on 34th street' or 'it s a wonderful life , ' mrs harris said you 're going to see a lot that s not realistic they 'll be a lot of hype and a lot of gaiety but there are other people who may not be having a perfectly wonderful holiday season , too drawing
harrison , ny , may 20 if sheer hard work counts for anything , if absolute dedication to beating all the vagaries out of the game of golf has any meaning whatsoever , then vijay singh is exactly where he belongs today right atop the leader board after three rounds of the buick classic at the westchester country club the tall , stylish player from fiji finally has an opportunity to defend the title he won here two years ago after capturing the 1993 classic , singh had to withdraw in the middle of the first round last year with a neck injury now , healthy again , beating balls like a maniac again , practicing until the calluses on his thick hands have calluses of their own , he s back singh \( as in swing \) turned in a round of 67 for a 54hole total of sevenunderpar 206 that s one stroke better than bobby wadkins , who shot a 69 , and two strokes better than nick faldo \( 67 \) and bruce fleisher , who hung tough with a round of 69 it was sad to come here last year and not be able to play , said singh , 32 , who also had to withdraw from last year s united states open the week after the buick but i actually feel like i'm defending this year he also feels fresh for the first time in a while singh , who won at phoenix earlier this season , took two weeks off before coming to westchester for a man who routinely beats so many balls that he makes the hardworking tom kite look like bruce lietzke , singh actually allowed himself to relax he promised that he would n't hit a ball for 10 days i made it nine , he said with a laugh there must be some validity to this vacation preparation approach last week at the gte byron nelson , ernie els went directly from the lounge chair to the top of the leader board , from three weeks off to a threestroke victory els looked as if he might carry that over into this week , too , but he struggled to a 75 today and is seven strokes off the pace if singh is to successfully defend his buick title here , he 'll need to shoot a fairly low score on sunday on a bright , breezy day at westchester , a large number of players put themselves into the picture there are 14 players within four strokes of the lead , and some of them are n't to be trifled with consider faldo , who provides the nearest name competition for singh faldo frittered away three strokes coming in on friday , but he did n't allow it to derail him this is the way he comes at it when he s playing efficiently , and that s just how he s playing now he birdied three holes and bogeyed none , making a 12foot putt at the first hole , a 2footer at the 14th and twoputting for birdie at the parfive 18th after ripping a driver onto the green from the fairway that shot , much like the spectacular 3wood faldo hit into the last green when he won the doralryder open earlier in the year , was exquisite he cut the ball perfectly , running it onto the green and leaving it 30 feet below the hole faldo never really threatened to bogey a hole , except at the seventh , where he made a 10footer for par after missing the green i'm still going to have to go out and shoot a number tomorrow , faldo said i 'll be trying to shoot a 66 or a 67 , then see what happens speaking of numbers , here s one 46 that s how old bruce fleisher is he 'll admit in his more candid moments , when his right elbow is on fire with tendinitis , that he feels older but he s not too old to dream , and right now he has only two men between him and the tournament lead for a man who struggled for the first 11 years of his career , quit and then came back eight years later and finally won his first event in 1991 , that s a pretty sight darn right i'm in a good position , fleisher said i'm in a real good position wadkins feels the same way he has played 21 years on the pga tour without a victory he had the dubious distinction of being the leading money winner without a victory \( 232 million in earnings \) until brad bryant passed him by about 20 , 000 at the shell houston open this year he has had his chances , most recently at last year s kemper open , where he led after three rounds only to shoot 74 and finish tied for second wadkins bogeyed the last hole today to keep himself from sharing the overnight lead , but it did n't bother him in fact , he chose to put some positive spin on that maybe that s a blessing in disguise , he said i ca n't remember the last time i played in the last group without having the lead and that pressure it will be neat to be the other guy for a change there are a lot of other guys hovering around the top and enough potential story lines to fill a catalogue for a tournament that did n't attract a particularly good field , the buick classic could have a firstrate finish chip shots jim mcgovern of oradell , nj , vaulted into contention with a tournamentlow round of 65 that included an ace at the 131yard sixth hole the holeinone was the 11th ace at no 6 in the 1990 s in tournament play no other pga tour stop has as many as six but it was special to mcgovern it was a perfect shot , he said of the second ace of his career mike hulbert finished eaglebirdie to remain within striking distance of the leaders at

washington american eagle flight 4184 had been holding for 32 minutes in a chilly drizzle last october when air traffic controllers in chicago cleared the pilots to make a routine descent from 10 , 000 to 8 , 000 feet although the pilots did not know it , a dangerous ridge of ice had built up on the wings , and in a fraction of a second , to their complete and ultimately final terror , the pilots lost control of the atr72 turbo prop the plane s controls moved on their own , tilting the right wing almost perpendicular to the ground the pilots wrestled with the aircraft , but the wing tilted violently again , the plane flipped on its back and , without hope of recovery , the plane plunged toward earth all 68 people aboard were killed when the plane slammed into a soybean field near roselawn , ind , a crash so violent that few recognizable pieces of the plane were left intact it was a crash that did not have to happen a new york times investigation has found that the federal aviation administration had for years brushed aside repeated warnings from pilots and experts , and from the behavior of the plane itself , that something was awry the failure to heed those warnings raises troubling questions that go beyond the roselawn crash , questions about the procedures and safeguards of the agency itself the agency does not routinely monitor crashes abroad of foreignmade planes operating in this country as happened with the atr it also relies heavily on manufacturers' evaluations of their own airplanes as with the atr rather than conducting independent tests as a result , its own experts increasingly lack the handson knowledge to ask the right questions the faa s bureaucratic culture keeps it from being aggressive , as does its reluctance to impose costly safety modifications on airlines there have been assertions for years that issues like wind shear and deicing become priorities only after a fatal crash brings them to public attention the experts call it tombstone technology , and the atr experience provides a compelling example the atr72 and the smaller atr42 were involved in a string of incidents in europe and the united states , including a 1987 crash in the alps that killed 37 people in at least 20 incidents the planes faltered in icy conditions yet the faa failed to conduct a farreaching , independent review of the plane s design until after 68 people were killed in the united states in october it s a story of a series of linked incidents , and at least one accident , that all point basically in the same direction that there is a problem in certain conditions with the aircraft , said william d waldock , a professor of aeronautical science at embryriddle aeronautical university in arizona and a leading safety expert but until the blood gets deep enough , there is a tendency to either ignore a problem or live with it for their part , faa officials vigorously defend the agency s actions in certifying the plane , and continuing to allow it to fly the pattern , they insist , became clear only after the roselawn crash it is only in hindsight , they say , that the atr crash seems as if it could have been prevented atr officials say much the same the plane , they say , fully meets the standards set by american rules , and exhibits its flaw only when subjected to much more severe conditions when the faa certified the atr to operate in this country , it meant that the plane met the agency s standards for flying in icy conditions the continuing problems with ice , however , inevitably prompted concerns not only about the design of the plane but also about the stringency of the standards themselves and while the agency signed off on design changes in the atr , it never reconsidered its own ice standards but by the late 1980 s , experts inside and outside the faa were pressing the agency to do just that since the turbo props used by the growing commuter airlines flew at lower altitudes where freezing rain and drizzle are more prevalent , the agency needed to adopt new , more demanding standards , they argued for the faa , however , new standards would require new rules , new tests and new costly demands on the airlines few in the agency s top ranks favored such an undertaking nearly six years ago , the air line pilots association , the nation s largest pilots' union , complained that the atr42 , the predecessor to the atr72 , had an unorthodox , illconceived and inadequately designed deicing system the agency dismissed the pilots' concerns at about the same time , a report by the italian ministry of transport on the crash in the alps included new evidence that dangerous ice could build up on the plane it virtually predicted the kind of ice accumulation that was eventually implicated in the roselawn crash but nobody in the agency obtained a copy of the report , or of a second italian report , a public document that said the plane s controls could malfunction in severe icy conditions there are a lot of italian reports that people do n't get , said anthony j broderick , associate administrator for regulation and certification mr broderick said hindsight is always 2020 i have n't seen anything that is , any data that indicates that anybody should have seen this coming , he said but mr broderick went on to qualify his remark had they been pressured , had they somehow been much more insightful than they were , yes , maybe they could have seen it timothy forte , director of the national transportation safety board s office of aviation safety , said that the faa and the safety board missed clues along the way , beginning in 1988 we missed it , he said it was there when we looked back , we saw it we wish we had caught it
east rutherford , nj , sept 24 many members of the giants met for lunch at a houlihan s restaurant on friday and none other than lawrence taylor picked up the tab but the team s inspiration for what was an incredible performance today against new orleans probably did not come from having nachos with a former player it may have come from a higher plane perhaps from the dreams of george henshaw , the offensive coordinator last monday , henshaw dreamed that the giants would score 30 points against the saints now that may not make the prophesy hall of fame , but considering how the team had only scored one offensive touchdown in the first three games of the season , it was a pretty interesting vision and considering that the backup quarterback tommy maddox had a dream similar to henshaw s , well , someone had better call unsolved mysteries henshaw said he did n't tell anyone about his dream at first because he thought his fellow coaches might laugh him out of the state but maybe he should dream more often in what amounted to a stunning turnaround , the giants rolled over new orleans , beating the saints , 4529 , as rodney hampton ran for four touchdowns to thrill the 72 , 619 fans at giants stadium the giants did n't just win , they scored the most points in a regularseason game since 1986 consider what happened a team that has had problems sustaining even one drive without mindnumbing penalties looked almost perfect for an entire game a team whose starting quarterback , dave brown , has appeared to have little confidence suddenly looked like joe namath a running game that had been average looked spectacular yes , it was against the worst defense in the league , and yes , the saints are 04 but the 13 giants and their quarterback looked like a team on a mission and deserve some credit a loss meant their season would have been just about over now there is hope no wonder there were so many smiles in the giants' locker room we got a win , said linebacker michael brooks everyone around here is really excited we 've been looking for this for weeks now while safety vencie glenn did have two big interceptions , the offense won this game and they won it because of two players in particular brown and hampton brown was 19 of 27 for 258 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception he looked confident , patient and poised not once did he get happy feet and get nervous i told the linemen 'i 've got cement on my shoes this game i'm not running at all i'm staying in there , ' he said what was the turnaround \? job security and everything else , he said i never know what s going to happen here i kind of took the mentality that i was a cowboy riding with a black hat on i wanted to go out and prove to everyone that i could play quarterback , and with me at the helm we can win in other words , he acquired an attitude hampton has already proved he can run he finished with 149 yards on 33 carries and set a team record with his four rushing touchdowns , scoring from 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 yards he also has 1 , 330 career rushing attempts , which broke the team record of joe morris \( 1 , 318 \) hampton needs just 128 yards rushing to pass morris as the franchise s career leader today showed that we 're moving in the right direction , said hampton you can definitely credit the whole gang today , especially the offensive line the first drive was typical of how things went running back tyrone wheatley took the kickoff 32 yards to the giants' 42 that was the best field position of the season for the giants after a kickoff and also the longest kickoff return of the year on the same drive , hampton had a 32yard run , his longest of the season and the drive ended with a 1yard hampton touchdown run and a 70 lead coach dan reeves and henshaw did an excellent job in preparing for this game s playcalling reeves inserted a number of misdirection plays that bought brown time for passing and confused the saints' defense when you get the running game going it makes playcalling a heck of a lot easier , said reeves but it was more than that the giants seemed more adventurous on one series , brown threw a 10yard screen to wheatley later , brown went to receiver chris calloway on a 38yard touchdown pass play after hampton nicely picked up a blitz and calloway shook off cornerback jimmy spencer that made it 2117 in favor of the giants , and a 50yard field goal by brad daluiso to end the first half made it 2417 i was shocked he got the pass off , monte kiffin , the saints' defensive coordinator , said of the pass to calloway there were other examples of the giants' new freedom on offense such as when brown went deep to hback aaron pierce for a 26yard gain that would set up another hampton touchdown and give new york a 3117 lead and on a later drive the offensive assistants made two great calls first , on thirdand1 at the giants' 48 , brown hit tight end howard cross for a 10yard gain then , on another thirdand1 on that same drive , brown found herschel walker across the middle for 22 yards those calls showed an openness that was not present in previous weeks i ca n't remember since we 've been here that we played with that much rhythm through four quarters , henshaw said on the other side of the rainbow was the reaction of saints coach jim mora , who is in jeopardy of losing his job we 're in a pretty low ebb as a football team goes , he said while brown did not have any dreams last monday his rem sleep has probably been interrupted more by nightmares than scoring visions he has kept busy reading to keep his mind focused and inspired last night i read from a book called 'the edge , ' brown said it s a book of quotes and i read one by terry bradshaw that kind of motivated me it said , 'you can lose with me , but you ca n't win without me' that was something i took to heart extra points defensive tackle ray agnew led the giants with four tackles , one sack and one pass deflection when rodney hampton scored his fourth touchdown , brown , in a lighthearted gesture , attempted to shake hands with one of the officials the official declined , putting his hands behind his back hampton was one of 50 nfl players to contribute 10 , 000 to the united negro college fund as part of a joint program by the league and the players association the contribution from each player was matched by the league photo rodney hampton gaining some of his 149 yards he scored four touchdowns \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
tokyo , saturday , april 15 the police and residents took precautions today against a possible terrorist attack because of a prophecy by a religious cult s leader that something horrible would happen in tokyo on april 15 at least two shopping centers in the capital said they would be closed , and many railway lines shut the coin lockers in their stations more than 10 , 000 police officers were patrolling railway stations , roads and other places in tokyo in another preventive step , the authorities conducted their most extensive raids yet on friday against the cult , aum shinrikyo , which is suspected of involvement in the nervegas attack that killed 11 people and injured more than 5 , 000 in the tokyo subway last month thousands of officers raided about 130 buildings used by the sect , from the northern island of hokkaido to okinawa in the south the police removed 53 children from the cult s main compound and took them to a welfare center in a nearby city thousands more officers were employed at road checkpoints in a manhunt for the cult s leader , shoko asahara , who is in hiding with many of his top advisers the religious group , whose name means supreme truth , has denied any involvement in the subway attack and said it has planned no actions for today but mr asahara , who has prophesied that the world will end in 1997 , said earlier this year that a major disaster will strike tokyo on april 15 he suggested it would be an earthquake , but the police are on alert for terrorist attacks based on ingredients confiscated in earlier raids , they suspect that the cult has stocks of sarin , the nervegas used to poison rushhour commuters on the tokyo subways on march 20 security was tightest in shinjuku , an area in western tokyo that houses japan s busiest railway station , tokyo s tallest office buildings and a somewhat seedy entertainment district shopping centers in the district were closed today with the official explanation that workers needed to do maintenance a big department store near the train station said it would keep 100 employees stationed near its doors today , up from the usual 15 the army s largest chemicalwarfare unit has also been placed on standby in shinjuku , one news report said but elsewhere in the city there seemed to be much less worry , and on friday most people went about their normal routine chief cabinet secretary kozo igarashi , the government s top spokesman , told tokyo residents there was little need to worry , although the government had taken precautions just in case in taking 53 children from the cult s main compound near mount fuji , the police said friday that they were acting under a child welfare law many of the children , aged 3 to 14 , were wearing distinctive headgear with wires that cult members say allows them to receive brain waves from mr asahara , the leader police officers said some of the children appeared malnourished and eight of them were brought to a hospital the children were also given urine tests to see if they had been drugged in their searches of aum shinrikyo buildings and vehicles , which have been going on virtually nonstop for more than three weeks , the police have discovered a russian military helicopter , tons of chemicals that could be used to make poison gases , possible supplies for biological warfare and sites that apparently could be used to make guns the authorities have already arrested more than 100 cult members , including two who had once belonged to underworld groups many have been arrested on minor charges including traffic violations in the hope that they can be pressured to reveal more about the cult s activities none has been charged with involvement in the subway attack the religious group has said it was stockpiling the chemicals to make fertilizers after the predicted apocalypse it has accused the police of harrasment and violating their right to religious freedom police are supposed to gather evidence and make arrests based on that evidence , said fumihiro joyu , a cult spokesman quoted today by the associated press but this time , they 're just attacking us and making up reasons to dismantle our property
napoleon is supposed to have sacked generals he said were unlucky perhaps baseball owners will explain what just happened to them as bad luck though of course none of them will be sacked but bad luck cannot account for the absurd events of the last seven months since the players went on strike and the owners vowed to get a salary cap now , as real baseball returns , we have the acting commissioner expressing pleasure that his fellow owners accepted the players' unconditional offer to return to work that s like custer saying the sioux unconditionally offered to come to the battlefield heading into this negotiation , the owners felt cornered by factors beyond their control they believed the union was powerful , selfish and led by ideologues who cared little for the game their operating losses , said to be over 400 million in 1994 , would reduce franchise values most of all , they believed this negotiation represented their final chance to fix things so what did they do \? they viewed the problem largely in good guy bad guy terms get rid of the commissioner and the deputy who might interfere hire a new labor negotiator and , above all , stay united that happened but it s what did n't happen that determined the outcome the owners did not develop a careful strategy and they misjudged the ability of their legal team lack of planning is endemic to baseball in 1990 , the owners' labor lawyer told me that any fallback negotiating positions would be leaked by owners , so none could be discussed as a result , during the heat of a negotiation , the owners are constantly dealing with problems on the run there is no careful wargaming to develop countermoves in anticipation of obvious union thrusts meanwhile , the union plays for time , confident that eventually a legal mistake will give it the dispositive edge now where are we \? the union leadership is properly flush as once again superior lawyering decided the battle the union lawyers have a longer unbeaten string than rocky marciano but the latest win is limited and does not decide the war the question is whether these same lawyers can work with owners during the coming season to construct a new economic mechanism that will provide a stable format for both the growth of the game and a decent sharing of revenues among owners and players i wonder the lesson of baseball s labor history is that owners and players have sadly turned economic issues into a morality play they see each other as evil and placing a moral cast on matters of money can only make the permanent solution extremely difficult to achieve baseball needs new players at the skill positions the old methods have failed again baseball also needs a few new ideas copying the national basketball association by seeking a salary cap is easy but even that league now faces the issue of how to construct new sharing mechanisms the answer has seemed clear to me for some time the owners and players must recapitalize the baseball business with players getting shares in the equity and future growth of the game almost as important , the owners have to believe in their economic future many do n't , even though the value of sports programming is growing and the emergence of the media superhighway is only going to drive franchise values even higher the challenge is to find smart , wellintentioned realists to sit down with the common objective of building the game on terms that provide owners and players with reasonable shares i do n't see the current leaders designing this new structure nor do i see any change in leadership resulting from this latest fiasco but change is inevitable after all , this game we love is ancient i 'll wait
washington , dec 20 the house voted today for the first time to override a veto by president clinton , reacting swiftly to his 11thhour rejection of legislation to make it more difficult for stockholders to bring fraud suits the senate , which is more closely divided , made plans to vote later this week within minutes of opening its session this morning , the house voted to override mr clinton s veto by 319 to 100 29 more than the twothirds margin necessary there was little evidence of white house lobbying today to swing senate votes in mr clinton s favor if mr clinton is to prevail , he will need some democratic senators who had voted for the measure to reverse their positions , an especially awkward political feat for them tonight , some said privately that they were annoyed that the president had allowed them to vote for the bill earlier this month without giving them any sign he would oppose it mr clinton delayed until literally the last hour before announcing his disapproval on tuesday night of a measure that would fundamentally alter a system , in place for more than 60 years , to discourage fraud in the securities market by combining private and government sanctions while the measure would preserve the authority of the securities and exchange commission to pursue fraud claims , it could place several obstacles in the way of individual investors seeking to have their claims heard in court against accountants , underwriters and company officials mr clinton had until midnight tuesday to sign or veto the bill or otherwise it would automatically become law he had kept all the competing interests in suspense until only half an hour before that deadline as a fierce debate raged among his aides over what position mr clinton should take just before the deadline he announced he had vetoed the bill because it was flawed even though he supported its principal purpose in his statement , mr clinton said he hoped that congress would reconsider a measure with changes he was recommending in an apparent suggestion that his opposition was not that strong the president has , all along , had to weigh varying political factors in assessing the legislation among those supporting the bill are large accounting firms , brokers and business groups , especially those from the more financially volatile hightechnology industries the supporters argue that the legislation is necessary to discourage a flood of what are seen as frivolous lawsuits when a company s share price drops suddenly on the other side are consumer groups , lawyers and state officials who manage pension funds who have said that the legislation will deprive small investors recourse when they are deceived in the financial marketplace in his veto statement , mr clinton said our markets are as strong and effective as they are because they operate , and are seen to operate , with integrity i believe that this bill , as modified in conference , could erode this crucial basis of our markets' strength in the white house deliberations , mr clinton had been counseled by some officials , including treasury secretary robert e rubin , to sign the bill as a demonstration of his understanding of the business community s needs other aides argued against approving a measure widely portrayed as helping businesses at the expense of small investors in his veto message , mr clinton cited relatively minor aspects of the bill he singled out the socalled pleading requirements , which under the new bill would require a plaintiff to show that a defendant had the intent to defraud someone mr clinton said that the requirement with regard to a defendant s state of mind impose an unacceptable hurdle to meritorious claims being heard in federal courts representative peter deutsch , a florida democrat who supported the bill , said he was baffled by that objection , saying it had not been previously raised by the white house in extensive discussions i really thought it was a stretch , he said this morning , as several house democrats met in a room off the house floor to discuss whether to go against the president , their resolve was bolstered by an appearance by senator christopher j dodd , a connecticut democrat , who had journeyed across the capitol s marble corridors to the other chamber to encourage a quick veto override the legislative fight provides an unusual personal political faceoff as it pits the president against mr dodd , a close clinton supporter and the chairman of the democratic national committee mr dodd said in a statement that he was disappointed in the president s veto he then quickly dismissed mr clinton s call to redraw the bill with some modifications and set about mobilizing an effort to override the veto some democratic congressmen said that mr dodd had suggested to them that the president would not suffer so much if he was overriden still , white house officials acknowledged later that the swiftness of the override effort in the house took them by surprise when the house voted , none of the democrats who had voted in favor of the bill defected after the president s veto aides in several senate offices of democrats who had voted for the bill said they had not yet been called by the president , although white house officials said he intended to make his case soon mr clinton , they argued , was preoccupied with the budget , whitewater and bosnia the administration argument , they said , is likely to be that mr clinton is seeking only minor changes and senators who reverse position and oppose the bill can say that they will support a slightly modified version over the last several months , most of the behindthescenes negotiation concerned the creation of a safe harbor for predictions about a company s performance because such forwardlooking statements are used as evidence by those charging fraud , companies say they are reluctant to provide needed information much of the negotiation over that provision was aimed at winning the support of arthur levitt jr , the chairman of the securities and exchange commission who had complained that the original safeharbor language was more like a safe ocean the bill was modified to inoculate companies from legal liability for such statements if they included cautionary amendments mr levitt supported that change but declined to take a position on the bill as a whole the legislation provided numerous lobbying opportunities for a flock of former sec officials who had been recruited by both sides in the end , the biggest winners were almost certainly the major accounting firms who had successfully lobbied for a bill that excluded accountants from those who could be sued for aiding and abetting fraud
an 11yearold lawsuit pitting a psychoanalyst against a journalist who wrote an unflattering profile of him may have taken a new turn because a little girl got tired of banging on a piano and sat down near a bookcase to play janet malcolm , the journalist whose profile of the psychoanalyst , jeffrey masson , led to a libel suit that went to the united states supreme court and was the subject of two trials in federal district court , has asserted that a missing collection of notes of her conversations with mr masson has been found at long last it is not clear what effect , if any , the new material will have on the case , in part because the fresh notes assuming they are genuine do not directly address the points on which ms malcolm seemed most vulnerable but her lawyer said yesterday that the material would be helpful if there was yet another trial in november , a jury in san francisco essentially ruled in favor of ms malcolm it found that while two of five disputed quotations she attributed to mr masson in a 1983 article in the new yorker were false and one was defamatory , none were written with the recklessness that constitutes libel in a telephone interview yesterday from his home in berkeley , calif , mr masson scoffed at the notion that missing notes had been uncovered the psychoanalyst , who is appealing the verdict , called them a fabrication , an adult version of 'the dog ate my homework' but ms malcolm has declared in an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the notes are genuine , and that her account of their discovery , first reported by anthony lewis , a new york times columnist , on the oped page of the times on friday , is true the notes were found , ms malcolm said in the affidavit , by her 2yearold granddaughter , sophy tuck , on the night of aug 11 in ms malcolm s home in sheffield , mass in ms malcolm s telling , the child had been banging on the piano , then began exploring a nearby bookcase , where she plucked out a thin book with a red cover i leafed through the book and saw it was a notebook filled with my own handwriting , ms malcolm said i began to read , and immediately saw that i had found the handwritten notes from which i derived the typewritten pages that are part of the trial record at issue in the marathon case , which has fanned a dispute over how much license if any a journalist should take with quotations , was ms malcolm s portrayal of mr masson in 1983 he had recently been dismissed as projects director of the sigmund freud archives in london for criticizing freud s theories of sexual abuse in childhood a central question was whether quotations she attributed to mr masson had been fabricated , as he contended , or simply rearranged and compressed in three of the five disputed quotations in the twopart , 45 , 500word article , ms malcolm wrote that mr masson had said he hoped to turn freud s home into a place of sex , women , fun that two prominent psychiatrists considered him an intellectual gigolo , and that he himself would one day be considered the greatest analyst who ever lived a fourth disputed quotation concerned a paper in which mr masson faulted psychoanalysis for its sterility i do n't know why i put it in , mr masson is supposed to have said , conceding to ms malcolm that his faultfinding was gratuitous the fifth disputed quotation concerned mr masson s dismissal from the freud archives ms malcolm wrote that mr masson had told her how an archives official asked him to keep quiet about losing his job , and that he had refused well , he had the wrong man , mr masson is supposed to have told ms malcolm the jury in the trial that ended in november found the fourth quotation false and the fifth not only false but also defamatory though not libelously so the notes that ms malcolm said her granddaughter had turned up are of recollections about the first three disputed quotations and do not address the fourth and fifth recalling the moment of discovery , ms malcolm said i went into the kitchen , where my husband was finishing the dishes , and said , 'gardner , i have found the notes' they are in this little red book i theorized that sophy had pulled the notebook out of the bookcase , where it had been sitting all these years , perhaps attracted by its bright red color ms malcolm had tape recordings to back up much of her quoted material , although she was criticized by some journalists for depicting a longrunning luncheon conversation instead of the several interviews that actually took place ms malcolm said she had no notes to support the fourth quotation and had relied on memory as for the fifth quotation , the issue was her editing of mr masson s taperecorded comments until the apparent discovery of the new notes , she had only typewritten summaries to back up the three other disputed quotations mr masson insisted that the new notes were fake she did not take notes i still maintain that ms malcom s lawyers originally moved to have the suit dismissed before trial , but the supreme court refused , holding that there were grounds for a trial in the first , in 1993 , a jury concluded that ms malcolm had fabricated the five disputed quotations , but it deadlocked on damages some jurors thought mr masson should get 1 million , while others thought that he had damaged himself by his own boasting ms malcolm s lawyer , gary l bostwick of santa monica , calif , said yesterday that the new notes would buttress ms malcolm s case further in the event of a third trial , and that he had felt all along that they would be found that s the way the world works when you mislay something photos janet malcolm , who says her granddaughter turned up lost notes , and jeffrey masson \( associated press jim wilson the new york times

as a latterday margaret mead might note , the land that is fifth avenue from rockefeller center to 58th street is populated by two tribes , two groups with distinct markings , customs and mythologies there are the luxurystore customers , known by their prada handbags and tailored retro suits , the wealthiest of whom are dropped by lincoln town car at the 58th street back door to bergdorf goodman this spring , more than any season in memory , they are sharing fifth avenue with another tribe , in shorts and running shoes , foraging for 12 cocacola baseball caps and tasmanian devil plush toys these budget tourists , who have long come to ogle , are now drawn by massmarket retailers that have flooded the avenue in the last 18 months , transforming it into a landscape as familiar as any suburban galleria ever since the first malltype stores announced that they were setting up shop along fifth avenue s platinum belt , retail analysts have warned that the hoi polloi would chase away the carriage trade so far , evidence of flight is slim , and many shop managers tout a new vitality on the sidewalks and a ringing of cash registers but other merchants say the new crowds are n't buying luxury goods , just souvenir tshirts the skeptics attribute the good health to the economic recovery and the weak dollar , and they worry about the avenue s longterm future massmarket shops such as the warner bros studio store , which are on fifth for public relations as much as profit , are driving rents up mallification , these skeptics warn , may accelerate a minimigration of luxury stores to madison avenue near 59th street the dumbing down of fifth avenue is full steam ahead , said alan g millstein , an analyst who has been a consultant to stores in the neighborhood in the long term , it seems the only people who 'll pay the outrageous rents are mallbased stores with more appeal to the masses than the classes whatever the economic effects , there s no doubt that the culture of fifth avenue , one of the world s most gilded shopping districts , is changing profoundly between the traditional anchors of saks fifth avenue , at 50th street , and bergdorf goodman , the last year has seen the opening of such mall staples as banana republic and 9 west levi s , nike and disney superstores are on the way they join the cocacola gift shop , which opened in 1991 , and the 18monthold warner bros store on the northeast corner of 57th street the heavily trafficked intersection has been nicknamed the four carats , because its corners are occupied by tiffany , bulgari , van cleef arpels and bugs bunny i loathe the coke store , the disney store , said roxane bednar , a new yorker who was headed for tea at the plaza hotel dressed in a fashionable creamcolored suit they 're destroying the most elegant corner of new york this is not hollywood or florida this is fifth avenue but tom cusick , president of the fifth avenue association , a merchants' group , says that the coke store and other mass retailers have helped the thoroughfare rebound from a troubled period in the early 90 s noting that the warner store filled a site that had been vacant for more than five years , he said , i do n't see how that kind of a change is a negative impact on the carriage trade he also cites zoning changes that have reduced the number of banks and airline ticket offices in favor of retail stores , and the departure of illegal peddlers and several stores with goingoutofbusiness sales perpetually plastering their windows the changes have led to heavy pedestrian traffic the association has counted 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 people an hour during peak business from 11 am to 3 pm no one denies that the sidewalks are more crowded , but merchants and analysts do debate whether those crowds are good news for bluechip fifth avenue you have a higher volume of traffic , said joseph ming , president of bally of switzerland , but the buying power of the traffic is not as concentrated as it was before this summer , bally is moving its 250 loafers and 400 handbags from fifth and 55th street to madison avenue and 59th street people do n't just walk , mr ming said they sit and stand and eat in front of the stores it s almost hard to get through sometimes in its new location near barneys new york , which opened there two years ago , bally joins superstores selling calvin klein and ann taylor that are scheduled to open this year ann taylor has been in temporary quarters on east 57th street since it moved to make way for levi s paola fuchs is manager of the italian designer martino midali s new boutique , which opened last week on madison between 78th and 79th streets she said mr midali had chosen the site because the shops on madison cater to a more sophisticated woman , and he felt fifth avenue was more for tourists bally , along with the leather store goldpfeil and the highsociety restaurant la cote basque , is being displaced by the disney studio store , which is to open in 1996 la cote basque closed last month after 36 years on east 55th street and plans to reopen later this year in a smaller space on west 55th street although figures were not disclosed , the walt disney company is said to be paying a much higher rent for the site
contradicting testimony by the government s chief informer , a supporter of sheik omar abdel rahman testified yesterday that the militant muslim cleric had not urged the informer to murder president hosni mubarak of egypt mr abdel rahman is on trial in federal district court in manhattan on charges that he led a terrorist conspiracy that included soliciting various people to assassinate the egyptian leader the informer , emad salem , testified earlier in the sevenmonthold trial that mr abdel rahman , during a 13hour drive from new jersey to detroit in 1991 , urged him to kill mr mubarak but yesterday s witness , adam hisham hamawy , said that he had sat immediately behind mr abdel rahman and the informer in the small van and had not heard the cleric make any such statement during the long ride in fact , mr hamawy , 26 , a student at the new jersey school of medicine in newark , said he did not recall hearing mr abdel rahman and mr salem discussing president mubarak at all during the drive did you ever hear sheik omar say to emad salem to turn his gun on mubarak \? mr abdel rahman s lawyer , lynne f stewart , asked mr hamawy no , mr hamawy relied mr hamawy s testimony was part of the defense effort to counter one of the main thrusts of the prosecution s case against mr abdel rahman , a blind , fiery fundamentalist cleric who arrived in the united states from egypt five years ago and settled in jersey city from his base there , he continued exhorting his followers in egypt to overthrow the mubarak government because of its secular outlook and strong ties to the united states the defense says that the sheik s efforts against the egyptian government have been in the great tradition of refugees from oppression abroad who have exercised their freespeech rights to agitate for change in their homelands but the prosecution says that mr abdel rahman crossed the line into criminality by conspiring from 1991 until his arrest in 1993 to assassinate mr mubarak , and that this conspiracy began with his urging , during the car ride to detroit , that mr salem kill mr mubarak mr salem , a former egyptian military officer who arrived in the united states in 1987 , had infiltrated mr abdel rahman s circle for the federal bureau of investigation shortly before the trip , which , mr hamawy testified , was made to attend a conference on islamic economic issues mr abdel rahman is on trial with 10 other muslim men none of the others is charged with taking part in the purported conspiracy to assassinate mr mubarak rather , they are charged , along with the cleric , with plotting in 1993 to blow up major buildings and transportation links in the new york , including the united nations headquarters and the lincoln and holland tunnels while they are not accused of carrying out the 1993 bombing of the world trade center in which six people died and for which four other men were convicted in an earlier trial the prosecution says that attack was also part of the conspiracy , which it says was motivated by opposition to united states policies in the middle east
washington to leah rabin from hafez alassad , president of syria dear mrs rabin i am writing you to express syria s regret over the murder of your husband , prime minister yitzhak rabin i never met your husband i'm not sure i would have liked him i can never forget that he commanded the israeli army that seized our golan heights in 1967 but i must acknowledge that he was the first israeli prime minister who was ready to seriously test the proposition that israel could have a full peace with syria based on the principle of full withdrawal from the golan heights , in accordance with un resolutions 242 and 338 your husband s untimely death is a loss to all who are committed to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in this region sincerely , hafez alassad that was the letter hafez alassad never wrote instead , syria s government issued a cold statement about how mr rabin s death should be used as an opportunity to push the peace process forward an opportunity \? that reminds me of the real estate agent who comes to your house after your father dies and tells you this is a great opportunity to sell your home thanks a lot by failing to evince even the simplest human gesture in the wake of mr rabin s murder , mr assad not only missed a great opportunity to impress israelis about his own commitment to peace , but actually set himself back given the way king hussein , hosni mubarak and yasir arafat each personally paid their condolences to mrs rabin and the israeli people , syria s inability to express one iota of regret over the death of an israeli leader ready to trade most of the golan for peace with syria left many israelis more skeptical than ever of mr assad imagine the positive impact on israelis if mr assad had just come to the rabin funeral and not said a word i guess it should n't be surprising , though , that a syrian leader who killed 20 , 000 of his own people in the syrian town of hama in 1982 could n't summon the humanity to mourn an israeli foeturnedpeacemaker child beaters do n't make good baby sitters it is probably unrealistic to ask mr assad to be something to israel that he is n't to his own people compassionate he lives in a brutal world where compassion is weakness and weakness is death no , mr assad wants his own kind of peace with israel different from the peace israel has struck with egypt , jordan and the palestinians he wants a peace based purely on realpolitik , cold strategic calculations none of this loveydovey stuff ok hafez , if that s the peace you want , then let me explain to you a few facts of life without the soviet union to back your army , syria today is a thirdrate military power it would be crushed by israel in any war syria has a fourthrate economy , where electricity still has to be rationed syria s gdp is oneeighth the size of israel s , even though your population is three times that of israel in other words , hafez , in the cold realpolitik terms in which you measure the world , there is very little reason for israelis to take any risks for peace with syria particularly the risk of giving up strategic high ground like the golan heights you ca n't threaten israel militarily , diplomatically or economically now what mr rabin represented , and what shimon peres represents , is a vision of reconciliation that goes beyond realpolitik a vision that says peace should be based on real interaction between two peoples , in commerce , in diplomacy , in tourism , because only such a palpable peace would demonstrate a change in syrian intentions that could persuade enough israelis to give up the golan but it is precisely that sort of human peace that you have shunned hafez , you ca n't get the benefits of a warm peace for the price of a cold one and do n't think the occasional encouraging hints you drop with the americans , or in your local press , are any substitute you are making peace with israel , not america the only way israeli withdrawal from the golan heights makes any sense to israelis is if it is the culmination of a process of total reconciliation with syria if it s just the culmination of a cold peace , well , they have a cold peace with you right now and the golan heights to boot think about that , hafez in the meantime , you can still write to leah rabin c o prime minister s office , kiryat hamemshalah , jerusalem , israel 91131
okemah , okla , april 29 imagine looking like john doe no 2 , the elusive confederate of timothy j mcveigh , the suspect in the oklahoma bombing by today the federal bureau of investigation had received more than 10 , 000 calls from people offering clues and had interviewed more than a dozen men resembling the sketch of the darkhaired , squarejawed , tattooed man the fbi calls john doe no 2 and while agents have not yet found their man , the hunt has sent jolts ranging from annoying inconvenience to harassment to the loss of a job into the lives of men whose only bond is a resemblance , whether real or imagined , to the fbi sketch perhaps the most traumatized of this brotherhood of the misidentified has been ray jimboy , a 30yearold fry cook from this dusty speck of a town 69 miles east of oklahoma city that was the birthplace of the folk singer woody guthrie mr jimboy suffered a double stigma he not only resembled john doe no 2 , but had also known mr mcveigh in the army so , when the investigation rumbled into okemah , it certainly seemed as if something promising awaited a focus of the manhunt has been members of mr mcveigh s army regiment at fort riley , kan among other things , the fbi has inspected photographs of men who served in that unit investigators were indeed interested when a unit picture of mr jimboy bore a striking resemblance to the sketch thus it was that a week ago friday , mr jimboy was cooking food at the k bar truckstop in okemah he had left his previous job only a week before at the black goat cafe for better pay at the k bar around 9 in the evening , when orders were coming in steadily , he said , his boss tapped him on the shoulder and said she needed him to come to the office to fill out a tax form when he got there , two darksuited fbi agents were waiting the agents spent hours grilling him , checking him for tattoos \( he has none \) and snapping pictures ultimately , two fellow agents ushered him to oklahoma city at 4 am for a polygraph test he does have a square jaw and dark hair like the man in the sketch , but his hair is parted on the side and flops down over his left eye john doe no 2 has his hair brushed straight back the fbi determined that mr jimboy was working the day that the ryder truck that bore the bomb was rented in junction city , kan mr jimboy said the agents told him he had passed the polygraph test they dropped him off at his home about 9 am 12 hours and no sleep later and thanked him for his cooperation when mr jimboy reported to work at the k bar the next day , he was greeted with the news that someone had been hired to replace him sondra smock , the manager of the truck stop , said in an interview that mr jimboy just had not worked out and she did not know anything about the fbi now mr jimboy is walking the streets of okemah looking for another kitchen to work in i'm pretty mad , he said this is a small town , and things are a little tight i ca n't find anything other john doe no 2 lookalikes have not suffered such indignities but , these days , it is not a good face to have late last night , the police in santa monica , calif , said the fbi was questioning a 24yearold oklahoma man who had been held on suspicion of auto theft he , too , closely resembled the suspect , and had a tattoo of the right kind in the right place on the upper arm but they also said that he had longer hair , was thinner and had tattoos all over his body eventually , the fbi said he was not their man on monday alone , three men were questioned , including 32yearold scott sweely of del city , okla , who had the bad fortune to be driving his 1973 bmw through georgia with oklahoma license plates he was pulled over by a sheriff s deputy who ordered him to crawl out through his driver s side window and lie face down on the roadside , where he was handcuffed and taken back to headquarters in valdosta , ga , for questioning it seems that several motorists had spied mr sweely s oklahoma plates and alerted the police , who in turn notified the fbi in atlanta by the time he was stopped , police departments all over georgia had been alerted to his presence only after four hours of questioning by the fbi was mr sweely allowed back on the road to florida he was real cooperative , sheriff ashley paulk said of mr sweely i 've seen people with a traffic ticket that had a worse attitude last sunday , the adrenalin of agents started pumping when an army deserter from fort riley named david iniguez was picked up in san bernardino , calif he looked vaguely like the sketch when he was marched into court in los angeles on unrelated charges , his arms were handcuffed behind his back and he was engulfed by a halfdozen fbi agents everyone calmed down when he turned out to be suspected only of being

hollywood , april 30 it has been more than 35 years since janet leigh saw herself on the screen in alfred hitchcock s classic horror film psycho after viewing the famous shower scene , in which she was repeatedly stabbed , ms leigh was seized with an overwhelming and lasting terror i stopped taking showers and i take baths , only baths , she said in fact , when the former movie star stays overnight in a hotel or at a friend s home where only a shower is available , she panics i make sure the doors and windows of the house are locked , she said , and i leave the bathroom door open and shower curtain open i'm always facing the door , watching , no matter where the shower head is the film s impact on ms leigh may seem extreme , but it s understandable and , she says , she s not alone psycho stands as one of the darkest movies ever made , one that revised the standards for horror and suspense films and ms leigh says it left an imprint on tony perkins , the star , and on a number of others connected with it as well , even hitchcock himself the 67yearold ms leigh , a top star of the 1950 s and 60 s , offers a revealing look into the film in a new book , psycho behind the scenes of the classic thriller , to be published this month by harmony books , a division of crown her coauthor is christopher nickens the actress began her career in 1946 and semiretired in 1984 after more than 50 films , including the manchurian candidate , touch of evil and my sister eileen , and 30 television movies she has spent the last decade writing her biography , there really was a hollywood , was published a decade ago , and a novel , house of destiny , partly about the movie business , will be released in the fall by harlequin press but psycho , with hitchcock s bag of nervejangling cinematic tricks and the screeching score by bernard herrmann , is what she is remembered for in the film , she played marion crane , a troubled woman seeking to break off an affair with sam loomis \( john gavin \) one day her employer asks her to deposit 40 , 000 in the bank on her way home viewing the money as her ticket to freedom , she embarks on a trip to see sam a torrential storm causes her to miss the main highway , and she stops at a lonely motel run by norman bates \( perkins \) , who befriends her norman tells her he lives with his powerful , unbalanced mother realizing that she is as trapped as he is , marion resolves to return home the next morning and face the consequences but that s tomorrow tonight , she 'll take a shower psycho consumed ms leigh for years a casual meeting with some publishing friends in new york last year , when ms leigh mentioned the mail she still receives about the film from viewers who have seen it on cable or home video , led her to do the book seated in her beverly hills home , the actress said that while there have been numerous books about hitchcock , including explorations of psycho , none have been written by an insider who was actually present at the creation of the film i 've been in a great many films , but i suppose if an actor can be remembered for one role then they 're very fortunate , she said and in that sense i'm fortunate the film had a negative , perhaps even destructive , impact on the career of perkins the actor , who died two years ago , felt that the shadow of norman bates dominated his life , ms leigh said she interviewed perkins s widow , berry berenson , his sons and his friends tony was definitely the consummate actor , she said he could do anything but very often the industry will get a fixation on an image of someone and they ca n't lose it while sympathetic to perkins s plight , ms leigh pointed out that the actor himself probably contributed to his difficulties after psycho he went to europe for several years and starred in films with ingrid bergman , sophia loren , jeanne moreau and others but he later returned to the united states and starred in three psycho sequels by then mr perkins was totally identified with norman bates as for hitchcock , ms leigh believes that the director sensed somehow that he would never top psycho although he later made such popular films as the birds and marnie , she said , unconsciously he knew he could never do it again although there have been accounts of the director s personal and sometimes harmful obsession with some of his glacially beautiful stars , grace kelly and tippi hedren among them , ms leigh said he never took his relationship with her beyond the most professional level with people like vera miles and tippi hedren , he was going to be their svengali , groom them for stardom , she said as talented as these women were , they were not really established , and initially they were n't married i had made many pictures i was married and we had socialized a bit it was a completely different association i had with him was hitchcock a tortured man \? i ca n't answer that , said ms leigh , who was married to tony curtis when she made psycho they were divorced in 1962 , after 10 years of marriage for the last 32 years she has been married to robert brandt , a stockbroker she has two daughters , the actresses jamie lee curtis and kelly curtis i do n't know what hitchcock s fantasies were , she said i do think he was happy at times he enjoyed his wining and dining he enjoyed his success was he happy \? it s hard to say in an interview with francois truffaut years ago , hitchock said the shower scene the suddenness of the murder served as his principal reason for making psycho , which was adapted by joseph stefano from a novel by robert bloch the shower scene had been technically difficult , she said it took seven days to shoot , but it lasts only about 45 seconds on the screen i wore a moleskin suit and it was very uncomfortable the first time i saw the movie was in a projection room with hitchcock and several others , she recalled i did n't know what to expect , so when i saw it i was stunned with the editing and rhythm and the music it was like you could actually feel the thrusts of the knife like it was going through me it was very , very emotional ms leigh has seen the film at least 15 times and still finds unexpected moments of hitchcock s technical brilliance you notice so many things , seeing it again and again , she said there s a light , almost an ethereal light , a heavenly light on marion it was like she was being purified cleansed the water it was like she was being baptized she was cleaning not only her body but also the inner dirt and this made the attack even more horrible asked if doing the book has somehow eased her fear of showers , ms leigh laughed i have absolutely no intention of stepping into a shower , she said photo janet leigh , actress and writer , outside her beverly hills , calif , home \( steve goldstein for the new york times \)
los angeles , sept 24 network television has discovered generation x every other new series this season , from dweebs to too something to almost perfect to central park west , seems to be about lovable , and or achingly vulnerable , young urban professionals they laugh they cry they live they love and not a single one has seen his 34th birthday behind all this , of course , is the huge success of nbc s recent spate of youngadultoriented programs , like seinfeld , friends , mad about you and hope and gloria contributing greatly to the network s stranglehold on the 18 to 34yearold audience the viewers most sought after by advertisers is a revamping last year that placed unprecedented creative power in the hands of three programmers young enough to be right at home on the set of one of their sitcom hits they are 31yearold jamie mcdermott , and david nevins and karey burke , both 29 each of them is , in effect , running a mininetwork of his or her own while all the networks' entertainment divisions teem with executives in their 20 s and early 30 s , most of them have relatively limited areas of responsibility because of a welldefined line between development , the process by which a show gets on the air , and current programming , the effort to keep it there last year , donald ohlmeyer , nbc west coast president , and warren littlefield , nbc entertainment president , decided to erase that distinction at their network and created instead autonomous inhouse teams , each responsible for taking a series from pitch meeting to pilot to premiere to whatever each team was placed under the direction of newly appointed team leaders the first two team leaders were ms mcdermott , who shepherded friends , news radio and hope and gloria onto last season s schedule , and mr nevins , whose responsibilities included er , homicide and the revamped drama sea quest , as well as the development of current entries like jag , the pursuit of happiness , minor adjustments and brotherly love at the end of last season , ms mcdermott considered by many to be the fastestrising network executive in hollywood was promoted to the newly created position of overseeing and coordinating the two teams her subordinate , ms burke , took her old post a third team , comprising executives from nbc s inhouse production company , will also be reporting to ms mcdermott \( two other teams are in charge of movies and miniseries and latenight programming \) the 43yearold mr littlefield was asked about the youth of his programming aides they 're the right age , he responded abruptly mr littlefield was perhaps a bit reluctant to alienate older viewers and advertisers by overemphasizing his programmers' youth he quickly added that nbc was interested in appealing to all segments of the population nevertheless , the network leads all three networks by a wide margin in ratings among relatively young adults with household incomes of more than 60 , 000 , a segment that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach ms mcdermott was similarly circumspect no , i do n't think i'm part of any organized effort to appeal to people in generation x a term i really dislike , by the way , she said ms mcdermott , whose father is jay tarses , one of the most gifted writerproducers in television , added i think in a weird sort of way i just got really lucky i think that my sensibilities happened to coincide with what people wanted to see not since 1980 , when the 30yearold brandon tartikoff went to work for fred silverman , the former entertainment chief at nbc , have so many crucial decisions been entrusted to so many so soon do i feel too young for this job \? asked ms burke , a petite , attractively thin woman with reddishblonde hair not any more raised in the affluent orange county community of laguna beach , calif , ms burke joined nbc in 1988 after graduating from ucla she hopscotched between the current programming and the development departments , working on series like la law and quantum leap her current preoccupations are raising caines and third rock from the sun , two midseason replacement comedies david nevins has had a slightly different ascent a tall , thin , somewhat seriouslooking man , he was raised in washington and bethesda , md , and graduated from amherst college with a liberal arts degree i came out of school with vague , naive notions about being in the entertainment business , said mr nevins , sitting in his starkly furnished nbc office he moved to los angeles in 1988 in the middle of a writers' strike and wound up in the offices of the hitchhiker , a quirky cable series that appeared on hbo and the usa network i came in for an interview and the executive producer said , 'do you have a job \? ' mr nevins recalled i said , 'no , that s why i'm here to see you' he said , 'ok , just sit at that desk , and you can tell people you work here' there was no mention of a salary for quite some time , mr nevins also recalled , but he worked his way up from photocopying to script reading to story editing to negotiating appearance fees with prospective guest stars he also wrote and sold a script for the series i felt very lucky , he said soon after , he donned a suit and began his career climb at nbc of his current responsibilities , mr nevins said i both respond and initiate but i try to do more initiating than responding i try to put things together with the writers and actors i want to be in business with as for ms mcdermott , she had an interesting upbringing in the household of mr tarses , a man whose fierce battles with network executives are almost as well remembered as his series , which include buffalo bill and the days and nights of molly dodd at nbc and the slap maxwell story on abc i think that in a way he sort of created my situation , ms mcdermott said because as much as the business frustrates my father , he loves it our dinner table conversations were spent talking about what he did and what it was like we analyzed books and movies and we all read all of his scripts and we talked about them after ms mcdermott graduated from williams college with a degree in theater , mr tartikoff , an old family friend , hired her as an entrylevel nbc staffer ms mcdermott , who is married to dan mcdermott , the head of television at dreamworks skg , the new studio set up by steven spielberg , jeffrey katzenberg and david geffen , rocketed up the nbc ladder , propelled by her involvement with hit shows like frasier , mad about you , wings and the fresh prince of bel air last year , she helped create the network s most talkedabout comedy , a show about six congenial young new yorkers though friends did not do terribly well when initially shown to test audiences none of the characters really popped out , she said ms mcdermott became the show s champion and eventually saw it become a defining show for her generation or , at least for her career we were n't saying , you know , 'we want to become the voice of our generation , ' she said it was just a conscious effort to identify and speak to people who were n't necessarily being spoken to on television and as luck would have it , that s the desirable demographic photos the cast of minor adjustments , a new show that is the responsibility of 29yearold david nevins jamie mcdermott , 31 , shepherded three shows last season
what s going on down there \? a pedestrian asked the other day , seeing extra security measures outside the united states courthouse in lower manhattan the pedestrian was one of the many going about their business who did not know that the biggest terror conspiracy case ever to come to trial in an american courtroom was taking place on the third floor of the big building with columns fronting on foley square imagine a similar pedestrian walking past the criminal courthouse in los angeles is it possible that he would be unaware that the trial of o j simpson was taking place inside \? at first blush , it seems obvious why the terror conspiracy case in new york would be generating a fraction of the excitement of the doublemurder case in los angeles , with its frequent scrutiny on nightline , larry king live and good morning , america its daily broadcasts on cnn and courttv , and the regular updates on the nightly news , not to mention the sensational weekly disclosures in the supermarket tabloids and the parades of highly serious professors of law from major universities who elucidate the meaning of each day s courtroom action as if they were super bowl plays the simpson case has a celebrity implicated in a sordid story of sexual obsession and violence that is a hard combination to beat and yet , the terror conspiracy case in new york does have some elements of drama it concerns 12 men , including sheik omar abdel rahman , a rather mysterious egyptian clergyman , who , prosecutors say , planned nothing less than a war of urban terrorism against the united states by following a battle plan that was so horrible , so monstrous , so vicious that if it had been successful the lives of every person in this city and in this nation would be changed forever a war of urban terror \? something horrible , monstrous , vicious \? in a different day and age , it is possible that this case , with its suggestions of an islamic extremist threat , of foreign connections , of bombs and mayhem against ordinary americans , would be deemed of greater national import than the los angeles matter why does the reverse seem to be true today \? the simplest explanation is that mr simpson is a celebrity , and in a mass democratic culture that is transfixed by celebrity , he will inevitably draw a disproportionate amount of attention other factors are commonly cited as well there are television cameras in the los angeles courtroom , for example , but none in new york , where the only visual images come from courtroom sketches and the camera , as the conservative commentator irving kristol once noted , is by nature a sensationalizing instrument and there is the vagueness of a conspiracy trial , in which defendants can be found guilty merely for agreeing to commit a crime , even if they did not actually commit it according to lawenforcement officials , in the new york case , the war of urban terror was terminated before any of its main targets were hit by contrast , there was a double murder in los angeles , two bloodied corpses , one of them that of a beautiful woman all the elements of a novel of sex and violence , lust and betrayal are present in the simpson case , along with the inherent fascination of a good whodunit but there has to be more imagine that it is 1950 , the height of the cold war , and a group of russian immigrants is put on trial on charges of plotting to blow up the united nations and the george washington bridge the nation would be in a tumult , transfixed every minute would be assiduously followed , just as every twist and turn of the alger hiss case or of the trial of julius and ethel rosenberg were followed a halfcentury ago the comparative indifference today seems to indicate that , despite the prosecution s dramatic language , the public does not really feel threatened by the presence of a hostile ideology , as it did by communism in the more intense days of the cold war true , the explosion at the world trade center in 1993 shocked many americans and made many feel vulnerable but the feeling of vulnerability proved evanescent , in part because the terrorist punch at the trade center was not followed by a second terrorist punch somewhere else in the united states so it is that americans feel pretty safe today moreover , even though mr abdel rahman is , in many ways , a compelling figure , with connections to islamic fundamentalists abroad , he is blind and diabetic and has heart disease some people may find it difficult to picture him as a major threat to the national interest the simpson case clearly touches a deeper american nerve indeed , it contains so many of the elements that make the united states special the story of a young black man of modest origins who overcame the obstacle of discrimination and , because of exceptional talent , achieved almost unimaginable fame and fortune , and who then suffered a tragic , public fall , is the stuff of great american novels the lesson seems to be that lawyers who yearn for a highprofile case should concentrate on the nexus of sex , violence , wealth and race it will galvanize public interest far more than some question of the national interest and public safety photo drawing television cameras in the courtroom are helping to bring national attention to o j simpson s murder trial in los angeles , above , where on jan 31 , mr simpson s lawyers conferred with judge lance a ito instead of cameras , the manhattan courtroom where the terror conspiracy case is on trial has sketch artists lynne stewart , right , a defense lawyer , is shown as she gave her opening statement on jan 30 \( pool photo by david sprague drawing for the associated press by shirley shepard \)
my five cambridge friends burgess , maclean , philby , blunt , and cairncross by their kgb controller by yuri modin with jeancharles deniau and aguieszka ziarek translated by anthony roberts illustrated 282 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 23 the philby files the secret life of master spy kim philby by genrikh borovik edited by phillip knightley 382 pp boston little , brown company 2495 tattered books with broken spines and worn jackets plastic globes , yellowed letters and a red throw rug set neatly on a dais , they looked like donations to a sunday neighborhood antiques fair but to the enthusiastic crowd of bidders and lookers that packed sotheby s weathered but elegant london auction house last july , the value of the items lay far less in their surface beauty than in the mystery and intrigue surrounding them except for boxes of oncesecret intelligence reports buried in a moscow vault , they were the last surviving artifacts of the most infamous spy of modern times harold \( kim \) philby since the 1950 s the west has had larger espionage rings and more damaging spies , but none have come as close to capturing the public s imagination as have kim philby and his four cambridge coplotters over the last four decades literary interest in the ring has generated nearly enough books to start a small library but in terms of detail and insight , it may be hard to top the two most recent accounts in my five cambridge friends , yuri modin tells the familiar tale of the philby circle but with a difference mr modin was the russian intelligence officer who actually ran the men during their most critical years and later spent time with those who defected to moscow for the first time , the reader gets to view the ring through the eyes of someone on the other side of the cloak and camera raised in a cold village on the prisoners' highway to siberia , mr modin made his way to the leningrad naval academy only to be drafted into the army as the germans laid siege to stalingrad during world war ii to avoid going to the front , he joined military intelligence later , because he spoke fluent english learned from his mother , who had studied it in school he was assigned to kgb headquarters in moscow , where he translated spy reports received on microfilm from traitors in england promoted to analyst , mr modin ultimately took charge of all the reports coming from the ring , and was finally sent to london in 1948 to run the cambridge spies kim philby , the charming leader who recruited the others and would become britain s top intelligence liaison with the central intelligence agency in washington guy burgess , brilliant , willing to die for the cause but also dangerous because of his fondness for drink and homosexual affairs , who would become first secretary at the british embassy in washington donald maclean , an outstanding diplomat and dedicated communist who became head of the american section at the foreign office anthony blunt , friend of the royal family and eventually the queen s art expert , who served first as a spy and then as the courier and middleman for the group and john cairncross , a treasury official with access to atomic secrets , who was the first to inform moscow that the united states and britain had been working on an atomic bomb since 1940 \( mr cairncross , the only one of the group who is still alive , is living in france \) although the same characters are present in the philby files , and the two books somewhat complement each other , genrikh borovik s emphasis is primarily on philby and there is another big difference a russian writer and television personality , mr borovik not only got access to philby in the three years before his death at the age of 76 in 1988 , but also persuaded the kgb to unlock its files on the cambridge ring for him thus , mr borovik with editing help from the british intelligence writer phillip knightley expertly weaves commentary together with actual text from internal kgb records on the ring , messages from philby to moscow , extensive interviews from 300 hours of taperecorded sessions with philby among the secrets held by the dusty documents was the fact that for many years the kgb itself never trusted philby , constantly suspecting him of being a triple agent and demanding , over and over , that he write out long , detailed biographies of himself taken together , the two books offer a rare inside look at the spy scandal through the eyes of its beneficiaries rather than its victims one nation s traitor suddenly becomes another nation s hero the emphasis is no longer on how many western lives philby might have sacrificed but on how many russians he might have saved the two books go to considerable length exploring the antifascist reasons that led the cambridge students to switch their loyalties to moscow they had visions of the great communist revolution , a revolution that barely outlived philby himself nevertheless , it is somewhat refreshing to revisit a time when spies offered their souls for noble , if flawed , beliefs rather than for the price of a new jaguar
mexico city , jan 9 in a daunting new turn in the traffic of colombian cocaine into the united states , smugglers are buying old passenger jets , taking out the seats and using the planes to fly huge amounts of the drug into mexico , american and mexican officials say traveling at night with their lights off , the boeing 727 s and frenchmade caravelle jets are believed to be carrying as much as six tons or more of cocaine on a single flight the cocaine is then transported overland into the united states , where the wholesale value of such a load is about 120 million this is creating new economies of scale , said a senior american official , who , like others , discussed the development on condition he not be identified they are able to bring tremendously large amounts of cocaine in on a single aircraft although the traffickers have occasionally used 727type aircraft of their own or smuggled their cargoes on passenger airlines in the past , drugenforcement officials say a more ominous pattern has developed over the last eight months in that time , six such planes are confirmed to have landed in mexico with big loads of cocaine bound for the united states but drugcontrol radar and intelligence reports suggest that many others may have landed , unloaded and escaped back to colombia , officials said before the planes set out , false identification numbers are often painted or pasted over the old ones the radar transponders that allow them to be tracked easily by airtraffic controllers are shut off whatever their flight plans , they file none the jets fly much faster than most of mexico s druginterdiction aircraft , mainly smaller cessnas , and are inexpensive enough , in a market glutted with newer planes , for the traffickers to abandon them on a remote airstrip if they need to officials say that even when they are detected by the radar surveillance planes that the united states regularly flies over the caribbean , the flights are difficult to catch there is no clear evidence that the traffickers' use of jets has yet had any significant effect on the amount of cocaine smuggled into the united states but even so , the advent of the jets has raised new tensions between the united states and the governments of colombia and mexico , american officials and foreign diplomats say american officials say the flights could not possibly take off from airports in colombia and on the colombian island of san andres , in the caribbean about 110 miles east of the nicaragua , without the assent or aid of the local authorities but the officials say their protests have been all but ignored by the government of president ernesto samper san andres is completely in the hands of the traffickers , a senior american official said and the colombian government is doing zero about it the landings in mexico have heightened american suspicions about collusion with the traffickers by mexican aviation officials and a fastgrowing mexican airline with ties to one of the most prominent oldline politicians in the governing party american officials say they take for granted the traffickers' corruption of police forces in mexico , through which about twothirds of all colombian cocaine is believed to enter the united states mexican lawenforcement officials respond that they are just as concerned about the flights as their american counterparts but have limited resources to stop them despite greater controls on airports and the sale of aircraft fuel and new efforts by the military to shut down clandestine airstrips , mexico seized only about 183 tons of cocaine in the first eight months of last year , down from 462 tons in 1993 some american officials have suggested that the mexican air force might use its f5 fighter planes to pursue the jets but a mexican official , noting the government s longstanding concerns about the potential for corruption in the armed forces if they are given druginterdiction duties , said that the military would absolutely not be used after years in which smugglers flew tons of drugs into northern mexico and directly into the southwestern united states in small planes , the drug enforcement administration began building an elaborate curtain of radar and aircraft to keep them out although the barricade proved notoriously porous , it eventually forced the traffickers to land their planes deeper in mexico over the last two years , after the dea s socalled northern border response force grew more effective in its coverage of the mexican mainland in coordination with the mexican attorney general s office , the traffickers took to flying and airdropping cocaine into southern mexico from guatemala and el salvador the loads are usually then transported to the united states border in cars and trucks mexican and american lawenforcement officials say they are also seeing a worrisome rise in cocaine smuggling on big container ships mexican officials said the attorney general s office was planning to open new offices in the ports of veracruz , acapulco and ensenada in order to check the ships more closely
washington , may 7 as president clinton prepared for summit talks with president boris n yeltsin , republican leaders warned today of catastrophic consequences for united states aid to russia if moscow goes ahead with plans to sell nuclear technology to iran house speaker newt gingrich said russia s insistence on selling iran lightwater nuclear reactors and equipment useful in making bombgrade material threatened to jeopardize relations between moscow and washington unless the russians are prepared to accept very , very severe safeguards to insure that it s only a reactor for power purposes , that none of the raw material can be used to make a bomb , that there s very careful records kept and very careful inspections , i think that this is a very serious problem , mr gingrich said on the nbc news program meet the press i'm not prepared to say today what we would do , but i think it would have catastrophic consequences in the congress senator bob dole of kansas , the majority leader , left no doubt that the senate would swiftly reexamine american aid to moscow if president clinton failed to win assurances from mr yeltsin that the deal would be canceled or modified it would be almost immediate , mr dole said on the cbs news program face the nation congress is a little leery of aid right now in any event , and with chechnya and other problems that russia s had , mr dole added without moscow s acquiescence , mr dole said , it s going to really cool relations with yeltsin , with the russian republic the comments from the two senior republicans came on the eve of mr clinton s departure for moscow , where he is to join more than 50 other world leaders on tuesday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the allies' victory over nazi germany he is to meet with mr yeltsin on wednesday to discuss the iranian deal and chechnya , as well as russia s concerns over plans to expand nato in recent days the administration has expressed serious concerns over russia s nuclear deal with teheran , and made it a top priority in this week s talks if this sale does go forward , russian national security can only be weakened in the long term , mr clinton said tonight in remarks to the american israel public affairs committee russian officials say there is no reason to object to the agreement because iran has signed the treaty to prevent the spread of atomic weapons and permits international inspectors to examine its nuclear installations in his remarks , mr clinton said disputes over iran s nuclear program and russia s fighting in the breakaway region of chechnya were disagreements that must be handled openly , constructively and resolutely i believe russia has a powerful interest in preventing a neighbor especially one with iran s track record from possessing these weapons , mr clinton said but the administration has shied away from threatening to cut off foreign aid indeed , in his remarks , president clinton pledged to nurture ties with moscow despite the agreement with iran crises come and go , he said but interests endure we must not hold our relationship hostage to any one issue , he said on saturday , secretary of state warren christopher suggested that russian aid was imperative , regardless of what moscow does on the irannuclear issue every bit of aid we give them is in our interest , mr christopher told cnn
nearly seven weeks after the mexican peso began its sharp slide , mutual and pension funds , as opposed to commercial and investment banks , appear to be the biggest losers among american investors but economists and analysts warn that the pain could spread if mexico s financial markets decline further the rescue plan announced last week by president clinton caused mexican stocks to rebound from their lows by more than 10 percent in a single day , but that gain only erased a small part of the losses suffered by investors who held mexican stocks and bonds when the peso was first devalued on dec 20 since then , the average total return of 16 latin american mutual funds , with assets of 33 billion , declined by 267 percent , according to morningstar inc pension funds , which generally publish their results quarterly , presumably took similar hits the market has n't come close to recouping what it lost , and frankly it wo n't for a while , said michael pettis , managing director of the weston group , a new york investment bank that specializes in emerging markets indeed , after the initial flush of enthusiasm that greeted the announcement of the rescue plan last week , the mexican stock market has declined 65 percent but the peso has rebounded 9 percent by forestalling the possibility of a complete collapse of mexico s financial markets , president clinton s plan directly aided some holders of mexican bonds and indirectly aided longterm investors , commercial banks and wall street investment banks the most immediate beneficiaries of the plan are holders of socalled tesobonos , the shortterm mexican peso bonds that are pegged to the value of the dollar it was the fear of a mexican default on those bonds , which ballooned from 2 billion to 28 billion outstanding in 1994 , that forced president clinton to act the holders of the tesobonos are spread among a wide range of investors of the 28 billion outstanding , 11 billion are held by mexican investors , mostly banks , according to mexico s finance minister , guillermo ortiz japanese investors are said to hold about 1 billion of the bonds the bulk of those remaining are held by american institutional investors , which used the tesobonos as a way to hold a part of their latin american portfolios in cash without incurring a significant currency risk commercial banks have a total of 542 billion in loans to latin american countries , including 173 billion to mexico , according to the federal reserve a collapse in mexico would have set off a cash crisis that would have imperiled many of those loans as it is , most economists are still predicting a recession for mexico as a result of the crisis but if the clinton plan is successful , it will be a much less severe economic downturn than it might have been , increasing the chances that those loans will be repaid for investment banks , the plan strongly improves the chances that mexican stocks will recover in the near future , allowing the recent boom in underwriting and trading emergingmarket securities to resume before the crisis , emerging markets had been one of the fastestgrowing specialties among investment bankers at merrill lynch company , goldman , sachs company and salomon brothers in the last two years , american investment banks underwrote nearly 10 billion of latin american stocks and bonds in the united states , according to the securities data corporation now the pace of that underwriting is likely to decline greatly , eliminating what had been a growing source of revenue for the investment banks the sooner mexico bounces back , the sooner revenue levels could rebound unlike mutual and pension funds , the commercial and investment banks appear to have escaped large trading losses when the peso plunged chemical bank said a foreignexchange trader had lost 70 million as a result of unauthorized trading of the peso but few other banks appear to have been hurt in as striking a fashion salomon brothers , which announced its fourthquarter results last week , went out of its way to say that it had made a profit in january , in part to allay fears that it had incurred heavy losses as a result of the peso crisis this is not like black monday , where you can expect everyone on the street to get really whacked , said peter marber , managing director of the emerging markets group at wasserstein perella company , referring to the stock market crash on oct 19 , 1987 the amount of exposure to these markets varies greatly from shop to shop many professional investors had already reduced their presence in mexico by the time the peso started to slide rising interest rates in the united states , a series of political assassinations and an uprising in southern mexico prompted many foreign investors to sell their mexican investments throughout the year many economists even predicted a devaluation of the peso , though none saw a decline against the dollar as large as 40 percent yet despite those danger signals , american mutual and pension funds remained dangerously overexposed , as investors hoped to match the high returns mexico provided in 1993 as of friday , fidelity investments' 616 million latin america fund was down 282 percent from dec 19 , according to morningstar dean witter s 347 million tcw dw latin american growth fund was down 251 percent in the same period , according to morningstar as a result of the debacle and the poor bond market last year , fidelity has shaken up the management of its fixedincome funds and its main latin american fund manager resigned to join another firm in addition , dean witter changed the management of its latin fund investors simply did not understand the risks of investing in emerging markets , said nariman behravesh , chief international economist at dri mcgraw hill they invested so much that they were forced to sell holdings when the crisis hit rather than stay put until an eventual upturn you have to have a longterm outlook , mr behravesh said if you have a 5 to 10year perspective , mexico is going to give you some nice returns
east rutherford , nj , dec 10 when wide receiver chris calloway looked for the ball , he could n't see it the lights at giants stadium were like a bright sun , shielding the football , making it invisible and when it came out of the air , falling like it was dropped from a plane , he still did not see it calloway simply reached out and grabbed for it and for once , when the giants needed a big play , it did n't slip through their fingers they reached out , grabbed for it and took it calloway s 40yard touchdown catch from dave brown with 1 minute 12 seconds left in the game allowed the giants to edge the redskins , 2013 , before 48 , 247 , the third smallest nonstrike crowd at giants stadium with their second straight victory , the giants improved to 59 and swept the redskins for the third consecutive season dan reeves is now 60 against the redskins since becoming giants coach and brown is 40 against them as the starting quarterback this is one of those games where it just feels good to win , defensive lineman keith hamilton said we know we did n't beat the 49ers but they have beaten the cowboys twice this season and the cowboys blew us out it was just a good win period the play to calloway a post pattern that he and brown had worked on countless times was actually a call made by george henshaw , the offensive coordinator and reeves backed the call it was a good one because it gave brown \( 10 of 12 for 91 yards and one touchdown \) several options and on this play , most of them were open brown could have easily hit mike sherrard for the touchdown that was a change on a day when it seemed no one could get open it had been a miserable offensive performance for the giants up to that point we went for the end zone in that situation with that play , said calloway , who has had 39 consecutive games with a catch no doubt about it it was a doublepost and it s supposed to occupy the safety with one of the patterns mike was also open on that play we worked on it in practice and today we executed it to perfection at the right time dave put the ball right on the spot the giants had just 160 yards of total offense and converted just one of eight third downs while holding the ball for 17 fewer minutes than the redskins maybe it was the weather the windchill was about minus10 degrees but the redskins had 306 yards of total offense they were playing in the cold , too at this point the giants do n't care as a defense you do n't like to be on the field too long , hamilton said , and even though we were today , we were still able to get the job done the redskins have some good players who come up with good plays and that s going to happen , but we bounced back and did the things we needed to do to win the giants almost lost it they had built a 133 lead thanks to brad daluiso field goals from 36 and 42 yards and a spectacular 90yard kickoff return by thomas lewis , who was playing for the injured tyrone wheatley it was a sweet turnaround for lewis , who had muffed a punt \( the ball hit him in his face mask \) that was recovered by washington s james jenkins the giants were able to get four sacks in the first quarter , but none after that the redskins were able to make some halftime adjustments to better protect quarterback heath shuler \( 17 of 32 for 175 yards and one interception \) the redskins got back into the game with a 30yard field goal by eddie murray , his second , and a 1yard touchdown run by terry allen then came calloway s play at that point , most of the giants players thought they had the game won after that touchdown i thought , 'ok , we 'll go out there , shut them down , then i can go home out of this cold , ' linebacker corey miller said but it was n't time to retire to the fireplace just yet after the giants' touchdown , brian mitchell took daluiso s kickoff 53 yards and daluiso grabbed mitchell s face mask as he tried to shove him out of bounds and almost twisted mitchell s head off tack on 15 extra yards so the redskins had the ball at the giants' 23yard line with 1 02 left and as the redskins had climbed back into the game in the second half , the giants defense had begun bickering among itself but thanks to safety vencie glenn , who chided some members of the defense in the huddle for pointing fingers , they were able to pull it together after three straight incompletions , it came to fourth down cornerback thomas randolph , who studies film extensively , saw the formation the redskins were using and thought the chances were that henry ellard was going to get the ball and that he was going to run a post pattern i knew he was their goto guy and they were coming after me , randolph said surprise ellard faked the post and ran an out pattern toward the left sideline randolph went for the fake and was turned around , and ellard was wide open at about the 1yard line he threw it on a line , randolph said of shuler it was a spiral he just threw it kind of late i did n't know i broke it up then i heard the crowd reaction so i knew i broke it up a late throw by shuler and a good athletic play by randolph combined for the breakup that was the best play thomas made all year , miller said the giants have lost a lot of games in the fourth quarter this season for once they won one forgive them if they celebrate extra points the giants came away from this game banged up

tobacco sticks by william elliott hazelgrove 308 pp chicago pantonne press 1895 songs in ordinary time by mary mcgarry morris 740 pp new york viking 2495 why is it that contemporary american fiction has such a profusion of 12yearold narrators walking us through their family chronicles \? one answer has to do with the way children at that age are the eyes and ears of their families the way they enact for us those revelations , inevitably involving some sort of loss of innocence , that we undergo as we instruct ourselves in what has gone what is always going wrong the narratives in both william elliott hazelgrove s tobacco sticks and mary mcgarry morris s songs in ordinary time turn on a plot device that s beginning to seem archetypal the terrifying event witnessed , only half understood and then suppressed by a narrator on the cusp of adulthood the moment seems so psychoanalytically weighted that it s surprising to discover the prototype is at least as old as tom sawyer spying on injun joe , and pops up in works as diverse as harper lee s to kill a mockingbird and faulkner s barn burning we can see why the model is so tempting the process by which the narrator comes to understand the shocking or transgressive event , and then gathers the resolve to speak of it , mimics the reader s progress in working through the text and the narrator s newfound ability to process and transmit such fraught information allows for a neat and \( the author hopes \) seamlessly dramatic way of signaling a coming of age there also often seems present the additional hope that such a model will allow , with one triumphant stroke , an intersection of the personal and political that will give the work importance \( see ! this niggling autobiographical stuff does have larger implications ! \) early on , mr hazelgrove s second novel , tobacco sticks , establishes his intention of setting up parallel tracks for this comingofage story the narrator , 12yearold lee hartwell , like his hometown of richmond , is undergoing a last sleepy summer before tumultuous change it is 1945 and richmond is the sort of place where doors were still left unlocked , where people called each other by their first names and walked between houses , staying for lunch , then dinner , and not going home till the heat of the day had long passed into the night lee s house is a threestory structure with a horseshoe driveway and six white columns across the front porch we get the picture the rock plunking into this still pond is a senatorial campaign , run by lee s father , in which labor , in the form of unions , has its first real chance to upset the established order , which supports the kind of dollaraday exploitation on which the south settled as the next best thing after slavery before events heat up , though , lee witnesses a sinister and mysterious act , on which the entire plot will turn a family servant is framed dad , a lawyer , takes the case , dropping his campaign work because of a conflict of interest and his fears that ethically he s backing the wrong horse he turns out to be standing alone against two of the most powerful men in the state the prosecutor , his old friend big jeb \( as in stuart \) mason , and the region s foremost captain of industry , buddy hillman unsurprisingly , dad s lonely stand turns out to be lee s as well dad , it can already be seen , is a paragon from the lineage of harper lee s atticus finch , a model of sobriety and principle who s always dispensing calming and benevolent wisdom he allows the novel to construct its bridge between moral behavior in lee s realm \( you might consider discussion before you resort to hitting someone next time friendships can only endure so many punches in the stomach \) and in the larger social realm \( people are capable of bad things , but very good things too \) dad represents the new south s repudiation of its past he s given up his family s tobaccogrowing tradition to study law and has been a rocksolid force for good in a community that turns against him as soon as it s given the chance , it being intermittently unworthy of him as in all works in which such figures appear , the rueful and un expressed regret seems to be that these , our natural leaders , will never be given the chance to perform that role , perhaps because they 're too upright to nurse the requisite ambitions our young narrator can track all of this with precision because his father has offered him a dime for every article on the election that he cuts out of the newspaper this status as a clipping service allows lee to slip us the sort of complicated information we would n't expect to be of much interest to a boy his age and later , after dad loses his sight because of a stroke , lee must become the narrator not only for us but for his father as well the novel builds toward an event that s been dramatized before the big southern trial , with bigotry and intolerance on one side and that lonely man of conscience on the other but the bad guys' case is so transparently flimsy and deceitful that there s not a lot of suspense involved in watching it demolished along the way , however , the novel s sensitivity to the peculiarity of its 12yearold point of view does a good deal to salvage the familiarity of its plot smell , for example , is treated with particular absorption a tree house is a sawdustsmelling box lee falls asleep late one night with the cold metal scent of rain in the air

cairo , nov 23 an egyptian military court sentenced 54 militant islamic leaders today to prison terms of up to five years after a mass trial that has been criticized by human rights campaigners around the world those sentenced to jail include prominent doctors , scholars and community leaders who are members of the muslim brotherhood , an organization that has been the target of a harsh government crackdown they were convicted of nonviolent offenses including holding secret meetings and preparing antigovernment leaflets the court also ordered that the cairo headquarters of the muslim brotherhood be closed and its contents seized until this year , the government had paid little heed to the organization , which regularly denounces violence but the arrest and trial of some of its leading figures reflected a decision by president hosni mubarak and his aides to no longer distinguish between the muslim brotherhood and the islamic militants who are battling the state amnesty international this week described the defendants as prisoners of conscience it urged that they be freed and said the egyptian government was wrong to try civilians in a military court a spokesman for the muslim brotherhood , maamoun alhodaiby , denounced the court s ruling as a political decision that comes in contradiction with the law while the sentences handed down today were somewhat lighter than western diplomats had expected , they will deprive the country s most influential network of islamic activists of many top leaders with parliamentary elections to be held here next week , the proceedings have also prevented the defendants from running for office under opposition party banners , a step that critics have said was one of the government s goals of 81 men tried in the case , 5 were sentenced to five years in prison at hard labor , including essam alaryan , the no 2 official in egypt s prestigious medical syndicate , and mohamed habib , a science professor at asyut university another 40 men were sentenced to three years at hard labor and 9 more to three years imprisonment twentyseven were acquitted until the trials began in september , the government had used military courts only to try militants accused of using violence in trying to overthrow the state but after a flurry of arrests of muslim brotherhood leaders , mr mubarak issued decrees referring their cases to the military court , whose decisions cannot be appealed while it has been officially outlawed since 1954 , the muslim brotherhood remains egypt s largest islamic fundamentalist organization it supports political change that would transform egypt into an islamic state , and its members include former members of parliament and leaders of trade unions but in the three years since muslim militants here launched their violent campaign to overthrow the government , the authorities have also come to regard the avowedly peaceful muslim brotherhood as a threat , accusing the organization of inflaming the sentiments that have led to violence some of the organization s members have been accused of giving clandestine support to militants , but none of those convicted today were so charged a leading expert on islamic fundamentalism in egypt , dr saad aldin ibrahim , said he believed that the crackdown would likely suppress the muslim brotherhood s operations but that the organization would not disappear
these are days of dread at the manhattanville bus depot , on west 132d street alongside the henry hudson parkway unless a miracle occurs in the form of federal court intervention , bus and subway fares will go up by a quarter on sunday , to 150 the scores of drivers who report to manhattanville each day and then ride off to navigate the streets of manhattan and the bronx know what that means it means that come sunday , they can expect to be glared at , snarled at , yelled at , cursed at , spit at and , if civility breaks down entirely , even lunged at by passengers who may be perfectly sensible people most days but who feel pushed to the snapping point by the transit system s latest dip into their pockets let s get real , said james williams , a driver for 18 years are new yorkers going to take their protest directly to e virgil conway , chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority , by riding the metronorth on sunday to his home in bronxville , ny \? of course not passengers are going to lash out at the most immediate symbols of their misery tokenbooth clerks and bus drivers and the clerks , lucky them , sit in glassenveloped booths the only thing standing between a driver and a punch is citizen restraint , a quality that some days can be as elusive as a bus at 4 am we 're the ones on the front line , and we 're the ones they 're going to take it out on , mr williams predicted yesterday outside the swing room , a large chamber at the depot where drivers can watch television , shoot pool , play chess or close their eyes between runs that s how it always is , added charles mcbryde , who works the m11 route and is bracing for the worst when the fare went to 125 , i had a knife pulled on me at 106th and manhattan avenue , mr mcbryde recalled the guy tells me , 'i'm not paying , ' and he pulls a knife i asked him to step back then , i saw a cop at the corner and he got the guy off the bus immediately another time , it happened on fifth avenue and 57th street that was when was it \? yeah , when the fare went to 115 same thing guy pulls a knife , and i had to get a cop we 're going to have lots of problems , said dennis johnson , another driver it makes no difference what the raise is a nickel , a dime , whatever it gets people angry and this one s a big one , robert dipenice , an 11year veteran , chipped in part of it s this blue uniform we wear , mr williams said blue means authority you 're in charge out there , and any time they get to throw anything at you , they will it has already started , says fredric rubenstein , a senior official of the transport workers union he reports three assaults on drivers in manhattan two punches and a whack with an umbrella since e virgil conway company approved the fare increase in midoctober \( and then delayed the effective date until nov 12 , soon after election day \) neither the union nor the mta has given the workers a crash course on what to expect starting today but , mr rubenstein said , we do tell our members that anyone who puts his wellbeing on the line for the fare box is in need of psychiatric intervention as much as they dread the nastiness , the drivers at manhattanville understand rider frustration it s a lot worse this year because of the service cuts , mr dipenice said passengers who used to wait 5 to 10 minutes for the bus now are left to stew for 10 to 15 minutes on some routes naturally , they will be seething by the time he pulls up , mr williams said if you 're taking service away from people , how can you justify raising the fare \? he said you means the mta what comes through time and again is a flood of anger against transit bosses , who are blamed for work rules , disciplinary codes and bottomline pettifoggery that the drivers say demeans them by comparison , they add , passenger rage is nothing more than an occasional irritant none of which is to say that drivers themselves are perfect some are surly some seem to have never been taught how to announce approaching stops some whip along the avenues as though they are tank drivers with orders to take no prisoners but they seem as a group more competent and polite than , say , a dozen years ago then , it was almost as though drivers had been told that procedure required them to stop as close to piscataway as possible anywhere but near the bus stop now , most drivers kneel their buses and lower the back door for people in wheelchairs without the grumbling that used to be inevitable good or bad , though , they say that they do not deserve the abuse headed their way nobody s trying to make a big thing out of it , said jerry summers , a bus operator for 22 years but everyone knows that sunday is not the best day to be a driver
colombo , sri lanka for weeks , at hearings in town halls and school auditoriums across this island , bereaved families have been telling their grim stories of groups of men , sometimes women and teenage children , being rounded up by armed men at intervals in the last decade and driven away , never to be seen again some accounts have told of trucks' stopping in remote clearings , of blindfolded captives descending , of bursts of automatic fire , of the last groans of the dying in a score of cases , grieving relatives have described mass graves , usually deep in the forests and jungles since ethnic and political tensions exploded in the 1980 s , life for many sri lankans has been a grim parody of the tropical paradise described by early western travelers to what was then ceylon for more than a decade , this country of 18 million people fell prey to a culture of violence that made government death squads , mass graves and killings of ethnic tamils and sinhalese part of everyday life last fall a new government took office promising to end the nightmare under president chandrika bandaranaike kumaratunga , widowed in a political killing in 1988 , the new administration pledged to return the country to the rule of law and investigate all past abuses , whether committed by the previous government or by militant groups that used terror against it we will dig up every grave , mrs kumaratunga said the promise of an accounting for past abuses was coupled with a pledge by the new government to seek a negotiated end to sri lanka s longrunning war with tamil tiger separatists , which spawned many of the brutalities but events in recent weeks have raised doubts about the government s ability to deliver effectively on the promises , and worse still from the standpoint of many sri lankans , raised the possibility that the brutalities could recur the heaviest blow came with the tamil tigers' recent decision to abrogate the standstill in the war that took hold shortly after mrs kumaratunga took office in august with a speed that has shaken the government , the rebels have struck hard at army and police installations all along the country s north and east coasts , killing nearly more than 350 government fighters in barely a month mrs kumaratunga has said she is ready if necessary to return to allout war but even if peace talks with the tigers resume , the evidence of abuses pouring forth from witnesses all across the country has been on such a scale that few in sri lanka believe that mrs kumaratunga can deliver on her pledge to have a full reckoning in hearings that began in january , each of three judicial inquiries investigating abuses in different regions of the country has been told of more than 10 , 000 cases of disappearances many cases involve more than one person , sometimes as many as 20 or 30 the numbers suggest that amnesty international and other human rights groups may have been close in suggesting that tens of thousands of people as many as 80 , 000 , by some sri lankan estimates have been killed in two separate conflicts one of these has been the continuing separatist insurgency in the north and east by the tamil tiger rebels the other conflict , now ended , was an uprising in the central and southern districts in the late 1980 s by a farleft group , the people s liberation front in appointing the inquiries , the new government hoped , among other things , to ease the bitterness that the war with the tamil tigers has sown in relations between the ethnic sinhalese majority , 75 percent of the island s population , and the ethnic tamils , about 15 percent although many tamils disappeared , the largest number of victims were ethnic sinhalese , victims of either of tamil tiger abductions or of the conflict between the government forces and the people s liberation front because many of those accused in the disappearances are army and police officers who now hold key positions in the war against the tamil tigers , sri lankans have been caught in a debate over how far the investigating should go in the election campaign last fall that ousted the united national party government , in power during the worst abuses , mrs kumaratunga said every killing should be investigated , and those responsible punished the culprits have to be found if possible , and punished , she said but others seem less sure among them is justice minister g l peiris , a constitutional lawyer who used his position as vice chancellor of the university of colombo to speak out forcefully against the abuses when many others remained silent since appointing the inquiry commissions , mr peiris has been cautious the government owes a duty to the parents and kith and kin to help them ascertain the fate of their loved ones , he has said but it is not possible for us to embark on a futile and impossible task of apportioning blame amnesty international , which compiled extensive accounts of the abuses when they were occurring , has urged the government not to follow the examples of argentina and chile , where inquiries into largescale disappearances were followed by amnesties for many of those responsible
the united baseball league plans to begin play in 1996 with one team in the new york area , but at least one more could be in its future plans here , league founders and investors indicated yesterday the league announced the specific sites of four of its franchises washington , new orleans , san juan , pr and vancouver , british columbia and the general areas of two others , greater new york and southern california bob mrazek and richard moss , two of the four cofounders , said in a telephone news conference that the california sites under consideration were the los angeles coliseum and the riversidesan bernardino area they named three locations in the new york area long island , near the border of nassau and suffolk counties brooklyn and northern new jersey we have three different investor groups for each one of the markets , all moving forward with specific plans to try to bring a team to fruition , mrazek , a former congressman from long island , said the issue is complicated because there is no adequate stadium to play major league baseball wherever we go we have to make plans as quickly as possible to construct a firstclass , fanfriendly facility mrazek said the league would not wind up with teams in each location , but he did not reject the idea of two teams it s entirely possible , although i'm not suggesting we believe it s possible to do it in 1996 with two out of those three , mrazek said we are convinced we can do one of the three we expect that our investor groups will join forces behind at least one of those locations he did n't say , but the likelihood is that ultimately one team will play in new jersey and another in brooklyn or long island harry bleiwise , a member of the league s investor committee , heartily endorsed the twoteam concept asked if that would be possible , bleiwise , the founder and president of rider insurance company of union , nj , said yes , definitely it would be a natural , brooklyn playing against northern new jersey it would be like the dodgers and the giants when the founders announced the creation of the league last nov 1 , they talked of inviting local governments to invest in the teams , offering a 15 percent equity and profit share in return for the city s providing a stateoftheart , fanfriendly ball park that plan has changed none of our stadiums will be built with public financing , mrazek said that no longer is a viable strategy in the context of the communities where we need to build a stadium we 're going to need to demonstrate the viability of privately financed public stadiums washington \( rfk stadium \) , new orleans \( louisiana superdome \) , san juan \( hiram bithorn stadium \) and vancouver \( bc place \) have stadiums that either are ready for baseball or can be prepared in time for a 1996 season a team in new york and a team in riverside or san bernardino would require new stadiums we feel as though we could put up a temporary stadium in nine months to a year they have the technical knowhow , bleiwise said it would be temporary then we 'd put up a permanent 25 , 000 to 35 , 000seat stadium with six franchise sites basically in place , the league plans to add at least two more teams officials said they were considering new england \( hartford or worcester , mass \) mexico \( mexico city and monterrey \) orlando , jacksonville and miami in florida portland , ore columbus , ohio san antonio , sacramento , calif , and honolulu officials estimated that startup costs for each franchise would be less than 20 million , including a 5 million franchise fee major league baseball is expected to charge between 125 million and 150 million for its next two expansion teams , which most likely will go to phoenix and st petersburg , fla inside pitch on baseball s labor front , bill usery jr , the mediator , met with donald fehr , the union head , for about an hour and a half yesterday in what dick conn , usery s spokesman , called a productive session because of a senate hearing on baseball s anitrust exemption , usery canceled a meeting scheduled for today with robert dole , the senate majority leader , and newt gingrich , speaker of the house under sponsorship of orrin hatch , utah republican daniel patrick moynihan , new york democrat , and bob graham , florida democrat , an antitrust bill was introduced in the senate yesterday the bill would strip baseball of the exemption as it pertains to labor matters
it is easy to imagine yourself eating at frank s once a week for the rest of your life , becoming so familiar that you 'd call the waiter by his first name and never even have to order the minute you walked into the big , boisterous room , he 'd order you a martini with three olives , or a whisky sour , or a beer he 'd know , without asking , that you wanted a tbone for two , medium rare \( which is pretty much rare by most people s standards \) and a basket of the fabulous steak fries , piping hot and salty and he 'd warn you , right away , if for some reason the kitchen was out of cheesecake when gloria molinari s father opened frank s in 1912 , it served breakfast and lunch to the men of the meat market in those days of precholesterol consciousness , the gansevoort market was a bustling place that served the butcher shops found on every corner in new york city but the corner butcher has all but disappeared , most meat is aged in cryovac plastic bags , and people who eat meat tend to buy it in the supermarket because of this the gansevoort market is a shadow of its former self and so when frank s went up in smoke last fall , ms molinari and her sons decided it was time for a change they moved uptown one block , to be precise in the move from 14th to 15th street they exchanged a long narrow room with a patina of history for a big plain one without a drop of sentimentality the walls are stripped to the bricks , the ceilings are high , and there s a bar along one wall just above it is a floating pressedtin ceiling , a little memento of the old frank s way in the back where the smokers sit puffing behind a wall of glass is a big industrial clock the carnations on the table are often weary unlike the fancy uptown steakhouses with their dim lights and thick carpets , this room has a nononsense air , as if reminding you that what you came to do is eat and eat big frank s was not built for wimps i have seen some of the largest human beings of my life at frank s and they have always looked happy if you follow their lead , you will be , too well , you might not want to order six shrimp in your cocktail three or four would probably provide enough protein for an average person at frank s , shrimp cost 3 apiece , which sounds like a lot of money until you see their size they are giant creatures of the sea , and absolutely delicious after the shrimp , the big guys take on a tbone steak i once watched a lone man devour a steak for two , but i think 40 ounces of meat is an awful lot for one person the steak arrives on a board , a great charred hunk with the fine , funky flavor of meat that has been dryaged for a long time \( the molinaris age their meat for four weeks \) it also comes with a baked potato and a fine mix of vegetables on my last visit , that was a buttery tumble of zucchini and bright green snow peas at 25 a person , vegetables included , this steak is a bargain you have to order the steak fries on the side , but you will probably want to they are long and thick , the sorts of fries that give potatoes a good name a single basket is large enough to allow a few people to participate in the experience there are other steak options for the less hungry shell steak , filet mignon or the broiled skirt steak for which frank s is famous they are all fine , but i 'll take the tbone any day but you need n't eat beef to be happy at frank s there s the veal chop , another hefty piece of meat or even the tiny chicken , marinated whole in mustard and tarragon and grilled until the crisp skin blackens slightly and begins to pull away from the moist , silky flesh and consider the offal what other menu offers tripe , sweetbreads , kidneys and liver \?

reverting back to the past , they scored in the low 80 s and when anthony mason s free throw was not experiencing technical difficulties , four veterans stood around on the perimeter and waited for patrick ewing to rescue them as dress rehearsals at madison square garden go , this is not what don nelson had in mind his knicks looked disturbingly like youknowwho s knicks in a 9482 preseason loss yesterday to the utah jazz , a rather homely contest that elicited a few boos from the small garden crowd in the final minutes i was expecting one of these to happen , said nelson , whose team lost its third straight preseason game and is 23 i was hoping it would n't be here , but we were just stinko tonight we will get a lot better malodorous as the knicks were they shot 368 percent and were outrebounded , 4834 nelson s club has 10 days before their regular season opens at detroit 10 days to completely grasp a new offense and rekindle their old confidence it is not an easy challenge and , to listen to the knicks , it will take more than merely an adjustment or two on offense their starters were still in the game against utah s second string in the final minutes yesterday , and still they looked lost we 've got to execute better and bring back the knick aggressiveness and intensity that s what we 've got to have first and foremost , said mason , who had 8 points , 4 assists and 4 rebounds to show in 47 of 48 minutes charles oakley went so far as to toss a hint ewing s way , inferring that the knicks' allstar center should not be held out of practice to rest his knees everything starts in practice , oakley said you ca n't practice , you ca n't do it in the game he s the key to the offense he sits out of practice , and , hey , that s up to him he s going to get the ball in the game , though he s got to realize that practice makes perfect , like they say in the old school ewing \( 18 points on 4of15 shooting and 9 rebounds \) and oakley \( 17 points , 11 rebounds \) played 37 minutes derek harper played 33 and scored 19 karl malone scored 17 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the jazz , who improved to 32 in the preseason reevaluating his trainingcamp philosophy , nelson played none of his starters fewer than 33 minutes and admitted afterward that ewing , at age 33 , and harper , at 34 , will not get their planned rest until later in the season he s going to be a player that s going to have to play a lot , nelson said of ewing , who he originally hoped would play between 30 and 35 minutes along with harper i think the next three games , i want him to start getting used to playing more i'm not going to practice him every day , but in a game situation he s got to get used to playing in the high 30 s , midtohigh30 s from the looks of things so far , at least early in the season , they 're probably going to have to hold this team up by playing more minutes than anticipated most of the knicks agree that breaking the mental chains of the last four years is the greatest adjustment while nelson s motion offense has given them creativity , it has also made them stop and think basketball is a game of reaction , and right now we 're thinking too much , john starks said we 're not just letting things happen seems like old times , the way we looked today when you 've been conditioned to do that for four years , it sticks in your mind we 've got to stop talking about it and just do it , oakley said nelson was the most bothered by the loss it was his garden debut and , preseason or not , the loss hurt he ventured to say that the knicks had hit rock bottom this particular game was the opposite of what i had hoped for , nelson said doug christie said he said 'rock bottom \? ' that s deep that s the end of the canyon man , we got to go back to work rebounds in protest over the unsettled labor situation between the league and its officials , referee steve javie and two former officials picketed in front of the garden yesterday meanwhile , patrick ewing continued his assault on replacement referees they should be fairly compensated , ewing said of the lockedout referees what s going on now is ugly out there more fights could break out anthony mason began the preseason hitting 13 of his first 18 onehanded foul shots but he has made only 15 of 26 in his last three games is 28 for 44 \( 636 \) during the preseason
geneva , june 29 in the long and tortuous history of trade disputes between japan and the united states , no president has ever talked a tougher game than bill clinton no administration threatened so convincingly to use its big stick unless tokyo agreed to fundamental , precedentshattering change in the way it did business mickey kantor , mr clinton s aggressive trade representative , spoke repeatedly in the months leading up to wednesday s accord on automotive trade of the need for a momentous shift that would break the back of the network of collusive relationships that keep outsiders foreign and domestic at bay for the first time , an american administration was unified in its willingness to use the blunt and ugly weapon of punitive trade sanctions to achieve its goal a few days ago , vice president al gore summed up the administration s stance we 're not going to blink but in the end , mr clinton settled for a deal that requires far less change in japanese business practices than his political oratory suggested would have been acceptable even some of mr clinton s closest economic aides conceded today that they might have let him set too high a hurdle almost any accord was going to fall short of the broad objectives of remaking the structure of japan s auto industry some are also wondering if they jumped too early could washington have won broader change it if had gone through with its threatened sanctions \? these are questions we 'll be asking ourselves for a long time , a senior administration official deeply involved in the issue said hours after mr kantor and ryutaro hashimoto , japan s minister of international trade and industry , declared that they had bridged the unbridgeable but we all looked over the precipice and discovered we could n't see the bottom the sanctions were a big risk so we took what we had in hand clearly mr clinton got more than he would have without resorting to extreme pressure , maybe a lot more for all the confrontational language , however , he ended up with an agreement that goes only modestly beyond past accords it is filled with goals but few commitments it contains some specific , important regulatory changes but no declarations of broad reform there are an impressive series of benchmarks to measure progress but no penalties if progress is not made if japan s economy recovers over the next three years , the agreement may yield the 9 billion or so more in american autoparts sales that mr clinton says it will the goal , though , was not just sales but dismantling the system that japan had built up over 40 years today , mr kantor argued in a telephone interview from denver , where he is the host of a meeting of latin american trade ministers , that the accord was being vastly underrated this is more than a step forward , he said i think it is fundamental change it is not total change but we have done a number of things we said we would do we 've made sure the japanese markets will be open to autos and auto parts we gave the right signal to the rest of asia and the us public is more convinced than ever this president will make sure trade is a twoway street to no one s surprise , however , mr kantor and his negotiating team also ran headlong into the three realities of economic diplomacy with tokyo that have changed very little since richard m nixon declared 25 years ago that the trade deficit with japan , then a fraction of tens of billions of dollars now , had reached intolerable proportions the first is that even the most comprehensive trade agreements are , by nature , maddeningly narrow and precise they are tiny little ice chips off the glacier the white house said it wanted an accord that would remake the world s secondlargest economy and strike fear into the hearts of asian countries tempted to imitate japan s model but what it got was an agreement that expands the number of garages and mechanics who are permitted to make repairs for car inspections in japan and that cajoles toyota dealers into thinking about putting a ford taurus in their windows there is always a mismatch between the loftiness of the goals and minutiae of the issues you actually negotiate , one of the principal negotiators said today the second reality is that equal access to japan s markets is a very subjective thing , as dependent on detroit s willingness to invest heavily as on japan s willingness to open its doors chrysler took an important step , if decades late , the other day in announcing a 100 million investment in a modest cardealer franchise that should expand its tiny presence in japan s big cities but for all the shouting , none of the big three has declared how many billions each will spend to seriously take on the japanese car market , the world s second largest now they have the opportunity mr kantor made the most headway in his demands that tokyo crack down on car companies that put pressure on their dealers not to handle competitive american lines by mr kantor s estimates estimates mr hashimoto declined to endorse , but did not dispute more than 200 such showrooms will be opened over the next year , and 1 , 000 in the next five years japanese officials say this is a major advance , but one that will fall apart if the big three fail to invest heavily in some of the world s most expensive car dealerships and they clearly think that even if you can take the shinoda family to the showroom , you ca n't persuade them to buy oversized cadillac sevilles the third reality is that broader political alliances still count for a lot the clinton administration , the most exportfocused one in decades , decided that it was not worth risking its most important relationship in the pacific for the extra concessions it might have gained in the end , i think people got scared , said alan tonelson , a fellow at the economic strategy institute , a member of a group of trade hawks who were trying to stiffen the administration s resolve boeing was afraid of retaliation the american car companies were afraid of what kind of investments they would have to make the intelligence agencies and the state department were concerned that the broader relationship might be in jeopardy so here s the message we ended up with we talk loudly and carry a tiny stick mr kantor argues that the stick is in the accord itself this is the first agreement , he noted , to contain a specific set of criteria for annual measurement of progress the key is to have a way to keep the pressure on , he said but already the japanese are saying that the benchmarks are vague because they did not agree to specific targets , a point their officials are heralding in tokyo as an enormous victory it is still hard to say which side is closer to the truth the final agreement was put together so hastily that neither government has yet to publish the final text chart dissecting the usjapan trade japan and the united states have been arguing over access to the japanese market for a century in recent years japan has shipped far more goods to the united states than it has imported , with the imbalance swelling to about 70 billion in the 12 months ended march 31 here is a breakdown of the trade flows that produced that imbalance both imports and exports are valued at united states ports figures are in billions of dollars vehicles and parts official trade barriers are not high , but the high quality of japanese cars and the structure of the japanese auto industry combine to make imports difficult inspection procedures , to be modified under the agreement announced wednesday , have discriminated against foreignmade replacement parts materials unites states producers say their lowcost goods would do even better in japan if not for regulatory barriers agriculture and food japan is the world s largest importer of food , but quotas and high tariffs keep out imported wheat , rice and sugar united states suppliers hold high market shares in unprotected categories technology sales to japan have been hampered by regulatory barriers , especially in the telecommunications sector , as well as japanese efforts to enhance technological capabilities of local firms the 1987 semiconductor trade agreement improved united states market access for semiconductors and the united states market share subsequently increased \( some analysts , however , cite changing technology as the main reason for this increase \) boeing sells large numbers of aircraft to japanese airlines other goods american steelmakers say a japanese cartel keeps their products out japan has imported more clothing and textiles in recent years , and the american toy retailer toys r us has set up outlets in japan , but in both cases most of the goods come from other asian nations , not the united states \( source edward m graham , senior fellow , institute for international economics \)

warsaw , nov 4 the mustache is now gray and trimmed the always generous chin has expanded and the usually flamboyant words have softened a little in the last few weeks as lech walesa has stormed around poland trying to insure that he is reelected president several months ago , mr walesa was virtually written off , his stellar political career deemed over as his popularity ratings dipped into single digits his main opponent , a suave , smoothtalking former communist , aleksander kwasniewski , maintained far higher support but again and again , mr walesa has told crowds in villages , mining halls and factories , i want poland to be a normal country it is a simple statement intended to bring back memories of life under communism , and it is a message that seems to be working as poland goes to the polls on sunday for the second democratic presidential election since the fall of communism , mr walesa , 52 , appears almost certain to be one of the two candidates to qualify for a runoff election on nov 19 the other candidate in the runoff will almost certainly be mr kwasniewski , 40 , setting the stage for the kind of political battle that has become commonplace in eastern europe the clash between a staunch anticommunist and a reformed communist public opinion polls show that neither mr kwasniewski nor mr walesa has enough strength in a crowded field of more than a dozen candidates to garner the more than 50 percent of the vote necessary to win outright on sunday an opinion poll published on friday in the newspaper rzeczpospolita showed mr kwasniewski ahead with 32 percent and mr walesa second with 29 percent several candidates who showed early promise have faltered badly , including hanna gronkiewiczwaltz , the president of the national bank , who campaigned on a platform sympathetic to the roman catholic church a former dissident and labor minister , jacek kuron , has also failed to garner much support even though mr walesa trails slightly and may come in second on sunday , many analysts say they believe that he may prevail on nov 19 such an outcome is likely , the analysts say , because the supporters of the center and rightofcenter candidates who fail on sunday will coalesce behind mr walesa to prevent the victory of a former communist and mr walesa has played on the theme of fear of the past , even though poles elected a parliament led by former communists two years ago the current prime minister , jozef oleksy , is a former communist and a member of the democratic left alliance , the party mr kwasniewski heads at campaign stops , mr walesa asserts that a victory for mr kwasniewski would mean that former communists would control the presidency as well as parliament , a consolidation of power that he contends would be bad for poland at home and abroad they control everything from local governments to banks , from parliament to government , and now they also want the presidency , mr walesa told workers at the gdansk shipyard where he began his political career as the leader of the solidarity trade union movement they are wolves in sheep s clothing mr kwasniewski , an economist and journalist who joined the communist party in the late 1970 s , has tried to deflect the issue of his membership in the party his most senior post was as minister for youth in the late 1980 s with his smart suits , his grasp of the issues and his wellrun campaign , he appears the antithesis of the old guard let s choose the future is his slogan and mr kwasniewski plays the communist period according to his audience to his solid core of supporters , the 25 percent or so of the voters who pollsters say regard the communist past favorably , mr kwasniewski declares that poland flourished under communism millions of people broke free from poverty , gained education and access to the fruits of culture , he says to opponents of the communist government whom he is now trying to woo , he declares , there were many mistakes , absurdities , wrongdoings and even crimes for all the charges about the past , there are few sharp differences between mr kwasniewski and mr walesa on the issues the polish economy is the fastestgrowing in eastern europe 65 percent is expected this year and after a slow start , foreign investment is increasing neither candidate would be expected to change the course toward a market economy , economists say but some investors have expressed concern that with excommunists as both president and prime minister , there would be more sympathy for a controlled economy privatization of state companies has slowed with mr kwasniewski s party in power on foreign policy , poland has shouted loudest of all the eastern european countries about its need to join nato mr kwasniewski does not dispute that entry to nato is in poland s best interest he has met with the major western european politicians to express his desire for poland to join the european union on the campaign trail , mr walesa has made much of his antirussian sentiments , a line that goes down well with most poles the president accused prime minister oleksy of being the greatest con , on the ground that he was too sympathetic to moscow in contrast , mr walesa said one of his greatest accomplishments as president was to negotiate the withdrawal of the russian army from poland and knowing that many workers outside the major cities are not feeling the effects of the growing economy , mr walesa has some easytounderstand explanations of why ordinary people are not better off than in the old days early this week , at the volunteer firefighters' hall in the village of gomulin , about 80 miles southwest of warsaw , mr walesa was frank economically , results are still quite poor , he said to murmurs of agreement we do not feel such a great improvement let me tell you why poland s trade before 1989 was mostly with the soviet union , czechoslovakia and the german democratic republic none of these countries exist any more so we are like somebody from whose wallet twothirds of the money has been stolen for all the warmth of the welcome in the packed hall , some listeners came away unpersuaded why do i not have a job \? asked jacek luczynski , 31 five years ago i voted for walesa , and what did i get out of it \? i will vote for kwasniewski he is understanding he talks well his past does not bother me at his closing campaign rally in cracow on thursday , mr kwasniewski said voters had a choice between the economic reform of his party and the empty , unfulfilled promises of mr walesa but one thing was clear , he added , as he pressed to put a distance between his past and the present on nov 5 we will not be choosing between communist poland and solidarity that fight is over photos president lech walesa campaigned for reelection last week at avolunteer firefighters' hall in the village of gomulin below , aleksander kwasniewski , a former communist , spoke to supporters in grodki after votes are cast in the election today , both candidates are expected to face a runoff on nov 19 \( photographs by witold kiassowski for the new york times \)
one of the last wishes of florine stettheimer , an american painter who died in 1944 at the age of 73 , was that all the work in her studio be destroyed upon her death this was no small thing , as stettheimer , who was independently wealthy , never sold her paintings although she occasionally gave them to friends just as she declined all offers of solo shows luckily , her sisters , carrie and ettie stettheimer , ignored the request florine stettheimer s witty , deliriously beautiful canvases , which chronicled a weird maidenly life spent with her adored mother and sisters on new york s betweenthewars cultural front , were saved for posterity indeed , they were rather quickly placed on prominent display in 1946 , the museum of modern art mounted a retrospective instigated by one of the artist s closest friends , marcel duchamp , and organized by another , the art critic henry mcbride stettheimer s ghost cannot have been pleased , but it turned out that posterity was n't ready like a bevy of sleeping beauties , stettheimer s paintings slipped into an oblivion that lasted more than 30 years posterity is ready now florine stettheimer manhattan fantastica , a dazzling exhibition at the whitney museum of american art , spreads before the eye more paintings than have been on view since the modern s show a total of 55 it includes examples of her academic early work , proving that the primitive style she arrived at between 1915 and 1917 , after years of studying and looking at art in europe , was of the pseudo sort as with elie nadelman and later milton avery , it represented a sophisticated adaptation , not a naive absorption there are also some pivotal costume designs , in the form of crude collages and little dolls that the artist made in 1912 , after seeing matisse s paintings and leon bakst s ornate designs for the ballets russes these presage the rich colors , fanciful clothes and patterned fabrics that would figure prominently in her paintings and of course there are photographs of the costumes and sets that stettheimer designed in 1934 for four saints in three acts , the virgil thomsongertrude stein opera her use of cellophane and other ephemeral materials looks like the latest in installation art this exhibition has been organized by elizabeth sussman , curator at the whitney , and barbara bloemink , a stettheimer scholar whose biography of the artist will be published next month in the catalogue , both women write about discovering stettheimer s work by accident in the late 1970 s and early 80 s , and instantly joining her small band of admirers stettheimer s work has become progressively better known in the last two decades , especially after an exhibition ms sussman organized at the institute of contemporary art in boston in 1980 nonetheless , the whitney show is like a newly opened time capsule that rewrites the past and affirms the present stett heimer s is an art of extreme artifice that comes directly out of life \( and a precedent for camp , as the art historian linda nochlin argues in a 1980 essay reprinted in the catalogue \) it points to the persistence of the personal at the center of the modernist enterprise at the same time , her work corroborates many of recent art s preoccupations with narrative , popular culture , autobiography and identity , decoration and femininity as well as feminism the list of artists who have admired her , emulated her dandyish persona or unwittingly followed her footsteps stretches from andy warhol , david hockney and edward gorey , past idiosyncratic figures of the 70 s and 80 s like thomas lanniganschmidt , auste and hollis sigler , to emerging painters like thomas trosch as for the paintings themselves , the best of them are so wonderful in whole and in part , and provide so many different kinds of pleasures , that you do n't quite know where to begin their primary subject may be pleasure itself the pleasure of life as a movable salon of loved ones and creative friends , transported from sitting room to swimming party to country luncheon \( you almost expect the paintings to smell or taste good or to emit their own music , which still does n't justify playing a recording of four saints in one of the galleries \) the most powerful pull is provided by color , which stettheimer used with exceptional boldness her wickedly vibrant palette plays saturated against pastel , pure against jaundiced , and makes you reach back to van gogh for precedent among her contemporaries , only marsden hartley , stuart davis and maurice prendergast seem as committed to color s undiluted joys , but none were so consistently flamboyant on the heavy side , stettheimer favored reds , blacks and hot , sharp yellows these three tones sometimes take over , as

denver , july 22 last winter , sydne vogel came from alaska to skate in the lower 48 , and the questions her adolescent competitors asked were as amusing as they were uninformed do you skate on icebergs \? do you live in an igloo \? yes , we have a twostory igloo , the figure skater would reply then she would laugh and let others in on the joke if i did n't , they would believe me , she said they do n't know anchorage is a regular city vogel won the junior national championship in february and things , inevitably , got more complicated vogel is 16 , and skating s newest phenom today , however , she slid to fifth place after the short program at the olympic festival , which is for developing american athletes later this season , she will compete at the senior level against stars like nicole bobek and michelle kwan , an elevated status that means new possibilities , new pressures , new concerns in a sport as troubled as it is popular no other olympic sport draws higher ratings and none has drawn so much recent , deflating scrutiny the clubbing of nancy kerrigan demonstrated what desperate measures people will take when an entire career is distilled to four minutes at the winter games tonya harding remains banned , an admitted felon this year s national champion , bobek , also ran afoul of the law when she entered the home of a fellow skater without permission the case was dismissed , and so has been figure skating s china doll image in a new , disturbing book titled little girls in pretty boxes , the author joan ryan has dealt figure skating a blow as forceful as the whack on kerrigan s knee ryan writes not of triple axels but of the triple liabilities of overzealous parents and coaches , eating disorders and distressing injuries if training costs run to tens of thousands of dollars a year , ryan suggests , the toll on the physical and emotional health of female skaters often runs higher traci coleman , who coaches vogel in anchorage , has not read ryan s book , but she seems sufficiently aware of the sport s perils to know that proportion and wariness are required though vogel s career has the green light , the skater , her coach and her parents are proceeding with caution this is the first year she s dealing with other people s expectations , coleman said of vogel i want to make sure it does n't overwhelm her there are no plans to separate the family , as happened with tara lipinski , the 13yearold who lives with her mother and trains in delaware while her father lives in texas if alaska s remoteness makes travel inconvenient , joy vogel said , it also keeps her daughter distant from the sport s excesses we considered it , but at this point , we see no need for sydne to train outside alaska , joy vogel said she does n't want to she loves alaska and she is doing well with her friends and her coach nor is the 5foot5inch , 110pound vogel on a spare diet designed to restrict her weight and facilitate her jumping , her mother and coach both said sydne eats what she likes , coleman said these kids have to live a life after skating i'm not going to destroy them they have to be healthy still , the leap from junior to senior level can be perilous only 8 of the last 46 junior champions have won a senior national title , none since jill trenary a decade ago it is the unforgiving some say , unforgivable nature of skating that , as bodies develop , career trajectories often flatten two years ago , vogel was still skating in the novice category reaching the senior level at the relatively late age of 16 may work to her advantage one , she has already experienced her adolescent growth spurt two , as her body has filled out , so have her outside interests she paints and has studied the french horn and piano at age 11 , one of her piano compositions advanced to a national music contest she also speaks some russian and would like to learn german if she won the olympics , i 'd hate for that to be the pinnacle , and she 'd have to live the rest of her life as a oncewas , hasbeen , coleman said as with other skating families , however , the vogels , who own a contracting company , have been forced to make difficult decisions as their daughter s skill increased , so did her travels to various competitions a high school sophomoretobe , vogel has left public school and now takes correspondence courses they told me i could n't miss so much school , vogel said but it s fine i'm actually learning more this way she has also begun to experience the injuries that inevitably come with a desire to land sophisticated , stressful jumps today , vogel wore a pad to protect a bruise on her right hip i bruise it , and before it heals , i bruise it again , vogel said i have to be careful she is practicing a triple axel and , by the 1998 winter olympics in nagano , japan , she would like to become the first woman to successfully land a jump that requires four revolutions in the air i welcome it , vogel said of the chance to compete against bobek and kwan i have the same jumps i 've been working hard for a long time she added i just want to make it to the olympics and do the performance of my life that would be a great opportunity for now , she skates carefully emerging careers always tread on thin ice i feel anxious for her , but we 're real pleased at how she s handling it , joy vogel said of sydne we have n't come into anything that has made us feel uncomfortable being in alaska , we do n't have to be on anybody s timetable photo sydne vogel , a junior champion , is planning to advance with caution to the next level \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)
the arrival of a new taxi czar in new york city is generally followed by a promise that cab drivers will start to behave better christopher lynn , the latest chairman of the taxi and limousine commission , has taken a more practical approach under his watch , he promises , cab drivers will start to be paid better the taxi fleet owners are petitioning the city for a fare increase mr lynn wisely says he will not support any rise unless the bulk of the money goes directly to the drivers , instead of the owners of the 11 , 787 taxi medallions and their middlemen mr lynn is not unfamiliar with the litany of complaints about new york cab drivers like his predecessors , he vows city cabbies will become polite , proficient in english and know how to get to lincoln center none of this is likely to happen as long as the drivers' pay and working conditions are so abysmal cabbies generally work a 12hour shift , which means they are often tired and cranky they must pay for gasoline and an upfront rent of 75 or more for the car if the day has been slow , they may be racing the clock to avoid actually losing money unscrupulous garages charge them huge deposits of up to 2 , 000 and then refuse to refund the money when they quit the job dispatchers may demand an extra 5 to 10 for a cab that has amenities like a radio , airconditioning , or even an unbroken driver s seat according to mr lynn s office , the average cabbie nets about 77 for a 12hour day that means the quicker , most agreeable , englishproficient drivers will not linger long in the trade the winners in this system are the medallion owners beneficiaries of a citychartered monopoly , they can lease their official permits to garages or agents , take their commissions and watch their investments appreciate the selling price for individual medallions , whose owners are supposed to drive themselves for one shift a day , has risen from 128 , 400 in 1990 to 164 , 000 today corporate medallions , which do not require the owner to drive , have skyrocketed from 135 , 700 to 220 , 000 in the same period mr lynn s agenda includes a crackdown on those deposits and more inspections to assure that every driver gets a safe , comfortable vehicle without paying under the table as to the fare , mr lynn s priorities are exactly right it has been nearly six years since the last increase the owners have asked for a hike that would raise the average fare by 27 percent a more reasonable figure is between 10 and 15 percent about twothirds of that should go to the drivers , putting mr lynn close to his goal of raising the average cabbie s income by about 20 a day once the drivers are better paid and better treated , new yorkers can demand that they provide better service
opening arguments are to be heard today in federal court in manhattan in the wirefraud trial of the boxing promoter don king , who is charged with defrauding lloyd s of london by submitting phony expenses and a fake contract from a canceled title fight between julio cesar chavez and harold brazier a grand jury said that king had taken out a 750 , 000 policy with lloyd s two months before the fight in june 1991 in case of a cancellation king was charged with receiving 350 , 000 in insurance after a cut to chavez s nose caused a cancellation by submitting a contract that said chavez was entitled to repayment of his training fees if the bout were canceled the grand jury said the contract , which it said chavez did not sign , was a fraud and that chavez received none of the 350 , 000 he is innocent , said peter fleming , king s attorney if convicted , king faces a maximum of five years in prison and a 250 , 000 fine for each of the nine counts
in a report issued yesterday , mayor rudolph w giuliani recommended a series of changes at the police department and at the emergency medical service to avoid the kind of miscommunication that led to a 35minute delay in dispatching an ambulance to aid gunshot victims at a shootout in rego park , queens , in december both departments were criticized after the dec 18 shootout , in which police fired 247 shots during a fourblock pursuit of a disgruntled tenant who killed his two landlords and wounded a bystander , later killed by police fire four other people were wounded victims' repeated calls to 911 resulted in ems s confusion and delay the report , released yesterday by the mayor s counsel and his office of operations , calls for increased supervision at ems and improved coordination between ems and the police department david bookstaver , a spokesman for ems , said the service had already instituted one of the key recommendations of the report , to increase supervision after completing its own review of the incident , mr bookstaver said , ems last month started requiring supervisors to review all situations in which dispatchers try to determine whether a call is merely a duplicate of another one already assigned , as occurred in this case we realized our duping procedure needed to be revamped , mr bookstaver said so we now have supervisors act as an additional set of eyes before a decision is made the mayor immediately endorsed the report , saying these factual findings and recommendations will help improve the quality of emergency medical services new york city provides its residents in the december incident , wenping hsu unleashed a torrent of gunfire at the tung shing restaurant on queens boulevard , shooting the restaurant cashier , then turning his 9millimeter weapon on the street , where he wounded the restaurant manager , a passing cab driver , two police officers and a bystander who eventually died from shots fired by a police officer patrons at the crowded restaurant , including united states representative gary l ackerman , democrat of queens , were highly critical of ems , saying that several ambulances passed by the restaurant while sheree yin lee lay dying by the cash register ms lee was one of mr hsu s landlords the mayor s report found that in the chaos after mr hsu opened fire in the restaurant , 27 calls were made to 911 six ambulances were assigned to the scene , but none arrived until 35 minutes after the initial call police officials declined to comment on the mayor s report , which advises the police department to revise some of its guidelines for officers who report to crime scenes and who work on the computer system linked to ems because four police officers apparently showed up at the restaurant but left without ensuring that medical care was being provided to the shooting victims , the report recommends that the police department and ems develop a protocol to make sure emergency care is provided before police officers leave a scene the police eventually killed mr hsu after cornering him in a garage mr hsu had started his rampage earlier that night by shooting ms lee s husband , chang mang lee , in the basement of the elmhurst house the three shared the lees had been planning to evict mr hsu
moscow , dec 19 as if the government of president boris n yeltsin has n't heard enough grim news this week , the figures from individual parliamentary races started to pour in today and the results were more of the same , only much worse it now appears certain that communists will control virtually a third of russia s new parliament , far more seats than even they had hoped for if their close ideological soul mates in the agrarian party are included in the calculations , the figure is even higher we are facing a very difficult situation , said grigory a yavlinsky , the leader of yabloko , the only openly liberal party certain of gaining a place in parliament at this point it is important to unite all forces opposed to attempts to restore a totalitarian system in russia almost nobody is talking about returning russia to totalitarianism , but these days the reform movement does not have much else for building a case when the russian people elect a parliament they each get two votes one supports an entire party the other lets voters choose among local candidates in individual races although communists and nationalists were always expected to prevail in the parliamentary vote for the 225 out of 450 seats that is based on supporting a single party , most experts thought the other half of the seats filled in headtohead races would produce far more mainstream victors , as it did in 1993 they were wrong the results so far suggest that the opposition , including communists , agrarians and nationalists , will account for nearly 250 of the 450 seats in the new parliament the government party , our house is russia , when combined with its sometime reform rival , yabloko , will have little more than 100 the rest of the seats will probably be spread proportionally among individuals who have been elected as independents no matter what happens in the end , the communists are not likely to have enough power to carry their motions over the opposition of reformers , and reformers are unlikely to pass any legislation unless the communists support it if only four parties make it into parliament , as appears likely , then 50 percent of the electorate will have supported parties that did not make it despite the large numbers for communists , any mandate will be weak this is going to be a parliament all about politics and not about government said michael mcfaul , a senior associate at the carnegie moscow center the whole next six months are going to be taken up with the presidential race that means that the parliament will almost certainly pass a series of bills lowering the price of bread , slowing privatization , moving backward on land reform that have no chance of mr yeltsin s support but each failure will be a card that can be dealt during the campaign with 195 of the 225 headtohead races accounted for , the communists , with 49 winners , have defeated the government party , our house is russia , with 10 , by five to one the communists' agrarian allies had 19 , and the liberal yabloko had 12 when the individual communists who won are combined with the party list numbers , which are still not final , they will have from 135 to 150 members in the new parliament our house is russia is likely to have about 50 to 55 of the 450 seats the ultranationalist liberal democratic party of vladimir v zhirinovsky , which so far has won only a single individual race , will probably have about 50 seats , as will yabloko in all likelihood none of this is good news for president yeltsin , but things might get worse most of the results that have already been reported were produced by computer the rural villages that do not tabulate their vote by computer are not expected to help turn the tide toward reform back in seclusion at the hospital where he is recovering from a heart ailment , mr yeltsin met with his prime minister , viktor s chernomyrdin , today to talk about the results of the voting mr yeltsin must now decide how to react to a parliamentary vote that has been as much as anything else a referendum on him gennadi a zyuganov , the communist leader , said today that the president would have to make changes in his government how could he possibly look at these results and do nothing about it \? mr zyuganov asked at a news conference mr yeltsin will certainly act , but the script will depend on his own murky intentions mr chernomyrdin laughed off calls today for wholesale changes in the government changes , shifts , sackings nothing of the sort will happen , he said he said that changes would occur in government , as in any living organism personnel changes have routinely taken place and will take place in the future , he said , sounding as if he was struggling to believe his own words but they have nothing to do with this election that of course depends on the ultimate results , which will not be known for at least two more days with about 65 percent of the party list vote counted , the communists have about 218 percent of the vote , mr zhirinovsky s ultranationalist party has about 106 percent , our house is russia has 96 , and mr yavlinsky s yabloko 76 no other party has received the 5 percent necessary to enter parliament although three , the liberal party of yegor t gaidar , the opposition group called women of russia , and the very hardline communist labor party , are all hovering tantalizingly close to the barrier mr yeltsin has a tricky task ahead he must sacrifice part of his government to the results of this election but if he moves too quickly he will be seen as caving in it also is not good politics most people expect foreign minister andrei v kozyrev , perhaps the bestknown liberal leftist in the yeltsin government , to be the first to go but mr yeltsin has said he will not decide until february whether he is going to run for president again and until then , he can gain little by moving his chess pieces more often than necessary mr zyuganov started his chess game today , saying it was time to start planning for the presidential race he took pains to stress that he would seek a broad coalition in parliament , that he wanted allies with whom he could work , and that he was not afraid of compromise or disagreement but he also said he expects the market reforms that have been the hallmark of the postcommunist era here to be eased and on this , at least , he did not seem willing to compromise the policy should be corrected , he said no matter what they say now it is impossible to continue this policy
guerrilla girls printed matter 77 wooster street soho through feb 26 the guerrilla girls are artist vigilantes whose names and number remain secret their targets have been racially and sexually discriminatory practices in the art world , and their main weapon has been a series of tersely worded posters that periodically cover the walls of soho and beyond in celebration of their 10th anniversary , a selection of posters is on view at printed matter , a gallery and bookstore devoted to artist s publications the blackandwhite posters rely on lists , statistics , spare graphics and a wry turn of phrase to deliver the message that , even with the raised political awareness of the past decade , the new york art world remains a predominantly white male shop if you would like to know the offending institutions and personalities of seasons past \( these galleries show no more than 10 percent woman artists or none at all states one poster which art mag was worst for women last year \? asks another \) , this is the place to look although some recent posters address issues outside an art context , the guerrilla girls always come back to it , and when they state you 're seeing less than half the picture without the vision of woman artists and artists of color , who could argue \? holland cotter
nowata , okla this is a city that walmart ditched hundreds of communities have wrestled with walmart coming to town as it raced across rural america to become the nation s biggest retailer for years , the script has been familiar walmart arrives in a city creating both excitement and trepidation , a sign of a community s stature but a threat to its local shopkeepers small stores often shut down , unable to match the big chain s prices across the country , town after town has struck the same bargain by embracing the retailing juggernaut the downtown is walmart for nowata , like three other communities in northeastern oklahoma and a small but growing number of towns elsewhere , it has proved a risky bargain when walmart pulls up and departs , it leaves both a hole in the old downtown and a gash across the entire local economy walmart has outraged and hobbled this struggling city of barbed wire , comatose oil fields and 3 , 900 people since shutting its store here a year ago public services have been cut , taxes have risen , and jobs are scarcer walmart bank deposits and wages that helped sustain the economy have shrunk people now have to take to the highways to shop for clothes and household goods businesses jolt and jilt communities all the time , of course stores , like factories , come and go no one complains when businesses bring booms and jobs to town and walmart , to be sure , is a thriving , growing corporation that is opening new stores far more often than it abandons places like this not keeping its bargain \? but when walmart does leave a city like nowata , the local reaction is so sharp partly because people tend to expect more of the colossus from bentonville , ark its culture is plainfolks , and its success is rooted in smalltown america , wooing consumers other retailers ignored by offering them low prices and national brands so citizens of the oklahoma towns that walmart has abandoned even rockribbed conservative business executives attack the company for its behavior here they say walmart failed to keep its side of the bargain they were not playing fair , said bryan l lee , president of the first national bank of nowata , who keeps copies of national review , the conservative monthly , on the waitingroom coffee table they came in and ravaged all the small businesses and when it came to the point where they were not satisfied , they left armel richardson , who owns a propane business and the town s only newcar dealership , was the mayor when walmart arrived they said , 'we 're here , ' and we welcomed them , he recalled recently yet now that walmart has gone , mr richardson leaves little doubt how nowata s feelings have changed walmart has proven this they 're big and greedy , he said they have no compassion for the community or the individual the nowata experience could add grist to the debate over walmart s current advance into the northeast ken murnan , who owns a printing business here and publishes the weekly nowata county people , said its foes would find ammunition here i do n't see any way that walmart s coming in is a benefit to a small community , he said not if you want to keep the life style you have now walmart shut the store here so it could lure shoppers to a vastly bigger supercenter 30 miles away in bartlesville but the company might be disappointed many people say they wo n't go near the place and their animosity has been passed to the children a schoolyard chant these days walmart fallapart walmart s retreat has stung this community in dozens of ways it was nowata s biggest business and , with a payroll of 70 , the city s no 2 employer , after a nursing home nowata s disproportionately large population of the poor and the old , many without cars , have lost a place where they could walk to work and to shop the biggest measurable impact , though , is the hole in the city s finances the city manager , nancy shipley , said the loss of nowata s 3 percent tax on its biggest business s sales has driven this year s 12 million municipal budget into the red by some 80 , 000 to cope , ms shipley is closing the city hall an hour early each day she has called off plans to resurface crumbling roads and to put a new roof on the city park s leaky shelter she has laid off her office receptionist , the street foreman and the dump s parttime supervisor water and sewer taxes have been raised 32 percent ms shipley says she expects to ask the five city commissioners for a 5 monthly tax on homeowners for fire protection last month , she wrote to david d glass , president and chief executive of walmart stores in bentonville , to beg you to do something to help our city as of late last week , she said , mr glass had not replied it was doing just fine the stores walmart keeps building in towns like nowata still deliver the bulk of company revenues and past performance of smaller stores seems unrelated to decisions to fold them walmart s famously secretive management says that for competitive reasons it cannot discuss such matters but mr lee , the bank president , said the receipts that the nowata walmart left each day at his bank were as strong before the closing as they were 5 and 10 years ago
a truism colleges perpetually need money boom years , bust years , government subsidies or none , it matters not the old alma mater will aways exhort alumni to give , give , give and , for the most part , alumni and others respond , and generously but not always with unrestricted cash in the past few years , bemused college fundraisers have received such donations as a malfunctioning dinosaur model , an unreachable island , a nondisplayable painting and a passel of animals and cemetery plots and they have gotten huge amounts of money tied to goals the colleges had never thought to pursue unanimously , college officials say they prefer unfettered cash but at fundraising time , they cannot be too choosy tennessee technological university in cookeville frequently receives bull semen , a gift it uses to fertilizes its cattle herd sure , we 'd prefer money , but we understand that semen is a more renewable resource , said ben l byler , director of the university s school of agriculture the uses for bull semen are pretty obvious but what about the three breeding pairs of emus , valued at more than 20 , 000 a pair , that southwest texas state university in san marcos received in august \? emus , apparently , are not just crossword puzzle words they yield leather , meat and an oil that works well in cosmetics and skin lotions the college will keep them on its ranch large , unrestricted cash gifts are obviously on top of the wish list , but we would not look a gift emu in the mouth , said mark hendricks , a college spokesman mr hendricks s personal gift favorite remains the dummy mummy that was used to portray the body of augustus mccray , the character played by robert duvall in the miniseries lonesome dove donated by bill wittless , an alumnus and executive producer of the series , it is now part of the college s growing collection of books and items associated with southwestern writers while such gifts bring smiles , most college and university officials would willingly forgo them for cash according to the council for aid to education , a nonprofit corporation in new york city that focuses on private gifts to schools , colleges received 112 billion in cash , securities , real estate and products from individuals , corporations , foundations and other nongovernmental sources in the 19921993 academic year gifts from alumni accounted for more than a quarter of that sum hefty as those numbers may be , the council says they still amount to just about 7 percent of the average annual operating budget of a fouryear institution put another way , a typical fouryear liberal arts college averages about 1 , 400 per student in annual gifts it costs the school , on average , more than 18 , 000 a year to educate that student moreover , a lot of gifts including big ones come with strings attached kathleen kavanaugh , vassar college s vice president for development , says that gifts of 100 , 000 are not at all uncommon these days they were 20 years ago , she says , but back then donors said , 'put the money where you need it' today , they 'll say they are interested in the library , or faculty salaries , or scholarships , or something else that might not represent our most pressing need in fact , few colleges accept everything they are offered many turn down buildings and land that might bring environmental problems or be otherwise difficult to resell lehigh university wishes it had turned down the eight philadelphia cemetery plots it was given in 1978 the school was unable to find a buyer for the plots until 1993 and that was n't the first time lehigh got stuck in the mid1960 s , the school received a dc3 from an alumnus s company the university quickly realized the plane was too expensive to keep bethlehem steel let lehigh store the plane in its hangar for six months , until the school sold it to a religious organization that said the aircraft would be used to fly bibles to south america many schools turn down gifts that have unpalatable restrictions rhodes college in memphis recently refused several hundred bottles of wine when the wouldbe donor stipulated that it be drunk on campus , not resold vassar turned down money for a professorial chair in government studies because the donor insisted that the professor teach a particularly conservative point of view we would n't take money to , say , establish a football team , or anything else we really did n't want , said ms kavanaugh of vassar but you want people to enjoy their giving , and sometimes they do come up with wonderful ideas one bittersweet example is vassar s alex krieger lecture series in the spring of 1991 , alex , a vassar freshman , died in a car crash his parents established a fund to bring writers humorists in particular to speak at vassar so far , tom wolfe and john irving , two of alex s favorites , have appeared we see these lectures as a celebration of alex s exhuberance and wit , said betty krieger , alex s mother the fund , which the kriegers and their friends continue to replenish , is up to 100 , 000 now
miami , may 11 as more than 20 , 000 cuban refugees prepare to leave the american naval base in guantanamo bay for the united states , 230 haitian children and teenagers who will be left behind are pleading with president clinton to be admitted as well , saying in a letter , we cannot hold on any longer the children , who have been kept at the base because there are no adults accompanying them , have grown increasingly restive in the 11 months since they set out for the united states in boats camp 9 , the tent area where they are being kept , experienced its first disturbance on wednesday when the children pelted soldiers with rocks and oranges and set two tents on fire , military officials at guantanamo said there were only minor injuries on both sides , the officials said , but after the incident 20 boys and three girls were taken to another camp , where they will be segregated from the others for at least seven days while they receive counseling the haitian children have shown the strain of being caught in this limbo mental health workers on the base say there have been suicide attempts , none successful on monday , in a letter signed camp 9 and sent to president clinton , the haitian children , most of them ages 14 to 17 , pleaded for the chance to set foot in your land , the land of opportunity they wrote some of us are going crazy we do n't know what to expect master sgt marvin kusumoto of the air force , a spokesman at the base , said the children were very disappointed when attorney general janet reno announced last week that the cuban refugees would be admitted into the united states over the next 10 months but that the fate of the haitians remained the same repatriation to haiti unless it is determined that the best interest of the child is in the united states twentythree children have gained entry under the policy , but most are expected to return to haiti of the 21 , 000 haitians who fled political violence in their homeland last year and ended up at guantanamo , all but 220 adults have been repatriated since november but advocates for the children say that the situation in haiti is still dangerous despite the return of president jeanbertrand aristide last october and that the minors are terrified of going back to the violence they escaped cheryl little , a lawyer with florida rural legal services , said all the children remaining at guantanamo had relatives or sponsors in the united states willing to take them justice department officials say no child will be returned until the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the red cross trace relatives in haiti and make sure there is an adequate home for the child but this week a report from ms little s organization and the public counsel immigrants' rights project in los angeles asserted that some of the 59 placements made so far had been careless of 12 repatriated children located by the organizations last month , two were homeless , three had parents in the united states , two lived in squalor and one was about to be evicted from her house with her mother , the organizations said barbara francis , a spokeswoman for the high commissioner , said the two homeless children and the three with parents in the united states had not gone through the placement process , probably because they had turned 18 or had been accompanied by adults and were repatriated with them she said onemonth followups on those placed had revealed no significant problems we 've only sent kids home to parents and families who have wanted them back , ms francis said we would n't send kids back to the streets of haiti but niels frenzen , who heads the immigrants' rights project in los angeles and visited with the repatriated children , said the government abdicated its responsibility by sending minors or those who aged out in the camps to improper living conditions or away from parents the government is saying they were acting in accordance with the child s best interest , he said we 're saying they 're not meeting their standards efforts to help the children gain admittance to the united states , including a petition to the united states supreme court by the haitian refugee center in miami , have failed clinton administration officials say that haitians can go back to a democracy , unlike the cubans \( in a new policy intended to prevent a mass exodus , cubans trying to leave are now sent back \) on tuesday , sergeant kusumoto said , a group of haitian minors began a hunger strike to protest not being included in the policy that releases the cubans the next morning , he said , the group became belligerent when an older refugee reported to the camp s guards that the teenagers were forcing younger children to skip breakfast oranges from the breakfast meal became ammunition against responding troops , and the fire set on two tents spread to two more , burning down the shelter and destroying belongings of about 40 of the children , sergeant kusumoto said
more than a dozen leading software producers , publishers and online services are forming a consortium to create the technology standards needed to filter pornography and other questionable material from the internet the standards initiative , called the platform for internet content selection , or pics , is being formally announced today it is clearly the computer industry s effort to provide a privatesector alternative to government censorship of the internet , by allowing parents and schools to protect children from offensive material using specialized blocking software the industry effort , under the auspices of the world wide web consortium based at the massachusetts institute of technology , comes as congress considers two legislative approaches to controlling content on the internet the senate in june passed the communications decency act , which would impose severe penalties on those who distribute sexually explicit material on the internet critics say it is overly broad , covering everything from child pornography to profanity , and may be unconstitutional in response to the senate bill , the house passed the internet freedom and family empowerment act , which calls for industry to set standards and develop software for filtering content both the senate and house proposals are amendments to the telecommunications reform bill , and the differences will be thrashed out in conference committee over the next several weeks american hightechnology companies are lobbying hard to defeat the senate amendment , sponsored by senators jim exon , democrat of nebraska , and daniel r coats , republican of indiana and today s industry initiative is partly a step to demonstrate that the private sector is moving to address parents' concerns for his part , senator exon remains skeptical that industry efforts alone are enough i salute anything the industry can do to stop the garbage on the internet , he said but none of this blocking software is foolproof so far the companies in the pics group are developing technology standards so that all filtering programs would have certain elements of common software code it intends to distribute the accepted standards free by early next year the group would develop a platform for rating systems , but not a rating system parents could determine what internet sites their children could tap into , or they could adopt the rated lists that are expected to be supplied by outside groups , possibly ranging from the american civil liberties union to the christian coalition the internet is at a crucial point now , because it s becoming a mass medium , said rob glaser , a software executive who will be chairman of the pics group parents have real concerns , and the industry is responding he added we are trying to come up with solutions that are wholly consistent with the civil libertarian ethos of the net and this country s tradition of free speech we think the exon bill is exactly the wrong approach the corporate members of the pics group include microsoft international business machines corporation apple computer netscape communications att mci communications america online compuserve , a unit of h r block prodigy , owned by ibm and sears , roebuck time warner viacom s nickelodeon service , and others a couple of startup companies , like surfwatch software inc of los altos , calif , have filtering software already on the market its program blocks access to certain locations on the internet , including playboy magazine s world wide web site
bal harbour , fla , feb 21 frustrated by labor s constant losses , the leaders of the nation s most powerful unions debated today whether to remove lane kirkland as president of their federation , the aflcio , and replace him with someone they consider more aggressive and effective the gathering of 33 union presidents , in a rare executive session , took place at the aflcio s winter meeting , and there was a note of urgency republican control of congress promises antilabor legislation major strikes drag on unsettled wage increases in union contracts grow smaller each year and the clinton administration pushed through two trade agreements , despite labor s opposition all this has focused attention on reversing the decline and mr kirkland has become the first item on that agenda there is a general sense that something has to be done that is not abrasive and tearing , said ron carey , president of the international brotherhood of teamsters but what is happening has to happen before turning to mr kirkland , the union presidents , who make up the aflcio s executive council , heard half a dozen clinton administration officials and democratic party leaders proclaim their commitment to labor they argued , in effect , that the union leaders should put aside their complaints and once again be supportive the high point of this effort came on monday , the opening day of the aflcio s fourday meeting , when vice president al gore announced that president clinton would issue an executive order intended to stop government agencies from signing purchase contracts with companies that permanently replace workers on strike congress defeated such a prohibition last year , and the aflcio criticized the administration for failing to campaign hard enough for passage we had been aware for some time that the administration was working on this idea , and we were all gratified by the administration s forthright position on worker replacement , said thomas r donahue , the aflcio s secretarytreasurer the executive order would speak to a gut union issue over the past two years , permanent replacement workers have played a role in strikes against caterpillar inc and the bridgestonefirestone company and a lockout involving the staley works , a corn processor in decatur , ill all three companies continue to operate but the new executive order has not been written yet , labor secretary robert b reich said today , and it is likely to have loopholes it might not apply , for example , if a multinational company holding federal contracts hired permanent replacements to work in a division other than the one handling the contracts we are still determining the scope of the order , mr reich said in addition , companies that hired permanent replacement workers before the executive order is issued would not be affected , administration officials said and a government agency , advised of a violation by one of its contractors , would have the option of ignoring the order for existing contracts , although new ones might be prohibited mr kirkland himself presided over the debate on his future , a debate that might not be settled by the time this meeting ends only four men have served as president in the 109 years of the aflcio and its predecessor , the american federation of labor , and none so far has left office short of death or illness mr kirkland , who is 72 , a former ship s officer and maritime union member , succeeded george meany in 1979 , but he never became the colorful , often cantankerous jawboner for labor that mr meany was nor , in an era of strong management and relatively weak labor unions , has he embraced solutions favored by some of the member unions , like working with management to improve productivity , or forming coalitions with church or environmental or community groups to strengthen labor s hand a half dozen or so union presidents are pushing for a replacement for mr kirkland , including gerald mcentee , president of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , john j sweeney , president of the american federation of government employees , and richard l trumka , president of the united mine workers but none have proclaimed their positions publicly and there is little talk here of who might be mr kirkland s successor mr kirkland acknowledged at the opening session yesterday the grumblings against him and offered the union presidents an opportunity to express their views , several presidents reported all of the sessions are behind closed doors , even the presentations made by mr gore and the democratic party leaders but unlike the executive session this afternoon , the others are attended by a host of aides photo lane kirkland , head of the aflcio , at a meeting of labor leaders yesterday in florida \( susan greenwood for the new york times \)
alexandria , va , june 30 eight teams of america s best female players began play here thursday , with two due to qualify for world championship play in beijing in october the first day of play was dominated by a team captained by phillip alder of manhasset , li , that includes a federal judge , amalya kearse , and jacqui mitchell , both of manhattan an unheralded squad from seattle , led by gene simpson , played steadily to take second place with 10 of 14 qualifying rounds finished , the scores by captain were 1st , alder , 67 2d , simpson 61 3d , john lowenthal of manhattan , 56 4th , gail greenberg of manhattan , 52 5th , sue sachs of baltimore , 49 6th , jan shane of white plains , 45 7th , steve robinson of arlington , va , 44 8th , peter nagy of chicago , 28 \( all captains are nonplaying except mrs greenberg \) when qualifying play ends tonight , the top four teams will earn the right to go into semifinal play saturday the kearse team gained substantially on the diagramed deal by making a borderline slam with a little help from the defense kearse and mitchell , sitting north and south , bid to six clubs as shown east doubled to request a lead of dummy s heart suit , but that proved unimportant south ruffed the second heart lead and drew trumps with the queen , king and ace dummy and east threw hearts south could now count 11 tricks and had three chances for a 12th the first was an even spade split , second was a singleton or doubleton diamond queen and third was a squeeze the last would operate if west held the diamond queen and the majority of the missing spades none of these were due to succeed , but east had trouble defending the bidding had suggested , misleadingly , that south held four diamonds , so east assumed a 2146 distribution when south cashed another trump , throwing the last heart from the dummy , east should have done likewise and then copied dummy s discard if south led her last trump instead east threw a spade , and dummy scored the 12th trick in that suit that was 1090 , a gain of 12 imps in the replay , northsouth rested in three notrump , which was unbeatable because the hearts were 44 diagram
odessa , tex traffic lights that clank and blow and even break in the wind may not be much of a problem in your hometown but in west texas , where powerful gusts frequently rage across the open land , vibrating traffic lights are indeed a vexing issue that is why researchers at texas tech university , at the institute for disaster research and the wind engineering research center , have spent nearly three years and 275 , 000 in state grants to study a windcaused phenomenon known as galloping this form of wind stress causes hanging traffic lights to blow a foot or more up and down in the air , occasionally cartwheeling over and over , and , rarely , to crash down onto the streets below , becoming lethal at worst and useless at best how to stop it \? in the end , the texas tech researchers found the answer blowing in the wind , just as the old song promises but to begin with , they had to set up shop indoors , in a special tank where various wind patterns were simulated after about a year and a half of study , then we took an actual signal structure and installed it at our field site , said kishor mehta , director of the wind research center the field site was , literally , an open field in lubbock , not a road there the scientists observed the effect of wind on their traffic light while measuring things like the speed , drag and direction of wind , the relative humidity , the barometric pressure and the temperature the specific wind problem studied , galloping , is a form of vertical vibration , mr mehta explained in an interview , as opposed to the more common sidetoside motion called buffeting , which most traffic lights are built to withstand galloping , vaguely akin to the wind shear that can suddenly bring down airplanes , causes cracks and metal fatigue in the lights and , so far , has been all but unpreventable unpredictable , too state highway officials suspect galloping in the breakage of several west texas traffic lights while dangerous , none of those incidents have resulted in death but thanks to the study , a solution may be at hand and a simple one at that earlier this fall , the researchers announced that they had managed to control the air flow dramatically by installing a small , flat piece of metal a few inches above the light the device , called a damper plate , has already been put on top of a few lights in the lubbock area , and the state department of transportation , which has mailed copies of the report to 125 local , state and federal agencies , expects it to be commonly used in the future while the study consumed a 275 , 000 grant , the device it produced is a relative bargain how much , installation included \? oh , said mr mehta , i would suspect no more than 50 or so a hole , or a tourist trap \? west texas is home to yet another natural phenomenon a meteor shower that struck just outside what is now odessa 20 , 000 years ago local officials here are hoping to promote the spot where the meteors struck as a tourist attraction the site a 600footwide gash , more than 8 feet deep in places , on meteor crater road in a bleak sea of oil fields just off the interstate freeway that heads west to el paso looks , well , a lot like a big hole in the ground but the officials say the site is full of history and mystery they are convinced that , with proper marketing , passersby on the highway could be persuaded to stop in the odessa region for a look it s a piece of something from outer space , said tom rodman , the head of an odessa chamber of commerce committee working to develop the site it s weird there s a lot we could put on display , from the odessa meteorite and other meteors , if we had a display room ector county , matching a 7 , 500 national park service grant with its own money , plans to build a stonelined path and interpretive trail through the mesquitelaced site the spot was designated a registered natural landmark 30 years ago and was home to a small museum in the 1960 s but vandals sacked the place , and it was eventually torn down the display items were sent to the county library as large meteor strikes go , the one near odessa is one of the most recent to strike earth , and it carried more power than an atomic bomb but as a tourist site , it faces competition from an older , 5 , 000footlong crater in arizona , and from a mexican site on the yucatan peninsula , and extending offshore , where a meteorite shower struck tens of millions of years ago , apparently wiping out the dinosaurs getting tough on tortillas for a while , things were getting out of hand this year among the footballcrazy fans at texas tech literally first came the great flap over a tech tradition , of uncertain origin , in which fans throw tortillas on the field to celebrate scores or harass the competition the school was chagrined during the nationally televised cotton bowl last season when tech boosters successfully threw tortilla after tortilla out onto the field while the team was having a tough time passing the ball , losing to the university of southern california by 41 points so this year , school officials sought to crack down on the problem citing an ncaa rule that prohibits thrown objects on the field , they announced that the red raiders could be penalized 15 yards if even one tortilla landed on the field this season while that threat has largely worked , the school found itself in another embarrassing scrape last month , when a university of texas mascot , rex l the bat , was pummeled by tech band members at a game in austin the mascot was rescued by two travis county sheriff s deputies and by the longhorn band members who push the giant drum called big bertha around the stadium nineteen tech musicians were suspended from the band the mascot s right wing was broken , but the person inside the costume , rosevelt hawkins , was not seriously injured the school issued an official apology to the bat , saying , situations of taunting and retaliation are counter to the positive spirit of athletic competition that our university has fostered
melbourne , australia , tuesday jan 24 on a sunny morning that would have been idyllic were it not for the intrusion of the resident blowfly population , the australian open gained its first two semifinalists michael chang , who has designs on ending his sixyear slam drought here , used his patented neversaydie technique to aggravate and eliminate andrei medvedev , 76 \( 97 \) , 75 , 63 and mary pierce , balanced by her imperious grace , continued to move through the draw at a furious pace , dimissing natasha zvereva , 61 , 64 the victory sent the fifthseeded chang , who had n't passed the third round in two previous trips here , into his first slam semifinal since the 1992 united states open chang s first and only slam title at the 1989 french open caught him by surprise , but over the past year he s developed a different attitude about his chances of winning a second crown i'm hungry for the next grand slam title , and i know my time will come , said chang i'm not afraid to play anybody chang will tackle defending champion pete sampras or twotime champion jim courier in the next round the 13seeded medvedev seemed resigned to a loss after taking a hard spill midway through the tie breaker , but he turned stubborn after falling behind 51 in the third set and twice thwarted chang as he served for the match staked to five breakpoint chances , the fourthseeded pierce converted them all , and in the first set she hit the appropriate service box with 90 percent of her first serves , a success rate that stultified her eighthseeded opponent i'm seeded fourth , so on paper i'm supposed to make it to the semifinals , said pierce , who gained her first semifinal here over all , i'm pretty happy , but it s not over yet pierce cruised to a 40 lead in the first set , shook off a 44 stalemate in the second , and accomplished her mission in 59 minutes according to pierce s head coach , nick bollettieri , the player has now reached that pivotal stage in her development where the physical part is there , the strokes are right there and now it s just a matter of whether she s ready mentally to become a grand slam champion as she did during her halcyon run to the 1994 french open final , pierce has not yet dropped a set and her route toward the final has been somewhat softened by the removal of gabriela sabatini , the player who defeated her on both previous visits while pierce held her position today , that was not a precedent followed by her fellow seeded players in several fourthround clashes on monday taken on a journey to a place he truly did not want to go , into a fifth set with aaron krickstein nipping at his heels , stefan edberg began to behave like an unwilling traveler not that long after the lengthening shadows turned his twosetstonone lead into a distant memory on the stadium court , the sixthseeded edberg succumbed 67 \( 86 \) , 57 , 64 , 76 \( 75 \) , 64 to the 45thranked upstart from michigan for jana novotna , seeded third , the journey was far briefer , but the destination was the same the veteran from the czech republic , at 26 the oldest member of the women s top 10 , was upended in straight sets , 75 , 60 by the 96thranked angelica gavaldon the pattern here was simple as the match was short gavaldon , who attracted notice when she ousted 15thseeded lori mcneil in the opening round , put the ball in play and novotna sent it out of bounds it was just horrible i do n't know when i 've played so bad , but i 've been struggling the whole tournament , said novotna , whose first three matches all required third sets novotna concluded the match with the stroke that has become her signature a double fault carried her to match point and the ensuing double fault guaranteed gavaldon , 21 , into her second career slam quarterfinal edberg , too , found his serve broken in the final game of his epic struggle with krickstein the 29yearold edberg had defeated krickstein in their last seven meetings and , up 52 in the fourth set , seemed on the verge of humbling him again and reaching his 11th consecutive quarterfinal here but krickstein , intractable on the baseline whether serving or receiving , gradually broke down his opponent s backhand along with his patience and unbeknownst to edberg , krickstein used one of his discontinued yonex magic racquets , vintage 1989 , which not so coincidentally happened to be the last year he 'd beaten the swede i picked up some of the old racquets i 'd beaten him with in 1989 i felt like i was playing my best with those racquets , and that i do n't have much time left , said the 27yearold krickstein maybe they 're magic racquets , i do n't know , he said after making his ninth successful comeback from a twosetstonone deficit krickstein crept back into the fourth set and sent it into a tie breaker where he converted his third set point by ripping a backhand return across and the net and out of edberg s reach sensing some deflation on the part of the swede , krickstein immediately banged his way to a 30 lead in the final set before edberg , who undermined his efforts with 76 unforced errors , commenced his futile comeback he whacks a lot of balls back , he never gives up , and that s probably how he won the match it feels strange to lose a match like this , said edberg , who s made continual references to his dwindling chances to collect an eighth slam crown in monday s muchhyped and muchtelevised late night match , the last australian hope , patrick rafter , was shown no mercy by secondseeded andre agassi the telegenic local hero made a very anticlimactic exit the mood inside the soldout stadium held the electricity of a las vegas prize fight , but rafter failed to put up much of a fight as agassi , who has n't yet dropped a set , demolished his 21stranked challenger 63 , 64 , 60 on the women s side , arantxa sanchez vicario left herself just three matches away from this title , and steffi graf s no 1 ranking ,

the first day of new york city s latest crackdown on mafia domination of the fulton fish market dissolved into chaos early yesterday as hundreds of workers staged a wildcat strike , virtually halting seafood distribution and prompting mayor rudolph w giuliani to threaten a temporary shutdown of the market asserting that some workers and merchants were trying to sabotage his plan to clean up the market , mr giuliani warned that he might reorganize it by hiring new workers and by licensing different merchants to do business there if disorder continued under a law that went into effect on sept 1 , the city has the power to determine who can work and run businesses in the market , the nation s largest wholesale seafood distribution center police officers were out in force early this morning in an effort to avoid a repeat of the disruptions the predawn walkout yesterday came hours after the city installed a new company , the laro maintenance corporation , to unload fish and seafood there and evicted six companies that federal investigators said were suspected of being linked to mobsters almost no seafood or fish was sold at the fulton market yesterday buyers for city restaurants scrambled to line up other sources of seafood and fish , and most said they were able to assure a steady supply the workers who walked off their jobs were employees of the approximately 60 wholesale seafood vendors that operate at the market they said their job action was a show of solidarity with the 40 employees who lost their jobs when the six unloading companies were evicted the eviction and the walkout produced hours of confusion and tension for workers , the police and the market s customers at one point , the market was plunged into almost complete darkness when master electrical switches were tampered with and employees roamed around the market , disrupting operations the tension continued into this morning , as the police escorted wholesalers to and from the market when the wholesalers arrived to deliver their fish , they stopped at a checkpoint for police officers to enter the trucks the officers then stood by as each truck was unloaded , and later escorted it out of the market to another checkpoint several blocks away for some outoftown wholesalers , what would normally have been a two or threehour delivery turned into a journey that found them in the city for almost 24 hours some distributors said small retail stores in the new york area might soon be without seafood or fish if the market was disrupted another day or two they said they would have to seek supplies from markets in philadelphia , in boston and on the pacific coast , raising the likelihood that customers would pay higher prices wholesale dealers in the market said their individual losses in potential sales yesterday ranged from 20 , 000 to 100 , 000 representatives for the 60 vendors estimated that far less than half of the 500 , 000 pounds of fish that flows into the market each workday was delivered , but because of the chaos , virtually no buyers could enter the market if there is a repeat performance tonight of last night , a sternfaced mr giuliani said yesterday at city hall , we will close the market , and we will reconstitute the work force and we will make certain that the work force is not influenced by organized crime , not influenced by corruption and not influenced by the desire to commit illegal acts or to extort people who do business there , or the city of new york it would be better for the city actually not to have the fulton fish market if it s going to be operated the way it has been for the last 40 , 50 , 60 years more than 100 million pounds of fish and seafood are sold each year at the market , generating about 1 billion a year in business but for decades , officials say , much of that money has wound up in the pockets of organized crime , setting off a seemingly endless series of oftenfutile crackdowns by law enforcement agents city officials , federal prosecutors and a temporary federal administrator have charged that the six evicted companies , known as unloaders , were a mobinfluenced cartel dictating fees paid by the dealers and the manner in which trucks were unloaded by doing so , the officials contend that the companies had an economic stranglehold over the movement of perishable supplies into the market and were not permitting dealers to switch companies the owners of the six unloading companies have denied any ties to organized crime and none have been indicted or charged with a crime under the new system , officials say , the laro company has cut unloading costs by about 20 percent and guaranteed to unload cargoes on a first come , first served basis but from the moment the laro workers took over late sunday night , confusion and congestion reigned , and most wholesale dealers said the old system was more efficient than the new arrangement the drivers who brought seafood in refrigerated 18wheel trailers from ports as far away as new brunswick in canada and the gulf of mexico complained that the laro crews were incompetent , mishandling the forklifts and pallets used to remove cargo and transport it 50 to 60 feet to merchants' stalls laro , based in bay shore , li , has no experience in seafood distribution the company s business has largely involved cleaning office buildings , airports and the statue of liberty the drivers said that if the disruptions continued , seafood suppliers and transportation companies would shy away from the market because of possible financial loses they have no idea what they 're doing , said bryan sullivan , a driver for jds refrigerated transporation of chelsea , mass , who waited seven hours to be unloaded they 're doing everything

identity and we 'll be well received everywhere with a quebec passport the cheers resound to the rafters hundreds of people , some of the younger ones with blue fleursdelis painted on their faces , stomp their feet and mount a chorus of lucien , lucien , lucien twelve hours a day , lucien bouchard , a truck driver s son from a remote quebec village and the driving force of the campaign to pull the province out of canada , plays to quebec s pride and its sense of betrayal by english canada mr bouchard s appeals to quebec s 48 million eligible voters of whom 82 percent are primarily frenchspeakers to back independence in a referendum on monday could force canada to confront the unthinkable its own breakup quebec is canada s largest province and its second most populous in the event of a separatist victory , mr bouchard says , it could be up to a year before independence is proclaimed he says he wants an economic union with the rest of canada as part of an orderly transition , but threatens an immediate declaration of independence if ottawa refuses to negotiate prime minister jean chretien has refused to be drawn out on how he would respond , but his options include a legal challenge and a second referendum to put the question of separation to all canadians , not just quebecers the separatist surge in the three weeks since mr bouchard , the leader of the parliamentary bloc quebecois , took the reins has put victory within reach , alarming federalists and many of canada s allies , and rattling canadian financial markets the latest poll by groupe leger leger placed the contest in a dead heat the poll , however , was conducted from last monday to thursday , just before an enormous rally on friday brought tens of thousands of federalists from all over the country into the streets of montreal while declaring a reluctance to interfere in the referendum , president clinton has expressed puzzlement as to why such a great model for the world would want to break up canadian federal officials have hailed the americans' comments but the deputy premier of the proseparatist quebec government , bernard landry , said bluntly that in the event of a victory for independence , the voters will remember that the sovereignty of quebec was achieved despite or even against the american will on monday , prices on the toronto stock exchange experienced their largest oneday drop in more than six years the canadian dollar has also weakened , forcing the central bank to raise interest rates , which could slow growth and increase mortgage rates for all canadians if you 're going to lock in your mortgage , do it now , mr chretien advised his countrymen last monday signs of capital flight were also manifest in the rush of inquiries to banks about transferring money out of quebec or converting quebec investments into cash the market reaction underscores one of the overriding issues of the battle while mr bouchard and his fellow separatists promote nationhood to preserve a distinct french cultural identity in a sea of englishspeakers , federalists point to unacceptable costs , including higher taxes , increased unemployment and economic isolation should a split actually occur separatists ignore the costs of the new political structures , said laurent baudouin , chief executive of bombardier inc , a producer of planes , trains and skimobiles and one of quebec s leading companies , as well as the consequences of a devalued quebec currency and the unavoidable rise in interest rates fearful that market reactions could influence voters , the quebec government ordered its financial institutions to buy hundreds of millions of canadian dollars this week in an attempt to check the slide of the currency and reassure quebecers against the drumbeat of attacks on the economic front , mr bouchard and his separatist followers promise that independence would shrivel deficits , restore pride , protect french culture and redress all wrongs mr bouchard , who less than a year ago had his left leg amputated to check the advance of flesheating bacteria , took over the daytoday management of the flagging campaign from the quebec premier , jacques parizeau , a former quebec finance minister who lacks mr bouchard s charisma on the campaign trail , mr bouchard walks slowly with a cane , usually accompanied by his americanborn wife , audrey aides are steps away to shield him from overenthusiastic crowds when he speaks , he lays his cane aside and leans forward on the podium toward his audience , rarely consulting notes although mr bouchard advocates nationhood for quebec , his notion of a newly negotiated political and economic partnership with canada is at the heart of what has apparently proven to be a successful strategy many quebecers including , pollsters say , about a third of those who would vote yes to sovereignty do not want a complete break with canada but rather greater leverage for quebec within the federation
king of prussia , pa , nov 2 not so long ago , most shopping malls seemed to be principally the domain of teenagers , who cruised through them regularly in search of cheap shirts , orange julius and each other but here at the king of prussia mall , which opened its doors today as one of the biggest and glitziest examples of mall renovations in the country , judy george envisions a rather different customer she is between 30 and 50 years old , said ms george , the chief executive officer of domain , a home furnishings store she lives in a dualincome home of 60 , 000plus she s individualistic a decision maker the king of prussia mall , about 25 miles northwest of downtown philadelphia , is just the latest example of the trend among more successful malls to turn themselves from large shopping centers featuring one or two department store anchors , lots of shoe stores , a toy shop , a gap , and a place to buy engraved doodads into mammoth upscale shopping centers in a retail market with too many stores angling for consumer dollars , the hottest malls contain well over a million square feet of space , at least six or seven anchor stores and dozens of speciality shops that cater to middleaged customers with money to burn in just the last year , several popular malls around the country have expanded substantially these include the short hills mall in the new york city suburb of summit , nj the woodfield mall in schaumburg , ill , near chicago , and the second of two malls in northern virginia , tyson galleria ii , at one of the biggest intersections of the washingtonarea beltway a handful of super malls have been sprouting up around the country for a decade , the most famous in bloomington , minn , home to mall of america , but the big expansions of older malls are a new twist on the theme and to add to the malls' appeal , famous stores like tiffany or barneys , which are more closely identified with urban centers , are often brought in to draw suburbanites from an entire region last year , renovations and expansions of malls outnumbered new construction by two to one , according to mark schoifet , the spokesman for the international council of shopping centers king of prussia is now the biggest such mall , with nine anchor stores , including neiman marcus , nordstrom and lord taylor 450 specialty shops , and 35 restaurants and many more mall developers are pursuing similar strategies , mr schoifet said it s extremely expensive to build a new mall , he explained developers find their money is much better spent enhancing existing properties that are already prospering mall developers have also been tapping sources of cash that were not available four years ago , either through their own public offerings , or through traditional lenders who reentered the real estate market after the giant credit squeeze of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s there is always a risk , said richard smoot , the president of pnc bank , which financed the king of prussia project but clearly it was helpful to know that this had already been a tremendous success there is a sharp distinction between the renovated , 33yearold part of the 28 millionsquarefoot king of prussia mall , which cost developers 225 million , and its newer counterpart the plaza and the court , respectively , were previously known to locals as the poor mall and the rich mall , because of the different demographics they attracted the poorer plaza was expanded and now there is a stark difference between new areas that gleam with stores like tiffany and company , joan and david , fao schwarz and swatch , and the other section , where sam goody , j c penney and things remembered stand as reminders of more downscale shoppers no longer the focus at king of prussia but where will the customers come from to feed king of prussia s growing appetite \? it s darwin s theory , mr schoifet said the strong will get stronger and the weak will have to find a way to survive developers expect 10 million shoppers annually , from the middle atlantic region in many regions , shoppers may find over the next decade that they will have to drive to superregional malls serving a huge swath of suburbia strip malls will gradually replace the smaller malls lacking strong anchors and a critical mass of smaller shops department stores are the backbone of supermalls to lure them , developers provide rentfree space , which helps draw hundreds of smaller tenants who pay 40 and more per square foot in annual rent i have n't seen a supermall go under yet , said kirk palmer , who runs his own executive search firm for retailers , kirk palmer associates it is a smart thing for developers to do because department stores , which got killed in the late 80 s , are making a comeback but that does not mean that the bargain shopper is ignored for instance , oilily , a glossy children s clothing store , will sell next to its 40 tshirts a less expensive line that it does not offer in manhattan tiffany is expected to offer a bigger selection of its less expensive merchandise , said lloyd miller , the vice president of leasing for the kravco company , which developed the plaza in 1962 , and also updated it during a tour of the mall , mr miller beamed at the giant television screen in the warner brothers studio store i call this an interactive mall , he said the customer can look , touch , taste the products for all of its newness , though , the plaza at king of prussia feels much like any other mall , a bit impersonal and sterile but none of that seemed to bother the wideeyed customers who flocked to the premiere i think it s fantastic , said grace glenn , who was rushing off in search of the tiffany store it is long overdue

moscow , may 22 european security officials said today that the leader of the separatist rebels in the southern region of chechnya has agreed to take part in direct peace talks with representatives of the russian government in grozny later this week a spokeswoman for the organization for security and cooperation in europe , speaking in vienna , said all parties russians , chechen separatists , and chechens allied with russia have received invitations and agreed to attend talks the organization has tried for six months to halt the war in chechnya the chairman of the osce has officially proposed the holding of talks between parties involved in the crisis in chechnya with a view to reaching a peaceful settlement of the crisis , an official of the security organization said today all invitees have accepted the invitation the head of the russian administration in the region , nikolai semyonov , said the talks could begin as early as thursday , at the organization s office in grozny but there was no confirmation from the rebel leader , dzhokhar m dudayev , that he had accepted the invitation , and circumstances made it appear unlikely that negotiations were imminent mr dudayev was reported today by his information minister , movladi udugov , to be working on his own peace proposal but one aspect of it that all russians leave chechnya before hostilities cease would clearly be unacceptable to moscow on the other hand , there could be few more unpalatable notions to mr dudayev than sitting down with salambek khadhiyev , the man whom russia has installed as prime minister of occupied chechnya never will such talks take place , khamad kurbanov , mr dudayev s personal representative in russia , told the interfax news agency today there have been many attempts at peace talks , negotiations and ceasefires since russian forces went on the offensive in chechnya in december none have lasted more than a day or two no serious talks have been held since the beginning of the war , which has taken the lives of thousands of civilians still , both sides have strong reasons for seeking peace russia is eager to bring an end to a military adventure which has caused the deaths of thousands of soldiers , humiliated its army and helped bring president boris n yeltsin s popularity to a low from which many political observers say he cannot recover chechnya , on the other hand , has been all but destroyed in the past several months grozny , once a thriving city of 400 , 000 , is a ruin the war has now moved south to the mountains , where the rebels may hold out for a long time , but at a terrible price russian warplanes have been brutally attacking the villages there for weeks now

eveless eden by marianne wiggins 337 pp new york harpercollins publishers 23 marianne wiggins s fifth novel is an ambitious project a love story and a tale of international political intrigue , replete with chunks of recent history \( the fall of the berlin wall , the overthrow of ceausescu \) that function both as backdrops and as plot devices the narrator of eveless eden is an american foreign correspondent named noah john , tough and battleworn but not so disillusioned that he does n't still believe in the healing property of human love the story begins in 1986 , when , on a routine assignment covering an ecological disaster in cameroon , he meets a ravishing photojournalist named lilith da vinci , sassy and independent but not so unyielding that she wo n't give him a sexual down payment on the plane back to paris noah and lilith fall in love , and everything is peachy until her heart is stolen by the devilish romanian minister of trade , adam pentru \( all the main characters' names play out the story s pre and postlapsarian motif there s even a romanian translator called eva as well as eve , a machine that converts spoken words into type \) adam leads lilith and noah into a grim nether world of political corruption , from which the dashing pair will eventually emerge with the most shocking scoop of their careers in her last and bestknown novel , john dollar , ms wiggins demonstrated a fondness for slightly quirky syntax and arcane vocabulary here , simulating the slangy , smartaleck language of a newspaperman , her prose naturally takes on a more robust hue \( in her acknowledgments , she gives thanks to a host of journalists , in whose company she was allowed , for research purposes , to be both vigilant and delighted \) but , as is often the case when writers attempt to recreate the idiom of an industry or community not their own , ms wiggins tends to overdo the glamorous insiderness of her characters' dialogue , with rather corny results any present danger \? noah nonchalantly inquires of a source when he first arrives in cameroon this ai n't your baby , baby , the man on the foreign desk tells him when turning down his request for an assignment none of this bears much resemblance to the way journalists really talk , but on the other hand it s not a bad approximation of how a news hack with literary pretensions might like to imagine they do indeed , one is often half persuaded that ms wiggins has set out to produce a parody of the sort of selfserving , purple monstrosity that such a hack might pen in his twilight years read in this way , as caustic satire , eveless eden is a work of some genius noah s elaborate worldweariness , his outbursts of sensitivo philosophizing , his toughguy cursing , his portentous oneline paragraphs \( she was wearing cotton panties which , in the moonlight , looked incandescent \) are all achingly accurate the short sample he offers of his journalistic prose a grimly anecdotal account of the cameroon disaster is a perfect imitation of a tired reporter s formulaic lede his poetic descriptions of lifechanging sex are thrillingly authentic in their awfulness \( lilith was a pounding surf a pelvic strength that challenged like a riptide , needed to be fought against \) at some point , however , the fun and games must end , and a reader must confront the scary thought that this novel is not , after all , an elaborately wrought joke but an utterly earnest endeavor the suspicion arises not least because howlers keep creeping into the story that cannot be attributed solely to the narrator s ludicrous viewpoint describing his and lilith s first encounter with adam pentru , for example , noah recalls that adam wore a black velvet jacket , black jeans pegged over a pair of cowboy boots and a tshirt that read been there done that his hair was the color of an ostrich egg his eyes were the color of night even if we swallow the notion of a romanian minister of trade wandering about london in 1989 dressed like someone at a milwaukee swingers' club circa 1978 , can we really be expected to believe that anyone let alone lilith , that avatar of photojournalistic cool , that ravishing sophisticate whose apartment in paris has a fridge full of beluga caviar , white bordeaux and canisters of film would find this character sexy \? i think not ms wiggins is a brave writer , and her determination to compose a fiction so vigorously engaged with the issues and events of the recent past is not to be scoffed at finally , however , eveless eden is a novel too consistently off target in tone and characterization to achieve the kind of drama and pathos she seems to be aiming for as every reporter knows , even the noblest intentions ca n't save you from the editor s spike drawing
seoul , south korea , dec 5 south korean prosecutors today indicted former president roh tae woo , who presided over a major part of the transition to democracy , on charges of accepting at least 370 million in bribes seven of south korea s most prominent business leaders were also indicted , on charges of paying bribes to mr roh today s action sets the stage for a public trial of mr roh \( pronounced no \) , perhaps as early as this month , on charges punishable by a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison we could not but conclude that this was pure bribery related to his official position as president , ahn kang min , the lead prosecutor , said at a news conference this afternoon mr roh , who was arrested last month and is already in prison , has been disgraced along with his predecessor , chun doo hwan , who was arrested on sunday both are expected to be indicted soon on other counts as well , for staging a coup in 1979 and for crushing a prodemocracy uprising in the city of kwangju in 1980 those charges are punishable by death , though almost no one expects the former presidents to be executed the indicted business executives include the heads of huge conglomerates like the daewoo corporation and samsung group , some of the biggest corporations in asia but none of the seven were jailed , and they will apparently be punished without being imprisoned the government was concerned that their arrest could harm the national economy in addition , there is a broad feeling in south korea that the executives did not take the initiative and are less culpable than the leaders who solicited the payments the scandal has been a national embarrassment , underscoring how corruption permeated south korean politics , business and journalism this scandal is a real shame , choi pyong kil , a professor of public administration at yonsei university , said today whether young or old , rich or poor , all koreans feel guilty mr ahn , the prosecutor , said mr roh had admitted under interrogation that he had used more than 180 million in his slush fund to support campaigns in parliamentary elections in 1988 and 1992 mr ahn said the prosecutors planned to investigate exactly where this money went such an investigation could lead to further political upheavals in south korea , for there is widespread speculation that many senior politicians perhaps including president kim young sam may have benefited as mr roh parceled out the sums he is said to have collected in bribes under interrogation , mr roh has insisted that while he received donations from executives , the money was not bribes but gifts for political operational funds mr ahn said the prosecutors rejected that argument because some of the money had been used for personal expenses and because mr roh retained a great deal of it when he left office in 1993 in addition , mr ahn said mr roh took money in exchange for using his powers to help or hurt companies in another indication of the political turmoil here , the chairman of the governing party , kim yoon whan , offered to resign today , although the resignation was not accepted he suggested that he did not agree with president kim s recent decision to prosecute the former presidents for their role in the 1979 coup and the 1980 kwangju massacre mr chun took power in the 1979 coup and was the autocratic president of south korea from 1980 to 1988 mr chun chose mr roh , another former general , as his successor but mr roh submitted to a democratic election and won , serving as president from 1988 to 1993 in an era of expanding democracy

the united states department of housing and urban development has begun a preliminary inquiry into accusations from brooklyn and queens residents that real estate brokers are using tactics like race baiting to persuade them to sell their homes , a federal housing official said last week typically the practice , known as blockbusting , involves an agent claiming that property values will drop because members of minority groups are moving into the neighborhood the agent tries to persuade the homeowner to let him sell the house before the values drop , and the agent then gains a commission it is a very serious issue and concern , said elizabeth k julian , who heads the agency s fair housing division in washington , and is one of the oldest and most invidious forms of housing discrimination but it can be complex you do n't want to prejudge an issue over the last three years , the fair housing division has received 45 complaints of blockbusting throughout the country and none of them were proven , ms julian said the office receives 10 , 000 housing discrimination complaints a year ms julian said her office was made aware of the problem last week by representative charles e schumer , a democrat of brooklyn if his complaint is substantiated , violators could face 50 , 000 in civil penalties and lose their realestate broker s licenses , she said mr schumer said in an interview that 30 residents accused brokers of making bigoted comments on visits to their homes and using coded hints about change in mass mailings the inquiry focuses on 11 real estate agencies in woodhaven , glendale and south ozone park in queens and the brooklyn neighborhood of canarsie , he said blockbusting complaints resurfaced in new york in 1994 almost as soon as the state , under court order , reversed a series of bans on homeowner solicitation by brokers that began in 1971 , after abuses by agents in the 1960 s and 1970 s when the ban was lifted , thousands of residents began complaining about unwanted phone calls , impromptu visits and fliers from agents trying to drum up business but most complaints treated the deluge as an annoyance rather than a violation of fair housing laws in july , the new york department of state issued a ceaseanddesist order in queens , parts of the bronx and nassau county , barring agents from seeking out homeowners who did not wish to be contacted mr schumer , who represents parts of southern brooklyn and slices of southern and central queens , said he went to the federal housing department because the new york state office had not gone far enough he said the office should be trying to restore the bans neighborhoods are being ripped apart by a small bunch of rapacious and repugnant real estate brokers , he said what s so galling about this is that it was a problem that was solved and it was undone in one of the most asinine court decisions i 've ever witnessed i think the secretary of state is asleep at the switch michael e stafford , new york deputy secretary of state , said workers had been following up on complaints of abuse in areas where the ceaseanddesistorder is in effect and monitoring brooklyn to determine if it should be included hud certainly has a role to play in all of this , mr stafford said

the first time i went to parioli romanissimo , i was horrified the prices seemed outrageous but that was three years ago , and while the restaurant s prices have not changed , my outlook has in the interim , i 've moved to new york and discovered exactly what you pay for when you buy a rack of lamb for 3550 space and quiet and discreet service parioli romanissimo is one of new york city s most civilized restaurants the small , subdued dining room occupies the ground floor of a gracious town house , and from the moment you walk in , the staff tries to make you feel as if you are dining in a private home the captains play the role of butler they are thoughtful , retiring , unopinionated and if there do happen to be some other people in the room , well , they 'd just as soon you overlooked it that can be hard to do , however , for the oldfashioned tableside cooking sends seductive aromas into the air each time the rack of lamb is prepared , the scent of vinegar , mustard , herbs and garlic goes floating across the dining room that smells so good i 'd like to have some lamb for dessert , a friend said one night as we were finishing our cheese he was not kidding the lamb is spectacularly good some of the other dishes are , too the chef clearly cooks each risotto to order , and each one i 've tried , whether it was asparagus , seafood or a simple milanese , has been perfect grilled shrimp in a marinade of garlic and herbs are beautifully cooked , gently flavorful the rack of veal with rosemary and juniper is sweet and tender , with the scent of gin at the bone and it comes with a fabulously buttery broccoli puree pastas are also exemplary gossamer tagliarelle tossed with porcini mushrooms is as good as any pasta i 've had in new york \( and for 2475 , it should be \) i love the fedelini with tomatoes and basil too a half portion is the perfect way to begin a meal or it would be if the restaurant had the sense to take that piece of parmesan cheese off the cart and grate it over the pasta instead of offering pregrated sawdust and that , ultimately , is the problem with parioli romanissimo there is a shocking lack of attention to important details why should a restaurant that charges this much for pasta be using pregrated cheese \? with prosciutto this good , should n't someone have tried the figs and determined that they were tasteless \? a restaurant that prides itself on having one of the largest and most attractive cheese carts in the city of new york should surely ascertain that every cheese is ripe and any restaurant with a reputation for service should know better than to bring the check to the man when it was the woman who requested it occasionally the food is sloppy , too soft , lovely rounds of fresh mozzarella with marinated peppers are accompanied by arugula that has grown large and tough grilled sole is crisp and delicious , but many of the fish are dull even rouget , the tastiest fish of the mediterranean , seems as if its fine flavor has been magically removed but the wine list is the major argument against a meal at parioli romanissimo finding a good bottle at a reasonable price is extremely difficult still , the people who eat at parioli romanissimo are not trying to save money and people for whom money is no object can find many reasons to spend it here the creamcolored dining room is understated and so beautifully lighted that everybody looks attractive the staff is adept at pampering its patrons the food has evolved over the years until much of it is as elegant and understated as the room itself but the main reason to dine at parioli romanissimo is simply that an intimate dining room with space between the tables has become one of the ultimate luxuries so when you feel like pampering yourself with a relaxing evening , you could do worse than a meal at parioli romanissimo begin with a salad , an order of beautifully sauteed shrimp or a bit of risotto continue with a plate of pasta or some of that fabulous lamb have some cheese \( make sure that you choose the ripe ones and do n't miss the camembert from hollow road farm \) and a bit of fruit finish with the fine , light ricotta cake or zabaglione with raspberries sometimes the cook goes into the hallway to make the zabaglione you can hear the whisk hit the bowl with each stroke of his arm and know that nearby a man is beating eggs with a single goal in mind your pleasure it almost takes the pain out of the bill parioli romanissimo  24 east 81st street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 2882391 ambiance the small , cream colored dining room is luxurious in an elegantly understated way service your captain would like to be your personal butler he is solicitous in a carefully distant manner and does a great deal of tableside cooking and carving recommended dishes risotto grilled scampi fedelini with fresh tomatoes tagliarelle with porcini mushrooms rack of lamb rack of veal whole dover sole roasted chicken cheese from the cart zabaglione with raspberries wine list although there are many excellent wines at high prices , they are not balanced by good wines at lower prices hours dinner 6 to 11 pm mondays through saturdays price range appetizers 1175 to 1575 , entrees 2850 to 3550 , desserts 12 and 16 credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility the entrance is up five steps but restrooms are on the same floor as the dining room what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews hundreds of times restaurant reviews are available on line from times , an arts and entertainment guide on america online software and information 18005485201
listening to america twentyfive years in the life of a nation , as heard on national public radio edited by linda wertheimer illustrated 438 pp boston houghton mifflin company 2495 the sound and the story npr and the art of radio by thomas looker 421 pp boston a richard todd book houghton mifflin company in theory , national public radio should n't work financed mostly by private donations , it also relies on federal subsidies that ought to subject its news coverage to the nefarious influence of washington politicians as every schoolchild must know , a free press which means a press free of government is essential to a democratic system certainly there have been plenty of examples around the world of censored , biased , governmentcontrolled media soviet radio , television and newspapers were cheerleaders for a decaying system , burying economic failures , environmental catastrophes and illfated foreign adventures like afghanistan if a soviet leader had made the equivalent of president boris yeltsin s absurd declaration last month that no military action was taking place in chechnya , moscow television would have reported it dutifully , without showing pictures to the contrary even in the democracy of israel , government television has at times contributed to widespread ignorance by toning down news of palestinian suffering under israeli occupation when the rightwing likud bloc was in power , anguished palestinian voices rarely got on the air by contrast , npr has avoided biases that government might appreciate and reward its two newsandfeature programs , morning edition and all things considered , shame the commercial networks with more intelligent and less editorial reporting than private broadcasters provide this anomaly persists even as republicans threaten to eliminate funding for public broadcasting , a move that heightens the value of three recent books that display npr s virtues linda wertheimer and robert siegel , two of the hosts of all things considered , have each edited an impressive volume of transcripts of various touching , analytical , whimsical , historic , gripping interviews and reports ms wertheimer s listening to america twentyfive years in the life of a nation , as heard on national public radio covers npr s entire existence , from antiwar demonstrations to the republican victory last november mr siegel collected the npr interviews 1994 , which appeared last fall and includes the best of 1993 from richard avedon to archbishop desmond tutu and in the sound and the story npr and the art of radio , thomas looker , a producer who has worked as a writer and reporter for npr , goes into the studios for a meticulous examination of the personalities and processes that have revived radio s artistry , once lost beneath the gloss of television the most telling message of all three books is not addressed explicitly , but for anyone with the patience to read attentively , it reverberates throughout the texts of the broadcasts it is this the liberal political bias that some conservatives imagine simply is n't there nor is there any accommodation to the white house or to congress , no matter what the party in power listening to america includes a prescient and devastating report by mara liasson on the candidate bill clinton s tendency to shift positions an early indication of his inability to stand by difficult decisions there are transcripts of stories that fainter hearts , dependent on government funding , might have shunned nina totenberg s scoop \( along with newsday \) on anita hill s charges against clarence thomas , daniel zwerdling s vivid account of the dissembling that led to the space shuttle challenger s explosion , brenda wilson s caustic description of the opulence of the reagan inaugural celebrations the poor , if they attended , were in disguise , she remarked in a foreword to listening to america , bill buzenberg , vice president for news at the network , rebuts the myth that npr s audience consists of mostly welltodo liberals polling , he says , shows that just over half of npr listeners hold only a high school diploma and almost a third have college degrees nearly half have household incomes of less than 40 , 000 just over onethird describe themselves as conservatives , just under onethird as liberals , and the rest are middleoftheroad perceived distortions by npr are not political , mr looker writes in the sound and the story they are created by the mechanics of technology and news gathering experts who are chosen for interviews are those with particular verbal skills , mr looker observes a whole range of ideas and opinions a vast region of experience and understanding eludes articulation in a two or threeminute exchange , in the case of television , or a four or fiveminute presentation , in the case of npr typically , discussions that add historical perspective or that argue more than two or three alternatives to a question will not fit into such shortened frameworks the real struggle at npr , mr looker notes , is between journalism and art between the growing trend toward harder news and the more reflective use of sound to conjure up a sense of scene here , fine radio can be as rewarding as literature , for the listener must work with his imagination , in which received language and sound mingle with inner speech each individual consciousness tumbles through pirouettes of metaphor and meaning achieving a special kind of intimate knowledge newt gingrich ought to add these books to the occasional reading list that he distributes among colleagues , but he wo n't they would muddy the conservatives' purity of argument in the eternal american debate over how much government we should tolerate this country has always nurtured a healthy distrust of government , which can be good for democracy unless taken to the extreme by bombmaking militias society is produced by our wants , and government by our wickedness , thomas paine wrote a couple of centuries ago society in every state is a blessing , but government , even in its best state , is but a necessary evil in its worst state an intolerable one with that as ideological background , npr emerges as a remarkable model of government s creative interaction with society it s too bad that none of these books examine how this is accomplished since npr works better in radio than private enterprise does , it challenges some venerable american doctrine and needs to be preserved
houston , may 31 the san antonio spurs have not controlled hakeem olajuwon they have not controlled a single game of the three played so far on their home court and forget about trying to control dennis rodman as a result , the houston rockets hold a 32 lead in the western conference finals , a bizarre series in which neither team has won at home who can predict what will happen next \? but if the rockets win game 6 on thursday night at the summit , the defending nba champions will return to the finals a remarkable feat for the no 6seeded team in the conference olajuwon s performance in game 5 tuesday night was so masterful \( 42 points , 9 rebounds , 8 assists , 5 blocks \) , even veteran dream watchers were spellbound we were in awe , and we see him every day , said clyde drexler , houston s guard , after olajuwon and the rockets dismantled the spurs , 11190 i kept saying , 'there s no way hakeem can keep making those shots , ' said spurs guard doc rivers i looked like a fool meanwhile , rodman had another bad hair day after arriving 35 minutes late for monday s practice and showing up just 55 minutes before game 5 , he was benched for the first 7 minutes 11 seconds by coach bob hill when rodman finally entered the game , the spurs were off to a lousy start , and rodman was never himself , finishing with 5 points and 12 rebounds in 34 minutes , including just 2 offensive rebounds so the spurs were left with two things they did n't need another home loss and another rodman controversy rodman was at practice today in houston , and hill said he would likely start game 6 while rodman did not answer questions from the news media , hill did and he defended his decision for benching rodman despite the importance of the game and the importance of rodman s rebounding and defensive skills why would i change now \? hill said him not starting last night had no effect whatsoever on our performance none it s about the fiber of the team if i start him , then i lose certain guys on the team so then where am i going \? i get rodman for 40 minutes , but i do n't get two other guys at all that s what this league needs more than ever now if you 're going to have a team , then you better have an organization that s on the same page every winning player wants to be disciplined , but they will test you some guys will test you for two days some guys will test you for a week some guys will test you the whole year that s why you 've got to be consistent with your discipline asked if hill should have asked the players to decide whether rodman would be benched , rivers said i do n't know if there s a right answer if he had asked me to vote , i'm not going to tell you my vote you look at what bob did , and it has worked before this time we got caught we missed dennis s energy , and it threw off our whole bench rotation it would not be fair to question hill s handling of rodman without criticizing rodman himself rodman said he was late for practice monday because he had a stuffy nose and head did n't he think it was necessary to let the team know he was going to be late \? was n't he worried about becoming an issue again at such a critical time \? apparently , the answer to those questions is no which is why having rodman as an integral part of any team is a risky proposition i asked dennis , 'why did n't you pick up the phone and call , ' hill said 'then we can deal with it' this chapter of my book is going to be the best while the spurs tried to forget another rodman distraction today , the rockets concentrated on ending the spurs' season in game 6 olajuwon has put his mark on this series with actions , not antics david robinson \( 22 points in game 5 \) was voted the league s most valuable player , but no vote is necessary to determine that olajuwon has been the better player in this series olajuwon had too much class to gloat after today s practice about outplaying robinson but he talked about how much he enjoyed playing with this group of rockets , an unselfish group that puts winning first i'm just concentrating on being at the top of my game , said olajuwon i know i'm playing against david , so i have to be mentally prepared but if you worry about the battle , you could lose the war i'm worried about the war i 've been on teams where players wanted to compete with you for shots they wondered why the ball did n't go to them more that player is smallminded when you talk individual , you take away from the team concept if you have a legitimate center , you have to build the team around him we play with one another , there s no competition we play the team concept and together , the rockets have gone farther than most people expected they would probably wear their road uniforms for game 6 if the league allowed it but at some point , one would expect the home team to win olajuwon hoped it would happen thursday i 'd rather play the game here , olajuwon said of playing at home it s an advantage , but it s not an advantage if we do n't take advantage of it i hope we can
kobe , japan , feb 4 colds and flu viruses , the medical aftershocks of last month s devastating earthquake , are rippling through the refugee camps where 270 , 000 people live huddled together in classrooms and tents here in western japan , and some of the fragile elderly are dying of the flu but this week when an american relief organization offered to fly as many as one million doses of flu vaccine to kobe within 48 hours , free of charge , the government politely declined the health and welfare ministry explained that japanesemade vaccines would be sufficient , even though by its own calculation it would not have enough vaccine ready for nearly two more weeks the rejection of foreign flu vaccine is not a surprise elements in the japanese bureaucracy were also unenthusiastic , at least initially , to offers of foreign doctors to treat the injured , foreign dogs to sniff out those buried alive , foreign medicines to heal the sick , and foreign undertakers to prepare the dead a mountain of tylenol still sits in a locked warehouse because officials expressed concern that it may not be appropriate for japanese bodies normally it is western business executives who gripe about bureaucratic stonewalling as they try to penetrate the japanese market but in the aftermath of the earthquake that was centered here , the biggest losers and complainers have been the japanese people themselves when the japanese government refuses aid , it s not following its heart it s just acting out a diplomatic game , said kazuko tatsu , a 61yearold woman living among several families in a classroom of a school surrounded by the rubble of less solid buildings mrs tatsu s eyes danced angrily as she referred to japanese press reports about the agriculture ministry s attempt to enforce a quarantine against four french dogs that had been rushed to kobe to search for people entombed alive in the debris the dogs did not in the end have to go through the quarantine , but their arrival was delayed until four days after the jan 17 earthquake , and by then it was too late for them to do much good the nine victims that the dogs sniffed out through the rubble were all dead the government officials should be able to switch their minds more quickly in an emergency like this , said mrs tatsu , who added that she would like a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available we do n't really care what s happening among the top officials , but we 're very grateful for the help medicine tylenol sits in a warehouse japan proved to be formidable market to crack even when the aim was not to sell medical supplies to japan but to give them to the sick that much is apparent inside the locked doors of c warehouse on rokko island , just offshore from kobe in a corner on the cement floor are 14 forklift pallets of tylenol an american relief organization , americares , rushed the tylenol to kobe as part of a planeload of medical supplies sent immediately after the earthquake with 26 , 000 people injured in the quake , the tylenol seemed an appropriate contribution but tylenol is not licensed for sale in japan an arduous process and japanese officials set it aside health officials complained that the dosage might be inappropriate for japanese bodies , according to andrew hannah , executive vice president of americares \( similar arguments have been used before a cabinet minister once declared that japan need not admit american beef because the meat would not be compatible with japanese intestines \) it is true that doses vary a capsule of extrastrength tylenol contains 500 milligrams of acetaminophen , the active ingredient japanese products similar to tylenol contain only 300 milligrams of acetaminophen the problem with the government s concern about earthquake victims overdosing on a capsule of tylenol is that some of the japanese pain relievers like noshin , a wellknown product advise taking two capsules at a time , or 600 milligrams of acetaminophen health and welfare ministry officials deny that they are keeping out foreign goods , and say that in this emergency situation they are willing to allow the entry of medicines that have not been approved in japan mr hannah of americares said he was informed by the authorities on thursday that the tylenol which he had been ready to ship to the philippines since it could not be used in kobe would now be distributed among the earthquake victims yet , even if the authorities say they have shifted their stance , the 14 pallets of tylenol remain stacked in c warehouse on rokko island a spot check at several clinics for earthquake refugees turned up no sign of tylenol , and none of the doctors had heard of it decisions the system falters in emergencies the japanese authorities were cool to foreign offers of assistance in part because they did not realize how bad the damage was prime minister tomiichi murayama learned about the disaster only when he happened to turn on the television once the government had made a decision to accept a particular offer of assistance , it was usually efficient and helpful , say officials with americares and other relief organizations the problem lay with reaching a decision in the first place , partly because the japanese authorities operate by a process of consultation and consensus building called nemawashi
los angeles , aug 9 something is missing from the program cover for the pga championship in the beauty shot of riviera country club s legendary 18th hole , framed through a clubhouse window , there is no sign of the defending champion the tee is off in the distance the pine , sycamore and eucalyptus trees line the fairways part of the green is visible below the wroughtiron , mediterranean balcony and nick price is nowhere to be seen he has , in a sense , vanished the cover is an appropriate , if unintentional , symbol of what has become of price in the past year his predicament snaps into focus today , on the eve of the 77th pga championship once , his picture was on the cover of every golf magazine it was just 365 days ago that price was the preeminent player in the world , a nearly unbeatable golfing machine , a man who was in a zone where the air was so rarefied he was being compared with byron nelson and ben hogan by none other than ben crenshaw a man in full flight , crenshaw said then one year ago , he won seven tournaments around the world he was on a twoyear run that included 16 victories and 39 top 10 finishes he won more than 7 million on the golf course in that span since his first major championship victory in the 1992 pga championship it all caught up to him the pressure of commitments representing a new golf club company and trying to develop a design for the new clubs moving his home from orlando , fla , to jupiter island in hobe sound , fla , and trying to compete on the course took its toll he has become sort of the golfing claude rains , which is to say , the invisible man this whole year , i 've been trying to play catchup , said the 38yearold price looking back now , moving house was the hardest thing to do when your family is growing and you want to spend more time with your kids and then you move house , it just seems like golf is second in the year since he demolished the field at southern hills to win his second pga championship and his second major of the year , price s game has gone cold he has won once , at the canadian open , since that victory the same man who was so dominant that greg norman joked that the only way to cool him off was with a fire extinguisher has been replaced by norman at the no 1 spot in the sony world ranking price has not won this year he missed the cut at the masters after opening with a 66 at the united states open , he went south , finishing tied for 13th he was not a factor at the british open , and even got a little testy there about what he perceived as a snub by the royal and ancient their offense \? they left his picture off the program cover and he did n't get favorable starting times sic transit gloria , eh , nick \? more than anything else , i was hurt with the fact they had left me off the cover and the fact they had given me such a poor starting time , he said but price is showing some signs of a pulse lately during his practice rounds here at riviera , he has been sharp , driving the ball straight and long and hitting his irons crisply last week he finished seven strokes out of the playoff at the buick open , and he was encouraged by it i'm really happy with the way i 've been playing the last six or seven weeks , he said i think the best way to describe it is that i'm playing probably at the same standard i was before i started playing really well last year most of the parts of my game are all there it s just a question of putting them all together the putting part of it could be dodgy , especially since riviera s new greens have not matured , and will probably spike up during the championship but price figures that could help him , since the better putters will be neutralized by the bumpier surfaces once , that would n't have mattered but it has been a bumpy year for price he has had just two top 10 finishes in 14 united states starts any advantage he can get , he will take he is ready to reclimb the ladder , and this would be the best place for him to start , in the year s final major against a field with 48 of the top 50 players in the world that is the strongest in golf history he is ready to jump right back into the fray and into the frame , the one on the cover , that was empty it s been nice to let someone else carry the torch for a while , he said but i'm getting back into it i'm just sort of poised , i suppose , waiting to turn my game up that extra notch

washington , june 27 an effort by house republicans to abolish the council of economic advisers has drawn criticism from past council chairmen from both parties , who say it provides the president with an important independent source of economic advice a proposal to cut funds for the council s operations will be considered on wednesday by the house appropriations subcommittee on the treasury , postal service and general government representative jim ross lightfoot , the iowa republican who is chairman of the subcommittee , said last week that even without the council the president would have enough economists in the office of management and budget and the national economic council laura d'andrea tyson , president clinton s first chairwoman of the council of economic advisers and now chairwoman of the national economic council , said representative lightfoot has a notion that is not based on the reality of what is going on in government she said the council of economic advisers , which was established in 1947 , provided objective economic analysis , and had a role that was different from either the budget office or the national economic council at the white house none of these people is underutilized , she said everyone is working more than full time by any reasonable characterization of hours in a day the council of economic advisers often looks at proposals for government action and points out that some idea will have bad consequences , she said for example , she cited warnings from the council early in the reagan administration that large deficits and high longterm interest rates were putting pressures on the american manufacturing system economists at the office of management and budget , she said , have another mission budgetary analysis and the national economic council , she said , arranges the meetings and memorandums from which the president makes economic decisions herbert g stein , chairman of the council under president richard m nixon from 1972 through 1974 , was even blunter i think it s a stupid idea , he said , adding that the council was the only group of economists in the government that does n't have some agency ax to grind the council has a staff of about 40 it has a budget of 34 million , mr stein said the president is making decisions about a 7 trillion economy i think we can afford to give him the best possible advice mr stein said most other government economists promoted the interest of the department or industry to which they are connected he said the council s advice against building a supersonic transport aircraft during the nixon administration saved the country more than the whole cost of the council for 50 years the main thing the council does is give the president a view of his options , mr stein said even if he disagrees , he makes a better decision because he has seen what his options are democrats on the subcommittee plan to oppose mr lightfoot s proposal , arguing that it was inappropriate to be playing games with the white house budget , as representative steny h hoyer of maryland put it if the proposal is approved by the subcommittee , it could still be reversed by the full committee or the whole house , or by the senate
only a few months after the colombian government began arresting the top leaders of the cali drug cartel , law enforcement officials said the supply and potency of cocaine in new york city is dwindling , forcing wholesale and street prices to soar in what officials described as the most precipitous shift in almost six years , the wholesale price of cocaine has increased nearly 50 percent since may , while retail prices have gone up 30 to 60 percent or more similar increases , they said , are evident in other big eastern cities dependent on new yorkbased cali operatives for supplies in addition , they said , recent seizures and intelligence indicate that the size and number of shipments of cocaine into the new york area have declined only four months ago , federal agents say , shipments weighing 1 , 000 pounds or more were coming into the city in trucks , ships and airplanes now , they typically weigh less than 200 pounds the shifts are also evident in the city s drug markets drug dealers in washington square park said this week that the same gram of cocaine that sold for 50 in may now goes for 80 , an increase that they said was beginning to drive away younger buyers who come to greenwich village from new jersey 'i 've been around 39 years , said one washington square dealer , whispering as he gave knowing glances to prospective buyers walking through the park so i know when they bust the big guys in colombia , that s when the coke goes up law enforcement authorities cautioned that the shifts in supply and price might be temporary , evidence of another periodic realignment of international trafficking networks with little longlasting importance but they said that the declining sizes of cocaine shipments and five recent fatal shootings between competing drug gangs in queens appeared to be strong signs that the world s richest drug trafficking organization is at least going through a painful period of adjustment maybe it s only a breather that is benefiting the community , said peter a crusco , chief of narcotics investigations in the queens district attorney s office but relatively little is coming in the biglevel people are not risking moving the cocaine officials say cocaine buyers can still find the drug in neighborhoods across the city , but new york police officials say laboratory tests show that dealers are now mixing their small bags and tins of cocaine powder with 30 percent more sugar or baking powder to stretch supplies on the other hand , officials say supplies and prices of crack the cocainebased drug of choice among many poor users have not been affected , because its purity is low to begin with and abusers need little to become intoxicated though they are encouraged by the tightened supply of cocaine , some police officials expressed concern that shortages of cocaine could eventually increase demand for heroin , which is already gaining in popularity and is mostly distributed by organized crime groups that compete with the cali cartel they also worry that if drug profits continue to be stretched , street gangs competing for customers , territory and supplies could turn more violent , much as they did when crack first became popular in the late 1980 s investigators said information collected through wiretaps and informers indicate that supplies of cocaine are being held up in colombia and mexico , where they are stockpiled before moving across the border , because the leaders who once personally supervised their release are in jail or on the run middlelevel traffickers , the wiretaps and informers indicated , are holding back shipments , in part because they feared that the captured leaders might be trading information about cartel operations in exchange for more lenient treatment the one person who moved the cocaine between colombia and mexico , miguel angel rodriguez orejuela , is out of commission for at least the moment , said a senior drug enforcement administration official who spoke on condition that he not be named one can logically surmise that right now there is a quandary , a state of confusion , and problems with people hooking up with the traffickers both in colombia and mexico the most striking effect of the arrests in colombia have so far been at the wholesale level of the drug trade , officials said responding to the decreased supplies , several law enforcement officials said top cocaine dealers have increased their prices to their largest distributors to an average of 26 , 000 per kilogram , from 18 , 000 only four months ago in detroit , the drug enforcement administration has reported an increase in wholesale prices from 22 , 000 to 32 , 000 per kilogram in the last two months alone a bodega owner in washington heights with broad knowledge of the cocaine trade in new york said the recent increase had forced middlelevel dealers to drop some street sellers , shave profits , dilute their inventory and hoard supplies in case the current shortages continued a lot of people are just holding onto their good stuff for when prices really go up , he said the last time cocaine prices in new york rose so much and so fast was in late 1989 , when a shooting war broke out between the medellin cartel and the colombian government the medellin group never recovered , but within months the cali cartel picked up the trafficking slack , and prices returned to normal levels state department and law enforcement officials said that mexican trafficking groups and smaller colombian cartels operating on colombia s northern coast are now jockeying for new markets mexican traffickers have already taken control of much of the cocaine market in the southwest , they said , and wholesale prices there have not risen as sharply as in new york but thomas a constantine , the head of the drug enforcement administration , said in a recent interview that there was no cartel waiting in the wings that could match the cali group s financial resources , political clout in colombia , and international trafficking connections nobody out there even compares , he said , saying that the cali group had already surpassed the medellin cartel in sophistication and resources at the time of the medellin group s downfall but mr constantine and other officials cautioned that it was too soon to tell how harshly the colombian authorities would punish the six top cali leaders they captured this year united states officials noted that the cartel leaders were able to negotiate some of the terms of their surrender , and none have suffered confiscations of illgotten gains like their mountainside mansions or fleets of yachts in addition , the united states officials say , the cartel leaders are still able to communicate with their lieutenants sporadically through family members who visit them in jail and by paying off guards but perhaps because their telephone conversations are being monitored , the officials say , they have not directed their underlings to release huge loads of cocaine warehoused in colombia and mexico whatever the longterm impact , lawenforcement officials say , the latest price rises demonstrate that the cartel s top leaders direct the most minute details of their cocaine wholesale operations in the new york area recent captures of cartel records include items like personnel evaluations and con edison bills we have done investigations involving wiretaps , said robert h silbering , the special assistant district attorney in charge of citywide narcotics cases , that show a direct link from the streets of new york to the estates of cali
of all the tragedies of the holocaust , that of the german jews has to have been the most intimate auschwitz did n't just demonstrate the ease with which their entire community could be reduced to household products it turned their very identity into a contradiction in terms it was the ultimate rebuff to what walter benjamin once called the german jew s unrequited love for germany this exquisitely personal sense of loss , in any case , is the explanation of choice for scholars struggling to understand how hannah arendt and martin heidegger the german jewish debunker of totalitarianism and the nazi philosopher who were lovers before the war , could have become friends again after i think she did not want to believe that what had happened had contaminated the past completely , says seyla benhabib , a political philosopher who teaches at harvard she wanted to believe that something could have been saved after the catastrophe beyond that , says elisabeth youngbruehl , author of the definitive arendt biography and the first to write about the affair , in 1982 , i think arendt knew that heidegger was , among 20thcentury philosophers , a towering figure there is one explanation , however , that nobody proposed it would have been too crude , too distressing it would have forced us to fantasize an arendt a thinker of exemplary moral seriousness so in the thrall of her first great love that on catching sight of him again , she flings ethical reasoning to the winds until elzbieta ettinger published her book hannah arendt , martin heidegger last month , no one had dared hint at such things and while almost every arendt scholar in america and several in germany \( where the book appeared this summer \) and not a few heideggerians would happily consign ms ettinger s book to the tabloid hell they figure it sprang from it did have a very bodiceripping romantic streak to it , do n't you think \? asks thomas sheehan , a heidegger scholar there is not much anybody can do about it , because ms ettinger had something none of them had access to arendt and heidegger s letters i will tell you how this whole thing came about , says lotte kohler , a friend of arendt s who is now executor of the hannah arendt literary trust these letters , this correspondence , was very dear to her heart when arendt died in 1975 , she asked ms kohler to give them to the archive in germany in which heidegger had deposited his papers of course , i made copies of them before i put them there , ms kohler continues very soon after it became known that her letters were there , martin heidegger s son hermann put restrictions on the correspondence no access nobody is supposed to read it nearly 20 years later , she says , i wrote to hermann heidegger and i said 'both philosophers are dead i think something should be done i think serious scholars should have access to the correspondence' that the first to benefit from ms kohler s new policy was ms ettinger was something of an accident she had simply applied at the right time ms ettinger , a professor of humanities at mit and , like arendt , a refugee as well as a holocaust survivor she grew up in the warsaw ghetto wished to write a biography of arendt , and asked the estate for permission to read the letters ms kohler read ms ettinger s previous biography , of rosa luxemburg , and liked it but not long after she allowed ms ettinger to read transcripts of the letters , the biographer granted an interview to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the newspaper published bits of arendt s side of the correspondence \( hermann heidegger had given ms ettinger permission only to look at his father s letters , not quote from them \) , and ms ettinger realized that the story of the affair would make a good book in its own right when she told me she wants to publish just this chapter of the biography , i said , 'oh , this is terrible , ' ms kohler says she and mr heidegger who says he spotted 50 mistakes in the german edition of ms ettinger s book , although he will not enumerate them have now resolved to publish the correspondence a book is scheduled to appear in about two years perhaps what is most terrible about ms ettinger s decision , for ms kohler , is the wrath it has brought down upon her head the estate should have a policy of not making those correspondences available until they 're available , if you know what i mean , an annoyed elisabeth youngbruehl says otherwise , you get one person s interpretation and nobody can check it ms benhabib , who is just finishing a book on arendt s relationship to modernity , had asked to see the letters sometime after ms ettinger did i wanted to know how arendt assessed the transformations of heidegger s thought her request was denied , because by then ms ettinger , the estate and her german publisher , piper , were caught up in a lawsuit involving ms ettinger s claims that a heidegger biographer had plagiarized her asyetunpublished manuscript ms benhabib says the experience left her strongly disappointed with arendt s estate
sights unseen by kaye gibbons 209 pp new york g p putnam s sons 1995 a happy ending can be tricky , especially in a book with as much cruelty and pain as kaye gibbons s new novel , sights unseen although her subject is a manicdepressive mother and the havoc she wreaks on her family , ms gibbons believes in the good of the world just as strongly as in the bad to have tacked the medical miracle of maggie barnes s recovery onto the end of the story would never have convinced us so ms gibbons spells it all out in the first few pages the illness , the recovery through electroconvulsive therapy , and maggie s untimely death in a fall 15 years later not that the opening is any boring old flashback from a hospital bed or funeral instead , everything is steeped together in a rich stew of years what s more , ms gibbons continues in this fashion for much of the novel , jettisoning a traditional chronology consider , for instance , an incident in which maggie runs a woman down with her car \( supposedly for trying to steal her soul \) right after this , ms gibbons skips back a halfdozen years to introduce maggie s more subdued but equally troubling relationship with her housekeeper , pearl wiggins somehow and here may be the miracle such juggling is accomplished without ever being confusing or arty or contrived the story is told by maggie s daughter , hattie , who was conceived in an unsuccessful attempt to save her mother s sanity that is , having a baby was hattie s father s idea during maggie s manic phases , lovemaking itself could be nonstop in fact , maggie nearly kills him with her sexual demands hattie is sometimes bewildered when she gets off the school bus in the afternoon and finds her father adrift in the house in khaki pants and a rumpled undershirt , looking like a hallwalker in a veterans' hospital , spent and forlorn sometimes things get so bad that he has to go to a relative s house to get some sleep because hattie details her reactions as both child and adult , this situation evokes almost simultaneously distaste , pity , amazement and even amusement maggie calls the only roman catholic she knows of , asking what to serve when she s planning a dinner for robert kennedy , one of the many men she imagines she has been put on the planet to be worshiped by hattie s sights are always set at a delicate intersection of the ordinary and the horrific early on , she describes how maggie screams herself hoarse on her son s birthday when he scrapes his spoon on his bowl of ice cream , a sound she claims she can hear all the way upstairs , preventing her from sleeping after the child makes a nasty remark in return , maggie s fatherinlaw , mr barnes , bullies him into apologizing a small incident , perhaps , but that s what makes it the perfect illustration of how maggie s illness seeps into the very fiber of the household the events in ms gibbons s books have got quieter since the child narrator in ellen foster was hounded from household to household by dead bodies and drunks but i do n't think any of the villains in her other novels compare to rich old mr barnes , who coldly denigrates his sons and grandson when he is n't squiring maggie around town and paying for her manic shopping sprees none of the evildoers in ellen foster had anything but a temporary sway over the narrator s physical situation here maggie s husband actively encourages her continuing relationship with his father today s therapeutic culture has created a dichotomy of victims and victimizers in which good people have to prove how much they 've suffered \( though never in silence , unfortunately \) and bad people , no matter how pernicious their behavior , are probably victims themselves and so to be pitied i prefer ms gibbons s take , in which there is never any excuse for what the bad people do , however complicated they may be also , the good people in sights unseen are not really victims at all , at least not in the usual sense when her mother dies , hattie s first regret is for her own lost childhood her brother , whose encouragement is probably most responsible for hattie s later professional success , refuses for years to have anything to do with their mother and leaves the room as soon as she enters even their father , whose role is closest to the usual victim s , is clearly weakwilled as well as forbearing ms gibbons delineates all this with an economy that makes a standard psychological novel look as full of irrelevancies as a phone book i was glad that ms gibbons s last novel , charms for the easy life , found the large audience her work deserves , but i like this book even better it is more intense , more vibrant , both richer and stranger besides , it will give you a new answer the next time someone trots out that printisdead stuff at a cocktail party no movie could fool with chronology the way this novel does
iselin , nj , may 24 the great mythic symbol of scientific invention is the eccentric loner sweating away in a makeshift lab , chasing a vision that does not even remotely describe john r novak mr novak is a smooth and polished 47yearold salesman he wears monogrammed shirts he does not appear to sweat that made him a target of colleagues when he had the presumption to claim a scientific epiphany he said he thought that automobiles , the most prolific spewers of air pollution ever devised , could be transformed into mobile pollution sponges , sucking dirty , ozoneladen air into their radiators and cleaning it before expelling it there was an awful lot of skepticism , said mr novak , the commercial director of automotive emissions systems at the engelhard corporation , based just north of edison , nj , where another famous inventor once lived and worked i mean , you know , here s a sales guy the invention that resulted , which is now awaiting a patent and which engelhard says may be included on some cars as early as the 1996 model is built around the kind of simple , profound observation that transforms whole ways of thinking and makes people smack the sides of their heads because they had n't seen it themselves instead of focusing exclusively on reducing tailpipe emissions , why not enlist cars as active agents in the cleanup of existing pollution \? i 've been in the field for 28 years , and this is a completely new way of thinking , said dr haren s gandhi , the director of chemical engineering at the ford motor company , which launched a joint venture with engelhard this spring to develop applications of mr novak s idea dr gandhi said that while much study was still needed and the vagaries of the market for any new product can never be fully guessed the design of the engelhard ozone eater is extremely simple and the technology behind it has been around for years it s a new mindset , dr gandhi said the system , called premair , cleans the air by a chemical reaction that destroys ozone \( the main component of smog \) and carbon monoxide as air is drawn through a car radiator coated with the company s platinumbased catalyst , ozone molecules are broken down into oxygen and lethal carbon monoxide is converted into carbon dioxide the system would complement catalytic converters in automobiles , which destroy pollutants before they are released , and could add 500 to 1 , 000 to the price of a car , according to engelhard the development of premair provides a glimpse into how corporate research has changed in recent years in the archipelago of industrial laboratories that ring the new york metropolitan region , from the telecommunications , chemical and pharmaceutical belt of central new jersey through international business machines in the hudson valley of new york and into the defense and aerospace companies of connecticut the traditional world that existeduntil the last few years was hierarchical and structured , with walls separating company functions the trend at newer , flatter , downsized corporations , research experts say , is to assemble teams of people with differing skills and perspectives , then to shake them up and see what happens that a salesman like mr novak would regularly brainstorm with phd s in chemistry is testament to this new era , and perhaps to its fertility as well new jersey ranked fifth in the nation last year in patents awarded per million residents , according to the national science foundation connecticut was second new york came in at 11th place delaware , home to du pont , came in first that s the way all companies are headed these days , said charles f larson , the executive director at the industrial research institute , a trade group the technical function is more closely linked with the manufacturing functions and the planning and marketing research scientists at engelhard who made mr novak s idea a reality said that because it was such a departure from previous approaches to exhaust emissions , it required not only technical development but a profound marketing change as well this is a product that people were not clamoring for because it had not remotely occurred to them to need it usually , you have a problem and we try and solve it , said dr terence c poles , engelhard s director of product development here we had a solution , and we had to go out and find an application for it and while the key inspiration was , by all accounts , mr novak s a moment he cannot clearly remember , but which he readily concedes might well have occurred in a smoky bar under the influence of jack daniels there were some lesser flashes of insight along the way dr poles said he remembered vividly the rainy afternoon at the redwood cafe in san rafael , calif , during a business trip with some other executives , when a further startling realization emerged pollutionsucking technology might actually be most efficiently employed on cars when they are parked and empty , or on the tops of buildings , for that matter one engelhard prototype , for example , features a solarpowered battery mounted on the car s roof it operates the radiator fan , which clicks on by thermostat at midafternoon when groundlevel ozone is at its worst voila ! the parking lot at the mall on a hazy august day suddenly justifies its existence and how much credit to give the local culture \? new jersey , home to edison and einstein , is apparently the only state with its own cable television show offering tips for inventors the program , produced by the new jersey institute of technology , is called new jersey , the invention state , and made its debut last week dr john j steger , engelhard s director of environmental catalyst research and development , gets his best ideas while doodling , going blank at his desk and closing his eyes , he said he is credited with the realization that ozone can be broken back down into regular old oxygen at the colder temperatures of a radiator that kept mr novak s idea alive when hardly anyone else in the company thought it would work but dr steger said he was still mystified by the sources of true originality and inventiveness he said he sometimes takes his lunch to the thomas a edison park memorial tower , a half mile from the lab , to ponder that very question and soak in the aura of the man credited with inventing the world s first industrial laboratory but edison lived in simpler times however much of a wizard he was , he did n't have to deal with marketing consultants , or cleanair regulations collaboration is the name of the game today , dr steger said there are all sorts of things you have to contend with that ca n't be held in one head , he said photo john r novak , left , of the engelhard corporation , with his colleagues jeffrey hoke , center , and terence c poles the vehicle is a company car fitted with the air cleaning device that mr novak devised \( norman y lono for the new york times \)
cairo , nov 29 leaders from five african countries agreed here today on a plan to provide for the safe and voluntary return of nearly two million refugees who fled rwanda after a mass slaughter of minority tutsi by majority hutu last year the agreement , announced after a twoday meeting brokered by jimmy carter , does not provide a timetable for the refugees' return but envisions reaching an eventual rate of 10 , 000 a day within a short time i believe the refugees will return in large numbers when they believe that they will be safe , the former president said at a news conference the continued presence of 18 million rwandan refugees in neighboring countries has strained relations across the region , and the meeting here of leaders of rwanda , burundi , zaire , uganda and tanzania was their first on the crisis but while the leaders said they were determined to encourage the refugees to return home , none would say at a news conference how their plan might succeed after four previous international efforts had failed mr carter conceded that the plan to lift obstacles and provide reassurance to hutu refugees who continued to fear for their safety would depend at first on finding a way to resume a flow that has dwindled to less than 100 a day we feel that when the first ones go home and can testify that they are safe , there will be an increasing number each day who feel that they can return , he said the agreement appeared to forestall a threat by prime minister kengo wa dondo of zaire to expel more than 800 , 000 of the rwandan refugees there at year s end any return by significant numbers of refugees has in large part been hindered because of intimidation by hutu leaders , and so president mobutu sese seko of zaire pledged to disarm and remove such people from refugee camps in his country mr carter said tanzania , which has several hundred thousand rwandan refugees , had agreed to take similar steps against hutu intimidators in camps there but would first need international assistance for tanzanian forces the camps in tanzania and in zaire are housing many of the hutu who took part in the massacres of an estimated 500 , 000 people in rwanda last year , most of them tutsi , and fear returning to a country that is now under a tutsidominated government president mobutu , whose troops forced 14 , 000 rwandans to return to their country in august , did not say explicitly today that he had lifted his government s threat to oust the rest by the end of the month but he said in a national broadcast last week that it would be inhospitable to force refugees back , and neither he nor the other leaders objected when mr carter said all were committed to seeking their voluntary return no one is contemplating forceful return of the refugees , the former president said at the same time , mr carter said the rwandan president , pasteur bizimungu , would request that the united nations peacekeeping mission in the country be extended for three more months , a reversal that could postpone the withdrawal of about 1 , 800 troops who are now scheduled to leave by middecember
new york city has a special board to review civilian complaints against the police one more thing is needed a special board to review police complaints against civilians let police officers come to this board , and tell it how members of the citizenry often not only revile and humiliate them , but prevent them from carrying out their job of making the streets safe let them tell how the lives of police and civilians are endangered not only by thugs who start trouble but by crowds that refuse to get out of the way , turning a disturbance into a riot let the police , patrol cop to commissioner , do this regularly and in public the purpose would not be to exchange insult for insult but to do something of importance needed in new york and every city inform the public about its own responsibility in the keeping of the peace and how it is carrying it out the idea has been on my mind for a couple of years , since members of the public who consider themselves peaceful and lawabiding cheered on and covered up for the relatively small number of neighbors and professional haters who started riots in crown heights and washington heights when the police did move late the anger of the neighborhoods turned against the officers called in to put the rioters down the idea becomes imperative because of two things one is what happened in the bushwick section of brooklyn sunday night after the puerto rican day parade on fifth avenue the other is the disgraceful drunken behavior of new york cops in washington , and the arrest of gangs of corrupt officers in some of the city s precincts taken together they increase distrust between police and public they also obscure the fact that the mayor and the police commissioner are doing what new yorkers want them to do reduce crime by confronting it head on and deal with the public nuisances that make for the disorder that incubates crime it is the giuliani administration s job to deal with police corruption and drunkenness the mayor inherited both but it is his watch now from what we can see he is moving wisely bringing the problem into the open , shaking up the police structure but for once in their lives , new yorkers should face what they themselves do , or do not do , to help the police keep the streets peaceful bushwick after the parade , a lot of people there and in other neighborhoods went on partying for some in recent years that has meant heavy street drinking , burglarizing stores , vandalizing police cars , terrorizing whole blocks , and similar expressions of high spirits all of them happen to be very much against the law , public order , public safety and any minimal respect for neighbors calls came to the police for help about 10 pm , according to the new york times chronology , after bottles were thrown at cops , police were mobilized near the local precinct house more bottles and bricks were thrown at police more cars driven wildly and threateningly through a loudspeaker police gave orders in english and spanish to clear the streets most people paid no attention more bottles , bricks , and firecrackers thrown , windows smashed finally about 1 20 am , police moved in to clear the worst block cops chased up to the roofs to find partyers like the one who had sent an officer to the hospital with a carefully aimed brick the police used some force nightsticks and pepper gas some neighborhood people later applauded some complained that they had been attacked by police even though they were just standing there , all peaceful do n't we have a right to stand on our own sidewalks \? no , not in the middle of trouble that police are risking their lives to put down you do n't , after the police have told you to clear the streets if you still hang around , you get pushed around this may be of some consolation the cops have the duty to protect everybody s life , including people as stupid and arrogant as you of course there will be hearings by the review board on police conduct fine but then , every time there is a riot or nearriot , let s have another hearing by another board , on civilian conduct it will give us something interesting to look at that mirror as long as citizens continue thinking and acting as if keeping the peace were only a job for the police , there will be none
like a captain going down with the ship , encarnita quinlan stood among the halfempty shelves of endicott booksellers and gazed bravely at the bargain hunters picking over the remains of her store , which is closing after 14 years in business on the upper west side of manhattan a sympathetic customer approached and asked , heartbroken \? ms quinlan threw an arm across her chest , struggled for the right word , and settled for yes there is quite a bit of heartbreak among new york city s independent booksellers these days with the arrival of barnes noble superstores , places like endicott s are finding themselves up against the wall , unable to offer the discounts or carry the number of titles found at barnes noble stores , or to serve caffe lattes and flavored iced teas in spiffy mezzanine cafes up and down manhattan , even in brooklyn and the bronx , which have no superstores yet , bookstore owners and some serious readers warn of an approaching intellectual ice age , when impersonal superstores will drive out the city s rich array of neighborhood bookstores others , particularly the hordes of customers who pack the aisles of the barnes noble stores , are not so sure fans of the stores , including publishing executives , say they have brought a breath of fresh air the stores are prospering , they say , because they are well run and a pleasure to visit , with a wide selection of titles , many at discounts what the future promises , some publishing executives say , is a new york in which many generalinterest independent bookstores will be crushed by the barnes noble juggernaut , but the superstores will coexist with specialty bookstores and independents that can diversify or provide a high level of service and expertise there s always a place for a neighborhood bookstore , said lenny golay , coowner of the corner bookstore , on madison avenue near 93d street she plans to open a second store , lenox hill books , in midseptember on lexington avenue between 72d and 73d streets what the small store cannot offer are the discounts and the number of titles available at the superstores barnes noble stores , which carry as many as 150 , 000 titles \( compared with 35 , 000 at endicott s \) , offer 20 percent off all hardcover titles , 30 percent off hardbacks on the new york times bestseller list , and 20 percent off paperbacks on the list but discounts are only part of the story with their wide aisles , clubby decorating schemes , lavishly stocked magazine racks and coffee bars , they have become retail destinations a place to hang out , meet people and attend readings , children s programs and even concerts when i first walked in here , my impression was , 'this is a cool store , ' said danessa atkins , who had traveled from bensonhurst , brooklyn , to shop in barnes noble s chelsea store on saturday you can read whatever you want because they have these lounging chairs and everyone s relaxed uptown , doris ogel was shopping for vacation reading at books company on madison avenue near 74th street she pronounced barnes noble sort of a hassle books company was more like it , she said i come here for certain things , she said they have a wonderful classical library , and a lot of poetry barnes noble is trying , but the people who work there are not real book people real book people or not , the company thinks it has found a winner with the superstore concept last year , barnes noble recorded sales of 953 million from its 268 superstores across the country , up 32 percent from 6146 million from 203 stores in 1993 nationwide , superstores operated by the four largest book chains accounted for 17 percent of the 955 billion in retail book sales last year , up from 11 percent in 1993 that figure is likely to rise as expansion continues barnes noble , whose first new york superstore opened in rockefeller center in 1977 , has opened five more superstores in manhattan , one in queens and one in hoboken , nj , in the last five years it plans to open three new stores in the city by the end of the year , on 17th street across from union square , on broadway at 67th street , and on austin street in forest hills , queens forest hills and lincoln center , which has a few performingarts bookstores only , are more or less virgin territory the union square store will test the downtown market since it is only a few blocks from the barnes noble store on fifth avenue at 18th street , which is itself within hailing distance of the chain s chelsea superstore for independents , the success of the superstore formula means adapt or die after barnes noble opened a superstore at 86th street and lexington avenue in january 1990 , the burlington book shop went out of business so did eeyore s and

los angeles , june 24 in the latest word from what has surely become the most loquacious jury in history , a former juror in the o j simpson case has predicted in a book that despite some instinctive sympathy for a black hero , the largely black jury will convict mr simpson of murder the juror , michael knox , also said that while racial divisions existed on the panel , they were grossly exaggerated by jeanette harris , another former juror who , he said , had her own selfaggrandizing , divisive agenda blacks were nearly as divided among themselves as they were with whites , mr knox said in the book torn by everything from class differences to jealousy , sexual orientation and even bad breath mr knox , who like ms harris is black , took particular issue with her bleak picture of racial tensions within the jury and between black jurors and white sheriff s deputies he called ms harris manipulative , even malevolent , and said she fabricated racial slights where none existed i never saw any deliberate racial attacks by white jurors or deputies against any black jurors , mr knox wrote in my experience , the white people on that jury bent over backwards to be friendly i know that some africanamericans will be angered by that , but that s how i saw it mr knox , a 47yearold federal express driver who was dismissed from the panel in march , wrote that were he still on the jury , he would be leaning toward a guilty verdict i hope o j can prove his innocence , he said but if he s guilty , i'm not going to consider it some kind of defeat for the black race in a 265page paperback book , the private diary of an o j juror \( dove books \) , written with mike walker of the national enquirer , mr knox also described the oppressive , bizarre and infantilizing life of sequestration , in which no doors can be locked , jurors cannot drink a beer , and , even during conjugal visits , jurors worry about having their conversations monitored judge lance a ito removed mr knox from the jury for failing to disclose on his jury questionnaire that he had once been charged with kidnapping that fact surfaced , mr knox recalled bitterly , because prosecutors , convinced he was in awe of mr simpson , started an investigation that mr knox said was designed to remove him from the panel early in the trial , mr knox was the juror who wore a san francisco '49ers jacket and cap while touring the crime scene and later stared intently at the celebrity photographs and trohpies in mr simpson s home mr knox dismissed the kidnapping charge as a momentary spat with a girlfriend and he suggested that prosecutors pegged him incorrectly he wrote that he was wary of mr simpson , even though his charisma hits like a hammer the charm was undeniable , yet came up short of feeling completely natural , he said in the book o j s like a salesman selling a product he believes in totally himself mr knox said that the indiscriminate butchering to which ronald l goldman was subjected belied defense claims that a professional hitman had been responsible this murder had passion and frenzy written all over it , he wrote while blacks instinctively stand up for one of their own , he said , particularly for someone as successful as mr simpson , they are not beyond convincing racial divisions on the jury were apparent , mr knox wrote , from their first communal meal one minute we were a melting pot the next , three separate tables , islands segregated by race , he recalled blacks sat at two tables , whites and hispanics at a third after what he called the prosecution s devastating opening statement , he said , those divisions were starker still at dinner afterward , whites and hispanics talked animatedly among themselves but blacks , stunned and saddened by what they had just heard about a cultural icon , sat silent for half an hour for all their sincerity and the strength of their case , mr knox said , the prosecutors were ineffectual mostly their presentation was truly pathetic sloppy , badly organized , and rarely eloquent , he wrote when the prosecution came up to bat , we the jury started fidgeting he was particularly hard on christopher a darden , who he characterized as a big baby more impressive to him was mr simpson s chief trial lawyer , johnnie l cochran jr \( they do n't get any smoother \) and the rest of mr simpson s lawyers the dream team cost o j millions , but they 're worth every penny , he said while mentioning fellow jury alumni by name , mr knox refers to incumbents by pseudonyms and numbers for present and former jurors alike he also used nicknames the manipulator , the bully , the health nut , the timid beauty , the lesbian , the bitter old man , mister bad breath and the sexpot among them he is particularly critical of ms harris and other black women on the jury for their harsh treatment of tracy hampton , a 25yearold flight attendant who left the jury last month in part because she considered ms hampton insufficiently black , in part because she resented her good looks , he wrote , ms harris led other jurors to shun the naive and hypersensitive ms hampton , ultimately driving her off the jury and into the hospital he quoted approvingly his wife s reaction to the situation black people are always complaining about prejudice from white people , she told him and then we go and act that way toward each other i never realized how intolerant some black people can be responding today to mr knox s portrayal of her , ms harris said it s not me at all obviously , he had an agenda had he given the truthful account , the book may not have been marketable , and unfortunately , i happened to be the fall guy she said she and ms hampton were friends to this day , and that mr knox had pursued the younger juror aggressively , without success maybe how he deals with rejection from tracy is to say that someone else had a problem with her , ms harris said mr knox also criticized willie cravin , a recently dismissed juror he described as a bully almost from the start milton grimes , a los angeles lawyer who represents both ms harris and mr cravin , also said today that mr knox had an agenda to tell white america what they want to hear others , most recently judge ito , have characterized some former jurors as egomaniacs and selfpromoters , a position mr knox anticipated writing a book is the most complete way to tell the story of the o j jury from the inside and so what if i make a few bucks \? he wrote by mr knox s account , prosecutors should dread the day that a 72yearold black man , one of only two remaining alternate jurors in the case , ever gets on the panel he said that the older man , who grew up in the jim crow south , cannot abide white people and while gentlemanly otherwise , becomes a keg of dynamite on matters of race fuming , for instance , when he saw mr knox with his white foster child but mr knox attacked some white jurors , too he called another former panelist an arrogant , obnoxious boor and a total jerk who , touting his managerial experience and familiarity with computers , lobbied to become foreman even before he was officially selected mr knox praised judge ito for trying to improve the conditions of sequestration , but depicted his efforts as too little , too late , and too tonedeaf roger williams playing piano for a mostly africanamerican audience \? he wrote he s a nice man , very talented , and we all appreciated him giving his time but tinkling out oldies like 'autumn leaves' was n't what we needed photo michael knox , who was dismissed as a juror in the o j simpson trial , has written the private diary of an o j juror \( associated press \)
outside room 3614 at 26 federal plaza yesterday in lower manhattan , the polls were open and anthony mason was getting some lastminute counsel from his agent , don cronson i am for decertification , cronson had said a few minutes earlier , as marc fleisher , one of socalled dissident leaders , stood nearby now cronson huddled with mason , who paid closer attention than he ever did to pat riley a good 20 minutes passed before mason stepped into room 3614 , only to later emerge to say he had voted against his agent s advice and for the preservation of the national basketball association players' union basically because if you decertify , there 'll be a lot of time consumed while this is going on , he said in other words , in mason s opinion , it is time , with august fading and fall coming , for summer school to end it is almost time to play a forced education is nonetheless what this has been for the more than 400 pro basketball players , whose faxes were flooded with required reading , whose phone lines were strung out like one long rope in a rowdy tugofwar one of the good things to come out of this is that a lot of young guys had to grow up , said john salley , another prounion voter yesterday at the offices of the national labor relations board they 've always let their lawyers handle everything , but they realized this time they were going to have to make their own decisions few players disagree that simon gourdine , the union director , was baited by nba commissioner david stern into an atrocious deal in late june it was followed by the equivalent of a long , disorderly meeting in the town square , as the two sides one pushing a hastily renegotiated deal , the other espousing relocation of the fight to federal court vigorously campaigned suddenly , young millionaires who thought a luxury tax is what you pay for selling the penthouse coop , were being lobbied by the likes of stern , of michael jordan they were attending meetings , asking questions salley , formerly of detroit and miami , now of toronto , told of being pleasantly surprised by how the sacramento rookie brian grant stood and peppered gourdine with the tenacity of marcia clark at another meeting , the journeyman doug overton challenged jordan , the all and powerful oz himself some have falsely characterized this as a contest between the league s elite and everyone else for his part , salley wanted to make it clear that he had not referred to jordan , as one report claimed , as a house negro he said he used the pejorative terms house negro and field negro to make the point that africanamericans have historically been divided , and that he believed the players were allowing the agents to do likewise to them he said that because the nba is a very black league , the reality is that its players must be careful of the message they send judging by their summer of labor strife , that is apparently and sadly so after acknowledging that baseball and hockey players at least had the right to fight for their best deal , many sports journalists have more or less rolled their eyes and told the basketball players to just shut up and go play stern has been held up as the sport s shining knight , and jordan , as if he needs the money , has been cast as a greedy infidel learn from the mistakes baseball players made , they 've been told that sounds good , but does n't quite hold up baseball players went on strike decertification has been pushed as a means of declaring stern s lockout illegal so the games could go on to the best of my knowledge , none have yet been missed we ca n't have it both ways we ca n't belittle athletes for being the stereotypical dumb jocks , then call them spoiled millionaires when they are moved to take an interest in the rules that govern their relatively short careers on the phone the other day , doc rivers said he was laid up in bed with the flu and about 500 faxed pages of labor lit he was cramming for yesterday s vote , trying to make what he said was a really tough call sportswriters , the first to run across their own picket lines in the last couple of big newspaper strikes , should give these guys more credit this was a summer when patrick ewing spoke out , when joe dumars weighed in , when dino radja flew back from croatia to vote however that vote goes , the players were entitled to their debate , no matter how noisy it got
grozny , russia , jan 29 the city of grozny is gone now there are still roads , but they are marked by bomb craters , and there are buildings standing , but they are in flames there are landmarks and street signs and dogs and burnt trees there are even people , but they risk their lives each time they emerge from their basement shelters for a sip of muddy water after seven weeks of war between russia and the breakaway region of chechnya , this is no longer a city at the center of grozny this morning , from a vantage point behind the single wall of what was once the region s cabinet building , the landscape was one of remains bloody rags lying in the mud , twisted gas pipes , spent shells and , on lermontov street , a series of fresh brown mounds that have become the morgue getting into the chechen capital these days is difficult there is no regular transportation , but tanks and water trucks ply the roads en route to the city nothing here will ever be normal again , said pvt roman kaunas , 23 , standing in front of the main hospital , where he had taken a badly wounded fellow russian soldier the palace is gone now , private kaunas said , referring to the presidential palace it s just walls there are just walls everywhere but none of them are connected on one wall , at 57 pervomayskaya street , there is a red mailbox there is no door , no windows , no roof , no floor just a mailbox , with two letters to someone who is never going to be home again as long as there is a building left to hide a sniper , no one will be safe in grozny that is why the russian soldiers stationed here call it the coffin there were 400 , 000 people here before the fighting now there are probably fewer than 100 , 000 , and most of those who remain are considered fair game by russian soldiers and even by chechen fighters , unless they recognize them as one of their own the tension is constant every street is a sniper s alley , and the bullets can come from any direction no hiding place is completely safe , but people have to venture out in search of food and water , because there are no luxuries like plumbing or electricity despite assertions of calm and promises of a new order , not even russian soldiers venture out of their foxholes unless ordered to do so six weeks ago the main hospital was a lovely group of brick buildings now it is one large bomb shelter in front , a garrulous sergeant pointed to a group of five soldiers chatting two of our guys died on that spot yesterday when a mine blew up , he said then he pointed to a spot 10 feet away in the hospital compound , which is supposedly secure a shell fell there the other day , he said , and tore off the head of the deputy commander of the 255th motorized regiment the sergeant , farman shamsudinov , keeps a list in a neat handwriting of the officers from his brigade who have died in the last month so far there are 26 names on the list he is not registering the enlisted men who have died here there have been too many the russian army , which started its ground assault on grozny on new year s eve , controls the northern part of the city the chechen defenders , mostly bands of angry adolescents who live at home and fight by night , control the south but no one is winning today the rockets fell frequently in the south in the center , not five hundred yards from what is left of the presidential palace , the shooting was unrelenting the building , which for weeks seemed the centerpiece of the battle for grozny , is now one of the many ruins and nobody pays attention to ruins unless , of course , they have apartments in them then they are a perfect place for snipers to hide that is how nikolai khlusov got shot sitting on a cot in the hospital here , afraid to leave and unable to stay much longer , mr khlusov , 75 , explained that he had been wounded in the arm when he left his basement for water two days ago he knew the risks , but he was thirsty as a veteran of world war ii , he felt he could make it across a street without getting shot he was wrong this is a great tragedy that could have been avoided , said mr khlusov , an ethnic russian who has lived all his life in grozny i blame everybody for what has happened here , including myself mr khlusov said he had seen horrible looting , and not just from thugs everyone is doing it , he said he said that he obtained water the only way possible , as god gives it , from the rooftops , and that he had no plans for the future other than to make his way back to the basement and try to survive it is difficult to understand why anyone would shoot mr khlusov his eyes are still bright and blue , but at his age he clearly serves no army we get so mean we have even shot old people , said one friendly , sadeyed russian soldier who has served so much time here that he can no longer look at a highrise building without wondering whether the bullet that will kill him is waiting there i know these old people are guilty of nothing , he said but i'm not guilty either the killing has taken on its own logic there is nothing left in the city to fight for , no important buildings on which to plant a flag or make a point but the chechens will fight until they have driven the russians from their soil and the russians fly new tanks , artillery shells and men into grozny airport beginning at first light each day the dead are almost always impossible to account for , bury or memorialize there are just too many of them the main morgue was taken over by the russian army about two weeks ago then the chechens blew it up now the russians lay their dead in a square not far from here they tag and identify them and then load them into bags for the trip to tolstoyyurt 10 miles to the north civilians are neither identified nor buried if they die on the street , then the mud is their grave if they die when their apartments are pounded by russian artillery , they become part of the rubble at a certain point you have to wonder what it means to be alive in a city like this , said anya pletnova , 56 , a recently retired factory worker who was dragging a huge green fishing net home so that she could use the thread to make clothes i was born here and i have lived all my life here i have nowhere to go but can death be worse than grozny \? photo after seven weeks of war , the capital of the separatist

simpson is n't above the law everybody knows you ca n't send a message to fuhrman , you ca n't send a message to the lapd , you ca n't eradicate racism within the lapd or within the la community or within the nation as a whole by delivering a verdict of not guilty in a case like this where it is clear , and you know it is clear , you feel it , you know it , you know it in your heart , you know it as you have sat here day after day listening to this testimony , you know it everybody knows it everybody knows he killed everybody knows the evidence is there you just have to find your way through the smoke you just have to find your way through the smoke you heard from mr scheck yesterday , you heard him talk about our science they have to attack our science because all the science points to o j simpson , to the defendant , it all points to him as a killer goldman the hero does o j simpson look like he was in a struggle for his life \? does it look like o j simpson was in a struggle for his life \? it was n't o j simpson s life that was at stake he was n't the man about to lose his life it was ron it was ron goldman who was in a life struggle look at the nicks and the cuts on him we talk about heroes we talk about heroes a hero is a man that would rush into a lifethreatening situation to save a woman without ever thinking about himself first there are no heroes in this courtroom today two innocent people when i 've stood before you back in january i said there were many victims in this case and there are many interests involved in this case an important case to o j simpson and it s an important case to the victims and the families we just want you to be fair i just want you to do the right thing , that means the right thing under the law we believe we 've proven this case beyond a reasonable doubt and it s unfortunate , it s unfortunate what jealousy does to you , it s unfortunate that obsession can do these things to you it is unfortunate that two innocent people are dead because they got in this man s way that s the message we wanted to deliver and i'm the messenger , and i'm proud to have delivered it ms clark why so little blood now with respect to dr michael baden it was represented to you that dr baden said the perpetrator would have been covered in blood that s not true you can have all of dr baden s testimony read back i went and looked at it it s not there he did n't say that he did n't say it not only that , but their own expert , mr herbert mcdonald , had some interesting things to say about what kind of blood or how much blood you 'd ever expect to find as a matter of fact , we read the title into the record absence of evidence is not evidence of absence this makes sense a crime can happen in many different ways use your logic , use your common sense if you 're standing behind somebody cutting their throat , they 're bleeding out and they 're not bleeding on you so you 'll get some on your hands maybe you 'll get a little bit of spatter but you 're not going to be covered in blood and you 're certainly not going to be covered in the kind of blood that you 're going to track into the bronco because it is n't getting on your back a prosecutor s ethics i started on that side of counsel table i was a defense attorney i know what the ethical obligations are of a prosecutor , i took a cut in pay to join this office , because i believe in this job i believe in doing it fairly and doing it right and i like the luxury of being a prosecutor because i have the luxury on any case of going to the judge and saying guess what your honor , dismiss it , it s not here ladies and gentlemen , i can come to you and i can say do n't convict it s not here i have that right , i have that luxury this job gives me that luxury it does n't give me a lot of money but it gives me that luxury i can get up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror and say i tell you the truth , i will never ask for a conviction unless i should , unless the law says i must , unless he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on credible evidence 'planting' evidence they 're basically saying there was no blood on the socks that s what they 're saying , right \? why would you plant a blank pair of socks and then go back two months later and say i forgot , i'm supposed to plant blood on them what have i been thinking \? i 've got to go back and put the blood there

the spokeswoman at kingsborough community college in brooklyn is the wife of the former democratic speaker of the state assembly , stanley fink the dean for finance and development is married to another former democratic speaker , mel miller the husband of the top aide to irene h impellizzeri , a member of the city s board of education , works at the college , as does the wife of a brooklyn democratic district leader the first thing that almost everyone says about leon m goldstein , the president of kingsborough and the man who has emerged as mayor rudolph w giuliani s choice to be the next chancellor of new york city s schools , is that he is a shrewd politician who has forged close ties to influential elected officials they rarely say he is an educator he s someone who knows his way around politics , that i can tell you , former mayor edward i koch said he knows everybody , and he has maintained good relationships with politicians over the years to critics , mr goldstein s relationships reflect the last vestiges of the democratic party machine in brooklyn , where the college offers patronage opportunities and personal favors , like the dispersing of passes to the college s private beach to supporters , however , mr goldstein has simply leveraged political connections to benefit students , demonstrating over and over the administrative and lobbying skills that he has honed since 1971 , when he became president of the college , which now has 15 , 000 students for his part , mr goldstein is unapologetic he acknowledges friendships with politicians , big and small and he does not hesitate , he says , to call on them if it means helping to improve kingsborough i'm not a politician at all , mr goldstein said during a 90minute interview yesterday afternoon i'm not active in politics , nor do i belong to a political club i am , i think , politically aware and i understand that in new york city to accomplish things you 've got to work with the elected political officials mr goldstein , who has been considered for the job four times since 1983 , now appears to be the leading candidate to become the 23d chancellor only two days after the board of education narrowed its search to three finalists , aides to mr giuliani have said mr goldstein has enough votes among the board s seven members to get the job , although board members say the vote remains wide open the other candidates are robert r spillane , the superintendent of schools in fairfax county , va , whose 140 , 000 students make it the nation s 11thlargest district , and daniel a domenech , the superintendent for western suffolk county on long island , with 74 , 000 students dr spillane and dr domenech are educators first and foremost the quality that the board s president , carol a gresser , has said all along was her highest priority mr goldstein is an educator , too , but only in the sense that he has served as an administrator in the city university of new york for most of his whole career he is better known for balancing budgets and , recently , leading a committee that recommended consolidations at cuny that , the mayor s aides say , is exactly what mr giuliani wants brought to bear on the board of education mr giuliani , however , continued yesterday to remain silent , refusing to declare his support for mr goldstein or anyone else it s too early to discuss that , he said at a news conference , raising the possibility that other candidates still might emerge few people , even his strongest advocates , say that mr goldstein s strength is creating an educational vision instead , he has managed to build kingsborough into one of the gems of cuny s seven community colleges in spite of budget cuts and student turmoil and many say he has succeeded because of his ability to cultivate ties to politicians inside and outside a university system greatly influenced by the city s politics i think he recognized fairly early on what he needed to do to be able to survive in the rough and tumble world of south brooklyn politics , said city councilman kenneth k fisher , a democrat who represents brooklyn heights he has always bent over backwards to help the political establishment mr goldstein has not followed the career path of others who have served as chancellor he received an associate degree in hotel management , a bachelor s in history and a master s in history and social science all from the cuny system he began but did not complete a doctorate mr goldstein s career advanced in the era of meade esposito , the legendary party leader who reigned over brooklyn politics for more than a quartercentury after teaching history and eventually serving as dean at new york community college , he took over as president of kingsborough in 1971 in the 1970 s , he developed relationships with many elected officials from brooklyn , including mr fink and mr miller , two assemblymen who became powerful speakers those ties apparently extended to their wives judy fink , mr fink s wife and a former schoolteacher , has worked at the college for 15 years , serving most recently as the college s director of public relations elizabeth miller , who has a doctorate , has worked there 18 years , and rose to become dean for finance and development kingsborough also employs others connected to elected officials , cementing the college s reputation as a politically wellconnected place they include allan mirwis , an assistant professor whose wife , hilda , serves as a senior aide to mrs impellizzeri , and pauline lukpa , a college lab technician , who is the wife of herbert s lupka , the first deputy county clerk for brooklyn and a former democratic district leader no one has said any of these employees do not deserve their jobs and mr goldstein strongly defended the hirings , saying that all of the employees were exceptionally qualified and that none were hired because they may be related to people who are in government another close ally is borough president howard golden , who calls him a lifelong friend and has endorsed him for the chancellorship but while mr goldstein s supporters praise his ability to lobby successfully for scarce funds , others say the relationships can be too cozy mr goldstein often uses the kingsborough campus to serve as host of extracurricular activities , many of them political in nature the city council holds its annual picnic on the campus on the edge of the harbor in southern brooklyn mr goldstein is also host to an annual event each june , where brooklyn politicians are treated to dinner and music performed by the college s band it is something that everybody loves to go to , mr goldstein said he s been doing it for years the college also gives out passes to its private beach , as well as to its other recreational spaces some officials and community leaders complained that the passes were handed out selectively , allowing access to a beach that is supposed to be for students and staff members although mr goldstein dismisses such criticism , a community leader , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said she routinely received a pass every year until she opposed a project that mr goldstein supported it was a plum , the leader said , and it was taken away mr goldstein said the beach was open to all who asked we have never refused anyone a beach pass , he said all you have to do is ask for it whatever mr goldstein s credentials , critics say the close ties raise questions about his ability to lead the nation s largest school district he is certainly skilled at dealing with powerbrokers , said city councilman sal f albanese , a democrat from brooklyn that is an asset and a liability the liability is that sometimes you have to take powerbrokers on in the name of your constituency , which is this case is the children of the city of new york
greenwich , conn , june 15 jackie harris arrived at greenwich high school this morning still fuming about the discovery of a coded message of racial hatred in the school yearbook on wednesday so she and 10 other black students decided to take action they left the section of the student center where blacks generally gather and walked across the room to the area favored by whites , where they sat on a bench we just wanted to see what their reaction would be , said miss harris , a 17yearold junior we sat there no longer than five minutes , and all of the whites had moved for miss harris , the moment only helped reinforce the decision she had made the night before to transfer to a school in another community on a day when students were taking final exams , miss harris s reaction was among the most extreme but it was only one of countless expressions of outrage that students voiced toward the five senior boys , all of them white , who were suspended on wednesday school officials had learned that the last letters of their cryptic yearbook captions they had written for themselves , when taken together , spelled kill all niggers more than 300 students and teachers lined up today in the student center to sign a statement proclaiming their shock and disgust at the offensive statement , which they described as indicative of a simmering undercurrent of racial tension to show their solidarity , the students were given blue stickers , which they put on their shirts , book bags and foreheads although there were no reports of disruption , the calm was noticeably uneasy district officials said that they had ordered the high school s director of security , thomas dianis , to remain at home for the rest of the school year because his son keith was one of the students suspended the superintendent , dr john a whritner , said he was concerned for the safety of both father and son a reporter who knocked on the door of the dianises' white ranch house , in cos cob , one of the more modest sections in this town known for its wealth , received no answer with newspaper and television reporters scouring the school grounds the abc program good morning america called the superintendent information about the suspended students was sparse at least three played varsity football mr dianis was an outside linebacker , ed oberbeck a safety and patrick fox a lineman mr fox was also a star pitcher on the varsity baseball team , on which the fifth student , aaron valenti , also played school officials said some of the students were college bound but declined to elaborate none of the students could be reached for comment today , but on wednesday they told school officials they had done nothing wrong kristy sparan , 17 , a former girlfriend of mr fox , cautioned against reading too much into what they wrote they would n't have done it if they thought it would involve so much pain , she said they did it as a joke amongst themsevles personally , i know they 're not prejudiced the school headmistress , eileen m petruzillo , said she was more concerned , and she sent a letter to the home of every parent , in which she said the issue is not closed we are continuing to consider the situation and the consequences police chief ken moughty said his officers were interviewing a lot of people to determine whether the matter had criminal implications among possible charges , he said , were disorderly conduct and bias crime , but he said the investigation was too premature to draw any conclusions as they slipped in and out of the sprawling , red brick high school today , students offered a variety of opinions , with some dismissing the coded message as a practical joke and others saying it had made them shudder with fear i do n't think they 're going to act on their words , said matt hoster , 17 i'm offended by their sense of humor at the same time , i know some of the kids and i know they are not rednecks other students , particularly minoritygroup members , who make up 20 percent of the 2 , 000member student body , said the coded message was yet another example of the intolerance that seems to surface periodically last year , someone spraypainted a swastika and the phrase kill the jews near the school pool , students said in april , a fight between two students mushroomed into a brawl in which racial epithets were exchanged among white , black and hispanic students josh goldstein , a 17yearold junior , said he had been called a dirty jew and had pennies thrown at him by fellow students and cesar palomeque , who moved to greenwich from ecuador six years ago , was one of many students who described a school cafeteria that was somewhat segregated , with blacks sticking to one corner , hispanic students to another and nonhispanic whites on the other side of the room one member of the football and baseball teams , ryan decarlo , said he disagreed with the actions of his former teammates and did not want their behavior to stigmatize other athletes i feel backlash , not just because i play sports , but because i'm caucasian it remained unclear whether any of the five students would graduate with their class on tuesday the students were suspended through the end of exams , superintendent whritner said , unless they successfully appealed as of 5 pm today , none had tried to appeal it is impossible for a student to graduate without passing all his exams , the superintendent said in downtown greenwich , where the upscale shops and boutiques are evocative of fifth avenue , there was muted reaction fran lubrano , who said she volunteers at the high school , said boyfriends and girlfriends were the cause of far more fights than race arthur l thomas , 66 , a chemical engineer for the american petroleum institute

baton rouge , la those who support patrick joseph buchanan for president find themselves warding off unloved labels these days protectionist , isolationist and some that are a lot more unexpected i'm no socialist , god knows , said roy luxemburg , a former supporter of ross perot , explaining that he had nevertheless relished listening to mr buchanan rip into big business during a holiday gathering of republican voters at an antebellumstyle mansion here recently something very strange is happening in republican politics , and mr buchanan s bareknuckles campaign for the presidential nomination is at the center of it within the party , the debate over economic policy has passed far enough through the looking glass that mr buchanan , whose reviling of liberals built him a career as a presidential speechwriter and a commentator , has been branded a leftwinger by some of his increasingly peeved republican critics to that attack , mr buchanan is unyielding the policies i would put into place would attract democrats and working people by the millions , he said in an interview let me tell you , the group that would be alienated would be some of the financial community and some of the folks heading up the big corporations they 're the people that would be in the back of our bus mr buchanan , who as a protest candidate ran unsuccessfully for the 1992 nomination against president george bush , was expected this time around to vanish in a field jammed with seemingly likeminded conservatives instead , he has mixed his calls for tax cuts and his bedrock social conservatism with a fierce economic nationalism that is rattling not only the presidential campaign with his dire warnings of a spreading new world order , he is widening postcoldwar cracks among main street and wall street republicans over foreign and economic policy these fellows are committed to a quasireligious freetrade ideology that is colliding with reality , mr buchanan said of globaltrade advocates , acknowledging that he once shared their view what s good for general motors is not good for america if general motors has become a transnational corporation that sees its future in lowwage countries and in abandoning its american factories it s a new world a new world economically , a new world in foreign policy the first battleground will be louisiana with his zest for harsh language and a record of infuriating republican moderates , mr buchanan is still alienating more voters than he is attracting , according to polls but he has placed second in some polls in new hampshire and has concocted a message and a strategy , keyed to louisiana s firstinthenation caucuses on feb 6 , that are causing headaches for his betterorganized and betterfinanced opponents , in particular senator phil gramm mr buchanan is betting that a surprisingly strong showing in this economically distressed and increasingly republican state where , he tells voters , he intends to feed phil gramm to the alligators will make him the only viable alternative to the right of the frontrunner for the nomination , senator bob dole as mr buchanan travels early primary and caucus states like louisiana , georgia , iowa and new hampshire , he assures voters that mr dole and mr gramm are his friends then , ignoring the rest of the field , he proceeds to shred the two senators with the takenoprisoners style he honed on the cnn political talk show crossfire bob dole is our walter mondale , mr buchanan told voters in georgia recently he s the weakest frontrunner i 've seen in a long time although born and reared in washington , and employed there almost his entire adult life , the 57yearold mr buchanan mocks mr dole and mr gramm alike as washington insiders and , noting his onetime job as communications director for the great communicator , president ronald reagan , he offers himself as the authentic conservative in the race , planting suspicions that his opponents are closet moderates pat buchanan was conservative before phil gramm ever said he was conservative , before conservative was cool , said bryan joy , a finance major at the university of georgia who is chairman of that state s college republicans the spoiler of '92 adds to his message mr bush s campaign strategists partly blame mr buchanan for costing them the 1992 election , first by distracting the president in the primaries , then by alienating moderates in rallying the party to a religious and cultural war during a primetime speech at the republican national convention while he dwells more on economics these days , mr buchanan has not softened his positions or language on social issues at the bethel assembly of god church in lafayette , la , recently , he took the stage after a christmas musical to denounce the tragedy and atrocity of the systematic slaughter of the life of unborn children across america surrounded by a living nativity scene scores of people dressed as shepherds , wise men or the holy family mr buchanan karatechopped the air with each hand , a trademark gesture , as he mocked bureaucrats in sandals and beads at the department of education he accused intellectuals , whom he did not otherwise identify , of replacing the bible with playboy magazine in public schools

washington , nov 5 for the clinton white house , where it is as red hot a topic as everywhere else in washington , the prospect of gen colin l powell as a republican presidential candidate is both a dream and a nightmare the retired army general could be the democrats' best friend if he divided the republican field and yet was denied the nomination after a bitter internecine fight , allowing mr clinton to paint the republicans as extremists unworthy of leadership or general powell might win the nomination but prompt a rightwing , thirdparty candidacy by someone like patrick j buchanan that would split the vote in mr clinton s favor but if general powell , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , managed to win the republican nomination with his party s full backing , most democrats strategists assume he would be all but impossible to attack , tricky to defend against and terribly hard to beat most clinton advisers sum up the president s prospects in such a race in terse , simple anglosaxon verbs if he gets in and cruises , it s going to be very bleak for us , said carter eskew , a democratic consultant with close ties to the white house a big part of this nightmare for the president would be general powell s potential to draw black voters away from the democratic party , undermining it as well as hurting mr clinton a recent new york times cbs news poll found that in a twoway race , the general would draw the support of nearly 1 in 3 black voters and mr clinton would get just over half of the blacks' votes the other blacks polled were undecided the poll showed that general powell would defeat mr clinton by 50 percent to 38 percent over all hoping against the worst case for the president , mr eskew said of general powell s potential candidacy , i think the much more likely scenario is that it exposes the fissures in the republican party bob shrum , another democratic consultant who occasionally advises the administration , put it a bit differently i think that colin powell is probably too moderate , sensible and rational for the republican party to nominate , mr shrum said and the act of denying him the nomination because he s moderate and sensible would be good for bill clinton because it would make clear the real character of the republican party for the moment , democrats are pleased that general powell s possible candidacy has frozen the republican field , tied up money and helped force the withdrawal of gov pete wilson of california all largely to mr clinton s advantage one clinton aide said of general powell he s making these other guys shrink in stature every day dole just gets shorter and shorter and gramm gets more and more irritating , and buchanan is getting more and more threatening about a thirdparty candidacy no one yet knows whether the general will even be a candidate , of course , much less whether he could become the republicans' agreedon choice yet , over latenight drinks and earlymorning coffee , some clinton advisers think about the worst case and tremble how would a president whose avoidance of military service in vietnam looms as a liability attack one of the most popular generals in american history \? how could this president , with his lifelong commitment to civil rights and social progress for blacks , attack a black man who would be the first member of his race to be nominated for president by a major political party \? and how could mr clinton distinguish himself from general powell , since both seem to hold similar moderate views on social issues like abortion and affirmative action \? the answers vary , but none are particularly confident i think we hug him , one white house aide said last week , speaking , like his colleagues , on the condition of anonymity we point out how close he is to the president s point of view on many major issues , that he is effectively a moderate democrat and then we point out that the president s been in office , working for all these same things that colin powell is untested on , and argue that voters should stick with the real thing another line of attack is that general powell has worn too many brass buttons , for too long only once in the 20th century has the united states elected a general as president and then only after the largest war in history dwight d eisenhower after world war ii but these arguments are beanbag softies by the standards of modern american politics , and the fact that white house aides would not speculate about harsher ones even in this precampaign campaign is a testament to general powell s popularity and to the wariness that his potential candidacy has inspired white house aides are generally more willing to ruminate about all the ways in which a powell candidacy could help the president and about all the impediments to general powell s ever winning the nomination the argument that no one in the white house likes to talk about but that nonetheless is possible , is that the general s color might shake the republicans' prevailing stranglehold on the south in presidential elections under this theory , southern democrats who since the days of richard m nixon have otherwise split their tickets between local democratic candidates and republican presidential nominees might be prompted to make do with mr clinton , despite the venerable southern respect for military heroes at the same time , these democrats say , general powell will have to decide whether to enter the race by middecember , the deadline for the new hampshire primary and that could well force him to weigh in with his opinions on the huge fight over federal spending priorities that is likely to then still be unfolding in the budget battle between mr clinton and congress if general powell tips too far to the right on questions like slowing the growth of medicare spending , this argument goes , he alienates mainstream voters but if he tilts too far to the left , he loses the potential support of party leaders like speaker newt gingrich , whose acquiescence , if not active support , would be vital to his winning the republican nomination whatever happens , mr shrum said , the democrats' worst mistake would be to underestimate mr powell because he is a novice at electoral politics he will not face a blizzard of questions he s unprepared for , mr shrum said this guy ran the most successful major war of the last 30 years whatever he does , he will be prepared his strategy may or may not work , but he will have one his answers may or may not persuade people , but he will give them

chicago , april 16 the knicks had won five consecutive games they had momentum they appeared to be peaking for the playoffs none of that mattered to the chicago bulls whipping the knicks in a game that both teams had been pointing toward , the bulls frolicked to 11190 victory today at the united center in the previous meeting between these teams , on march 28 , the knicks were dominated by michael jordan , who scored 55 points today , the knicks were dominated by the entire chicago team scottie pippen \( 29 points , 8 rebounds , 7 steals \) set the tone with a 25point first half jordan \( 28 points , 8for19 shooting \) was content to play a supporting role and toni kukoc \( 20 points , 10 assists \) helped the bulls prove that they did not need a superior performance from jordan to beat the knicks i'm pretty sure everyone was expecting me to score 57 , said jordan , referring to suggestions that he might try to surpass the 56point game by glen rice of the miami heat on saturday we 're not threatening or saying that everyone has to come through chicago , and i like that this way , we believe in ourselves the knicks \( 5226 \) were left with no choice but to move on , because to dwell on this game would be depressing after an emotional road victory against the indiana pacers on friday , the knicks were flat today , and they were stepped on by the bulls so the playoff picture for the knicks looks like this the orlando magic can clinch the atlantic division title and the no 1 seeding in the playoffs monday night with a victory over the washington bullets at home or a loss by the knicks to the milwaukee bucks at the garden but the knicks still need just one victory to clinch homecourt advantage for the first two rounds of the playoffs new york appears almost certain to face the cleveland cavaliers in the first round and after today , playing cleveland looked like a much better firstround proposition for the knicks than playing the bulls \( 4434 \) it was a total loss , said pat riley we were not in it after the first quarter at all we did not play a forceful , energetic game , but we 've got to keep it in perspective we were coming off a very emotional game the other night in indiana , a lot bigger than this game i think our players felt that , and the results showed that today i really felt the other night in indiana that the emotional plug was pulled as much as i think our mindset was that this was a big game , and that it would be a great statement game , they were just much more ready for this game than we were , physically and mentally right now , we do n't match up with pippen , jordan and kukoc i do n't know what s going to develop during the next week , but we would not face this team for a good six weeks , so i think we would be able to make some kind of adjustment charles smith led the knicks with 22 points and 6 rebounds , but for much of the game , new york s offense lacked direction and effectiveness the bulls did what they often do to patrick ewing played him physically with three different centers , and doubleteamed him whenever he turned to make a strong move into the lane ewing , who had been playing forcefully , finished with just 17 points on 5for16 shooting , and had just 2 points in the second half new york played the entire fourth quarter with ewing and charles oakley on the bench oakley sat out the final 17 minutes 28 seconds as riley went with anthony mason , smith , herb williams , greg anthony and hubert davis a unit that cut chicago s lead to 10 points before the bulls pulled away again oakley was frustrated by the loss and by playing just 24 minutes everybody on this team wants to play , so it s hard , said oakley that s riley he s got an answer for everything i guess he 'll answer this i guess he figured we were n't getting the job done it s the first time i have n't seen john or patrick somebody should be in there asked why he benched ewing , oakley and john starks \( 3for11 shooting , 11 points \) in the fourth quarter , riley said that team played harder than the starters did the biggest game for us is tomorrow night going four games in five nights , i was n't going to try and get a miracle at the end asked about his performance , ewing said they basically handed us our butts the bulls did n't do anything to neutralize me i just missed my shots this game means nothing as far as the playoffs trailing by 8668 after three quarters , new york added a little suspense with a fourthquarter comeback , but jordan \( who else \? \) made a spectacular shot to help choke off new york s momentum after the knicks pulled to within 10 , at 9383 , with five minutes left , jordan lofted a higharching baseline 18footer over smith s outstretched arms that was all net , just before the 24second clock was about to expire the crowd went wild the knicks on the bench shook their heads in disgust the bulls pulled away again it was another bleak day for the knicks in chicago , where they were 02 this season , and 03 during last year s playoffs the first half was a disaster from new york s perspective pippen was unstoppable the bulls shot 57 percent and chicago was so dominant offensively that there was no reason for jordan to play superman the bulls took a 6747 lead into the locker room , and the grim looks on the faces of the knicks said a lot pippen was simply sensational his firsthalf statistical line read 25 points , 11for13 shooting , 4 rebounds , 4 assists and 4 steals since jordan returned , a giant burden has been lifted from pippen s shoulders he no longer has to carry the offense and with jordan around , opponents can no longer doubleteam pippen at will using his first step to get into the lane consistently , pippen carved a hole in new york s interior defense as the knicks fell farther behind in the first half , they lost their composure mason got a technical foul and starks picked one up a few minutes later both were called by joey crawford , who also called technical fouls in the second quarter on corey blount and will perdue crawford is not a referee who enjoys backtalk from players but he was the least of new york s worries the knicks were dreadful offensively , shooting 5 for 22 in the second quarter with 7 turnovers ewing was held to 2 points in the second quarter as new york s offense often broke down before ewing could even touch the ball derek harper did not do a great job running the offense , and new york s set plays were disrupted on a regular basis despite new york s frontcourt muscle edge , the bulls outrebounded new york , 2419 , in the first half and were well on their way to victory photos scottie pippen colliding with patrick ewing as he releases a shot during his 25point firsthalf performance pippen finished with 29 \( agence francepresse \) \( pg c1 \) bulls' scottie pippen maneuvering against knicks' john starks in the first quarter yesterday michael jordan searching for a teammate as four knicks close in on him during the first half yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg c5 \)
east rutherford , nj , april 22 while the first round of the national football league draft unfolded like some wild soap opera , the giants were sitting quietly in the middle of the pack they simply watched everything play out before them and patiently waited it became clear early on that they would get a good pick a very good pick and they did the giants picked michigan running back tyrone wheatley , one of the top backs in the draft he should have been one of the top players taken , and the only reason he was n't was because of questions about his durability but that did n't concern the giants , and even though there will be questions about what kind of pounding he can take , it was a steal for the giants to get him at no 17 this is like a baptism , a rebirth , wheatley said of being drafted washing away the old and bringing in the new the giants got a running back for the future and they have to be happy with that i think we were fortunate to have a player of this caliber facing us with our pick , said giants general manager george young the giants definitely wanted some offensive linemen in this draft and that s what they got later with their secondround pick \( 54th over all \) , the giants took the 6foot8inch , 300pound offensive tackle scott gragg from the university of montana all you need to know about him is that his nickname is lurch big and strong , he s a younger jumbo elliott he is also intelligent he majored in chemistry and education and the giants know him well the staff coached him at this year s senior bowl with their thirdround selection \( 85th over all \) , the giants picked lsu cornerback rodney young he s capable of playing safety , but was mainly a cornerback the past two seasons he started at left corner and led lsu with 80 tackles and had 3 interceptions he is the son of the former giant willie young , an allpro tackle who played for the team from 1966 to 1975 but the most sensation was caused by the giants' first pick the main question now becomes , what will the giants do with rodney hampton \? in all probability , nothing hampton is perhaps the most productive back in giants history and as good as wheatley is , he is n't ready to step in yet the giants may listen to trade offers , but chances are they 'll keep their star back and break wheatley in slowly in effect , though , the drafting of wheatley means that after next season , hampton probably wo n't be a giant apparently , the giants received some feelers for hampton , but none serious enough to make the giants blink the giants have also yet to call anyone about a trade and probably wo n't the problem with trading hampton is that he makes a ton of money and few teams are willing to pay 2 million for a running back who is good , but tends to get banged up a lot not to mention that hampton will become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season young said the giants are not looking to trade hampton about having hampton and wheatley on the same team he said , that will work itself out translation wheatley will be an understudy to hampton i think it s a good pick , said hampton , who added he was concerned by the trade rumors you ca n't have enough running backs his agent , ralph cindrich , said he has been told by the team that they will not trade hampton and that hampton is pretty hard to trade without a new deal wheatley , who would have been a topfive pick last year but decided to go back to school and pursue his degree in movement science , has not announced who his agent is \( he may do so on wednesday \) so the giants may not be able to begin negotiations for several days the main thing for the giants was that they had many options going into the draft , they were thinking about helping themselves on many fronts they certainly could have used a lineman since the average age of the current five starters is 31 years old the average salary is 16 million but there was an alternative way of thinking maybe the giants could draft a young back and groom him for a year and replace hampton should he become banged up or should he leave hampton is still one of the most talented backs in the league , but the giants needed to look to the future since young took over the reins of the giants in 1979 , he has taken more running backs in the first round five than any other position wheatley has an excellent combination of size , skill and speed at 6 feet 1 inch and 230 pounds , wheatley can run the 40yard dash in 44 seconds , which is fast for his size wheatley was only the third player in michigan history to rush for more than 3 , 500 yards and gain more than 4 , 000 allpurpose yards during his career , joining jamie morris \( 4 , 293 rushing and 6 , 201 allpurpose \) and butch woolfolk \( 3 , 861 , 4 , 126 \) wheatley is a good athlete , as evidenced by how he played eight different positions his senior year in high school about the only knocks are about his durability and that he runs almost straight up that will definitely have to change in the pros or wheatley will have a short career in college this year , wheatley hurt his shoulder in a scrimmage \( instead of running out of bounds , he turned the corner and took on a tackler \) , and in some team s eyes , the injury hurt his draft status but the giants' team physician , dr russell warren , checked out wheatley s shoulder when he visited the team and said there are no concerns one thing the giants also get with wheatley is good character the giants , who always like smart players , were impressed by how he bypassed the lure of making millions last year to get his degree now , wheatley will get millions of dollars and a degree extra points there was debate about who the giants should take with their first pick but everyone was quiet about who wanted what player said giants coach dan reeves , who added that this was the most argumentative place i 've ever been the giants have two picks in the fourth sunday , and one each in the fifth , sixth and seventh photo tyrone wheatley , the michigan running back , smiling after the giants made him the 17th pick in the first round of yesterday s nfl draft \( alan zale for the new york times \)
jidda , saudi arabia , march 12 secretary of state warren christopher said today that he has withdrawn from policy discussions on a sensitive oil deal between conoco inc and iran because his former law firm is representing the american company mr christopher told reporters en route to saudi arabia that he decided to take a very conservative position after the state department informed him last week that conoco had retained o'melveny myers , the los angelesbased law firm where he had been chairman thomas e donilon , mr christopher s chief of staff and a former partner at the firm , has also recused himself in conflict of interest matters i think you have to take a conservative position , mr christopher said i will not be stepping out of iran policy by any means president clinton and his advisers were stunned last week when they learned that the houstonbased oil company had clinched a deal to develop two huge offshore oil and gas fields in the persian gulf , a senior administration official said in recent months , conoco had informed the american consul general in dubai in vague terms of its negotiations with iran , but american officials did not take the talks seriously , assuming iran could not afford such a contract the administration did not learn that the oil company had retained the law firm until thursday when conoco representatives came to discuss the deal with the state department , an administration official said a lawyer familar with the deal said today that o'melveny myers had represented conoco inc for several years on a variety of foreign and domestic matters he said it was one of several outside counsels working for conoco and said that the firm had intended to inform mr christopher before the deal was announced , but that the news was made public before the secretary had been told mr christopher said he has an ongoing association with the firm because of his retirement benefits news of the deal has pushed the administration to speed up a review of its policy toward iran , and various agencies have prepared papers laying out options ranging from largely symbolic steps to an executive order imposing a total unilateral ban on trade with iran mr christopher has taken a tough line against iran , because of its support for terrorism and its determination to build a nuclear weapon his absence in discussions of the oil deal will deprive the administration of iran s harshest critic officials traveling with mr christopher deny that conoco intentionally sought to weaken the administration s arguments against the deal by cutting out mr christopher in recent months , mr christopher has told aides that he is increasingly uncomfortable with the policy that allows american oil companies to buy iranian oil and sell it abroad and allows iran to buy an array of nonlethal items from the united states that inconsistency has made it difficult for mr christopher to persuade allies to block investments , loans and credits to iran the deal is particularly worrisome for the administration because it means that for the first time since iran s revolution 16 years ago , a major american company is willing to invest huge sums of money in iran s faltering economy and that iran is willing to work on a major joint project with an american firm the contract with iran , which was signed by a dutch affiliate , conoco iran nv , does not violate american law because none of the oil and natural gas is to be brought to the united states
officials of new york city s embattled department of youth services seriously mismanaged the awarding of city contracts to nonprofit agencies last year , an independent review commissioned by mayor rudolph w giuliani concludes the review , which was released yesterday , found that department officials repeatedly ignored city contracting rules , changed their own procedures without telling applicants for municipal contracts and generally bungled the awarding of contracts to nonprofit and community groups that provide programs for young people the procedural changes , which were made after the groups had applied for contracts and after their applications had been evaluated , meant that some citywide groups that had long received city financing obtained none at all , the report found the late changes seriously compromised the integrity of the process , the report said , and prevented deserving young people , including the disabled , from getting needed services the audit did not suggest any criminal wrongdoing by officials , nor did it address whether the list of problems arose from deliberate decisions or merely sloppy management practices the highly critical report , which concentrated specifically on the department s work under mr giuliani , is the second this month to have looked into serious problems at the youth agency the giuliani administration first raised questions about the department of youth services last may , when mayoral aides charged that the department , under former mayor david n dinkins , had committed itself to spend as much as 11 million more than its budget for the fiscal year that ended in june 1994 mayoral aides also suggested that some contracts had been awarded to garner political support for mr dinkins , and that files and computers had been ransacked to cover up the mismanagement in a report released two weeks ago , the city s department of investigation concluded that many of the allegations were unjustified or exaggerated city investigators did find that the youth agency had a 39 million deficit in the last fiscal year , which ended in june , although city comptroller alan g hevesi has certified to the contrary , that the department had a surplus of 42 million in that fiscal year the report released yesterday was the first to rigorously evaluate the performance of the youth services department under mr giuliani the mayor created a committee to examine the agency last november , after the department was heavily criticized for its decision to stop financing nearly 150 established groups like big brothersbig sisters and the door in favor of groups that had not previously provided youth programs the department gives out contracts to scores of nonprofit community groups to provide a broad variety of services for children and young people , including afterschool care , job training and recreation in announcing the audit , which was conducted jointly by the mayor s budget office , the comptroller and a private auditing firm , kpmg peat marwick , mr giuliani said that its mission was to provide an objective analysis of what went wrong in dense , unusually terse language , the 37page report did precisely that the committee found , for example , that the youth services agency had no written guidelines for its officials to evaluate proposals from the nonprofit groups it determined , too , that the department s officials gave confusing and often contradictory answers to questions from applicants at conferences held in all five boroughs the report said city contracting rules were routinely broken proposals from nonprofit groups were not sealed , as is required , and proposals were opened by agency officials before the submission deadlines , which is prohibited the committee also found repeated errors in ratings sheets used by youth agency officials to evaluate applications they found mathematical errors , the whitingout of evaluators' comments and unsigned and undated documents in perhaps its most significant finding , the committee concluded that in august 1994 long after applications had been filed and evaluated city officials decided to reduce significantly the amount of city money that would be awarded under a major category of the youth agency s grants the applicants , many of them established , citywide groups , were never told of this change , the report said , and they did not have an opportunity to apply for other categories of city aid some democratic city officials have suggested that the lastminute changes and other sloppy management practices were deliberate , and were part of an effort by the new republican administration to redirect city financing away from community groups linked to mr dinkins , a democrat , toward those more responsive to mr giuliani but the committee s report did not address that question the report was completed early last month , several city officials said , adding that its release was held up while mayoral aides and officials of the comptroller s office disputed the wording of crucial sections an early draft characterized the late changes in financing as creating an appearance of impropriety officials said the phrase was revised several times before it appeared yesterday as saying that the late procedural changes seriously compromised the integrity of the process mr hevesi said last night that the report showed evidence of very severe management failure , all across the line mr giuliani called the report full and complete he said the findings could provide the basis for major improvements at the youth agency , and he said that officials had already begun to put into place many of the report s recommendations
two portraits of sheik omar abdel rahman have emerged over the last seven months in a heavily guarded courtroom in manhattan one , the sheik described by prosecutors , used his sanctuary in america as a base for plotting terrorism this mr abdel rahman is a fundamentalist muslim fanatic who led a conspiracy that included the bombing of the world trade center in february 1993 and plots to bomb other major new york buildings , all in an attempt to coerce the united states into changing its middle east policy of supporting israel and the government he detests in his native egypt the other sheik , the one portrayed by his defense lawyers , is a charismatic religious leader who did nothing more than exercise his freespeech rights to agitate fervently for the overthrow of an oppressive regime in his homeland this sheik , they say , is the victim in a trumpedup case , set up by an informer with a history of lying and with financial and political motivations to frame the cleric with closing arguments to begin on tuesday , the jury in federal district court in manhattan will soon begin deliberations to determine which version rings truer to do that , the jurors will wade through a thicket of evidence that includes testimony from more than 200 witnesses , a bundle of speeches and sermons that mr abdel rahman has given over the years , and well over 100 hours of secretly recorded conversations , many between the informer and mr abdel rahman or the other nine defendants the recordings are the prime evidence to back up charges of seditious conspiracy , bombing conspiracy and other crimes against most of the defendants , including mr abdel rahman but in the end , only one of the taped conversations in which mr abdel rahman took part can be said to offer direct evidence that the 57yearold blind cleric crossed the line from ardent advocacy to criminal conspiracy and while that recording is certainly compelling , the jurors will have to weigh it against the vigorous argument of mr abdel rahman s lawyers that the informer , emad salem , had used the skills of a consummate confidence man , which the evidence certainly suggests he was , to set up mr abdel rahman the conversation , which involved only the two men in the cleric s jersey city apartment in may 1993 , took place three months after the world trade center bombing killed six people in a transcript of the conversation , translated from the arabic , mr salem , after emotionally pledging his allegiance to mr abdel rahman , says that another figure in the case has proposed that the united nations headquarters be similarly bombed we are preparing for something big , something big if god is willing , that will bring it upside down , mr salem says of the united nations building so is this considered licit or illicit \? it is not illicit however , will be bad for muslims , mr abdel rahman replies the cleric says this is so because many people consider the united nations to be the center of peace , and he tells mr salem to find a plan instead to inflict damage on the american army itself in response to mr salem s request for advice about a second possible target , the main federal building in manhattan , mr abdel rahman says to hold off , and suggests that much preparation is needed for striking such a target the prosecution says this exchange is clear evidence that mr abdel rahman was the leader of the conspiracy , a figure who was consulted about which targets were permissible aside from the united nations and the federal building , mr abdel rahman and his codefendants are also charged with plotting to blow up the holland and lincoln tunnels and the george washington bridge , though the cleric is not heard on any recording discussing those sites his chief lawyer , lynne f stewart , points out that her client discouraged mr salem from attacking the two sites the informer brought up , and maintains that the advice to attack an army site was an effort to mollify mr salem , who just before raising the subject of bombing targets is heard imploring mr abdel rahman for guidance on how to give you my allegiance to death in fact , mr salem , a former egyptian military officer , had infiltrated mr abdel rahman s group for the fbi and is to be paid more than 1 million for his work on the case although not as pivotal as the taped talk of bombing targets , another recording mr salem surreptitiously made will also have to be given close attention by the jurors in it , mr abdel rahman is heard mediating a june 1993 dispute in which one of his followers accuses another of being a spy for the fbi one of the prosecutors , robert khuzami , has told the jury that the session shows mr abdel rahman doing the real work of a criminal boss protecting the organization his organization from infiltration ms stewart , however , says it shows only that as a leader of a movement that in egypt is considered dangerous , he has heightened security notions , which she says were made still more acute because of press reports at the time linking him to the four men then under arrest for the world trade center bombing those four were convicted in a trial last year and while none of the defendants in the current trial are accused of helping to carry out that attack , the prosecution in this trial says the trade center bombing was part of the overall conspiracy that mr abdel rahman led the many other recordings of the cleric used as prosecution evidence contain no words of his advocating or discussing tactics for violence in the united states but like the speeches and sermons introduced , they contain his harsh views of american policy in the middle east and of president hosni mubarak of egypt , and were offered to show that mr abdel rahman had the state of mind to commit the crimes charged another of those charges is conspiring to assassinate mr mubarak during the egyptian leader s visit to the united states in april 1993
trenton , july 25 if james pascale were living in california , he might be paying a lot less child support because of the time he spends with his 11yearold son and twin 9yearold daughters but he lives in new jersey , where the state supreme court has ruled that his former wife , debra pascale , should continue to have complete control over the 25 , 000 both parents contribute each year to support their children the way things are i might as well live on the moon and write checks , mr pascale said , insisting that he does not want his support obligation reduced but that he only wants to share in decisions about how some of it is spent he argued unsuccessfully that his visitation arrangement with his children was nontraditional and should be exempt from the state s child support guidelines the argument made by mr pascale is being heard around the country , as courts and legislatures take a fresh look at divorce laws that include a crazy quilt of childsupport standards ellen j effron , secretary of the american bar association s family law section , said , virtually every state is encountering arguments that noncustodial parents who spend much more time with their children should be allowed a deviation from the guidelines , and that s the problem an overwhelming majority of cases involve fathers who pay support and mothers who have custody the census bureau reported earlier this year that there are 16 million custodial fathers , compared with 99 million custodial mothers the big issue is , are we really going to redefine the family and fathers' roles \? said marvin ventrell , executive director of the national association of counsel for children , based in denver the unanimous new jersey supreme court decision strengthened mrs pascale s control over the day to day structure of the new family by contrast , in california , a noncustodial parent , usually the father , can reduce his support payments by increasing the number of visits with his children michael barber of sacramento , a former member of the federal commission on interstate child support and a former chairman of the childsupport subcommittee of the american bar association , said that in a middleclass family with two children , a visiting parent who never saw his children pays about 1 , 050 a month in support payments , but that could be reduced to 123 a month if he divided childcare time equally with his former wife this produces conflict , since the visiting parent is always trying to get to see the children more often to lower his support payments and the custodial parent is trying to frustrate that to keep the payments up , he said a better approach , he said , would be a twotier system that provided a permanent level of support for fixed costs of maintaining the home for the children and a second level that could fluctuate with the frequency of visits under the federal family support act of 1988 , each state is required to establish child support guidelines , either by legislation , court rules or agency regulations , and to review them every four years in the last year , there has been increased pressure in congress to establish a study commission to come up with national guidelines but bruce i afran , mr pascale s lawyer , said a national support guideline would be a mistake each state knows what works best in their environment , he said besides , there is a big difference between the cost of raising a family in manhattan and in montana the federal department of health and human services has commissioned a study of state support guidelines , which is gathering information on the variety of issues that can occupy state rule makers in north carolina , special adjustments for teenagers' clothing was an issue elsewhere , states tried to decide whether courts should have the power to waive support payments , knowing that the children would suffer if a custodial parent impeded visitation none of the reports discussed increasing support payments if the visiting parent failed to exercise visitation rights , which could add significantly to the custodial parent s expenses colorado and utah said the parent who did not have custody should have the children for overnight stays 25 percent of the time before becoming eligible for a reduction in support payments in alaska , the threshold was set at 30 percent , and idaho recommended 35 percent several states concluded that the custody sharing would have to reach 50 percent before adjustments could be made other states avoided such tests entirely and said support levels should be left to the discretion of the courts a report released last year by the women s legal defense fund following a study of state guidelines , stated that the living standards of children continue to decline drastically after their parents divorce , just as they had before the 1988 law diane dodson and joan entmacher , the authors of the report , said that applying bureau of labor statistics standards , the children s households' living standards would decline an average of 26 percent , and those of the fathers would increase an average of 34 percent , for all typical families protecting the children s living standards , and preventing them from sliding into poverty , is a chief concern of courts dealing with child support issues justice marie l garibaldi , who wrote the opinion , said parents who fight over their support obligations without considering the impact on their children are missing the point in the court opinion , she said , child support is the right of the child and the responsibility of both parents , not a chip won or lost by the custodial parent from the noncustodial parent during divorce gary n skoloff of livingston , a lawyer specializing in family law , said the new jersey supreme court opinion appeared to be a resultoriented decision for efficient administration in certain cases intended to avoid an increase in litigation the result , he said , was unfair , ignoring the legitimate claims of fathers , real fathers , not those who do the minimum necessary , but those who want to spend more and more time with their children the court is awaiting a new report from the subcommittee on child support of the court s family practice committee , which has reviewed the child support guidelines every two years since 1986 the aim is to base child support schedules on more accurate estimates of childrearing costs and to increase the upper limit of those schedules , the court said the legislature , which is considering revisions to the state s divorce law , decided not to deal with child support issues immediately , but asked sara flohr , manager of planning and budget for princeton university , to act as liaison with the court s subcommittee ms flohr said the final report could be ready next month and that it might deal with the issues raised by the pascale case as well provide an update of economic issues in addition , a bill that would create a legislative commission to study custody and child support has been passed by the assembly and released by a senate committee it is expected to pass the upper house if the senate president , donald t difrancesco , posts it for a vote when the legislature returns later this year
roseland , nj , sept 24 lorraine clark stared at the wicker basket that held the answer to her fate would hers be one of the names pulled from it \? inches behind her , richard o'brien put his arm around his wife , jackie , and tilted his head forward to listen name after name was being called where was his \? in a meeting room at our lady of the blessed sacrament , father frank mcnulty fished another slip of paper from the basket tina corona , the pastor called hot dog ! mrs corona shouted as she clapped her hands , giggled , and then slowly turned teary at her good fortune she would be among the audience in giants stadium on oct 5 for a mass celebrated by pope john paul ii the suspense at the blessed sacrament church today echoed similar scenes throughout the new york region in recent weeks , as many pastors parceling out a limited number of tickets to the pope s public events chose lotteries as the most equitable means of distribution the competition for tickets also hinted at the widely ranging sentiments the impending visit has stirred in catholics for while 382 parishioners submitted their names for the 90 pairs of tickets allotted to blessed sacrament , most of the roughly 1 , 600 families in the parish did not bother to test their luck i do n't know anything about the papal visit , said janice philips as she stood with two other mothers late wednesday afternoon in a parking lot outside the church you know more than i do , said kate farrell , one of the other mothers mrs farrell said she would love to find time in her work and childrearing schedules to pay more attention to the pope , but then she would also love to get all six of her activitiescrazed children to the dinner table at the same time in this busy life , one often settles for less interviews with parishioners at blessed sacrament , which straddles a leafy hilltop in a borough of 4 , 847 residents , suggested that while some feel so intimately connected to the pope that they pray for him daily , others feel so distant that they almost never think of him unless he makes the news mrs clark called the pope s journey to her home state the greatest thing that ever happened to me another parishioner called it a waste of money with all the needs we have , i do n't see why every place he goes , we should spend 1 million , said frank decoster , 86 , a retired insurance salesman mr decoster will steer clear of what he thinks will be a madding crowd in giants stadium , where , because of security demands , some will take their places as early as 1 pm for the 6 pm mass i ca n't see vegetating there for five or six hours , mr decoster said but bob pasquariello , one of the winners in today s lottery , ca n't see not doing that mr pasquariello , 45 , an airline security worker , has been in the pope s presence before , and said he will never forget it when the pope visited new york city in 1979 , mr pasquariello stood beside the van wyck expressway to watch his motorcade go by the sky was dark gray , threatening rain , until the pope appeared , he recalled then , suddenly , the sun fought through the clouds mr pasquariello remembered thinking that it was purposely orchestrated by god , and i'm not trying to sound corny mr pasquariello s mystical reverence for the pope was not at all uncommon among fellow parishioners with very few exceptions , they spoke of a visceral , reflexive regard for the pope that transcends any disagreements on such matters as the celibacy requirement for priests , the barring of women from the priesthood and the formal prohibition on artificial birth control we do n't like everything our husbands do , either , and we do n't reject them , mrs philips said in the parking lot on wednesday afternoon , eliciting laughter from mrs farrell and the third mother with them , susan ullmann none of the women had entered the ticket lottery , and none was concerned about it but still , they professed an ambiguous , ineffable affection for the pope that was as hard for them to ignore as it was to define asked if they defied his wishes and used artificial birth control , they paused for a moment and glanced sheepishly at each other before mumbling yes mrs farrell , the mother of six , quickly explained you ca n't keep having child after child he s over there in rome with no children some people who are active in the parish and the wider church received tickets to the pope s events without submitting to the lottery , revealing that the distribution system allowed at least some wiggle room for special treatment although most of the 85 , 000 tickets for giants stadium have been given to parishes in new jersey , with the number depending on parish size , roughly 4 , 000 were reserved for catholics who gave 500 or more to the 1995 appeal by archbishop theodore mccarrick of newark one parishioner at blessed sacrament , thomas costlow , said he has given about 2 , 500 to the catholic church over the last year he has been guaranteed a seat at giants stadium another parishioner , adrian foley , said he has done legal work for archbishop mccarrick mr foley has been guaranteed tickets not just to giants stadium but also to sacred heart cathedral in newark , where the pope will lead an evening prayer service oct 4 for an audience of just 1 , 800 mrs clark will be there too , because she has been a participant for two years in the archdiocesan synod , a policymaking group including clergy and laity even so , mrs clark said she desperately wanted a giants stadium ticket as well mrs clark , 50 , a registered nurse , grew up with pictures of various popes hanging on her family s dining room wall , and she sometimes uses a prayer card bearing pope john paul ii s visage as a bookmark hers was not one of the names pulled from the wicker basket today , so one of the nuns at blessed sacrament pledged to let mrs clark have the other ticket in her pair mr o'brien , 33 , a computer applications analyst , also came away emptyhanded he and his wife vowed to pursue other avenues and perhaps write a note of appeal to the priest who married them the priest works alongside archbishop mccarrick , they said vincent hartwick , yet another parishioner who watched the wicker basket without reward , shuffled out of the room quietly , apparently resigned to failure before the drawing , mr hartwick , 78 , a retired letter carrier , had said he prayed every day to get a ticket his wife was ill , he explained , and that made it seem essential to get to giants stadium mr hartwick said that somehow , he felt that being with the pope might make everything better
municipal bonds gained a bit more favor in the third quarter , with none of the 751 municipal funds tracked by morningstar losing money concerns about a flat tax proposal battered municipal funds earlier this year some of those fears have abated , but returns from municipal funds continue to lag behind those of taxable bond funds the taxable funds cooled off a bit from the torrid pace of earlier in the year , but the funds with the longest maturities especially the ultravolatile benham target funds continue to attract great interest those bond funds could be in for further gains if congress and president clinton come together with a meaningful deficit reduction package funds specializing in convertible securities dot the winners list for the most recent quarter , and those funds are attracting growing amounts of new cash , according to amg data services of arcata , calif municipal funds , meanwhile , attracted more money than flowed out in the week ended thursday the first time that has happened in a month michael metz , chief investment strategist at oppenheimer company , said more cash might be headed toward bond funds demand for credit will slacken , and that will bring about lower rates regardless of what the fed does , he said edward wyatt charts list total return for taxable bond funds and municipal bond funds \( source morningstar inc \)
the key words for airline passengers to remember to get where they are going this holiday season , especially passengers headed to and from the snowbound northeast , are patience and flexibility with more than a million passengers booked on flights today as well as tomorrow and saturday , airports will be more crowded and skies less friendly than usual add to the usual holiday crush those passengers who had been booked on flights that were canceled yesterday and tuesday , and there are all the ingredients for mass frustration for those looking for a magic way to cut through the chaos , the answer is this there is none the standard advice is to phone the airline long before leaving for the airport , to learn whether the flight has been delayed or canceled airlines say they do their best to provide uptodate information , either on a tape or person to person of course , getting through on the phone can be a problem when everyone else is calling at that point , there are two choices , seasoned travelers say try to figure out what is going on by listening to an allnews radio station or just head to the airport passengers are also urged to allow extra time if going on snowy or icy roads , and to add at least 30 minutes for not only the routine security checks but also the additional security measures decreed by the federal aviation administration beginning in august adult passengers are required to produce a photo identification on request passengers holding reservations have precedence on that flight over passengers who held reservations on a flight that was canceled sometimes it is quicker to book again by going to a pay phone and calling the airline rather than waiting in a long line with everyone else who has been grounded the airlines say they will do everything possible to accommodate people whose flights were canceled as standby passengers , but with planes filling up for the holidays , standbys should get to the airport as early as possible to get listed in the computer when they do make a flight , they may have to settle for a stopover or change of planes , instead of the nonstop they originally booked , and they may arrive late at night rather than at midday

mr mullen asked in response to a telephone call from a reporter that an announcement was coming oh , good the advertising business is not one of great stability , he added you must be prepared for a life that includes change none of the agency s 175 employees will be laid off because of the bmw loss , mr mullen said , adding that they feel very comfortable because we gave our best by adding attributes like value and safety to bmw s reputation for performance still , he added , if i have any regrets it s that we and bmw could not have addressed this change more directly mr mullen , a selfproclaimed absolutely certifiable car junkie whose book about management , the simple art of greatness \( viking \) , was published monday , owns 17 automobiles , three of which are bmw s , plus one that s a company car asked if he 'd now sell some or all of the bmw s , he quickly replied why should n't i keep them \?

durango , mexico even in uniform , with his badge shining and his shoulders squared by the stars of a commander in the mexican federal highway police , miguel angel reyes makes a somewhat unlikely crusader for honest enforcement of the law though he earns only about 1 , 000 a month , he offers no apology for the rolex watch on his wrist nor does he look twice at the highway patrolmen who saunter in and out of his headquarters behind the durango bus station carrying semiautomatic rifles and other nonstandard weapons it is not that i am how do you call it \? a puritan , mr reyes said when asked about the corruption that is virtually taken for granted in mexican law enforcement but there are some things that you cannot go along with and mr reyes says he finally refused to go along when officers under his command told him last august that they had been forced by federal judicial police agents to acquiesce in the theft of tons of colombian cocaine that highway patrolmen had seized near sombrerete , about 80 miles southeast of durango after federal agents maintained that they had recovered only 25 tons of cocaine from a cargo that american officials said might have been 10 tons , which would be worth 200 million wholesale , mr reyes reported the episode to every senior official he could think of the highway police chief , a state governor , the head of the federal drugenforcement agency but while considerable evidence has emerged to support his initial report , mr reyes , 55 , is being treated as something less than a hero federal prosecutors say they have found no proof of wrongdoing and have no plans to investigate further several federal and highway police officers involved in the incident have moved on to better posts mr reyes , however , has been called back to mexico city by his superiors and told he will face a disciplinary hearing for speaking out without permission commander reyes was right to have the concerns that he had initially , but we have taken these facts as far as we can with the investigative authorities , the director of the highway police , antonio arizpe , said in an interview in mexico city he is acting now without authorization we cannot have the force defamed by rumors other mexican officials say they wish the sombrerete case would just go away they note that the reported theft of the cocaine took place in the last months of president carlos salinas de gortari s administration and that an investigation then was supervised by two officials who have since been charged in other cases of corruption this is not our package , said one official in the new administration of president ernesto zedillo yet largely because of mr reyes , one of the few mexican police officials in memory to accuse his comrades of drugrelated corruption , the incident has not gone away united states officials , who seemed to have given up on the case as one of many that went unsolved under mr salinas , now say they hope for a more credible inquiry gov arturo romo of zacatecas state , where sombrerete is located , has also pressed mr zedillo for further investigation in a report to the director of the highway police three days after a caravelle jet landed near sombrerete on aug 4 , mr reyes , who commands a region that includes durango and zacatecas , gave an account of the seizure that he had heard in interviews with each of the 15 highway patrolmen involved when federal judicial police agents responsible for antidrug operations failed to answer an urgent report of the plane s landing , two highway patrolmen took off in pursuit mr reyes said they caught one of three trucks carrying cocaine from the plane and captured its driver , and later found the two other trucks abandoned in sombrerete speaking on the condition they not be identified , two other officials corroborated key parts of mr reyes s account that the truck driver had vanished after being handed over to the judicial police that dozens of judicial police officials had intercepted a convoy carrying the cocaine back to zacatecas and unloaded part of the cargo , and that the federal agents appeared to have stolen even part of the 25 tons of cocaine they said they had recovered american officials say cocaine in the same packaging found at sombrerete was seized along the united statesmexican border soon after the flight but officials of the mexican attorney general s office , the federal judicial police and the highway police say that whatever mr reyes s officers may have told him , they later denied in sworn testimony that any theft of cocaine had taken place the judicial police commander in charge of the operation , david grajeda lara , offered an especially angry denial mr grajeda suggested obliquely that if there was any wrongdoing in the case , it was probably on the part of mr reyes but what none of mr reyes s detractors have come up with is a plausible reason why he might have risked his career and possibly his life by inventing or exaggerating his account mr reyes acknowledged having a poor relationship with the director of the highway police , antonio arizpe before being sent out into the northern desert as regional commander in durango , mr reyes had served as the highway patrol s operations chief , inspector general and director of its training academy he said he had quarreled with mr arizpe when he refused to support mr arizpe s efforts to dislodge the previous director of the force several mexican officials said mr arizpe had a similar confrontation with jorge vergara , a former commander who is close to mr reyes and who left the force to work in the campaign of the governingparty presidential candidate who was assassinated last year , luis donaldo colosio mr vergara briefly became a focus of the colosio inquiry after being accused of drugrelated corruption by a jailed former officer he was never charged with any crime asked if he was trying to use the sombrerete story as a scheme for professional advancement , mr reyes dismissed the idea as absurd if what i reported is not true , then i was very , very stupid to have opened my mouth , he said the only other choice i had was to be part of the coverup but then , it cannot be that dozens of guys from the two main police forces of the country could be mixed up in something like this , you report it , and then nothing happens photo miguel angel reyes , a commander in the mexican federal highway police in durango , reported the suspected theft of tons of cocaine by federal agents now his superiors say he may face a disciplinary hearing \( phillippe diederich for the new york times \) maps shows the location of durango , mexico
houston , nov 22 a federal grand jury here has returned an indictment of dr stanislaw burzynski , the latest salvo in a 12year battle between the physician and the food and drug administration the lengthy investigation , and the current indictment , stem from the doctor s development and use of a drug called antineoplaston , originally derived from specially processed human urine and now also produced synthetically , which dr burzynski says helps cells' response to disease the indictment of the doctor and his clinic , the burzynski research institute , alleges 40 counts of using an unapproved drug in interstate commerce , 34 counts of mail fraud in the submitting of false and misleading claims for payment to insurers , and 1 count of contempt for violating a federal court s order against interstate delivery of the drug the indictment says dr burzynski has treated more than 2 , 500 patients with antineoplaston for a variety of maladies , including at least eight forms of cancer , aids , lupus , multiple sclerosis , arthritis , skin disorders and baldness patients were charged 34250 each for a daily intravenous dose , 685 for a megadose and up to 200 daily for oral capsules , the government says those fees , the indictment says , generated 40 million in gross income from 1988 through 1994 dr burzynski s conduct in violating the law has continued over too long a period of time and affected thousands of persons across the nation , united states attorney gaynelle griffin jones said in announcing the indictment on monday the doctor s lawyer , richard jaffee , said we think what dr burzynski is doing is legal his plant is in full compliance with fda regulations and is periodically inspected by the fda critics say dr burzynski has preyed upon the most vulnerable of the ill in making unsubstantiated claims for an unapproved drug his supporters , on the other hand , have testified before congress on his behalf and say he has been singled out for persecution by a zealous federal agency dr burzynski , 53 , left his native poland in 1970 and spent seven years working as a researcher at the baylor college of medicine before starting his own practice in 1983 , the fda filed a civil suit to shut down his clinic for the use of unapproved drugs a federal judge , gabrielle mcdonald , ruled in that case that he could continue his practice in texas but could not ship the drugs out of state since then , he has been engaged in a constant round of battles with state and federal officials alike but although the doctor appeared before three previous federal grand juries , none indicted him his lawyer , mr jaffee , presented testimony on his case this summer before the house commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations , a proceeding that prompted the chairman , representative joe barton , republican of texas , to write to attorney general janet reno requesting an investigation into the possible abuse of the grand jury system to harass and punish the doctor it is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to fail to indict at the request of a us attorney , mr barton wrote , adding that a grand jury failing to indict some three to four times on essentially the same base of facts is virtually unprecedented mr jaffee , dr burzynski s lawyer , said that the fda had waived the first phase of the drug s clinical testing , to determine toxicity , based on the doctor s patient base and that clinical trials of the drug were continuing he said that there was anecdotal evidence the drug worked and that in any case it s a treatment which does n't hurt anybody dr burzynski runs his practice in a modest clinic on the city s west side , with four examining rooms , two infusion rooms , a waiting area and office space farther west , in the community of stafford , just outside houston , is the burzynski research institute , which conducts only research , and the manufacturing center that produces the drug one of those who testified on the doctor s behalf before the congressional subcommittee this summer was mary michaels , whose son paul was found to have an inoperable brain tumor in 1985 , when he was 4 years old after consulting with physicians around the country , and trying treatments like laetrile and a macrobiotic diet , the michaelses learned of dr burzynski and came to houston for treatment since then , ms michaels said , her son s tumor has shrunk from three inches in diameter to the size of a pea , and he enjoys a normal life i want to tell you what the fda s persecution of dr burzynski means to me , ms michaels testified if it was n't for dr burzynski , our son would be dead
government agents began conducting surveillance of some defendants in the terror conspiracy trial of sheik omar abdel rahman as early as 1989 , when lawenforcement officials photographed two of them taking target practice on long island with three men who were later convicted in the world trade center bombing that information , which came out in testimony yesterday during the conspiracy trial of mr abdel rahman and 10 others in federal district court in manhattan , indicated that lawenforcement agencies were collecting information about the trade center bombers and other terrorism suspects considerably earlier than had previously been disclosed the prosecution testimony about the 1989 activities of the men seemed aimed at showing the jury that the defendants had ties with each other going back several years beginning well before mr abdel rahman , the main defendant in the trial , even came to live in the united states among the elements in the case that the government needs to prove is the existence of a jihad organization that plotted terrorist acts against the united states but the testimony seemed to deepen questions that had been raised earlier about the fbi s failure to take measures to avert the trade center explosion in february 1993 , which killed six people and injured more than 1 , 000 some of the questions have been raised over the role of an fbi informer , emad salem , who is expected to be a crucial witness in the trial mr salem worked as an informer for the federal bureau of investigation in 1991 and 1992 , when the relationship was broken off in 1993 , after the trade center attack , mr salem recorded conversations he had with his fbi contacts in which he seemed to scold them for ignorning his warnings that a terror attack was being planned and the information disclosed in court yesterday indicated that the fbi had put the trade center plotters under surveillance even before mr salem presumably began providing information about them testimony in the case resumed yesterday after a postponement caused on monday by the decision of a principal witness in the case , siddig ibrahim siddig ali , to change his plea from not guilty to guilty yesterday morning , before the jurors entered the courtroom , there was some angry wrangling between judge michael b mukasey and defense lawyers over mr siddig ali s changed plea and the detailed statement he made in court implicating each of the other defendants defense lawyers asked for a mistrial , arguing that mr siddig ali s pleabargain negotiations , which began a week before opening statements , took place without the knowledge of lawyers for the other defendants , thereby depriving them of the opportunity to attack mr siddig ali s credibility in their opening remarks yesterday morning , judge mukasey did not formally rule on the motion , but his comments to lawyers and his eagerness to resume testimony suggested that he was inclined to reject the mistrial motion with the jury back in the courtroom , the prosecution called several lawenforcement officials to the stand , including james p fogle , an fbi agent , who said he photographed several suspects as they came in and out of a mosque at 552 atlantic avenue in brooklyn on july 2 , 1989 mr fogle said he saw several men carrying boxes and other objects draped in cloth out of the mosque and loading them into vans and cars parked nearby he and other agents then followed the men as they drove to the calverton shooting range near riverhead , li , where mr fogle photographed them firing what he said were ak47 assault rifles and 9millimeter semiautomatic pistols at targets among the men visible in mr fogle s photographs were two of the defendants in the case now under way , el sayyid a nosair and clement hamptonel , along with three of the men convicted last year in the trade center bombing , mohammed a salameh , nidal a ayyad and mahmud abouhalima mr nosair was later tried in the assassination of rabbi meier kahane in 1990 , and though he was acquitted of that charge , he was convicted on related weapons charges the kahane assassination is now seen by the government as one element in the overall terrorist conspiracy mr hamptonel is charged with helping to organize military training for the defendants and with obtaining bombmaking materials mr fogle of the fbi said that at one point , one of the men at the shooting range fired an ak47 into the ground three or four feet in front of himself , whereupon mr abouhalima came over , grabbed the weapon and like slapped the person for , you know , carelessness none of the witnesses yesterday specified what led the fbi to begin surveillance of the men at the mosque , though valerie s amsterdam , one of the defense lawyers , asked mr fogle if the bureau was looking into muslim groups that at the time were sending money and men to help in the muslim struggle against the soviet union in afghanistan the government s theory , which it is seeking to prove to the jury , is that the jihad organization , whose ideological leader was mr abdel rahman , aimed at waging a war of urban terrorism against the united states by plotting to blow up buildings , tunnels and bridges in the new york metropolitan area photo as early as 1989 , federal agents had some men under surveillance who are now on trial in a bombing plot two of the men were photographed that year at a shooting range with three others who were later convicted in the trade center bombing one of the three was mohammed a salameh , taking aim \( edward keating

williamsburg , va , may 13 at the end of a week of passionate washington arguments over how much to cut the federal budget , both republicans and top officials of the clinton administration came here to convince america s top business executives that their approach has the best chance of keeping a thriving american economy from driving off the edge it was a crowd of natural republicans , who emerged entranced by the energy and determination of representative john r kasich of ohio , the house budget committee chairman who on friday brought his laundry list of cuts but when it came to the details , they balked at many of the most extreme cuts , from the deepest slashes in medicare to the elimination of the commerce department an agency that democrats , of all people , have turned more probusiness than at almost any time in its 130year history i think everyone here agrees that reducing the deficit will be a major factor in improving the economy , said lawrence a bossidy , the chairman and chief executive of allied signal inc , and the vice chairman of the business council , which held its semiannual meeting of top corporate officials here over the last three days but can you eliminate it by 2002 without hurting the economy \? i do n't know and why would you start by eliminating commerce \? the reaction seemed to suggest that the administration had succeeded in winning over a number of executives with its effort to undercut the republican s traditional source of strength and support both with its promotion of american exports and its willingness to confront japan and china on trade barriers that could pay off in the budget battle that will stretch through much of the rest of the year in contrast , many executives said , the administration seems to have lost whatever credit it once enjoyed for beginning to bring down the budget deficit the session here also underscored a political reality that is leaving america s largest businesses feeling a bit irrelevant their influence over the new republican majority in congress is on the wane in an age of talk radio and a more ideological right , when small business has emerged as an easier fit for a new generation of republicans , a centrist and essentially antiideological group of executives has less of a role to play curiously , not one of the republican aspirants for the presidential nomination came to speak to the group gov pete wilson of california was scheduled to speak , but canceled after some minor throat surgery the business council bars reporters from sessions between the executives and the government officials but from accounts provided by the participants , mr kasich , the 43year old leader of the republicans' most aggressive budgetcutting plan , arrived more in a mood to explain his strategy than to seek support he talked about deep cuts in the capital gains tax which he insisted would cost the country nothing because it would generate new investment , a theory that ran into considerable trouble in the reagan administration and the need to slash taxes he did a spectacular job of making his case , alexander j trotman , chairman of the ford motor company , said , adding , the whole package sounds like a businesslike and pragmatic approach but scratch just beneath the enthusiasm for mr kasich s deficitcutting ardor and there seemed to be surprisingly little common ground on the some of the key details of the house budget plan in a survey of business council members released at the start of the meeting here , twothirds of the executives said they wanted all the savings from budget cutting to go toward cutting the deficit , with no tax cuts at all just shy of a third wanted the savings to go into a mixture of deficit reduction and tax savings , and only 2 percent wanted all the savings to go to tax cuts moreover , the argument offered by the administration over the last week , that a commitment to balance the budget in seven years is bad economics that could prevent the government from smoothing out economic downturns , struck a chord even among even the most fiscally conservative none said they would be willing to lock their own corporate budgets into a similar plan these are moderate republicans , donna shalala , the secretary of health and human services , said this morning after she emerged from a twohour discussion on how to reform the welfare system insisting that the administration s attack on the republican plans as coldhearted and unwise was sinking in , she said the executives were slowly realizing that there are steps they would never do in their own businesses
i tore the ligaments in my shoulder going for the gamewinning touchdown in a football game it was n't as if i had a choice i waited and waited for a pass , but the quarterback was n't throwing to me when the ball finally came , i had to chase it down at all costs before my recent injury , i played sundays in central park in a fun , challenging , coed pickup game but when i went outside that circle of friends and played others , it turned from exercise into existentialism i was on a team , yet felt abandoned and alone , running out for passes which never came , playing against opponents who could n't see me was i really invisible \? maybe i simply did n't exist if i keep going out for the ball and no one has any intention of throwing to me , then am i playing a lie \? am i playing at all \? the mere presence of a woman on the field humiliates the guy she s covering we 're human scarlet letters the teammates of the poor guy are pained to look at him poor guy , a girl s covering him i guess it adds a lot of extra pressure for him i mean , if he ca n't catch a ball when he s covered by a woman , he must really stink of course , that s if anyone notices he s covered one friend calls it the stealth factor i could be standing on the opposing player s toes , my elbows in his back and though he s slow as a jelly roll , he s still always open i'm open i'm open , he yells , killing the hairs in my ear , as i jog down the field making sure not to overrun him i have more hearing loss from playing against men who ca n't see me than dancing near the speakers at the continental when i cover a woman , she usually does n't yell , but we cancel each other because neither of us can be seen the day of the big injury , i was surprised to find i was the only woman in the fiveonfive mix although this was not my usual game , it was with members of my softball team i was really excited about the game i'm ok at softball , but i consider football to be my best sport my build is pretty good for football i 've got a low center of gravity , which grounds my strong , swivel hips for sharp cuts and maneuvers down field my small size cuts down on wind resistance and is invaluable in the sneak factor \( my ability to break free of the crowd or get open in the end zone \) on this sunday , i could n't wait to get open in the end zone but it did n't matter how open i was the game would be full of the same frustrations i met on the field each time i play with a new group of men it did't matter that these were friends and associates i 've been playing softball , and yes , sometimes football , with for years it did n't matter that danny , the captain of the softball team , turned out to be my team s quarterback \( yes , the same captain who would wink when our opponents did the female shift when a woman stepped to the plate yes , the same captain who scoffed at the other side for never learning after our women hit the ball over their heads \) instead , the stealth factor was on huddle after huddle , i listened to danny call plays for my other teammates play after play , i watched incomplete pass after incomplete pass thrown to others when i was just as capable of missing those balls as they were we were losing the game , and i wanted some action i debated in my mind whether to say something ok , was anybody open \? danny prompted i spoke up , but i still did n't get a pass perhaps i had my audio turned off the thing was , if i complained and then missed the ball , it would be remembered forever i 'd never get another chance there would be a deafening unspoken harrumph while i managed to make a few interceptions , none of my qb s throws were to me i 'd sprint out hard to get open , but by five mississippi the ball would be thrown to someone else and i 'd come back to the line and start the whole thing again i felt like i was waiting for godot , auditing a class or just doing wind sprints was i competing or was i just the team s mascot \? how long would i have to wait for a pass \? we were down four touchdowns to six danny said he had to leave soon we decided to play to seven touchdowns , meaning one more and they 'd win somehow , with a burst of energy and strategy we got a fifth touchdown , narrowing the gap and then , we got the ball back on the next set of downs , i was open in the end zone by three mississippi i'm open i'm open four mississippi danny was almost out of time boom , he threw it to me touchdown tied score , 66 their team was disoriented again , somehow , we kept them from scoring now , we had the ball back with a chance to win i had caught the last touchdown and i wanted to catch another i planted my hand on danny s shoulder and firmly said , i can beat my man long danny looked at me he told me later that his pause was full of you , a girl \? you must be kidding but instead he said , ok , it s coming to you ok , i said , but do n't throw it short because he s bigger than me and he 'll knock it down i do n't remember if my man hit me off the line , but i got around him as fast as i could then , looking over my shoulder , i saw the ball sailing in the air , going deep , way deep , deeper than possible to catch but i had to catch it i 'd fly if i had to the ball was sloping down to earth she leaped out into the end zone , her body fully extended , recalled a teammate my fingertips met the ball but i was still in the air if i hit the ground like that , i 'd have dropped the ball she pulled it to her body , cradling it as a mother cradles her baby to protect it , said another teammate the impact with the ground severed the ligaments in my shoulder and rattled the brains in my head but still touchdown ! game over ! what do you mean you would have dropped the ball if you 'd have known , danny said later how could you say that \? you could have dropped the ball and still have gotten a concussion you know what they say , 'pain is temporary , but glory lasts forever' yeah , yeah , just throw me the ball next time , and i wo n't have to make every play for women everywhere drawing
god bless john wayne by kinky friedman 253 pp new york simon schuster 22 there are two basic attitudes toward mystery stories the first combines contempt and puzzlement why should so many intelligent people be devotees of such a demotic form of literature \? the great critic edmund wilson articulated this position in two stinging essays in the mid1940 s , why do people read detective stories \? and \( in a reference to a novel by agatha christie \) who cares who killed roger ackroyd \? from the age of 12 , wilson wrote , he felt that he was outgrowing that form of literature considering , and dismissing , various celebrated practitioners of the genre , wilson concluded that we shall do well to discourage the squandering of paper that might be put to better use the second attitude is one of passionate , not to say uncritical , devotion w h auden spoke up for this position in a famous essay called the guilty vicarage admitting that mystery stories , particularly those set in english country houses , were for him an addiction like tobacco or alcohol , auden analyzed what he called their magical function the spell cast by whodunits , he suggested , depends not on their virtues as works of art but on their predictable , even formulaic , presentation of a drama of lost innocence and order successfully restored at bottom , he concluded , the appeal of mystery novels was more religious than literary it may seem odd to mention such matters in the same breath with kinky friedman , the world s funniest , bawdiest and most politically incorrect country music singer turned mystery writer but underneath \( even if quite far underneath \) their coruscatingly irreverent surfaces , kinky friedman s novels there are eight of them now supply , as dependably as any english cozy , the satisfactions auden outlined not that the novels themselves are cozy kinky \( it is impossible to address him as mr friedman \) is the detective hero of all his books , and nothing that the cigarsmoking , irishwhiskyswilling , cowboybootwearing former leader of a band called kinky friedman and the texas jewboys does can be called cozy like most of his earlier novels , god bless john wayne is set largely in new york , ground zero being kinky s dilapidated loft somewhere off vandam street kinky s fans will appreciate that the plot revolves around an attempt to discover the real mother of his supremely weedy friend larry sloman , a k a ratso the thought of ratso actually having a mother being itself a matter of high comedy there are enough items now in kinky friedman s oeuvre to make some comparisons , and i have no hesitation in pronouncing god bless john wayne a classic , a notch beneath a case of lone star , perhaps , but right up there with armadillos old lace and elvis , jesus cocacola the humor gleams as brightly as kinky s brontosaurusforeskin cowboy boots , and there is a little something to offend people of every known ethnic background , religious persuasion , sexual orientation , political affiliation , nationality and age group musing on the number of germans who were shot while driving rentacars in miami , kinky confesses that for the past few years now when , in my travels , i 've come across a party of german tourists someplace i 've always made it a matter of conscience to approach their table with a friendly , innocent , american smile and say 'have you checked out miami \?

aschauimchiemgau , ger many the war was ending and berlin was in ruins when hansernst schneider shed the uniform of a nazi ss officer and slipped into obscurity , abandoning his name and his history and there the story might have ended another nazi easing into the fabric of modern germany had it not been for the coverup and intrigue that in april forced an 85yearold pillar of german learning , hans schwerte , to acknowledge that he was hansernst schneider as schneider , records indicate , he served on heinrich himmler s staff and was a leader of a unit that carried out horrific experiments on concentration camp inmates , though he denied taking part in the atrocities in the year that marks the 50th anniversary the end of world war ii , the case has stunned german intellectuals and fascinated them with its implications was the flight of hansernst schneider no more than another tale of a nazi fugitive or , as professor schwerte now implies , was it a parable for modern germany , turning its back on the shames of history to build a new society \? most unsettling to those who knew and worked with him how wide was , or is , the web of academic and political protectors that kept his identity secret as he rose to the heights of scholarly and social acclaim \? in academic circles , the case has been compared to the story of paul de man , the yale professor who concealed the fact that he had contributed articles to a pronazi publication in belgium during the war in professor schwerte s case , the masquerade ended only when he acknowledged his history in a letter to the college authorities in western city of aachen after , he said , anonymous phone calls and letters threatened to divulge his true identity another reason was that a dutch television investigation of his ss activities in the netherlands was about to be broadcast since then , the story that he has told casting himself as a victim of persecution and circumstance and wartime records combine to weave a chronicle that might inspire a novelist after fleeing berlin in civilian clothes , hansernst schneider , a nazi hauptsturmfuhrer who served in the ss under himmler , used his wartime contacts to procure documents pronouncing him to be hans schwerte , a simple soldier two years later , in munich , hans schwerte remarried annemarie schneider , who told the authorities that her first husband , hansernst schneider , had died in the final battle for berlin by that time , the former hansernst schneider had retrieved a family and an identity from nazism s ashes but his credentials as an expert in germanic studies had died with his ss uniform so he repeated his courses at the university of erlangen for a doctorate in germanic studies , he said , and hans schwerte rose from the penurious life of a fugitive to the heights of german and austrian academia in aachen he was appointed rector at a university called the technical high school the german and belgian authorities awarded him high civilian honors the state educational authorities appointed him as their liaison with universities in belgium and the netherlands prof walter hinderer , who teaches german literature of the 18th to the 20th century at princeton , said professor schwerte was a german scholar quite wellknown in germany but not abroad nonetheless , professor hinderer said , the german scholar s name and work were generally familiar to american students of goethe , professor schwerte s specialty of his achievements , professor schwerte said none of that was a lie only the name was a lie he declined to be interviewed face to face , but spoke in a series of telephone interviews from his home in this village under the shadow of the bavarian alps , 50 miles southeast of munich , which has been his retirement home for 17 years since the disclosure , president roman herzog has stripped professor schwerte of a high honor , the national service cross , first class , awarded in 1983 for his services to german scholarship the unmasking has left another puzzle was the affair uncovered because of the research of an american academic in germany who as early as 1992 sought to enlist the nazihunter simon wiesenthal in the effort to discover whether professor hans schwerte was , in reality , hauptsturmfuhrer schneider \? there are many schwertes in other fields , mr wiesenthal said , but the fact that he could become the rector of a university is unique mr wiesenthal said in a telephone interview from vienna that his own inquiries at salzburg university , where professor schwerte became an honorary professor in 1984 , ran into a stone wall of silence professor schwerte acknowledges help from friends , but says most are now dead what is less certain is whether he will face any kind of formal investigation under the statute of limitations , mr wiesenthal said , charges that could be brought against professor schwerte because of his membership of the ss division called the ahnenerbe the department that dealt with matters ranging from the promotion of hitler s pangermanic visions to lurid and fatal experiments on human beings in concentration camps in any event , the professor denies committing war crimes i wore that uniform , he said but i never committed a crime in that uniform my work was purely academic records from the berlin document center , a reference center for nazi archives , and professor schwerte s own recounting of his life say he joined the ss in 1937
on friday , after 11 weeks of trial , testimony in the lawsuit against new york hospital and four doctors in the death of 18yearold libby zion concluded at last , leaving many questions unanswered fortyfive , and counting after summations , which are to begin today , the jury will work through one of the longest verdict questionnaires ever in a new york state civil trial the questions address the judgment calls made by the doctors during that long march night in 1984 when ms zion went to the hospital with fever and chills she died about eight hours later , after her fever spiked to 108 degrees and she went into cardiac arrest a typical question goes something like this did dr x depart from accepted medical practice by failing to order test y for ms zion \? and each question is followed by if the answer to the first is yes , did that action contribute to ms zion s pain and suffering and to her death \? only if both answers are yes can a defendant be found negligent now for that indelicate question how much is the case worth \? not very much , say many medical malpractice lawyers under new york law , damages for wrongful death are limited to the economic worth of the deceased to the next of kin ms zion was not , for example , a working parent with two dependent children she was a college freshman , supported by her parents her father , the journalist sidney zion , who is bringing the lawsuit , stands a better chance of collecting for his daughter s pain and suffering her lawyers have argued throughout the trial that her discomfort worsened because doctors gave her the wrong drug and , when she started thrashing around , ordered nurses to tie her down while thomas a moore , the zions' lawyer , may ask for a whopping amount , lawyers in the field predict that an appellate court will reduce it to about 300 , 000 this assumes , of course , that the jury comes down entirely against the defendants jurors could buy outright the defense s argument that the doctors' care was appropriate and that ms zion contributed to her death by failing to disclose that she had taken cocaine and award nothing or jurors could find only some of the doctors negligent they could also split the award , saying , for example , that ms zion was 30 percent responsible and the doctors and the hospital 70 percent defendants would then pay 70 percent of the total damages amount but friday evening , judge elliott wilk of state supreme court in manhattan , gave mr moore his dearest wish the right to ask for punitive damages to make such an award , a jury also has to find that the defendants were grossly negligent that they acted with reckless disregard for ms zion s condition it is a very high hurdle new york appellate courts have virtually never upheld punitive damages , in part because medical malpractice cases are usually settled before a plaintiff s lawyer gets to pose such a question to a jury if jurors vote to send a deterrent message with punitive damages , the amount is limited only by the defendants' net worth small wonder , then , that this case has been so hard fought for mr zion , punitive damages would underscore his decadelong struggle to correct what he says were flaws in the supervision of young doctors for the defendants , there is an institutional stake in turning away such a verdict there is also a powerful pecuniary one the money would come out of their pockets insurance covers awards for malpractice , but not punitive damages stuffing a cat back in a bag in the 10th week of testimony , the zion lawyers' worst nightmare was realized before the trial started , judge wilk had blocked any testimony about possible cocaine use other than ms zion s inconclusive autopsy results such information would be prejudicial , he said , because no one had witnessed her using the drug just before she went to the hospital but the defense s psychopharmacologist , dr george simpson , broke that rule during crossexamination by mr moore dr simpson had testified that a factor in ms zion s death had been the interaction between cocaine and nardil , the potent antidepressant she had been taking mr moore pressed dr simpson to concede that his opinion that ms zion had been using cocaine was based on unreliable tests unless the doctor had other information meaning about the tests mr moore assumed dr simpson had none it was the information that she had used cocaine in the past , with her boyfriend s testimony , dr simpson said , alluding to pretrial statements the remark was a deadly blow to the zions' case in a rapid attempt to recover , mr moore ignored those statements and instead tried to discredit the expert are you saying , doctor , that you relied on information from a jilted boyfriend \? asked the lawyer , looking aghast do you pride yourself on your professionalism \? he thundered later , judge wilk instructed jurors to disregard most of dr simpson s testimony but as a court tv commentator said , that was like telling them to forget they had seen a pink elephant an alarming false alarm under the gaze of the court tv camera , tension built steadily during a trial that was fought ferociously by lawyers whose ill will toward one another exploded regularly after the jury had left for lunch on friday , judge wilk appeared to have finally reached his limit miss karas ! he shouted to the court tv reporter i 've just learned something disquieting turn off those cameras ! we 'll do this off the record elizabeth j karas , who had joined court tv only six months ago , dashed into the well , pale and trembling memories of the mishap from the o j simpson trial , in which a court tv camera inadvertently showed an alternate juror for nearly a second , sprang to mind then judge wilk jettisoned his wrathofjustice mask i just heard it was your birthday , he said , with a grin then he handed her a piece of cake with a lit candle and led the entire courtroom in singing happy birthday to a stunned , blushing and abundantly relieved ms karas
mexico city , nov 4 doctors are struggling to identify a mysterious disease in the dirtpoor backlands of northwestern nicaragua whose victims die suffocated by their own blood according to the world health organization , 18 people have died and more than 1 , 000 suspected cases have been reported in the epidemic , which first appeared in the farming village of achuapa in rugged hills about 50 miles northwest of managua , the capital researchers in nicaragua and at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta have determined , based on samples from the victims , that the illness is not hemorrhagic dengue fever , a disease accompanied by agonizing bone pain that is already endemic in nicaragua they have also ruled out yellow fever , another disease that , like dengue , is carried by mosquitoes those stricken by the unidentified illness suffer from high fever , severe abdominal pain and body ache , all symptoms of dengue as well but the patients also develop severe hemorrhaging , which fills their lungs with blood without treatment , they suffocate in three or four days , doctors in nicaragua who are treating the disease said today last week president violeta chamorro declared a medical emergency in the country , and the health ministers of the five central american nations convened on friday to discuss the epidemic medical investigators do not know what causes the disease or how it is transmitted but it does not appear to be passed through the air or by personal contact , a spokesman for the pan american health organization , daniel epstein , said by telephone from managua researchers suspect there may be an animal carrier for the disease , which has been tentatively named achuapa febrile syndrome , but have not ruled out a mutation of some familiar virus achuapa is in a region of dry hardscrabble hills where water and food are scarce but torrential rains spun off from an unusual series of caribbean hurricanes in recent months washed rats and cockroaches from their holes and provided new breeding grounds for mosquitoes and countless other tropical insects the epidemic has spread to other towns near achuapa but does not appear to have spread outside the region , mr epstein said patients are being treated at the teaching hospital in leon , the largest city in the area if they come to us right away , we can save them , the hospital director , dr donald quintana fajardo , said by telephone from leon but nicaraguans have a machismo complex where we pretend there is nothing wrong with us they only come to the hospital at the last minute dr quintana said 133 patients suspected of having the disease were under treatment in leon with intravenous liquids and blood and treatment to control the fever , doctors have succeeded in stopping the onset of bleeding in the lungs , he said but blood components needed for treatment are in critically short supply a team of physicians from the world health organization , the pan american health organization , the nicaraguan health ministry and the government of cuba are scouting the achuapa hills to detect patients and possible carriers in the early years of the rule of the sandinista national liberation front in the 1980 s , government health programs were greatly expanded but years of war with the contra rebels , who were backed by the united states , sapped the public health system the government of president chamorro has not received the aid from the united states or other countries that she expected , and the economy has remained stalled , forcing her to limit public services the living conditions in achuapa are deplorable , dr quintana said none of their basic needs are satisfied this year almost 11 , 000 cases of dengue were reported in nicaragua , and cholera is also endemic map of nicaragua showing location of achuapa
on its surface , the proposal seems barely capable of causing a ripple administrators of the community school district on the upper west side of manhattan hope next fall to move a kindergarten class for gifted and talented students from an elementary school on west 84th street to another one five blocks away to the district superintendent , james mazza , the rationale is simple public school 9 , where the gifted program is now housed , is not accessible to the handicapped public school 166 , where all five grades of the gifted program would eventually move , will be soon but parents at ps 9 , one of several dozen magnet schools credited with keeping middleclass families from abandoning the public schools , are deeply suspicious that mr mazza is trying to improve another school at their school s expense thanks to its magnet program , whose special courses draw students from around the city , ps 9 is now considered one of the city s best elementary schools a decade ago , it was in much the same shape as ps 166 , which is ranked in the lower half of the city s elementary schools several hundred ps 9 parents voiced their anger wednesday night at a candlelight protest and public hearing and the five teachers who work with the gifted program signed a petition saying they would refuse to move , including maria shapiro , the kindergarten teacher whose resistance to the plan has made her the focal point of the dispute that a quartermile move would provoke such vocal opposition underscores how attached parents and teachers can become to a good public school , especially one for which parents raise nearly 50 , 000 a year in private donations the dispute also highlights how difficult it can be for administrators to make even the smallest of changes , particularly when questions of race and access are involved ps 9 s student body is more than onethird white ps 166 s has a much larger proportion of black and hispanic students nobody ever likes change , said michael weinberg , the acting principal at ps 166 , a centuryold gothicstyle building on 89th street between amsterdam and columbus avenues i think that s what s really happening you could move them to any building and they would resist the problem is moving , not where they are going many of the parents and teachers at ps 9 contend that mr mazza is being less than honest in explaining his motivation , and that an effort to improve test scores at the weaker school is as much a factor as the issue of handicapped access ps 9 , helped in part by the gifted program , was ranked 49th in reading last spring out of 633 elementary schools citywide ps 166 , however , was ranked 362d , a number sure to go up if nearly 150 gifted students , most testing above the 90th percentile in intelligence , join the pool at the same time , parents predict , ps 9 s scores would likely go down parents at ps 9 see the move as potentially destroying an excellent school in a city where so many things do n't work , why tear up a school that is working \? said rik kirkland , an assistant managing editor at fortune magazine whose 5yearold daughter , allegra , is in the gifted program but several teachers and parents at ps 166 said it was the parents at ps 9 who were being disingenuous , and that their resistance to moving was rooted in racism ps 9 , again bolstered by the gifted program , to which students from all over the city apply , is 36 percent white , nearly double the systemwide average ps 166 where many students are bused in from an overcrowded district at the northern tip of manhattan is only 4 percent white they have the uninformed presumption that just because it s a predominantly africanamerican school , these africanamerican children are lesser or inferior as compared to their own , said maria chale , a kindergarten teacher at ps 166 , who is black it s not true these children are very smart as a compromise , some ps 9 parents are urging mr mazza to create a new gifted program at ps 166 and leave ps 9 s in place but mr mazza said that the district , which has three other such elementaryschool programs , cannot support a fifth and he bristled at the suggestion that he was being anything but forthcoming in justifying the move of the four elementary schools in his district with programs for gifted students , none is housed in a building accessible to children in wheelchairs or on crutches therefore , the district violates the federal americans with disabilities act and the terms of the settlement of a classaction suit brought by a parent against the board , said jay hecht , a board official mr mazza said that since ps 166 would become , in september , the first in the district to receive an elevator and ramps , it was a logical destination for the gifted program , in which no handicapped student is enrolled and the board of education backs him up i certainly support him , mr hecht said i believe he is trying to do the right thing , the morally correct thing , and comply with federal obligations ps 9 , which has about 660 students , actually comprises four programs under a single roof a schooladministered accelerated program for students who score above the 97th percentile on standardized intelligence tests the lesserpaced , but still enriched , gifted program , which is run by the district a standard elementary program , and a specialeducation program in the accelerated program , which is known as anderson and has about 280 children , a second grader may do fifthgrade work in the gifted program , which has 136 students , a secondgrade class might engage in an intensive special project like creating a replica of the fulton fish market to learn more about the city but still follow the curriculum at its grade level under mr mazza s plan , which still must be approved by the district board , the anderson program would remain at ps 9 but the gifted program would be dismantled , a grade each year , to allow all students currently participating to graduate from ps 9 since students at ps 9 routinely move among the different programs , depending on how well they succeed , stephanie lebowitz , the school art teacher , lamented the prospect of losing a very vital option ms shapiro , who has taught gifted kindergartners at the school for five years , said she had decided to remain at ps 9 next year and take on a standard elementary school class rather than follow the program elsewhere i feel safe here , she said , i feel happy referring to the program s ethnic composition 34 percent white , 38 percent black , 19 percent hispanic and 9 percent asian she added , i love the diversity ms chale , the kindergarten teacher at ps 166 , said she empathized with those teachers and parents reluctant to make a change , but hoped they would keep their minds open they 're very welcome here , she said come and take a look at the classrooms sit in that s very important before they make a judgment photos several hundred parents and students held a candlelight vigilat public school 9 on wednesday to protest a proposal to move its program for gifted and talented students to ps 166 , five blocks away maria shapiro , one of five teachers in ps 9 s gifted program who signed a petition opposing the move , reading to her kindergarten class \( photographs by michelle v agins the new york times \)
paris , may 27 just three weeks ago , andre agassi , the world s no 1 player and master of all the world s grand slam tournaments except the one that starts on monday the french open brought his golf cart to a stop and eased himself into a deck chair at florida s exclusive fisher island resort even though he was still in contention at a tournament in atlanta , there was agassi , off in another state with another agenda the impromptu exit from the springtime tennis circuit was , explained agassi , partly a birthday celebration of his recent membership in what he calls the quartercentury club and partly an unorthodox training tactic for the french open i'm ready to play like a champion i dare someone to stop me , said agassi , who has captured the last two grand slam events , the 1994 united states open and the 1995 australian open the las vegan swears he s so intent on replacing his penzanceesque bandanna with the paris crown that even vacations have become a training tool so earlier this month during atlanta s att challenge , agassi granted himself a daylong furlough and skipped town on his day off why would he want to put himself through the needless stress of the extra travel \? because he would rather be by the beach than in a suburban hotel , and his private jet made for a twohour transition besides , to agassi , escapism is a virtual necessity and stress is virtual reality i do n't know what i 'd do with myself if i did n't have something to stress out about , he said agassi , who rose at noon , breakfasted at two and had n't yet seen fit to remove a pair of steel sunglasses apparently modeled on the reptilian gaze of a 50 s horrormovie monster , had ordered his umpteenth cup of coffee by teatime he then enhanced his tannability by discreetly removing his shirt to the undiscerning observer , it might have appeared that agassi was indulging himself in a little seaside laziness to the uninitiated , it might have seemed that he was avoiding the serious task of whipping his claycourt game into proper working order for paris after all , none of his fellow professionals , especially not the man who wound up defeating agassi in the atlanta final , michael chang , found it prudent to hightail it , without a coach , to miami on their day off no , nobody but agassi would consider a 29hour holiday on fisher island an integral part of his grand slam training regimen but then again , agassi s brand of logic has always defied duplication and happily smacked of contradiction logic , particularly other people s logic , scares agassi almost as much as the opaque turquoise water with which he elected to surround himself on his hiatus logic suggests agassi , who has already contested two french open finals , should have won that event before , and it practically demands that he win it this year should n't he be sweating on a practice court somewhere \? logic also suggests that fisher island , reachable only by boat , is no place for a man who is terrified of any body of water not containable by a bathtub ten years ago , agassi was taking a breather at the bollettieri tennis academy when the raft he was riding in the gulf of mexico came within petting distance of a shark he has n't gone back in the water since and wo n't until the morning i wake up with webbing between my toes but there he was , consummately relaxed , albeit a safe distance from the beach , and arguably in full control of his aquaphobia it s such a simple solution , it s actually so logical if you never go in the water , you never have to worry about being eaten by a shark , he said , casting an approving glance at the swim at your own risk sign posted at the edge of the patio i wish everything was that easy to figure out as far as a french open phobia is concerned , agassi thinks he has got that figured out as well hence his getaway i never really respected myself when it came to being a professional because i always secretly thought i was n't giving it my best shot , so i did n't , and it turned into the proverbial vicious cycle , said agassi , who watched as contemporaries like jim courier and pete sampras worked their way to no 1 and wondered why he could n't seem to copy them i always thought they must have some miracle thing going for them , but then i took a look at what made them a success and i started to think , 'hey , that part will work for me , but that part wo n't , ' he said belief is everything you 've got to trust yourself to know what makes you tick like coming here for a day this gets me away mentally from the whole tennis scene , and i think that s gonna help me a little down the road in paris to me , except for the ferry ride to get here , this place is perfect nobody can get to me , nobody knows i'm here , and i can totally relax he considered his vacation an ingredient in taking his best shot , for a change , at the french open this is all about treating myself right to put myself in the position of giving everything i have once i get to paris , said agassi i plan to be ready for the french on all cylinders i know i should have already won it twice i also know why i lost i played tentatively in both finals now i do n't secondguess i pick my road and go i 've never been this prepared to win the french open

charlotte , nc , april 12 the end may come in philadelphia on thursday or at home against the 76ers on saturday simple math kept the nets from playoff extinction tonight but common sense prevents them from returning to the postseason beneath the roar of the charlotte coliseum and above the whimper of a wounded franchise , the nets were annihilated , 10577 the hornets inflicted the worst beating the nets have experienced this season , and now all that is left for them is to find a final resting place for their season this is not the time to get depressed , this is not the time to get frustrated , said a reflective kenny anderson you 've got to understand what went on and for what reason this is not the time to point fingers this is the time to move on and learn from the past no one will remember what the score was , that neither derrick coleman \( sprained right wrist \) nor benoit benjamin \( strained back \) bothered to attend , that the nets essentially started their bench for the second straight game the enduring images were the misfires from in close to the basket , the 386 percent shooting from the field , the griping of armon gilliam to his teammates , the disbelieving look anderson gave coach butch beard as he was removed from the game lotto fever is , indeed , gripping new jersey the nets fell to 2848 , 4 games behind boston for the final eastern conference playoff spot with 6 to play that potential eighth pick in the june draft is beginning to look sweeter and sweeter with each loss it s extremely difficult from here on in , beard said we tried to stay with them , but they just put their will on the game in the first quarter i ca n't say this was a bad effort we tried we just did n't have anything before he jammed his right wrist in the first half , muggsy bogues helped administer a firstquarter knockout he led the hornets on a 304 run alonzo mourning \( 25 points \) forced the action early on , and greg sutton came off the bench to score a careerhigh 17 points the key to charlotte s success was focusing on the one player who might give it trouble gilliam led the nets with 20 points , but he was only 7 of 17 from the field as the hornets refused to let him receive the ball in his favorite spots on the floor , about 18 feet from the basket a sidelight to the game included some of the nets taking umbrage with the players who failed to make the trip in particular , coleman , who missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left wrist and benjamin , who returned home to san antonio to see his personal physician regarding his back we get paid for 82 games , jayson williams said i think it s very embarrassing when little nicks and knacks keep us down let me tell you this if we got paid game by game , there 'd be people in this locker room are you asking me if they would have been here , would it have helped \? pj brown said yeah , it probably would have but that s their business the hornets , meanwhile , \( 4729 \) continued strutting toward the postseason , winning for the fifth time in their last six games they moved within one and one half games of indiana in the central division standing and the third slot in the playoffs the nets have lost 11 of 13 , but none were more hideous than this one perhaps the most unusual sight of all was charlotte coach allan bristow , wound like a copper spring , fuming as he stormed off the court after the hornets had allowed a jumper by chris childs at the firsthalf buzzer his team had the audacity to shoot 684 percent and lead at the break by 21 points , 6544 during one torrid stretch between 9 10 and 1 52 of the first period , charlotte hit 12 of 13 shots and went on a 304 binge when the nets awoke , they were behind 3412 anderson , who scored 12 points and played 20 minutes after missing the past two games with a strained back , called the season snakebitten before tonight s game he said the troubles started as early as training camp and carried over he thinks he has a solution for next season next season , we need a camp of not just basketball , but you know , like sleepaways when you 're a kid , he said you hang out with everybody you bond it sounds corny , but that s what we need
london when it announced in december that it was in merger talks with the morgan stanley group , s g warburg group plc implicitly acknowledged that it was not big enough or strong enough to go it alone in what promises to be a painful consolidation of the global investment banking business two months later , warburg is even weaker the merger negotiations with morgan stanley collapsed key executives , uncertain about the british company s future , began defecting to rivals on monday its chief executive , lord cairns , the primary proponent of the morgan stanley deal , quit at the same time , warburg warned that the outlook for investment banking profits for the year ending on march 31 continued to dim all of which raises the question if warburg was willing to merge with a strong partner in december , should n't it be downright eager to do so now \? some investors clearly think so even after the run of bad news , warburg s shares have been trading in london at roughly the same level at which they were trading before word of the morgan stanley talks began leaking out the shares closed yesterday at 710 , up 4 pence there are persistent rumors in london that another big bank or investment house is interested in acquiring warburg the most commonly mentioned buyers are j p morgan , the dresdner bank of germany and hsbc holdings , the parent in london of the hongkong and shanghai bank none of them has commented , but all could benefit from adding warburg s strength in fund management and in the european merger and privatization business but warburg says it has had no merger discussions with anyone since december sir david scholey , who took over from lord cairns as chief executive , has said he wants warburg to remain independent and many analysts think that possible bidders are likely to shy away until sir david can bring the turmoil at warburg under control still , there are some aspects to the current valuation of warburg that could interest a bidder its total market capitalization is 155 billion , or 24 billion warburg s stake of 75 percent in a highly regarded fund management subsidiary , mercury asset management , has a market value of slightly more than 1 billion , or 155 billion the market is therefore valuing warburg without mercury at less than 853 million that , according to the company s calculations , is a discount of 365 percent to its net asset value will warburg spin off another chunk of mercury or sell it entirely \? not likely , analysts said johnny de la hay , an analyst with sgst securities in london , has reduced his profit estimates for warburg for the current financial year to 130 million from 155 million mercury , he said , will account for about 120 million of that at the time of the merger talks , morgan stanley s executives said they were primarily attracted by mercury , and did not value warburg s investment banking business very highly but morgan stanley found warburg unwilling to sell itself at a price that did not provide a premium for gaining control of mercury any other bidder would presumably be required to come up with a big premium to the market value because of mercury s profitability making a bid for the whole company that much less attractive , analysts said is there a longterm turnaround play in warburg \? the company would benefit from any improvement in the overall investment banking climate but to compete globally to increase its small presence in the american market , for instance the company would need new capital and even just to make it as a strong regional presence , warburg will have to reduce its costs substantially , which would inevitably add to the turmoil , at least in the short run if you 're spending your time looking at internal structures , you 're not going out and getting new business , mr de la hay said if you start cutting salaries , you ca n't expect income to grow
if you want to get away from the glitter , the pressure and the noise of christmas , you might visit new york city s historic mansions during the holidays they are seldom crowded the van cortlandt house , set in the romantic , wintry landscape of van cortlandt park in the bronx , has only about half a dozen visitors a weekend the merchant s house museum , a beautifully restored late federal house , is tucked away nearly out of sight , next to a vacant lot on east fourth street in greenwich village these and several other great houses are oases of calm in a city frenzied with christmas revels indeed , they are among the secret treasures of new york but they are simply decorated , and there will be no lavish parties inside for not to be a scrooge in old new york , there were few christmas day celebrations as we now know them the story of how christmas came to new york is part of the social history of the city itself , one that is reflected in a chronological tour of its historic houses from the morrisjumel mansion in washington heights to the abigail adams smith house on the upper east side to historic richmond town on staten island , these houses represent the city s various eras , including colonial new york and the victorian age to understand the evolution of christmas in new york , you must look to europe in prechristian times there have always been celebrations in northern countries during the period now called christmas week the harvest was over it was the winter solstice the typical prechristian was on layoff he would kick off his proverbial wooden shoes , have a drink , kiss his mate and engage in general licentiousness in the fourth century , church fathers wisely chose dec 25 , near the time of the solstice , as the birth date of jesus that made pagans more likely to incorporate the christian liturgy into their ceremonies still , christmas day as we know it was not widely observed there were no decorated trees there might be parties on st nicholas eve , dec 5 but the tradition of st nicholas arriving on a white horse with candy and gifts was a later invention until the 1800 s , christmas and new year s were interchangeable terms and the month of december , generally , was a time of revelry , not necessarily connected to jesus' birth during the reformation , the puritans banned christmas celebrations as pagan and popeish the puritans brought their traditions to the new world , and christmas festivities were banned in massachusetts in dutch calvinist new york , holiday parties would have been frowned upon , though this did n't stop the lower classes from getting drunk and shooting guns and behaving noisily in general but at the start of the 19th century , new york began to change there were new immigrants , new industries and unemployment christmas week revels became rowdier , with parades of callithumpians , as they were called , or drunken vagabonds , begging for money merry modern christmas in a way , the story of modern christmas begins in 1810 , with john pintard , a member of the gentry and founder of the newyork historical society pintard hated the rowdiness of christmasnew year s parties he was woken up at night by bands of callithumpians the season , he thought , had become divorced from its spiritual origins in his forthcoming book , the battle for christmas \( alfred a knopf , 1996 \) , stephen nissenbaum , a professor of history at the university of massachussetts at amherst , writes that pintard and his patrician friends invented christmas to control the noisy immigrants who disturbed the peace during the christmas week pintard first campaigned to make new year s day a holiday of family visits , an alternative to nighttime revelry upperclass men visited , and women stayed home and provided food but the disturbances continued pintard turned to st nicholas day , then to christmas day itself , trying to create formal celebrations in 1810 , pintard paid for a broadside published by the newyork historical society with a picture of st nicholas and a poem in 1819 , a fellow member of the historical society , washington irving , published the sketch book of geoffrey crayon , gent , promoting christmas as a family occasion two years later , another friend of pintard , clement clarke moore , wrote a visit from st nicholas mr nissenbaum has a social historian s explanation for moore s poem moore was a hebrew scholar and slaveholder who owned much of chelsea he watched in horror as the city filled with foreigners and the pastoral world he had known as a child was transformed in 1818 , ninth avenue bifurcated his entire estate ninth avenue became a metaphor in moore s mind for the hordes of immigrants who threatened the established order , mr nissenbaum writes moore s poem a visit from st nicholas sought to create an ideal christmas of domestic family festivities it represented a nostalgia for a christmas , notes mr nissenbaum , that never existed the household visitor moore portrays , writes mr nissenbaum , has come neither to threaten his genteel host , nor to make any demands on his generosity charles dickens s christmas carol was a further embellishment of the christmas legend such tranquilizing trees

luanda , angola looking for a used tin can \? a brand new frostfree refrigerator \? the sacks left over from a food relief effort in zimbabwe \? the skin of an endangered species \? try the markets of luanda , including roque santiero , which stretches for more than a mile along the seafront in this wartorn city just about anything can be bought or sold , including assault rifles , abortions and , in at least one case , babies twenty years of civil war have left angola s capital with intermittent telephone service , no traffic lights , main boulevards unpaved for blocks at a time and millions of refugees who have overwhelmed the sewage system , turning the waves that lap against the promenade brown and pungent there are no supermarkets or department stores there are barely any stores at all the markets have sprung up out of need , none perhaps as amazing as roque santiero , which is at the edge of what used to be the city dump it now draws more than 500 , 000 people a day , who come to buy everything from tomatoes and meat to coal and antibiotics the stands are built of odd assortments of whatever was handy a rusty car door , a stretch of military parachute or a branch some people cannot afford even a stand , and display their wares on a plank , a bit of cardboard or a folded shopping bag flat on the ground the few latrines cost 15 cents to use , an impossibly high price for most angolans there is no garbage collection in the steamy afternoon sun , the stench can be overwhelming flies are plentiful and bold as are thugs gangs prey on those who venture too deep among the stalls and are wearing anything even prescription glasses or a bandana that might be stripped away and sold elsewhere i put on very tight jeans and i'm always watching , said amacleto pessela , who does the accounts for the government s communications center and buys all his food at the market you try and stay away from the parts that really smell bad fights erupt constantly , sending everyone running even the law is lawless recently , policemen and soldiers chasing each other through the market shot two people dead yet almost everyone shops there , because they have little choice and the prices are good so most residents climb into the backs of trucks which serve as buses here and go to the market what s for sale can offer some startling insights into wartime survival leopard skins , shot by poachers and dried stiff as boards , begin at 150 but bargaining is expected one family is in the toothpaste business the children hunt in the garbage for discarded tubes the father slit them open , scraped out the leftover paste and mashed it into a new tube his wife handled sales last year , a woman was arrested for selling her children at one of the markets she had lost her husband and was faring poorly in the city , which has grown from 450 , 000 residents to three million since civil war broke out after the portuguese left in 1975 her oldest child , who was 6 , was too malnourished to be sold , she told authorities the two youngest ones , an infant and a 3yearold , fetched 300 each from a zairian , who was also arrested they might , she said , have found a better home we know of cases like this , said ana afonso gourgel , the head of angola s social service agency it happens , but we do n't think it s an organized racket still , it is a very disturbing thing although it looks like one seething , chaotic mass , to sell at roque santiero you have to follow the rules about five years ago , police officers went through the market grouping people by the goods they were selling and the merchants say newcomers must ask them for permission to join the market the market is both wholesale and retail for instance , maria delourdes bantalomeo , who sells soda at the market , goes to one area where it is sold by the case and then sells the individual cans near the road she makes about 80 cents on a case and on a good day she can sell four or five cases , she said the goods come from all over the world the cocacola can be made in france or in thailand the fabrics with africanlooking patterns are made in china there are japanese stereo systems and germanmade generators and french champagne luandans have no doubt that most of the goods are either stolen or smuggled , so they laugh about the market s name roque santiero is the title of a popular brazilian soap opera whose hero was once falsely accused of stealing it s a joke , as in it is n't stolen , officer trust me people who live near the market enjoy a financial boon despite the overwhelming stench , they make money renting their yards to sellers who do not want to carry their goods home at night mrs bantalomeo , 23 , who sits on a piece of cardboard near the police station , seven days a week from 7 30 am to 4 30 pm , and commutes an hour to her home , said her meager earnings were still more than what her husband made as a policeman in the market , she said , she had seen all kinds of violence thefts and assaults when the police and soldiers fought , she had to flee she left behind her soda bottles , worth a week s profits nothing was left when she returned sure i'm afraid , she said with a shrug why not \? photo just about anything , including rifles and abortions , can be bought at roque santiera , an openair market in luanda , angola twenty years of civil war have left the city with barely any stores \( greg marinovich matrix \)
washington , sept 27 leaders of the republicancontrolled congress today reached an agreement with the white house on a plan that will keep the government from shutting down for lack of money next week while they try to thrash out differences over the 1996 federal budget the agreement provides a reduced allowance , for six weeks , to a drove of federal agencies whose 1996 appropriations bills are either mired in congressional debate or facing imminent vetoes by president clinton without the stipend , all but essential operations in offices from the commerce department to the environmental protection agency to the white house itself would have to cease when the 1996 fiscal year begins this sunday whether the deal is more than just a stay of execution , however , is not clear the republican congress appears set on sharply reducing or abolishing spending for a host of democratic programs that the clinton administration seems equally intent on preserving and no one knows whether the two sides can settle the fate of the spending bills before the temporary financing expires on nov 13 should they fail , those bills could become sticking points in a more ominous debate two days later , on nov 15 , when the entire government is expected to reach its current legal borrowing limit some republican factions have already warned that they are willing to block any increase in the public debt , and so force the government into default , if their party s budget priorities are not law by then the spending agreement , called a continuing resolution in capitolspeak , still requires approval in votes by both houses of congress this week , but that appears a mere formality the accord covers the 13 budget bills that set spending for the government bureaucracy battles over many major benefit programs , including medicare , medicaid and welfare , involve separate legislation that is not affected the details of the agreement more or less split the difference between a congress that wants to look like a tough budgetcutter and an administration that wants to preserve its options in the budget fight to come the white house won a guarantee that none of its prized investments , like mr clinton s national service program , americorps , would suffer more than a nick before the administration has a chance to fight for them the agreement provides that any federal agency lacking a legal budget will continue spending for six weeks , but at a rate 5 percent below the average of the levels that the house and the senate have proposed in their 1996 spending bills by itself , that would mean that many federal offices marked for major cuts , like the epa , or outright abolition , like technology programs in the commerce department , would suffer immediate reductions of onethird , onehalf or even more below 1995 spending levels but that yardstick is constrained by a second provision any program that would be abolished or significantly impacted under republican budget proposals would be allowed to spend at a rate about 10 percent below its current level the decision as to which programs are considered to suffer significant impacts is left to the white house the accord would prevent those agencies from staging an end run around the spending limits by barring them from entering into longterm contracts or other major spending commitments until politicians settle the agencies' future in strictly financial terms , republicans said today , the agreement is a winner for their party congress has proposed to reduce overall spending authority for the government programs and agencies at issue by 21 billion below 1995 levels , while saving some programs and expanding others were this accord extended to cover the entire 1996 fiscal year and not just its first six weeks , one republican aide boasted , it would reduce spending by just as much , or even more but some democrats suggested that the agreement s details were considerably less important than its timing in six weeks , it is n't going to matter much anyway , the top democrat on the house appropriations committee , representative david r obey of wisconsin , said of the accord the white house issued a statement saying that there had been too much irresponsible talk about using the threat of a government shutdown or default to force a particular set of priorities on the american people and that both sides would now have time to resolve the significant differences that remain the chairman of the house appropriations committee , representative robert l livingston , republican of louisiana , put it differently the agreement provides breathing room , he said , but pinches enough to give democrats reason to come to terms we want the continuing resolution to hurt , mr livingston said congress is passing spending bills as fast as it can , and mr clinton may even sign a few , including budgets for congress and for military construction but he is poised to veto the two other bills that will reach him this week , covering spending for the military and the interior department and except for the foreignaid and district of columbia bills , which seem safe , the nine other bills face uncertain prospects , either within congress or at the white house the agreement briefly came untracked this afternoon when the white house suddenly sought more money for payments to the united nations and other international bodies , saying 237 million was needed to maintain american obligations in the end , it got 120 million that was just not in the cards , mr livingston said of the request the purpose of the continuing resolution is not to meet all the needs of the country mr livingston said 120 million would satisfy immediate commitments to the united nations , if not to other agencies , and a state department official did not disagree i think it will allow us to cover the bare minimum of payments , the official said
you know , my job , it s hard to sit in judgment about what people do , inspector charlie resnick says in john harvey s living proof \( holt , 2250 \) what happens , most of the time anyway , whatever it is someone s done , somehow you come to understand you wo n't find a more ethical or compassionate copper than resnick , which is one reason this series , set in the depressed industrial city of nottingham , represents the top of the line in the traditional british police procedural another reason is that without deviating from the classic detective formula , mr harvey writes truthful stories about people who have to fight to retain their humanity in the harsh social climate of their gritty city in this context , crime is what happens when they fail here the focus is on lonely men who are too inhibited , inarticulate or ashamed to admit their need for love four of these sad specimens are attacked by someone working the redlight district with a knife , but none of them will talk to the police , not even when a fifth victim dies of his wounds no lonely man is safe certainly not the bored husband of an american mystery writer in town for a fan convention this is poignant material , but the narcissistic author and her clod of a husband are a misstep for mr harvey , who strains to make them sympathetic but ends up giving them the uglyamerican treatment the world would be a much stuffier place without victor \( call me vic \) plotz , the charming reprobate who serves as charlie bradshaw s antic alter ego in stephen dobyns s witty privateeye novels when a shady stock market hustle puts a crimp in his style , vic hands over the keys to his mercedes and takes a security job in saratoga fleshpot \( norton , 21 \) , guarding the artwork on display at the race track for the annual yearling sales the job may be unworthy of vic s entrepreneurial image , but it gives the old scoundrel all the raw material he needs for his vulgar jokes and snide comments about the pretensions of the horsy set in saratoga springs bored with all the pomp and pageantry that rich folks require when they spend their big bucks , vic makes friends with a rumpnipping colt he calls fleshpot when the horse is stolen from his stall after fetching half a million at auction , vic lets charlie do the brainwork while he goes roaring off on a riotous adventure that involves stashing a frisky colt in a hotel bridal suite and wreaking awesome havoc on a parade that means a lot to the town s upstanding citizenry why is it , vic wants to know , that as people get richer , their sense of humor decreases \? that s a fair question coming from this great kidder , but it s nothing that mr dobyns s readers have to worry about cass jameson has n't worked a case since 1986 , when she burned out as a legal aid lawyer in where nobody dies but carolyn wheat s conscientious brooklyn sleuth has hung on to her wits and her principles , and in fresh kills \( berkley prime crime , cloth , 1995 paper , 9 \) she does a remarkably thorough and sensitive job of dealing with the emotionally charged issue of adoption i 'd known there were people in the world who sold babies , others who bought them and lawyers who did the deals , cass says when a friend from law school talks her into handling an adoption i just had n't known i 'd be one of them despite her misgivings , things go smoothly when her client hands over her newborn baby to its adoptive parents the heartache starts when the natural mother changes her mind and wants the infant back , a turnabout that initiates cass , if not her savvy young client , into the blackmarket underworld of baby buyers and sellers so where does it stop \? cass demands after the kidnappings and killings are over is there anything you draw the line at doing in the name of your child \? ms wheat is a strong , smart writer with a clear head for complicated matters and a kind eye for her characters' feelings wisely , she does n't even try to answer that loaded question like a lot of professional actors , philip fletcher is vain , prickly and full of himself unlike the rest of his tribe , this seasoned player with britain s royal shakespeare company and royal national theater company is also a murderer in simon shaw s comic mystery the villain of the earth \( thomas dunne st martin s , 1995 \) , philip has his talons out for sergei shustikov , a surly buffoon who is directing him in an atrocious moderndress production of antony and cleopatra but before antony can lift a dagger against this vile tyrant , cleopatra beats him to it reflecting on this bold deed , philip is lost in admiration for his treacherous leading lady , natasha fielding , a gifted actress whose only lapse in taste was becoming sergei s mistress philip admits that he had thought of himself as being perhaps unique it had not occurred to him that anyone else , still less a woman , could have reacted with quite such cool detachment to the fact of murder already infatuated with natasha from their early apprentice days , he falls madly in love with her and pledges to help cover up the crime mr shaw runs out of steam or heart or something at this point instead of devising more devious mischief for his lethal lovers , he maneuvers them into some unfunny business about hiding sergei s body not their style at all it takes that peculiar southern california tolerance for the weird and the wicked to concoct characters like hugo and rick , the hired executioners in robert ferrigno s new crime novel , dead man s dance \( putnam , 2395 \) rick is young and bursting with dreams of fame as hairdresser to the stars he s the one who gives you beauty tips before he shoots you hugo is the conscience of evil , a walking shadow , marooned between life and death a sad man in a sad place he s the one who weeps inside when he pulls the trigger mr ferrigno s showy prose works best on grotesque villains like hugo and rick , who have been dispatched to silence a group of old men a judge , a pickpocket , a vice cop , a gambler and a dancer with knowledge about a longago crime the flashy writing also does the trick in plot situations that are bizarre enough to be theatrical , so that even when the pace sags and the logic of the story falls apart , the sheer stagecraft of the lurid murder scenes still delivers a charge if the author had just stuck to bloody business , this might have been good junky fun but he had to go and tack on a banal fathersandsons theme and then dig up the brooding hero from his last novel , the cheshire moon , to worry it into the dirt maybe a nice , close razor cut from rick would cure him of trusting his feelings and holding up the action drawing
sights unseen by kaye gibbons 209 pp new york g p putnam s sons 1995 a happy ending can be tricky , especially in a book with as much cruelty and pain as kaye gibbons s new novel , sights unseen although her subject is a manicdepressive mother and the havoc she wreaks on her family , ms gibbons believes in the good of the world just as strongly as in the bad to have tacked the medical miracle of maggie barnes s recovery onto the end of the story would never have convinced us so ms gibbons spells it all out in the first few pages the illness , the recovery through electroconvulsive therapy , and maggie s untimely death in a fall 15 years later not that the opening is any boring old flashback from a hospital bed or funeral instead , everything is steeped together in a rich stew of years what s more , ms gibbons continues in this fashion for much of the novel , jettisoning a traditional chronology consider , for instance , an incident in which maggie runs a woman down with her car \( supposedly for trying to steal her soul \) right after this , ms gibbons skips back a halfdozen years to introduce maggie s more subdued but equally troubling relationship with her housekeeper , pearl wiggins somehow and here may be the miracle such juggling is accomplished without ever being confusing or arty or contrived the story is told by maggie s daughter , hattie , who was conceived in an unsuccessful attempt to save her mother s sanity that is , having a baby was hattie s father s idea during maggie s manic phases , lovemaking itself could be nonstop in fact , maggie nearly kills him with her sexual demands hattie is sometimes bewildered when she gets off the school bus in the afternoon and finds her father adrift in the house in khaki pants and a rumpled undershirt , looking like a hallwalker in a veterans' hospital , spent and forlorn sometimes things get so bad that he has to go to a relative s house to get some sleep because hattie details her reactions as both child and adult , this situation evokes almost simultaneously distaste , pity , amazement and even amusement maggie calls the only roman catholic she knows of , asking what to serve when she s planning a dinner for robert kennedy , one of the many men she imagines she has been put on the planet to be worshiped by hattie s sights are always set at a delicate intersection of the ordinary and the horrific early on , she describes how maggie screams herself hoarse on her son s birthday when he scrapes his spoon on his bowl of ice cream , a sound she claims she can hear all the way upstairs , preventing her from sleeping after the child makes a nasty remark in return , maggie s fatherinlaw , mr barnes , bullies him into apologizing a small incident , perhaps , but that s what makes it the perfect illustration of how maggie s illness seeps into the very fiber of the household the events in ms gibbons s books have got quieter since the child narrator in ellen foster was hounded from household to household by dead bodies and drunks but i do n't think any of the villains in her other novels compare to rich old mr barnes , who coldly denigrates his sons and grandson when he is n't squiring maggie around town and paying for her manic shopping sprees none of the evildoers in ellen foster had anything but a temporary sway over the narrator s physical situation here maggie s husband actively encourages her continuing relationship with his father today s therapeutic culture has created a dichotomy of victims and victimizers in which good people have to prove how much they 've suffered \( though never in silence , unfortunately \) and bad people , no matter how pernicious their behavior , are probably victims themselves and so to be pitied i prefer ms gibbons s take , in which there is never any excuse for what the bad people do , however complicated they may be also , the good people in sights unseen are not really victims at all , at least not in the usual sense when her mother dies , hattie s first regret is for her own lost childhood her brother , whose encouragement is probably most responsible for hattie s later professional success , refuses for years to have anything to do with their mother and leaves the room as soon as she enters even their father , whose role is closest to the usual victim s , is clearly weakwilled as well as forbearing ms gibbons delineates all this with an economy that makes a standard psychological novel look as full of irrelevancies as a phone book i was glad that ms gibbons s last novel , charms for the easy life , found the large audience her work deserves , but i like this book even better it is more intense , more vibrant , both richer and stranger besides , it will give you a new answer the next time someone trots out that printisdead stuff at a cocktail party no movie could fool with chronology the way this novel does
various types of parmalat s longlasting milk , which is superheated and packaged in aseptic cartons , were tasted for business day by florence fabricant , who contributes food articles to the living section when parmalat s longlife milk made its debut in the united states about two years ago , it had a flavor that suggested cooked or boiled milk that taste was evident even when the milk was well chilled or chocolateflavored that has changed in a tasting of parmalat s 1 percent , 2 percent and whole milks , all chilled , none had that unpleasant cooked flavor after tasting the parmalat milks i then tasted them again in comparison with regular 1 percent , 2 percent and whole milks there was a pleasant sweetness to the traditional milks that the parmalat lacked another subtle difference between the regular whole milk and the parmalat was that the latter was a trifle less rich and creamytasting but these are very minor quibbles that can show up in a sidebyside comparison the adult daily milk drinker in the family who would not touch parmalat in the past still preferred the regular milks , but said the parmalat was certainly acceptable for the convenience of having milk on hand that keeps for months and can be put in a child s lunch box , the consumer no longer has to compromise on taste florence fabricant

near the west 85th street entrance to central park , a spring trickles through rolling hills thick with white oak trees the occasional woodpecker hammers overhead it would seem that this spot was always this way but before the park was built , 250 people lived there residents of seneca village , mostly workingclass blacks , traveled to their jobs in laundries or inns in bustling lower manhattan like other communities in the northern reaches of manhattan , they impatiently waited for proper streets of cobblestone there were multistory frame houses , gardens , three churches and at least one school then , in 1857 , the community was demolished , and none too peaceably , to make way for central park it is a littleknown story , one only chipped at by historians until recently prevalent thinking in history books has been that the park was built on swamps inhabited by scattered squatters living in shanties but new research , partly inspired by an interest in rediscovering new york s black history , has uncovered details of a thriving community of black property owners at a time when few blacks owned land roy rosenzweig , the coauthor of a history of central park , offered one explanation of how new york forgot seneca village as well as the pockets of other people living in what would become the park the story of rich people is more likely to be told historically than the story of poor black people , said mr rosenzweig , a history professor at george mason university in virginia who wrote the park and the people \( henry holt , 1994 \) with elizabeth blackmar , a history professor at columbia university but in a new fivemonth pilot program sponsored by the newyork historical society , students are piecing together the lost story of seneca some 100 seventh graders at intermediate school 49 in the williamsburg section of brooklyn are reviewing original documents and newspapers in morninglong sessions at the offices of the historical society , on central park west the society , with a 75 , 000 corporate grant , hopes to offer a similiar program on the colonialera african burial ground north of city hall this gives these children a new way of thinking about themselves , said betsy gotbaum , president of the newyork historical society they 're realizing they were part of the foundation of new york seneca village , whose boundaries extended approximately from what is now 79th to 86th streets and from what is now seventh avenue to today s central park west , was one of the largest settlements in the park area it offered something that blacks were denied elsewhere in the city few could own property because of racial discrimination in land sales , limited financial resources and the high price of downtown real estate in 1850 , there were 71 black property owners in new york city , about 20 percent in seneca village , according to land records seneca residents displayed an unusual permanency at a time much of america was in motion virtually every black seneca family counted in the 1850 census was still there five years later in contrast , 40 percent of the population of boston moved in the same five years and of the 100 black new yorkers eligible to vote in 1845 , 10 lived in seneca village peter salwen , the author of the 1989 history upper west side story , first suspected that the village might have been a respectable hamlet instead of a shantytown when he found a map in the new york public library on 42d street in the late 1970 s that had been used in condemnation proceedings he was struck by the height of the buildings , their density and the sturdy construction materials mostly wood , with at least one building of brick and one as high as three stories it just did not fit in at all , mr salwen said how degenerate was it , really \? mr rosenzweig said the drive to build the park , supported by the movers and shakers of what had become the nation s biggest city , pushed all other considerations aside one motivation of what were essentially real estate developers , he said , was to get rid of people who were less appealing to be sure , the future park was the site of some smelly industries like bone boiling to make glue there were institutional homes for the poor , criminal and disabled , and many people did live in tiny , squalid quarters , though perhaps no worse than families crowded into tenements downtown the historian edward hagaman hall , in 1911 called the area a sort of no man s land , occupied by squatters living in the most abject manner but the new york sun , one of the few newspapers sympathetic to the socalled squatters , reported in 1857 that most people asked permission of property owners before building shanties not a few of them have been paying a small ground rent , and raising fruits and vegetables on patches of land that otherwise would have been unproductive , the article said there were actually a variety of ethnic settlements in what became the park the irish lived in the southwest corner , and in the village s last years rented almost a quarter of the homes in seneca germans cultivated small gardens scattered over much of the present park jupiter zeuss k hesser , a germanborn music teacher , had seven lots , called jupiterville , near what would be seventh avenue and 100th street blacks first came to the area in 1825 , when john whitehead , a deliveryman , began selling off parcels of his farm the first purchase was by andrew williams , a 25yearold africanamerican shoeshiner , who bought three lots for 125 epiphany davis , a laborer and trustee of the african methodist episcopal zion church , bought 12 lots for 578 the same day the church itself then bought 6 lots between 1825 and 1832 , real estate records show , the whiteheads sold at least 24 land parcels to black families the name seneca village remains a mystery it must have been an ethnic slur , a way to simultaneously denigrate indians and blacks , said sara cedar miller , the central park conservancy s historian seneca indians had nothing to do with this place no photographs of the village have been found , and much of what is known represents reasoned judgments based on fragmentary facts the historical society s approach is to supply students with the same shreds of evidence a historian faces and to have them weave the information together and interpret it for instance , the new york herald of 1871 tells of finding decomposed bodies in the course of uprooting trees to build the west 85th street entrance to the park where did they come from \? in 1856 , the newyork daily times reported the impending eviction of all the residents of a neat little village the article ended , it is hoped their removal can be effected with as much gentleness as possible was this the case \? a decade later , another times article suggested that the residents' removal was anything but gentle , even though property owners had been compensated the supremacy of law was upheld by the policemen s bludgeons , and with many broken heads and ensanguined eyes then commenced the laborers of the park engineers and surveyors the seventh graders are being encouraged to weigh these clues with historical hindsight about the park s value to the community at large the response is invariably emotional i would n't like to be kicked out of my home , said christina rosado , 12 brian norton , 14 , seemed to sum up the prevailing thinking it was n't worth it , he said they should have built the park someplace else drawing \( pg b2 \) map of central park north showing location of seneca village
toronto , april 25 todd hundley admits that he feels a little more anticipation than he has before recent opening days john franco is excited that his fellow bullpen mates are , in his eyes , better than any crew he s had in his seven seasons with the mets and though he rarely shows any emotion , bobby jones is visibly thrilled over his first opening day start i'm 24 hours away , jones said today , after watching the mets defeat the blue jays , 31 , in their final exhibition game i'm not jumping up in the air or anything like that i am a lowkey guy but i'm excited i'm anxious for it to get here with a 103 spring training record and marked improvement in many areas , especially pitching and defense , the mets are all anxious for the start of the 1995 season , which will officially open for them when jones faces colorado s bill swift wednesday night at coors field in denver manager dallas green has refused to set goals \( he asked for a 500 season at the start of 1994 \) , but his players did not hesitate to talk about being contenders for a wildcard berth in the national league playoffs for us to win , everybody has to do their job , said brett butler , the newly acquired center fielder it s not just bret winning 20 , john saving 50 , or me hitting 400 everybody has to do what they 're capable of doing , nothing more if we do that , we 're going to contend certainly , saberhagen , franco and butler bobby bonilla calls him the key addition to the team will have a huge impact on the mets' chances , but the most important changes appear to be the stronger bullpen , the younger legs and the better lategame defense in 1994 , franco looked around the met bullpen and often felt like a lone soldier in the middle of disaster bonilla got up to bat , fourth in the order , and frequently found no one on base and green would look down his bench and dislike his pinchhitting options , because he did not want to send many of those players onto the field this season , all three believe that those problems could disappear i think this is the best bullpen we 've had since i came here , said franco , who led the national league with 30 saves in 1994 despite the mets' 5558 record in a strikeshortened season last year , it was just me now you have me and jerry and some young kids i think it s a lot better than it has been the last couple of years pitching improvements , in general , have most impressed hundley , who will start at catcher wednesday night today , for example , four met pitchers combined to throw eight hitless innings before josias manzanillo , who has struggled all spring , gave up a bloop hit to alex gonzalez with one man aboard and none out in the ninth dave mlicki , tabbed to be the no 5 starter , pitched the first four innings and walked one with four strikeouts , and both mike remlinger and kevin lomon added a pair of nohit innings as the mets , over one stretch retired 16 straight toronto batters we have a lot of young , live arms and it makes a difference , hundley said certainly , the spring training results bode well for the club , even though no one , particularly green , will put any stock in the numbers the mets finished the shortened spring with 10 victories in their final 11 games , and got impressive performances from several of the new faces they hope will make an impact carl everett , the rookie outfielder , had his third homer of the spring this afternoon at the skydome , and finished the preseason with a 361 average ricky otero and edgardo alfonzo , both class aa players in 1994 , were impressive enough in three weeks to make the team and the bullpen pitchers jerry dipoto , doug henry and lomon convinced green and others that the team has has improved its weakest area in 1994 i'm not going to put a goal on this , green said i think it s fair to say we all anticipate improvement , and what i call good improvement i think we 're going to be competitive all year and i would be disappointed if we were n't in the mix late in the year inside pitch the mets , who have never had a nohitter , nearly had an exhibition one against toronto but carl everett misjudged a short fly to right that put alex gonzalez on base and the blue jays on the board with a hit in the ninth then josias manzanillo gave up a second hit and later hit a batter with the bases loaded to force in the only toronto run joe orsulak is scheduled to join the team in denver wednesday in time for the game the outfielder has been home in cockeysville , md , with his 3yearold son , michael , who underwent surgery photo the mets' ricky otero was safe stealing second base yesterday toronto s alex gonzalez tried to pick up the ball \( associated press \)
sometime this summer , the yields on mutual funds will probably take a sudden dip the culprit wo n't be market forces , but the securities and exchange commission the commission is expected to approve a proposal soon that will force funds to disclose the value of certain services received in kind and then to calculate the cost in their fund expenses as astute investors know , expenses come right off the top of a fund , so any increase there will result in a lower yield the investment company institute of washington , the fund industry group , supports the proposal , lending credence to the belief it will be passed in short order yields will be affected immediately , and funds will have to update expense ratios in their next regular report the impact is expected to be small , however , just a few hundredths of a percentage point for most funds but a strong voice of opposition comes from a surprising source the vanguard group john c bogle , vanguard s chairman , is usually a champion of telling the investor all i think disclosure , like sunlight , is the greatest disinfectant , he said in a recent interview for that reason , he said , vanguard has been listing the disputed costs in its footnotes since last spring but adding these embedded costs , no matter how small , to fund expense ratios is another matter altogether , mr bogle maintains doing so will be a nuisance , he said , and will leave investors befuddled in its proposal , the sec says a fund must disclose the value of certain products and services received from a brokerage firm in exchange for directing its trades to the firm the proposal mainly applies to administrative services , like transfer agency and custody , for the fund say fund a pays its transfer agent 15 annually for each account , to cover such things as setting up the account and sending out shareholder reports the fund has to list the 15 as an expense this year , reducing its yield by a similar amount but the fund could direct abc brokerage , which it pays 6 cents a share to execute trades , to pay the 15 to the transfer agent the 15 then becomes a brokerage cost and is added to the price of the shares purchased through abc it reduces the gain or adds to the loss when the fund sells those shares what s really going on is a cash rebate , said robert e plaze , an assistant director at the sec the fund regulator considers the practice , known as directed brokerage , akin to a shell game with expenses we 're trying to give greater transparency to the real costs of a portfolio , mr plaze said ian mackinnon , head of the fixedincome group at vanguard , called the rule a trivial issue still , vanguard has perhaps the most reason to be concerned it runs its funds on what appears to be a razorthin margin , and mr bogle goads other fund companies to try and match his expenses the vanguard municipal bond fund longterm portfolio received 78 , 000 in services supplied by brokerage firms in the six months ended feb 28 over a year , that would amount to an increase of 2 hundredths of a point in its expense ratio but because the fund keeps expenses to a slim 020 percent of assets a year , the increase would be nearly 10 percent for the fidelity contrafund , accounting for similar services would have raised expenses from the 1 percent listed in its 1994 annual report to 103 percent a much smaller percentage gain a few fund companies shun the practice we think traders should trade and people who incur expenses should pay them , and you should n't confuse the two , said paul haaga , senior vice president of capital research and management company , los angeles , which runs the american funds we do n't think you 're accomplishing anything except making your expense ratio look lower running costs together also creates a potential conflict , said geoff bobroff , a fund consultant in rhode island the more services paid that way , the more incentive a manager has to buy and sell frequently the tempest may be just a taste of what s to come also up for discussion at the sec is the industry s practice of directing brokerage firms to pay for nonadministrative services , like research , software , telephone systems , and even business travel none of which is covered by the current proposal photo john bogle of vanguard balks at altering his funds' expense ratios \( chris gardner for the new york times \)
sunburn by laurence shames 279 pages hyperion 2195 the standoff by chuck hogan 306 pages doubleday 2350 i got regrets like heinz got beans , says vincente delgatto , an aging mafia godfather , at the opening of laurence shames s engaging new florida novel , sunburn the godfather with regrets is sitting poolside in key west , at the home of his bastard son , joey goldman joey , as fans of mr shames s fiction may recall , moved from new york city to key west in the author s amusing first novel , florida straits , in which he unsuccessfully tried to break free of his menacing family joey is a regular floridian now he cooked outside , he ate outside , he lived in sunglasses , he 'd almost learned to swim but he still has n't broken free of his devoted father and his resentful halfbrother , gino delgatto , who keeps trying to grab a piece of the mob s action despite his inability to do even the wrong thing right and now his aging father s regrets prompt joey to make an outlandish suggestion write it down the godfather should hire a ghostwriter and dictate his memoirs at first vincente is appalled certain things you did n't talk about , not even kiddingly , not even among family but gradually he warms to the idea and takes joey up on his suggestion to sit down with artie magnus , a reporter for the key west sentinel aut'ority , vincente tells his ghostwriter at one of their first collaborative sessions that s what this whole thing is about aut'ority the notion of a godfather writing his memoirs is diverting but it does n't amuse certain new york city colleagues of vincente s , and thereby shortly hangs a tale involving another clumsy attempt by stupid gino to prove himself to his tooindulgent father yet even more than in his previous fiction , mr shames is preoccupied here with the details of his story the tics of his characters , the nuances of his settings , even the way inanimate objects behave the results are often arresting for instance , whenever the godfather feels uncomfortable , he reaches up to straighten his tie this was an old habit , a gesture that helped his composure and helped the transition from one thought to the next his hands were almost to his throat before he remembered he was n't wearing a tie often , the florida scenery comes to life in the rearview mirror , the pulsing orange sun seemed to be picking its way among mangrove islands , looking for a clear path to the sea even furniture plays a role a lamp still lay on the floor and seemed to be groping after its shade , like a man who had lost his hat at times the accumulation of such touches weighs heavily on the action , and mr shames s story , like a bicycle moving too slowly , nearly tips over and crashes but like don giovanni , the constipated chihuahua beloved of vincente s old colleague , bert \( the shirt \) d'ambrosia , the plot somehow stays alive and keeps moving , at least actively enough to carry the reader contentedly through to the end sloweddown action is never a problem in chuck hogan s first thriller , the standoff , which concerns a weeklong showdown between a white supremacist who has barricaded himself and his family in a cabin on a montana mountaintop and an fbi agent who wants to prevent the man from murdering his five children the story races along from the opening page , which finds special agent john t banish being treated for trauma at a mental health facility on a sprawling estate in chapel hill , nc apparently banish failed in a previous hostage showdown at the world trade center in new york city , and this failure has left him as taut as piano wire , even after six months of rehabilitation strung out any more , he is likely to snap unfortunately , there is not much to engage the reader s interest beside banish s vulnerability we do n't know a thing about the fugitive , glenn allen ables , except that he is heavily armed and fanatical his wholly unappealing reason for barricading himself is left to a sympathetic neighbor to expound the great race war is coming here glenn knowed it he said all along , he said the first shots 'd be fired at his cabin and now just look around you you know the united nations tower of babylon in jew york city is making all the laws it s coming see , glenn s for preserving the white race he s for the grand old america given ables s views , one has difficulty even working up much compassion for his children , who remain completely faceless throughout most of the novel almost as if to compensate for the lack of moral balance in the showdown , mr hogan tries to make interesting characters out of the besiegers , among them fagin , a hottempered black deputy marshal , and leonard m blood , a blackfoot indian sheriff but these two do n't really represent much beyond their ethnic backgrounds and the prose with which blood , for one , is introduced is distinctly unpromising he wore a resistol cowboy hat crease greased , brim firm though he supported none of the other stereotypes of a backcountry sheriff , such as chewing tobacco or spitting or being grossly overweight he was trim and strong enough , with broad 40yearold shoulders down to which thick , crowblack hair hung straight and neat given so many handicaps , mr hogan does remarkably well to keep his story even minimally energetic the standoff does chug up to the top of the mountain but it remains by and large a mechanical accomplishment photos laurence shames \( marilyn staruch hyperion \) chuck hogan \( marion ettlinger doubleday \)
washington , oct 10 the rescued came to thank the rescuer today , as president ernesto zedillo of mexico met president clinton for the first time since the administration sidestepped congress to bail out the mexican economy the two leaders declared that jobs and prosperity had been saved on both sides of the border mr zedillo s visit was an effort to turn a political liability the perception among many americans that closer economic ties with mexico have brought more misery than profit into a celebration of the country s return to some semblance of financial stability mr clinton praised mr zedillo s courage and determination in keeping mexican markets open to american goods despite huge political pressure at home to exclude foreign products at a time when a million mexican workers have lost their jobs in a deep recession for his part mr zedillo , who was feted at a state dinner tonight , praised his host s vision and courage for lending funds to mexico over congressional and public objections , saying that mr clinton had prevented a systemic economic crisis of world scope beyond the mutual praise , a few concrete agreements were announced today the two countries ended a longrunning dispute over the labeling and inspection of tires made in mexico by american manufacturers , and the united states announced 70 million in financing from the exportimport bank to allow mexico to purchase radar equipment for antinarcotics operations but two other major trade disputes remain unresolved , despite last minute efforts before mr zedillo s arrival mexico s refusal to speed up a reduction in tariffs on wine imports , and a continuing dispute with the united parcel service over its desire to use large trucks on mexican roads but today was hardly a day when either side wanted to dwell on problems mr clinton made the case that the 125 billion loaned to mexico another 75 billion was promised but will probably not be necessary profited both nations the united states treasury has already received roughly 470 million in interest , in addition to an early repayment of principal on the loan , which mr zedillo engineered last week by floating a bond issue on the private markets , a step that would have been impossible when the country seemed a far larger risk in the spring responding to conservative critics like patrick j buchanan and liberal opponents of the bailout like ralph nader , administration officials have argued in recent days that their emergency loan program also succeeded in stemming far worse economic disruption and a surge of illegal immigration across the border a strong , democratic mexico will be an even more effective partner in the struggle against drugs and crime and pollution , mr clinton said at a news conference at the white house but as mr clinton s advisers have conceded privately in recent weeks , even the most favorable statistics , including the administration s somewhat optimistic estimate that 340 , 000 jobs have been created as a result of the north american free trade agreement , cannot shake the perception that the free trade accord and the bailout have yielded few benefits for american workers and that , in turn , has fed into the broader political problem of an american work force seized by insecurity this is a tricky political problem for the president , one of his close economic advisers said recently we were doing fine until the peso crisis you could make a credible case that the nafta was benefiting us but now you get an earful wherever you go even if mexico resumes strong economic growth , however , it is unlikely that the mexican market will become an engine of growth for american exports before the presidential election that has far more to do with the depth of mexico s recession than with the trade accord itself but in the public mind , the trade accord and the bailout are fused into one , and that has dampened any political enthusiasm for mr clinton s biggest free trade initiative nafta has become a mirror for our political dilemma over trade , said jeffrey e garten , the undersecretary of commerce for international trade while many gain , others lose , and the losers are much more visible such realities have frustrated many of mr clinton s closest aides there is a fiction around that us personal income has gone down since nafta was enacted in fact , it has gone up , said mickey kantor , the united states trade representative our share of imports in the mexican market has gone up our total exports to mexico are above what they were in 1993 , despite the recession there and it would have been an even greater success had it not been for the peso crisis nevertheless , mr buchanan , the most overtly antifreetrader of the republicans seeking the presidential nomination , wins huge applause whenever he makes the point that the united states' 2 billion trade surplus with mexico has turned into a 15 billion trade deficit this year mr zedillo dwelled on none of that today instead , he offered assurances that his administration would continue to fight drug trafficking and would attempt an experimental program of repatriating illegal immigrants caught in the united states , sending those who volunteer back to their hometowns rather than letting them sit on the southern side of the border , where they are likely to attempt another illegal crossing but most of all , mr zedillo promised to continue his austerity program , the chief requirement american officials placed on his country in return for the loans i am fully confident that we are going to achieve our growth goal , mr zedillo said to mr clinton today , because throughout history the mexican people have risen to the challenges and proven that we are capable of great achievements photo president ernesto zedillo and president clinton yesterday at awhite house welcoming ceremony for the mexican leader \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
it was billed as a rally to stand up for new york city s schoolchildren and to protest school budget cuts the teachers' union showing a toughened stance against mayor rudolph w giuliani bused thousands of teachers to city hall some school board members walked across the brooklyn bridge with many of the school system s top leaders , a few hundred parents , students and more teachers everyone except schools chancellor ramon c cortines the chancellor stayed away after issuing statement that said , i was led to understand that my presence would be interpreted as meaning the rally was against someone or something city hall , or the city council , or state leaders or whomever or whatever although mr cortines did not say so in his statement , his decision to stay away followed a conversation with deputy mayor ninfa segarra in which she told the chancellor that the mayor would consider his participation an affront mayor giuliani said at a news conference that he had not asked her to convey that message we have worked long and hard to forge better working relationships with all our partners in government and i want to preserve that relationship , the chancellor s statement said about 10 , 000 people attended the rally mr cortines s decision to stay away , and his curious explanation of it , illustrated how uneasy his relationship with the mayor , which has followed a tumultuous twoyear course , continues to be during a confrontation with mr giuliani over budget cuts 13 months ago , mr cortines resigned briefly and then rescinded the decision several of the educational leaders who attended the rally said they were puzzled by the chancellor s decision carol a gresser , the board of education president who hired mr cortines and is his closest political ally , said she first heard of his decision not to take part when she read the chancellor s statement yesterday she expressed some irritation with mr cortines s posture i would have preferred that he join us because i think that we have an important message to deliver , mrs gresser said in an interview at the rally i want the mayor to hear our message , and i'm not tiptoeing around about it sandra feldman , the president of the united federation of teachers , said she was really disappointed about the chancellor s decision this is not a rally against anybody , ms feldman said this is not an antigiuliani rally this is a rally to show that there is a large constituency for public education in this city i think it s appropriate for the leadership of the school system , the chancellor , the board president , to come out and say to the mayor and the city council , 'we want you to make education a priority in your budget' donald singer , the principals' union president , said of mr cortines i'm disappointed that he s not here since he s the leader of the school system , but we 're not leaderless we have most of the rest of the city s educators here the teachers' union hired 185 buses to transport teachers and parents from the outer boroughs to city hall for the rally , said susan amlung , a union spokesman both the teachers' union , which represents 90 , 000 teachers , guidance counselors and other school employees , and the principals' union , which represents more than 3 , 000 assistant principals , principals and other supervisors , bought radio time to criticize city hall s proposed school budget cuts and to urge the rank and file to attend the rally mr giuliani , and to a lesser extent gov george e pataki , were the targets of the rally , although almost none of the speakers mentioned either man by name stanley hill , executive director of district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , whose locals represent cafeteria workers , school aides and other school employees , was one of the few we 're saying to mayor giuliani and to governor pataki that when you take away money from the school system , you kill people , you hurt people , mr hill said if most of the rally s speakers seemed reticent to target mr giuliani by name , few of those who marched , chanting slogans and waving placards , showed the same hesitation gov pataki and mayor giuliani hate the children of new york ! screamed a placard carried by ann walter , an unemployed mother of a secondgrade student who attends public school 230 in the kensington section of brooklyn two teachers from george washington high school in manhattan carried a banner , stretched between two poles , which portrayed a menacing mr giuliani wearing an i love ny tshirt , but swinging an ax the mayor is a target of a lot of unrest in this city , said luis espinoza , a social studies teacher at george washington high school in manhattan who helped paint the banner people trusted him because he says that he loves the city , but he has cut it apart seeking to close the city s budget gap , city hall has proposed that the board of education s operating budget , which was 84 billion during the current fiscal year , be reduced to 81 billion for the fiscal year that begins july 1 because enrollments are rising and there are other increases in operating costs , board officials say city hall is cutting the budget by 1 billion city hall says that it is seeking to cut the budget by only 220 million mr giuliani , appearing after the rally on a wcbs radio talk show , took a call from a teacher at john f kennedy high school in the bronx who complained that the city s schools are insufficiently funded mr giuliani reacted with an angry lecture about waste in the schools those are the things the teachers should have been out there demonstrating about today , he said we have got to be more accountable in spending the first 8 billion there is no more money in new york city to put in the school system or anywhere else
washington , april 4 the republican tax bill the house of representatives plans to take up on wednesday would reduce the federal income taxes of people and companies by 189 billion over the next five years and , according to treasury department estimates , 630 billion over the next decade the bill would give most families with children a 500 tax cut for each child it would also lower the capital gains tax and provide a variety of other tax breaks for individuals and businesses the republican sponsors of the legislation maintain that the bill would reduce spending by more than enough to offset the revenue loss in the first five years they have also promised that none of the tax measures will go into effect until congress has approved a budget plan setting forth a clear path to a balanced budget by the year 2002 but the tax reductions are described with great specificity while the spending cuts are little more than promises the biggest single saving , for example , would be 100 billion over five years from lowering the overall annual ceilings on discretionary spending this is all government spending for everything from pencils to submarines except the spending for programs like social security and medicare for which money is paid to everyone who meets the eligibility requirements the bill does not specify which programs will be cut in addition , the republicans are assuming a 65 billion saving over five years from cuts approved by the house last month in welfare and other programs for the poor republicans and democrats offer different statistics accurate but from different perspectives to illustrate who the main beneficiaries of the tax reductions would be for example , republicans have produced a study showing that taxpayers with annual incomes between 30 , 000 and 75 , 000 would receive a tax cut of 43 or 44 percent , while the taxes of those with incomes above 200 , 000 would be reduced by only 29 percent democrats have figures showing that under the republican bill , the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would get 20 percent of the tax reduction and that the wealthiest 10 percent would get 47 percent what follows are the main items in the bill , most of which would take effect next year individuals family tax credit most families with annual incomes below 200 , 000 would get a 500 tax credit , or tax reduction , for each child under 18 families with incomes between 200 , 000 and 250 , 000 would get a gradually reduced credit the credit would be available only to the extent that families owe income taxes that means families with incomes below about 25 , 000 would get at most a partial credit cost 105 billion marriage penalty married workers would be entitled to a credit of up to 145 on their joint tax return to help offset the additional taxes that are often owed when single workers marry cost 8 billion retirement accounts a new form of individual retirement account would allow workers , regardless of income , to deposit up to 2 , 000 after taxes that could be withdrawn at retirement without additional taxes on the accrued interest and dividends in addition to penaltyfree withdrawals when the taxpayer reaches 59 , money could also be taken out without penalty after five years to pay for college tuition , firsttime home purchases , medical bills and longterm care insurance the treasury would get 2 billion more in the first five years as taxpayers converted their existing ira s to the new kind and paid taxes on the money , but revenue losses in later years would be substantial spousal ira s nonworking spouses could contribute up to 2 , 000 to the existing form of retirement account in which taxes are not owed on the contribution but must be paid on money that is withdrawn cost 500 million capital gains taxes would be assessed on only 50 percent of all capital gains , which are the profits from investments the result would be to lower the maximum rate to 198 percent from 28 percent the value of assets would be adjusted annually for inflation so that no tax would be owed on the amount of profits that resulted solely from inflation taxpayers who sell their homes at a loss could deduct the loss cost 32 billion , including the corporate capital gains rate cut described below social security increased income taxes enacted in 1993 on the social security benefits of many middle and upperincome retirees would be repealed the amount retirees age 65 through 69 could earn without having their benefits reduced would be raised gradually over five years to 30 , 000 from the current 11 , 280 cost 23 billion adoption families with incomes below 60 , 000 who adopt a child would be entitled to a 5 , 000 tax credit that year , and families with incomes up to 100 , 000 could get a partial credit cost 1 billion elderly care families who take care of a disabled elderly relative in their homes could get a 500 tax credit each year in addition , tax breaks would be provided for the purchase of longterm care insurance , and terminally ill taxpayers could claim their life insurance without owing taxes cost 8 billion estate and gift taxes the amount that could be excluded from estate and gift taxes would be increased to 750 , 000 from 600 , 000 cost 68 billion businesses minimum tax the alternative minimum tax for corporations would be repealed over five years \( its purpose is to make sure that companies with large writeoffs still owe some taxes \) cost 17 billion capital gains the top corporate capital gains rate would be reduced to 25 percent from 35 percent the value of corporate assets would be adjusted for inflation depreciation the bill would allow companies that buy machinery and equipment to take smaller deductions in the first few years after the purchase but to claim much larger deductions in later years this would increase revenue by 17 billion in the first five years but cost much more afterward small businesses businesses could write off the entire cost of machinery and equipment costing 35 , 000 or less in the year of purchase that is double the current limit of 17 , 500 cost 8 billion home offices a deduction for the cost of offices at home would be allowed if the taxpayer used the office for administrative work and had no other fixed place of business cost 1 billion spending cuts discretionary spending this is now frozen at slightly less than 550 billion a year the bill would lower that by an average of 20 billion a year , but it does not indicate which programs should have less money saving 100 billion medicare several costsaving measures enacted in 1993 on a temporary basis would be made permanent saving 11 billion enriched uranium the bill would allow the clinton administration to sell the united states enrichment corporation the corporation produces enriched uranium for nuclear power plants revenue gain 2 billion broadcast licenses the federal communications commission would be authorized to continue for two more years , 1999 and 2000 , its practice of auctioning the rights to portions of the radio spectrum revenue gain 2 billion government workers federal employees would have to make larger contributions

washington a small plastic cylinder filled with cells taken from a pig may one day become an artificial pancreas for some diabetics scientists and medical researchers have created plastic hearts , artificial livers , pancreases and lungs yet none match the efficiency , reliability and lifespan of the organs people are born with even if they come close , the body s immune system often rebels against implants now a research team at the university of toledo in ohio has patented a manmade pancreas they say eliminates the risk of rejection the device is an inchlong plastic cylinder filled with insulinproducing cells called islets taken from a pig a recipient s immune system cells never come into contact with the pig cells because they cannot pass through the plastic the cylinder is made of a polymer that is mostly carbon , hydrocarbon and oxygen so the immune system does not treat the device itself as foreign , its inventors say the bioartificial pancreas is a way to protect transplanted islets from the patient s immune system , said ronald fournier , a professor of chemical engineering at the university he invented the device with two doctors from the medical college of ohio , peter goldblatt and james horner , and a graduate student , jeffrey sarver it s kind of like a chainlink fence , mr fournier said it s designed in a way that large molecules like a patient s antibodies and immune cells ca n't get in , but little molecules like insulin , glucose , oxygen and other nutrients that cells normally take out of blood can readily diffuse in diabetes is caused when cells in the pancreas fail to secrete the insulin that regulates glucose levels in the blood people can inject themselves with insulin , but the resulting irregular glucose levels sometimes cause blindness , kidney disease or circulatory problems a onetime transplant of healthy insulinproducing cells might solve the problem nicely human cells are hard to come by , but millions of pig pancreases are available from the meat industry and pig cells happen to be so compatible with human needs that pig insulin is already used to treat diabetes the plastic cylinder , empty but covered in a fibrous substance , is implanted just under the abdominal muscle wall the real pancreas continues its other task of secreting digestive enzymes because the pig cells will need nutrients from the blood , doctors must then wait several weeks for blood vessels to grow into the fibrous substance that surrounds the artificial organ when it s laid inside the body next to tissue , mr fournier said , there is a natural woundhealing process that occurs the body tissue fills all the pores and vascularizes it once the process is complete , the pig islet cells are injected into the plastic core human islets last a lifetime , mr fournier said pigs live 10 or 12 years so the question is , do their cells have some programmed death \? in case the pig cells must be replaced , he said the researchers were trying to make this device reseedable the inventors have tested their artificial pancreas in rats and plan to continue with larger animals until they are ready in a few years to begin clinical trials the bioartificial pancreas received patent 5 , 387 , 237 to reduce stress , chair with waterfall robert olsen began work on his invention in a rather uncommon manner mr olsen is openminded , willing to consider the powers of crystals , ancient philosophies and even channeling consulting a spirit during a channeling session , it seemed only natural to ask for advice in dealing with stress the spirit said to think about atlantis , mr olsen , a furniture designer in new york , said that meant considering what they did in atlantis , which was sitting in a moving stream of water that was a wild idea but then i thought , why not \? so he began work on a lounge chair called the oasis that depends on water and organic materials to soothe tensions the chair has a builtin water channel that creates the lulling sounds of a babbling brook mr olsen describes the piece as a lounge with waterfall it looks a lot like a steamer deck chair , with vertical slats made of mahogany and dowels of birch i tried to use only wood and metal , no plastics , so it would be environmentally sound , mr olsen said the dowels move to conform to your back the dowels flex at the back of the head to hit the shiatsu points for stress the leg portion is bent so your legs can be higher than your heart the chair s stressreleasing feature is in the water that flows under the seat , mr olsen said it s a oneinch pan right below the dowels , he said the trench has multiple loops running from the shoulder to the knee , with a pump in the middle copper foils prevent splashing and create a bubbling sound , he said the foils roll the water over itself like any natural waterfall the water is also heated , allowing a warm mist to float up around the reclining person the movement of the water releases negative ions any waterfall creates negative ions and neutralizes your auric field , mr olsen said we all have an auric field around us in multidimensions if you are in a highly positive or highly negative ion environment , you 'll be upset you do n't know what s bothering you , but something is wrong mr olsen has built and sold several of his chairs , which carry patent 5 , 387 , 181
science fiction has never paid much attention to sex given the freedom that science fiction writers have to invent new social customs , new attitudes , even new bodies for their characters , their speculation about the future of sex has been disappointingly timid notable exceptions include robert a heinlein , theodore sturgeon , ursula k le guin , joanna russ , norman spinrad and samuel r delany but by and large , more ingenuity has gone into devising new ways of getting on to the next galaxy than new ways of getting it on in shadow man \( tor tom doherty , 2295 \) , by melissa scott , sex is on everyone s mind which is not to say that this is sexy book far from it none of the characters seems to derive any pleasure from sexual activity no one wastes time seducing or being seduced no one seems concerned about procreation or its prevention sex , for ms scott s characters , is a political act what turns them on is the struggle over gender labels , a cultural conflict that pits personal imperatives against public convenience in the future envisioned by ms scott , a drug that allows people to survive fasterthanlight travel has drastically altered the human genome instead of two sexes there are now five man , woman , mem , fem , herm each with a different complement of genitalia on most planets this biological upheaval has already been integrated into a new social concord that , among other niceties , recognizes nine sexual preferences but on hara the forces of tradition insist on defining everyone as a man or a woman , physical evidence notwithstanding not surprisingly , this leads to grievous misunderstandings , especially when natives interact with offworlders who come to hara as tourists or traders the narrative turns on the plight of warreven , a haran whose body does not conform to his public identity as a man warreven s resolution of his personal crisis shakes haran society to its core in preparing the reader for this moment of truth , ms scott has provided each of the new sexes with pronominal equivalents of he , she , him and her , so that warreven s comingout is neatly signaled by an abrupt change in orthography i only wish ms scott had taken as much care with haran psychology by piling political , economic and social distinctions on top of physical and emotional differences , she has constructed a text so dense as to be almost indecipherable even with the 12page glossary , i had trouble responding to sentences like everyone knew warreven was a halving , wryabed and a modernist to boot what i craved finally whatever the biology or the gender labels of the characters was less analysis and more passion passion is no problem for frances lorien van de oest \( lore for short \) , the 21yearold protagonist of slow river \( del rey ballantine , 18 \) , by nicola griffith lore is attracted to women , a preference that neither surprises nor disturbs anyone in this nearfuture novel by an author whose wellreceived first novel , ammonite , was set on a planet without men lore s problems have to do with family the immensely wealthy and powerful van de oests control the genetically engineered microorganisms that keep the world s water supply free of deadly pollutants when lore is kidnapped , her family declines to pay the ransom , for reasons that are not immediately clear severely wounded in an escape attempt , she refuses to go home , preferring to place herself in the hands of spanner , a woman of many skills and connections , most of them shady in an effort to reinvent herself , lore takes a lowlevel job in a water treatment plant that uses her family s patented sludgeeating bacteria a crisis in the plant leads to revelations about lore s childhood that are more distressing than even her grimmest memories of growing up among the rich and neurotic having chosen to tell a complex story in a timefractured mode , with several levels of flashbacks , ms griffith complicates matters further by alternating between firstperson and thirdperson narration , to no apparent purpose from her detailed descriptions of the water treatment plant , it is obvious that she has done her homework on cuttingedge technology in waste management unfortunately , many of these passages read like pages from a 21stcentury technical manual for a de nitrificationnitrification process , heterotrophic facultative bacteria were usually comfortable anywhere between 25 and 30 degrees even the working out of lore s family trauma seems somewhat mechanical her agony , her healing and her final triumph appear to be ordained not so much by exigencies of plot and character as by the will of the author , who hovers over the book like an oversolicitous parent , as if uncertain that her creations can make it on their own dead girls \( st martin s , 1995 \) , by richard calder , is about death and sex , roughly in that order the title refers to pubescent females who have been infected with the dollplague , a laboratorydesigned virus that turns living tissue into a mass of polymers and resins , metals and fibers , animated not by a heart and a brain but by fractal programming of a subatomic matrix located in the belly these ghastly parodies of isaac asimov s positronic robots have immense powers that come from their control of what the author , in a moment of subscientific delirium , calls the subquantum world but despite their ability to read minds and walk through walls , and their thirst for human blood , the dead girls are more victims than monsters primavera , who escapes from quarantined london to the porno district of bangkok , does not know her own strength ignatz , her consort , is addicted to dolllove , which is painful even when it s not lethal although they earn a living for a time as professional killers , these two innocents are clearly more sinned against than sinning even the dr frankenstein who may be responsible for the worldwide catastrophe operates from motives so involute that he too may be blameless fixing blame is not the point of this exercise in postcyberpunk decadence actually , i'm not sure what the point is mr calder is given to pronouncements like when we speak of the subquantum world , we speak of ourselves , and dolls are n't women they 're man s dream of women made in man s image , they 're an extension of his sex , female impersonators built to confirm his prejudices but this vision of civilization s skunk hour is so idiosyncratic as to raise questions about whose bent is being vented for those still curious , two sequels are on the way sean stewart s resurrection man \( ace , cloth , 2295 paper , 11 \) is a rather sweet tale about growing up in a world bereft of comfortable verities the setting is an alternatehistory earth \( circa 1990 \) where magic , bred of anger in the inner cities , has returned to claim its rightful place in our streets and our psyches despite the changes , daily existence for most people goes on as before thirtyoneyearold dante has been marking time what had he done \? nothing never finished his degree , never fell in love he only begins awakening to life when he discovers , under a bedspread on his dresser , a corpse that looks just like him dante is one of those people who have a special affinity for the new magic , no matter how hard they try to deny it his efforts to come to terms with the manifestations around him are abetted by his sister , sarah , and his foster brother , jet , who are fully realized characters with their own strengths and weaknesses the family secrets they uncover lie deeper than mere abracadabra the real magic here is the tight focus and emotional intensity that mr stewart sustains in tracking dante s arduous journey toward selfknowledge
while toy makers , clothiers and distillers live for the holiday season , the period from thanksgiving through christmas can be the dead est of times for the hotel industry occupancy rates in december typically tumble to about 50 percent , compared with a yearround average of 652 percent in 1994 , and would fall even further without a wide array of discounts and other enticements many of those enticements , often including free parking and free breakfast , are widely available again this holiday season but there are fewer discount rates than usual , and almost none in new york , chicago and other cities where business and leisure travelers have filled hotel rooms for weeks on end recently in new york , for example , most of the 65 , 000 rooms have been booked solid all fall , with the occupancy rate soaring to 919 percent in october , the city s secondhighest monthly rate ever , according to pkf consulting , which tracks the hotel industry thus the hotel industry s determination this holiday season , after seven or eight bad years , to expunge the widespread perception that discounts are a permanent feature of booking a room the discounting that hotels have had to do has confused customers , led to unrealistic expectations and weakened bottom lines , said brian stage , executive vice president of sales and marketing for the radisson hotels , a unit of the carlson companies so our strategy during the slow season is to create valueadded packages to attract customers who would n't ordinarily stay in the hotels indeed , hotels are offering everything from room upgrades and transportation to and from airports and shopping malls to discounts for food and beverages and gift certificates toward items in lobby shops because business travel slows during much of the holiday season , a prime target of hotels is couples and families within a radius of about 50 miles not to mention partygoers at the venerable seelbach hotel in louisville , ky , where the fictional tom buchanan rented an entire floor before his wedding to daisy fay in f scott fitzgerald s the great gatsby , december is filled with christmas parties , weddings and local social events this evening alone , viola sanders , the seelbach s sales manager , said in a recent interview , we have seven corporate christmas parties as states have cracked down on drunken driving , partygoers are increasingly staying over at hotels and often qualify for some of the remaining discount rates if they had their party here , ms sanders said , they would get a discount rate of 69 a night , compared with the usual corporate rate of 137 similarly , most radisson hotels offer party guests rooms at half price to fill their rooms , hotels are also trying to entice more holiday travelers to stay with them , rather than with family or friends the loews santa monica beach hotel in santa monica , calif , has been aiming at affluent families with radio and television ads proclaiming , your guest house for the holidays radisson hotels in minneapolis , atlanta and arlington heights , ill , have all run ads with the headline at radisson , uncle fred can snore as loud as he likes group discounts are viewed in a more favorable light by hoteliers than discounts for individual travelers , because most groups stay longer , rent meeting rooms and spend more on food and beverages in fact , group business is so sought after , especially during slow seasons , that sales and marketing departments refer to it as smerf an acronym for social , military , ethnic educational , religious and fraternal groups the radisson sand piper beach resort in st petersburg , fla , not only solicits family groups , soccer associations and youth football leagues at thanksgiving time , we 're always looking for canadians who do n't celebrate the holiday , said drew toth , the hotel s director of sales and marketing the trend away from discounting also does not normally extend to weekend rates at hotels that cater to business travelers , who are scarce on friday , saturday and sunday on the contrary , weekend rates are regarded as providing incremental revenue from rooms that otherwise would have been empty so weekend rates abound , including during the holiday season almost 150 itt sheraton properties in the united states and canada are offering 6 to 25 percent off their usual weekend rates , with some restrictions the cincinnatian hotel in cincinnati s downtown business district has long offered weekend rates \( currently 125 a night , compared with the 160 corporate rate \) but the hotel does not further lower those rates for the holidays , although at christmas it offers an array of amenities that include holiday meals and afternoon tea we would rather leave a room empty than lower the rate too far , and risk losing our image as a luxury hotel , said marjorie hermann , a spokeswoman for the cincinnatian and in a luxury hotel there are costs beyond turning a key and opening a door there s the wear and tear on the room the cincinnatian is not alone in thinking it necessary to protect its image , and hotel analysts say that belief is likely to spread at least until the next economic slowdown nothing is more perishable than an unoccupied hotel room , said stanley turkel , a hotel consultant in new york who is generally critical of the policy of accepting unoccupied rooms rather than offering lower rates still , some luxury hotels are offering holiday rates well below normal the ritzcarlton huntington in pasadena , calif , for example , offers a holiday package for 115 a night that includes two cocktails and a room that regularly costs 165 but we end it dec 28 , said george lysak , director of sales and marketing , because we 're sold out for the rose bowl and rose parade on jan 1 one of the most unusual marketing efforts is that of the 527room san francisco airport hilton , which through jan 15 charges guests the same rate as the lowest temperature in the city that day it s a real bargain for guests , said laura jung , the hotel s director of sales and marketing , who noted that the temperature was often in the 40 s during last year s promotion the hotel s regular corporate rate is 140 we drew about 250 people because of it , ms jung said , most of them from around here and when you include what they spent on food and drinks , the hotel made out ok
the first of two big buses with the valuableasgems cargo of ice skaters arrived in the sparkling saturday morning sunshine at the meadowlands for a matinee just came through the turnstile at the venue site , lou mcclary , the silverhaired , nononsense director of security for the 1995 tour of world figure skating champions in the front seat , barked into his black walkietalkie we 're heading in this is the 15th year of this tour and never until last year did it have security , or need it but never until last year did figure skating take on the aura it has now , and thus attracting such huge crowds never before had the graceful , gossamer , magical kingdom of figure skating encounter such a sordid spectacle as that of the tonya hardingnancy kerrigan clubbing incident oh , yes , from all the publicity of that crime , skating has soared , said viktor petrenko , the russian champion it is sad , yes , but it is true tom collins , the promoter of the tour , said i remember when phil donahue said on his show , 'when nancy kerrigan steps on the olympic ice at lillehammer , america will stop breathing , ' you knew this was an incredible thing and when did we get the covers of time and people and all the newspapers \? it was like a minio j trial cbs ratings went through the roof in my 45 years in skating , interest is the greatest it s ever been already assembled in the parking lot were fans who would help fill the brendan byrne arena to the capacity of 19 , 000plus this is about midway in a tour of 70 american cities and 76 performances in 100 days that for this show of 33 skaters is virtually standingroom only from huntsville , ala , to hampton , va , from pittsburgh to boston to washington once , the tour had one or two stops in the new york area now there are four the meadowlands on saturday afternoon the nassau coliseum on saturday night and again last night , and madison square garden tonight the fans in the parking lot were waving and holding up signs elvis is king , for elvis stojko , the muscular world champion from canada , who was indeed named for the man who immortalized hound dog we love you , oksana ! and , simply , nancy ! nancy ! the tour had arrived at 4 30 in the morning at its manhattan hotel from a performance in syracuse , and the cast was only now halfawake at best on the bus , stojko , curly haired and stretching after a brief nap looked at the fans and smiled and waved , saying thanks to the shut window oksana baiul was wearing a tshirt of a chicago tribune front page with a photo of a dunking michael jordan and with the headline , relaunched ! she sat , eyes closed , listening to music via ear phones kerrigan , in greenandblue sweats , was immersed in a mystery novel by mary higgins clark and while she prefers not to speak publicly about her own drama that had gripped a nation when harding s minions carried out a plot last year to try to eliminate her as olympic competition it s old news , she says it is still everywhere for her the security director follows her and her alone to the brink of the ice rink for her stint \( there were threats against her during last year s tour , though none this year \) when she was about to board the bus in front of the hotel on saturday , she was handed two 1994 magazine covers with her picture to sign a people cover read , terror on ice , and a sports illustrated cover said , why me \? kerrigan politely signed both , telling the autograph collector , scott smith of englewood cliffs , nj , those are negative covers then she looked again at the si cover kerrigan told smith i did n't say 'why me \? ' i said , 'why \? ' inside the arena , the skaters do n't have time to warm up on the ice the crowd is already beginning to file in and an illusion might be destroyed so they go through some of their routines backstage while in their skating costumes and sneakers , spinning and jumping in the aisles and around the many trunks that have brought in the technical equipment and lights thirty minutes ! one of tom collins s assistants yells in the large area backstage , collins set up a play area , which travels with the tour and keeps the interest of the skaters when they are not floating and twirling and zipping about the ice philippe candeloro , the young french champion who wows audiences with his barechested energy , was madly working a pinball machine the russian aleksandr zhulin , of the worldchampion dance team , sought to beat baiul at an electronic dart board i know she will beat me , he said , glumly baiul then threw her first two darts off the board she grimaced he beamed stojko shot pool alone , and then stopped and unconsciously broke into a skating step , with his pool cue as a partner surya bonaly , the wellknit frenchwoman who somersaults backward on ice with alarming ease and lands on one blade , was now huffing while riding a stationary bicycle my breakfast still here , she said , patting her stomach fifteen minutes ! someone called out brian boitano warmed up in the physical trainer s room , where he got rubbed down eric lang , the trainer , kneaded boitano s back muscles
in other sports , it s called the locker room or the dressing room but in baseball it s always known as the clubhouse maybe that s because baseball players , with the longest schedule in sports , spend so much time there that it might as well be their house , if not their home in every baseball clubhouse , some lockers are different than others not by what is in them , but by who is in them in show business there s always a star on at least one dressingroom door backstage in sports the name above the locker is enough , as taylor and simms and seaver and namath were , as ewing and messier are now but sometimes the locker itself is enough , especially the corner locker to the right of inside the door to the yankee clubhouse that is now empty of players with any yankee heritage , the locker where don mattingly put on his pinstriped uniform in shuffling the roster , george steinbrenner has created a team of strangers there are no real yankees on the yankees now , none for the strangers to look to for how to win , none deserving of that corner locker where only real yankees have dressed donnie baseball had been in that corner locker for several seasons before him , dave righetti , ron guidry , graig nettles and sparky lyle were there , each a real yankee that locker has been used only by real yankees it s bigger and better than the others bigger so donnie baseball could sit inside it and check the grain in his bats while surrounded by bluesleeved sweatshirts and stacks of black baseball shoes better for the captain who might turn out to have been the last real yankee in the years before yankee stadium was remodeled , whitey ford was in that corner locker before him , eddie lopat each was a real yankee , just as so many others were in other lockers in other years near the trainer s room , with his mask and chest protector and shin guards on display , thurman munson s corner locker remains a shrine to his 1979 death reggie jackson was in the other corner locker near the door in the previous clubhouse , yogi berra dressed near the manager s office roger maris was near the cooler across from mickey mantle s locker near the trainer s room this way , mantle always joked , i do n't have to walk far to get my legs wrapped before a game after the yankee clubhouse was moved in 1946 to the firstbase side from the thirdbase side , joe dimaggio also dressed back near the trainer s room , sipping half a cup of black coffee and smoking a chesterfield cigarette when joe walked in , the late pete sheehy , the legendary clubhouse man , often said , the lights flickered they do n't flicker now just putting on the uniform , as tino martinez will as the new first baseman , or even being around for a few seasons does n't make a real yankee it takes time as well as talent bernie williams might be a real yankee eventually paul o'neill has a chance so does jimmy key , if his left arm is healthy but they 're still too new to be knighted to be a real yankee , you must be thought of as wearing only a yankee uniform , as playing primarily in yankee stadium wade boggs is still thought of by many , and probably always will be , as the red sox third baseman who won all those batting titles even if the yankees sign david cone , he s thought of as a pitcher with a on his cap , not an interlocked ny blinded by the glare of his own ego , george steinbrenner does n't understand that a clubhouse with real yankees is important , that when games must be won in september or october there must be some real yankees for the strangers to look to , to depend on the principal owner did n't even understand that buck showalter , who developed into a real yankee , was a good manager or that gene michael , another real yankee , was a good general manager the principal owner probably thinks he s the only real yankee now but he s the reason there are n't any he s the reason that corner locker should stay empty until a real yankee emerges if one ever does photo mattingly s old locker \( steve berman \)
they dressed like police officers , they acted like police officers , but the 30 employees of the state investigation services company were actually illegal copy cops , state officials said yesterday attorney general dennis c vacco announced that the company s head , mckenneth k ortiz , had been arrested on charges of fraud and forgery for running a unlicensed security guard agency mr vacco said mr ortiz , who has a criminal record for forgery , had fraudulently sold his company s services to a 240unit apartment complex in manhattan by claiming his guards were offduty law enforcement officers mr vacco said none of the guards were actually in law enforcement although they carried stateofthe art equipment , including 9millimeter ruger handguns and at least one assault rifle , he said none were trained or licensed to carry firearms or work as security guards there was a real threat to the public , having these untrained , unlicensed people carrying powerful firearms , he said the counterfeit new york police department uniforms worn by the guards included windbreakers with the logo state investigators and the new york state seal so realistic that even investigators from the attorney general s office mistook the guards for real officers , mr vacco said but he said the employees were apparently unwitting and have not been arrested the authorities began investigating the twoyearold state investigation services in august , after a business owner became suspicious of the uniforms and reported the agency to the attorney general s office mr vacco said his undercover agents posed as businessmen in search of a security concern and taped conversations in which mr ortiz misrepresented his employees as law enforcement officers mr vacco declined to say whether company guards ever made arrests or interacted with legitimate police officers he said ballistics tests were being conducted to determine whether they ever fired their weapons
kyoto , japan , jan 23 as if she did not face enough challenges becoming a geisha , what with endless training in the arts of teasing her hair and clients , keiko takada now must deal with an unexpected crisis that is affecting her job security the earthquake that devastated the city of kobe , 40 miles to the southwest , did not at first do much damage in the ancient japanese capital of kyoto but since then the economic aftershocks have been rattling kyoto without interruption , cutting sharply into tourism and myriad related businesses we 're very concerned , said miss takada , 17 , a maiko , or apprentice geisha the earthquake was on the 17th , and that night all of our banquets were canceled we had many customers in kobe , so we 're very alarmed about our business i hear there are lots of cancellations , and i wonder what will happen miss takada paused and delicately adjusted her red and purple silk kimono , and a hint of anxiety showed through the layers of white makeup on her face even before this there was a recession , she explained earnestly , with the same charm and polish she uses at dinners to entertain business customers and now the earthquake has made the situation much worse kyoto was the capital of japan for more than 1 , 000 years , until 1868 , and it is perhaps the foremost japanese city for temples , tradition and tourists but these days , all it has are temples and tradition many of the tourists , on whom 30 percent of the economy depends , have been frightened away by the earthquake hotel lobbies are vacant , temple gardens are nearly empty , and entertainers like miss takeda are left to sit at home with train service disrupted , it is more difficult for people from western japan to reach kyoto and in any case , kyoto and kobe are linked in the popular mind as neighbors some guidebooks cover both cities so that prospective visitors are turned off by the prospect of visiting an earthquake zone nearly 40 million tourists normally visit kyoto each year including 500 , 000 foreigners , of whom 90 , 000 are americans but the number is now well below normal the city tourist office estimates that tourism has been cut in half , but that may be optimistic the night sightseeing bus tour , which sold about 100 tickets an evening this time a year ago , is now selling just 20 an evening the earthquake has particularly affected the geisha and the tea houses where they work , entertaining businessmen with their charm and music and sometimes when the mood and money are right their bodies geisha are not regarded as prostitutes , any more than surgeons are to be equated with seamstresses , for a geisha s training has much less to do with sex than with hairdos and music and courteous speech instead of fishnet stockings and high heels , they wear layers of kimonos secured with a most daunting obi , or belt kyoto is a center for geisha , with 210 of them and another 71 maiko , but their prices are as impressive as their appearance a few businessmen can easily spend more than 1 , 000 on a dinner with a geisha , sating their culinary appetites alone , and now they seem inclined to cut back on such expenses customers are businessmen , many of them small entrepreneurs from osaka , kobe and other areas hit by the earthquake , said toshio ozeki , a man who is an official of one of the geisha associations in kyoto now they would rather use their money to rebuild , instead of on entertainment even those customers not affected by the earthquake feel they should refrain from going to entertainment areas when there is so much suffering going on , mr ozeki added , a bit regretfully tetsuo ito , an official in the kyoto tourism association , said that the impact of the earthquake would probably last at least a year he said the city wanted to get the message out that it was safe , but without any flamboyance that would be in poor taste considering the misery nearby in kobe because of the suffering in kobe , it would be inappropriate to have lots of flashy advertising , but we need to make some efforts to let people know that kyoto is ok , mr ito said indeed , the frustration for people like mr ito is that the only abnormal thing about kyoto these days is the absence of tourists while the earthquake jolted kyoto badly , it caused no deaths in the city , only a few injuries and little damage the city s temples and cultural treasures survived almost unscathed none of the buildings fell over , although a few cracks were reported in walls , and the worst harm was to wooden statues that toppled at koryuji , a secondrank temple on the outskirts of town a 13thcentury statue of a servant lost its left arm in the accident , and a 9thcentury statue of the god of mercy lost its right arm experts are going to reattach the missing limbs , and the damage is expected not to be noticeable dozens of other artifacts at the temple including a famous statue damaged in 1960 when a college student was overcome with its beauty and embraced it , snapping off a finger in his passion remained upright and were unhurt in the earthquake many japanese have grown critical of buddhist temples , saying the monks have grown rapacious with exorbitant demands for money for funerals and other ceremonies but while the monks acknowledge the criticisms , they attribute the earthquake to chance alone this ca n't be a punishment , said yorito matsuda , the curator of the koryuji we 've prayed very faithfully every day and looked after everything carefully at the nishi honganji , an important temple in the center of the city , about 20 stone lanterns fell over homei komagai , a buddhist priest at the temple , said that the lanterns were about 300 years old but that they did not seem to have special historic or cultural importance a greater concern at the temple was that many of its donors lived in kobe we 're concerned about their safety , mr komagai said , and also about their ability to continue to contribute
houston , june 12 he is a dead ringer for the fresh prince of belair or scottie pippen , depending on the day robert horry strolls the galleria here , signs an autograph and hears , wait a minute , i thought you were that actor , will smith the orlando magic does not know what to make of him , either he has been automatic from 25 feet out , and it has horace grant s goggles fogged up if it is not horry recording a record seven steals in game 2 of this championship series between the magic and the houston rockets , it is horry airmailing a 3pointer with 14 seconds left to sew up a taut game 3 he has a few mostvaluable player votes coming , to which he replied today shoot , i wish but you ca n't pick a screwup like me he is furthest from the sort he grew up under the tent of an army sergeant \( his father , robert \) and a fourthgrade teacher \( his mother , lelia \) he adhered to authority all of his life or else his father took out a belt and the one time he did not , the rockets traded him a season ago , coach rudy tomjanovich demanded that he shoot more horry instead kept lobbing it in to his boyhood idol , hakeem olajuwon , and that was his ticket to detroit in exchange for sean elliott they traded me for not shooting , which is kind of funny , horry said usually , they trade a guy for shooting too much he was a piston for three days and three nights , but the deal was voided because of elliott s problem kidney and the rockets , ahead of the magic three games to none , are on the verge of having their second ring to show for it lucky he stayed , guard kenny smith said because we do n't win last year without him , either horry s aboutface has to do with a picture frame , with lingering voices of discipline and with the simple purchase of a newspaper before this series , the experts analyzed the matchups , one by one , and predicted grant s imminent swallowing of horry at power forward you 'd open the paper and read , 'advantage grant , ' horry said that motivated me i thank those guys for thinking they know everything to the contrary , horry has camped out beyond the 3point arc , has baited grant away from the basket and has cleared the freeway traffic around olajuwon and when grant does cheat inside to help out , that is horry howling frantically for the ball he has averaged 167 points and 9 rebounds in the series and his late 3point bomb sunday is still the lump in grant s throat no one thought he 'd take a big shot like that , grant said i 'll try to lock him up at home so he ca n't come to game 4 grant , in fact , was the one who said today that horry and pippen \( grant s former chicago teammate \) are connected at the hip i ai n't that good , horry said scottie can put the ball on the floor , although not downgrading scottie i can shoot it better than him but i ca n't put it on the floor like that plus , scottie jumps better than me , jumps easier but horry owns something pippen does not a piston uniform after his 72hour stay in detroit , horry kept his jersey , framed it and hung it in the corridor next to his bedroom i pass it every day on the way to the bathroom , he said when i see it , i see the words , shoot' traded initially for his reticence , he has returned to the rockets a gunner his father and his high school coach never had to tell him something twice , and now tomjanovich does not have to tell him , hurry up and shoot , twice he was always a good listener , or else when he was growing up in andalusia , ala , his father cared little about basketball and would punish him for unseemly report cards one time i refused to learn the states and state capitals , and my father drove all the way from his base in south carolina to put his belt on me , horry said his coach at andalusia high , richard robertson , picked up where robert sr left off i went to high school a big magic johnson fan , horry said i wanted jersey no 32 , but my coach said , 'wrong , you got to be your own person' he said , 'when s your birthday \? ' i said , '25th of august , ' and he said , 'that s your number , 25' you know , i 've got to thank him he always said if you ca n't play one on one , you ca n't play ball i 'd want to shoot these silly shots , and he 'd say , 'work on your j' i guess he knew what was in my future so , horry is in houston to stay , no longer contentious , no longer in anonymity , and hoping to make a guest appearance on the fresh prince that is the good news the bad news is he and his fiancee may have to cancel his plans to purchase property in orlando if we win this series , he said , they may not want me living down there
ouagadougou , burkina faso , march 1 was n't that wole soyinka \? someone asked in a crowded hotel lobby , referring to the nigerian nobel laureate and dissident , who was spotted darting from one interview to the next has anyone seen alice walker \? another celebritywatcher wondered aloud , referring to the american novelist who visited here two years ago no , but i did see winnie mandela , came the response , a reference to the estranged wife of the south african president , nelson mandela mrs mandela soaked up vip treatment here despite a government order not to leave home she looked just like a queen , zooming about town with a cortege of motorcycle escorts women drivers , no less this is usually the quietest of subsaharan capitals but not this week , when ouagadougou is the host to africa s version of cannes , a biannual film festival known as fespaco the buzz of celebritywatching , movie business deals and discussion groups briefly overtakes the whiny din of the town s preferred mode of transportation , the motor scooter redlettered banners festooned all about town shout slogans like enjoy fespaco and say thank you , and going to the movies is like taking a trip from early morning , when the city s dozen or so theaters open , until night , the thousands who mill in and out appear to have taken the call to heart i do n't usually go to the movies at all , said bintou ouebraogo , a 24yearold university student who fought the crowds for a flimsy metal seat under the open sky of the riale theater to watch a drama from neighboring ivory coast but this is the one time when it is exciting to live in ouagadougou , when our country is even easy for foreigners to find on the map american hits like pulp fiction and what s love got to do with it \? were among the dozens of films being shown here but this is decidedly a week when hollywood s products do n't stand out , much less steal the show for years , african cinema has seemed dominated by slowpaced lyrical epics that explore the mysticism and traditions of rural life but veterans of the 26yearold festival , which ends on saturday , said the offerings this year featured more conventional story lines the shift reflects africa s growing preoccupation with urban problems , none more prominent than aids on a typical festival evening , one screen carried the story of an unemployed senegalese man s obsession with winning the lottery , an obsession that turned him into a wandering lunatic at a theater across town , moviegoers watched a prostitute concerned about aids argue with a customer over the use of a condom in a third cinema , an audience wept audibly over the story of a mistreated child who commits suicide you can sense a real consciousness among the artists of the african tragedy , said djibril diallo , a member of the festival s jury at the same time , you get the sense that through this kind of art , the continent is recharging its batteries for many firsttime visitors to this dusty and unimposing city , including the scores of south africans whose newly democratic country was officially invited for the first time , there is the inevitable question why burkina faso \? even the festival s organizers seem conscious of how improbable it seems to many that burkina faso , one of this poor continent s poorest countries , has succeeded in building what many have come to consider africa s premier cultural event burkina faso is a truly undeveloped country , but we could not allow that to prevent us from trying to organize a festival , said filippe sawadogo , the secretary general of fespaco in the 1960 s we decided to show the outside world that africa has its own civilization , its own culture we have a lot to say , but that begins by controlling our own images over the years , france has become an important financial backer of the event , leading some to complain that the festival had become more a frenchspeaking gathering than a panafrican one with the entry of south africa , which already has a welldeveloped movie industry , that situation is likely to change quickly , and some members of the cozy circle of frenchspeaking artists here are worried that the festival may soon escape their control for many of the eager south african film makers attending the festival for the first time , however , the event is an opportunity to profit from the experience of their west african neighbors rather than to dominate them for a long time we were barred from being africans , said lionel ngakane , a pioneering south african film maker whose works were produced mostly in exile in an openingday address that seemed intended to put the frenchspeakers at ease , mr ngakane said we are coming to you now as africans please help us learn photo the quiet capital of burkina faso , ouagadougou , is host this week to africa s answer to cannes , the biannual film festival called fespaco passersby read posters for movies being shown at cine burkina theater \( robert grossman for the new york times \) map of burkina faso showing location of ouagadougou
some investors are betting that small breweries have a future , and one company they have focused on is rock bottom restaurants inc of boulder , colo analysts say it is the leading contender to build a national chain of brew pubs the united states once had hundreds of local brewers practicing a rich tradition but their number had dried up to 60 by 1980 , according to the institute for brewing studies now , a renaissance is in full swing , the trade group says , with local brews on tap at 658 microbreweries and brew pub restaurants , which serve proprietary beers since first selling shares to the public at 8 in july of last year , rock bottom stock has charmed wall street by not living up to its name its shares ended yesterday at 2650 , down 50 cents , about 32 times projected earnings , one of the priciest on an index of 70 restaurant stocks compiled by piper jaffray , the minneapolis brokerage firm a lot of people thought rock bottom was fully priced at 18 , said allan f hickok , a managing director of piper jaffray , one of rock bottom s underwriters he continues to favor the stock because it s a good concept run by solid people the company operates 6 rock bottom breweries and 18 old chicago pizza restaurants and plans to add 6 more restaurants this year in the quarter that ended march 26 , rock bottom s earnings more than doubled to 617 , 000 and revenue rose to 145 million , compared with 1994 s firstquarter sales of 78 million about 45 percent of the revenue comes from sales of alcohol the 3 tab for a glass of beer that costs 20 cents to produce can yield fat profit margins frank b day , 62 , rock bottom s chairman and chief executive , has been perfecting the company s formula oversize portions and ebullient help along with specialty beer since the first old chicago s opening in boulder in 1976 he owns 187 percent of the company s stock while the popularity of brew pubs may initially entice customers in the door , analysts say rock bottom s results give signs that novelty has given way to loyalty samestore sales of restaurants open at least a year rose 89 percent in the first quarter the fact is people are wrestling over high chairs in there , mr hickok said families are welcomed , not tolerated michael g mueller , a managing director of montgomery securities , said he expected rock bottom s revenue to reach 75 million this year , and net income to increase to 63 cents a share , from 47 cents last year montgomery comanaged a 34 million second offering of rock bottom stock in february , when the shares sold for 18 each the proceeds will finance expansion a typical rock bottom brew pub costs about 25 million and generates 5 million in annual revenue , a 45 percent return on investment , mr mueller said i do n't think that s excessive , he said these are excellent returns compared to a typical restaurant , which is 25 percent william j wykle , managing director of pnc small cap growth equity fund in philadelphia , said he thought rock bottom had tapped into a broadening trend by consumers , whose tastes for wine , coffee and now beer have become more sophisticated i do n't think it s a fad , he said the fund owns 101 , 000 rock bottom shares , acquired last fall at an average cost of 16 none of its other restaurant holdings , including landry s seafood , morrison and bugaboo , have priceearnings multiples as high it s a very rich multiple , mr wykle acknowledged it s hard to buy the stock at this price the nation s big brewers , unwilling to cede the tiny 13 percent market share held by local brew masters , are concocting their own faux specialty beers and applying some serious marketing muscle capitalizing on the growing appetite for amber beers , for example , the miller brewing unit of the philip morris companies and the anheuserbusch companies have brought out red dog and red hook , respectively
a new study of more than 75 million births has challenged the assumption that low birth weights per se are the cause of the high infant mortality rate in the united states rather , the new findings indicate , prematurity is the principal culprit being born too soon , rather than too small , is the main underlying cause of stillbirth and infant deaths within four weeks of birth each year in the united states about 31 , 000 fetuses die before delivery and 22 , 000 newborns die during the first 27 days of life the united states has a higher infant mortality rate than those in 19 other countries , and this poor standing has long been attributed mainly to the large number of babies in this country who are born too small , including a large proportion who are born small for date , or weighing less than they should for the length of time they were in the womb the researchers found that americanborn babies , on average , weigh less than babies born in norway , even when the length of pregnancy is the same but for a given length of pregnancy , the lighter american babies are no more likely to die than are the slightly heavier norwegian babies the researchers , directed by dr allen wilcox of the national institute of environmental health sciences in research triangle park , nc , concluded that improving the nation s infant mortality rate would depend on preventing preterm births , not on increasing the average weight of newborns although prematurity results in low birth weights , dr wilcox said in an interview , it is the prematurity , not the low birth weight , that accounts for the increased likelihood of death among lowweight babies more than half the lowbirthweight babies born in this country are not preterm , he noted small fullterm babies generally do well furthermore , he cited an earlier study in which he compared survival rates among lowbirthweight babies of women who smoked during pregnancy with survival among babies of equal weight born to nonsmokers smoking , like poor nutrition , is known to interfere with prenatal weight gain ounce for ounce , he said , the babies of smoking mothers had a higher survival rate as he explained this paradoxical finding , although smoking interferes with weight gain , it does not shorten pregnancy thus , among smoking women the smaller babies are more likely to be born fullterm , but the smaller babies born to nonsmoking mothers are more likely to be born prematurely so , he deduced , it is their prematurity , not their low birth weight , that explains the higher infant mortality rate among babies of low birth weight who are born to nonsmokers the new study , published in today s issue of the journal of the american medical association , examined the rate of stillbirth and infant deaths in the first four weeks of life among 7 , 421 , 861 births in the united states in 1986 and 1987 , the latest data available at the time for comparison , the researchers analyzed 104 , 624 norwegian births that occurred during the same two years at the time , the perinatal mortality rate \( stillbirths plus infant deaths \) was 115 per 1 , 000 births in the united states but only 98 per 1 , 000 births in norway but when the researchers compared perinatal mortality among babies of equal weight , they found that the survival rates were nearly identical in other words , dr wilcox said , american babies , though lighter , are not less likely to survive as long as the cause of their low birth weight is not prematurity in an editorial in the same issue of the journal , dr melissa m adams , a specialist in reproductive health at the federal centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta noted that approximately 71 percent of fetal deaths and 74 percent of neonatal deaths occur among preterm infants and that preterm deliveries are rising in the united states , to 107 percent in 1992 from 94 percent in 1981 a rise in prematurity has also occurred among women who began receiving prenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy , she reported to dr adams , this suggests that those who deliver prenatal care are failing to recognize some of the causes of prematurity or failing to intervene to correct them she concluded that more careful studies were needed of such causes of prematurity as a tendency to go into early labor , premature rupture of the amniotic membranes and maternal illness severe enough to warrant induction of premature labor such studies should lead to new strategies for preventing prematurity , she maintained in a related study published in the february issue of the archives of pediatric and adolescent medicine , canadian specialists in newborn care reported that parents of infants born at very low weights suffered longterm stress , including serious financial burdens and personal and family strain , even though the cost of infant care is fully covered by the national canadian health insurance system dr catherine m g cronin , a pediatrician at the university of manitoba in winnipeg , and her colleagues found that parents had considerable problems dealing with the birth and upbringing of infants who at birth weighed from 570 to 1 , 495 grams , or roughly 13 to 33 pounds , and were born 3 to 17 weeks prematurely many mothers were forced to stop working or had to cut back on work time , they had less time for other family members , they had difficulties obtaining appropriate child care and educational services and they complained of chronic excessive fatigue the stresses on fathers were less severe , the researchers reported , but the researchers found no diminution of family stress as the children got older on a positive side , however , parents reported a greater sense of mastery as a result of having to care for their prematurely born children the analysis was conducted when the children were from 1 to 5 years old it involved 97 pairs of families whose children were born from july 1986 to june 1990 half the families had premature babies with very low birth weights , the other half had babies born at term none of the children involved had a significant birth defect or severe handicap , but , as expected , the parents of children with moderate handicaps reported more severe financial and personal stress than did those whose children were only mildly impaired or had no impairment

several banks are moving closer to making friendly private offers for first interstate bancorp of los angeles , which appears to be looking for a white knight to rescue it from a hostile bid made last week by wells fargo company the first bank system of minneapolis has examined first interstate s books and is interested in making an offer , people familiar with the situation said yesterday first bank s larger crosstown rival , the norwest corporation , also appeared to be preparing to bid for first interstate and another potential suitor , the banc one corporation of columbus , remains interested but has decided to lie low for the present , other people familiar with the talks said norwest and banc one have also examined first interstate s books none of these potential friendly suitors are expected to make a public offer , however , without a signed merger agreement with first interstate that would include penalties if the deal were not concluded representatives of first interstate , norwest and first bank declined to comment yesterday a banc one spokesman did not return calls seeking comment first interstate is being vague about its plans and goals , even with its potential white knights , people involved with the talks said in particular , it has not said whether its board had met to discuss any deals or when it was scheduled to meet some deal makers speculated that first interstate was trying to attract other bids to drive up wells fargo s price wells fargo , based in san francisco , has the greatest overlap with first interstate s operations , so it presumably could pay the most in an auction , analysts said but executives at first interstate could well be looking to combine with an outofstate company because such a deal would preserve jobs in los angeles , where mayor richard j riordan has expressed concern about the impact of the wells fargo bid an outofstate buyer , with no overlapping operations in the city , would probably close fewer operations there wells fargo executives have not been in touch with first interstate since the offer was announced , people familiar with wells fargo said on oct 18 , wells fargo offered to buy first interstate for stock initially valued at 13350 a share the stock market reacted positively , sending the value of the wells offer to 143 a share but the value has since fallen to 130 a share investment bankers say they expect that the other potential bidders could offer stock deals valued at roughly 135 a share many also suggest that wells fargo is prepared to raise its bid significantly , from its initial level of 0625 of a share for each share of first interstate in a private unsolicited bid in february 1994 , wells offered 065 of a share for first interstate , and many analysts expect it could bid as much as 070 share , which would be worth 145 wells fargo has hired a second highpriced law firm , cravath , swaine moore , to advise it on its bid it i already being advised by sullivan cromwell allen finkelson , a cravath partner , has worked on a number of hostile deals , including the acquisition of the lotus development corporation by ibm takeover experts say they expect him to lead a shareholder proposal to oust first interstate s board mr finkelson declined to comment the entry of the first bank system into the fray is unexpected with 33 billion in assets , the company is barely more than half the size of first interstate , which has 56 billion in assets and first bank s market capitalization is 66 billion , compared with 97 billion at first interstate as a result , in a merger , first bank s current shareholders would own only about 40 percent of the combined company but because first bank is highly profitable , and its stock trades at a lofty multiple of 24 times its book value , it could well pay a high price for first interstate and not subject its shareholders to much dilution of earnings , analysts said deal makers also said first bank s chairman , john f grundhofer , might be the most eager to get a deal done a former top executive of wells fargo , mr grundhofer has transformed a multistate holding company troubled by a string of bad agriculture loans into a successful consumer banking company , cutting costs with the aggressive approach of his former employer now mr grundhofer is eager to return to california , people familiar with the bank said he has approached a number of large banks , trying to sell first bank system , and sought unsuccessfully to succeed richard m rosenberg as chief executive of the bankamerica corporation of san francisco , these people said mr rosenberg plans to retire industry analysts predict that in a combination with first interstate , he would move the headquarters to los angeles a spokeswoman for first bank declined to comment on any past merger discussions and said mr grundhofer had no formal talks with bankamerica frank suozzo , an analyst with s g warburg , wrote in a report released yesterday that first bank system is the most logical white knight for first interstate he said first bank could bid 129 a share for first interstate without hurting its earnings per share

with a volcano out front , dolphins out back , a tropical jungle and tigers inside and a huge frontdesk aquarium where sharks lurk , the mirage casino resort that steve wynn opened in las vegas six years ago quickly became to resort hotels of the 1990 s what disneyland was to amusement parks in the 1950 s competitors raced to imitate its mix of gambling and fantasy for adults , beginning a construction boom on the las vegas strip they built casinos around the themes of ancient egypt \( circus circus \) and the emerald city of the wizard of oz \( mgm grand \) others plan nostalgic visions of new york city \( mgm grand and primadonna resorts \) and paris \( bally entertainment \) now , the 53yearold mr wynn wants to take the concept to atlantic city , and others may not be far behind this morning , new jersey is expected to grant his company , mirage resorts inc , a license to build a gambling resort mr wynn envisions a 600 million complex on what are now 155 marshy acres in atlantic city s marina district , near the harrah s and trump castle casinos and west of the seedy boardwalk area where 10 casinos sit on cramped sites mr wynn plans something akin to his las vegas adult fantasyland the east coast , he said in an interview , is basically a gray experience , and to overcome that dullness his company s new resort will have glass roofs , glass ceilings , atriums while mr wynn would not talk about specific themes or attractions , the new mirage would emphasize live entertainment , including original productions of shows , and would be dotted with boutiques assuming mr wynn receives a contract next month from atlantic city to develop the site , which is expected , the casino could open in 1998 while mr wynn may become the first new kid on the block , he probably will not be the last already , at least three major investors are waiting in the wings the financier ronald o perelman is expected to get a license next month to buy or build a casino he will not disclose his plans in addition , hilton hotels and the financier marvin davis were both awarded casino licenses last year they also have not disclosed their plans but it is mr wynn s proposal that has most excited the gambling industry mirage , in which he holds a 15 percent stake , is the strongest company in the gambling business , with 11 billion of shareholder equity , only 292 million of debt and a 1 billion credit line with major banks its profit nearly quadrupled last year , to 114 million , while revenue surged 30 percent , to 137 billion the company owns two other las vegas casinos besides the mirage treasure island and the golden nugget as well as a smaller casino in laughlin , nev the credit line should enable mirage to finance both the proposed atlantic city resort and the 1 billion beau rivage casino that mr wynn is about to build in las vegas , without a single penny of additional financing , said dan lee , mirage s chief financial officer if everything mr wynn and the other potential investors want comes true , atlantic city would finally make the leap from a daytrip town to a destination resort while it remains the nation s no 1 tourist destination , with about 30 million visits annually , the average visitor stays only eight hours , compared with half a week in las vegas or orlando , fla , home of disney world such a transformation poses new risks for the existing casinos , which would benefit if the market truly expands , but might suffer if their most profitable players drift to glitzier temples of chance right now , donald j trump dominates the city s gambling industry , with 3 of its 12 casinos and nearly onethird of the total business other players include bally entertainment , with two casinos , and the entertainment entrepreneur merv griffin , with one of all the atlantic city operators , only two have both strong balance sheets and solid management caesars , which was recently acquired by the itt corporation , and harrah s , owned by the promus companies mr trump is particularly at risk because of his reliance on the kind of high rollers mr wynn courts and because his casinos , while showing operating profits , have heavy debt loads then again , if new casino projects help atlantic city attract a lot more customers , mr trump could benefit indeed , mr trump said he would welcome mr wynn as a real asset for the city having steve return to atlantic city just reaffirms what i have been saying about how things have changed and what a great business there is there today , he said already the future looks brighter for atlantic city after stagnating for six years , gambling revenues are rising again , up 13 percent in the first five months of 1995 from the corresponding 1994 period also , new jersey significantly loosened its regulatory grip last year the legislature essentially ended regulation of the hotel side of the casinos , including removing strict requirements on architectural design , and extended licensing periods to four years from one or two at the same time , the administration of gov christine todd whitman has said it will no longer take an adversarial approach to the industry

in a challenge to the business improvement districts that have sprouted up throughout new york city , apartment owners in midtown manhattan charged yesterday that the board of the city s largest district the grand central partnership violates constitutional guarantees of one person , one vote the lawsuit asserts that the district s board which levies fees on property owners to provide security , sanitation and other services does not adequately represent apartment owners , even though they are assessed fees to help pay for the operations of the partnership , the largest business improvement district in the city the suit questions the very nature of the structure of the business districts , many of which were created by business owners to improve the quality of their neighborhoods representatives of other districts said that if successful , the suit could severely damage the efforts of such districts throughout the city the suit raises difficult issues , both for the court and for those who hope to see more business improvement districts formed as a way to supplement government services at a time of budget cuts many business improvement districts , or bid s , have come to rely on a delicate balance of interests and the sharing of costs between residents and business owners the plaintiffs say that the suit is the first of its kind in challenging the basic structure of the bid s but that similar challenges to special districts have been upheld in court the suit focuses on a fundamental anomaly of the districts that they encompass both residential and commercial property , yet were created largely by business owners , with their interests in mind the suit against the partnership was filed in federal district court in manhattan on behalf of the owners of two fifth avenue cooperatives it said that the 920 people who live in coops or rental apartments within the partnership s boundaries have only one representative on its board , while the area s 200 commercial property owners have 45 seats representation on the board is closely analogous to poll taxes and election structures that excluded nonproperty owners , said the suit , filed by the urban justice center and robert solomon , a law professor at yale who is a member of the university s jerome n frank legal services organization officials of the grand central partnership declined comment on the suit yesterday , saying they had yet to study it but officials of other new york city business improvement districts , which have proliferated in number and in the scope of their activities over the last 10 years , said the suit would cause serious disruption if it succeeded in its demand for far greater representation by neighborhood residents this goes to the heart of what we do , said gretchen dykstra , president of the times square business improvement district as much as we try to be democratic , we ultimately service the interests of business , she said there should always be a residential voice on the board , but i'm not sure it can be tit for tat while the grand central partnership has been praised for many of its efforts , including restoring bryant park , the plaintiffs say they do not necessarily benefit from it we are being assessed for services we do n't need , said vicki cheikes , a lawyer and member of the coop board for 372 fifth avenue , at 35th street , who is one of the two plaintiffs named in the lawsuit she said she and the other plaintiff robert kessler , another resident of the building shared the feelings of most people in her coop that they were being forced to contribute to the district although it was benefiting only business owners annual assessments for coop owners at 372 fifth avenue average 200 , she said in the grand central partnership , as in most other bid s , commercial property owners pay far more depending on the value of their buildings , their assessments almost always are more than 1 , 000 a year and can exceed 1 million the lawyers representing ms cheikes said yesterday that they hope to win greater representation for residents , even in bid s that forgo assessments from apartment owners or where assessments are for a nominal amount assessment rules vary widely in the times square district , for example , apartment owners pay only 1 a year douglas lasdon , executive director of the urban justice center , said the suit resulted from questions raised by his group over the last year as it filed another suit against the grand central partnership in that suit , awaiting trial , the group charges that the partnership illegally hired homeless people at below minimum wage to act as guards in bank automatedtellermachine vestibules it seeks reimbursement of the homeless employees' lost wages but the suit filed yesterday raises more fundamental questions about business improvement districts , both in new york and across the nation , where more than 1 , 000 have been formed , partly in response to cuts in government services mr lasdon said legal precedents would be presented in court , but none that apply directly to the type of business improvement districts that have been formed over the last 15 years in new york city the districts , authorized by state law in 1980 , depend on the city s finance department to collect their assessments those assessment levels require approval by the city council mr lasdon said that past cases before the courts have applied to special improvement districts that were formed to operate sewer districts , provide agricultural assistance and perform other services in cases where the objective of the district was narrow and short term like building a sewage treatment plant he said the courts have allowed unequal board respresentation by business groups but where the objective of the districts was broad and long term , like that of the grand central partnership , he said the courts have held that the principle of one person , one vote must be upheld this is the first case challenging the fundamental structure of bid s , he said with groups across the nation planning new business improvement districts , he said , it is still an expanding concept and the time has come to make our case

william d powers lost his patronage job with the new york state legislature in 1980 for supporting alfonse m d'amato s successful campaign to wrest the republican nomination from the united states senator jacob k javits but landed another post anyway on senator d'amato s payroll a decade later , rejecting mr d'amato s advice but winning his blessing , mr powers captured the state chairmanship of a party that was financially and politically bankrupt both times , mr powers bet against the odds and he won the november election of a republican governor in new york for the first time in 24 years was a personal and political triumph for mr powers , a 52yearold gritty college dropout and former marine who was senator d'amato s director of state operations and also the rensselaer county party chairman for four years since one of the party s worst drubbings in a gubernatorial race , mr powers nurtured the withered grass roots in demoralized town and county republican organizations he helped mr d'amato to get reelected in 1992 and played a less visible but vital role in the 1993 election of rudolph w giuliani as the first republican mayor of new york city in a generation for nearly a year , mr powers saw in george e pataki , a relatively obscure state senator from the hudson valley , the basic ingredients a young , moderate roman catholic from upstate for a successful challenge to mario m cuomo , the democratic incumbent and then he forged a crucial coalition with the conservative party , which in november helped provide mr pataki s winning margin as a result , mr powers is one of the few politicians with close knowledge of both the governor and the mayor , who are now in a position to mend their differences what was the difference between working for mr giuliani and mr pataki \? that one was business , mr powers said of his help in the campaign for mr giuliani , with whom he was not close and on whom he has since soured this one , he said , referring to the pataki race , was personal if mr powers often succeeded because he was perceived to be mr d'amato s surrogate , fellow politicians agree that his own dogged perseverance and political savvy have also contributed to his success bill powers , the senator said , is a yes man to no one when mr powers was elected to the republican chairmanship in january 1991 , he inherited a party that was more than 1 million in debt and could not afford to pay its telephone bill , much less his salary republicans controlled local legislatures in 19 of the state s 62 counties , accounted for 4 of the 16 county executives and none of the mayors among the state s six largest cities last year alone , mr powers said , the republican state committee raised more than 6 million for its candidates more than enough to cover his 120 , 000ayear salary , just shy of the governor s today , republicans dominate local legislatures in 57 counties fourteen county executives and four of the six major mayors in new york state are republicans we raised money nickel by nickel and i went out to instill some pride in local organizations that had taken the licking of their lives , mr powers said i said from the beginning that we would n't win the governorship until we developed a base early last year , when mr d'amato officially ended his public flirtation with running for governor himself , mr powers embraced mr pataki in a primary , the state organization is not supposed to take sides but , mr d'amato remembers , bill never faltered in his belief that george would be the best candidate , and a party chairman should rally support behind the person who he thinks could do the job mr powers s greatgrandfather was a founder of the republican party in nassau county \( two of his three sons are political tacticians , too , and the third is in law school his wife , judith , is a sculptor \) after holding a variety of nonpolitical jobs , including working as a laborer and a railroad trackwalker , he was hired to help in the 1978 republican gubernatorial campaign by perry b duryea , the assembly speaker who , like mr d'amato , knew the powers family from long island mr powers was having dinner with mr d'amato in florida over christmas vacation four years ago when he announced that he wanted to succeed j patrick barrett , an upstate businessman , who was retiring as state chairman mr d'amato advised , do n't i thought it was a deathdefying leap into a millionandahalfdollar hole , the senator said i sensed that there would be no cooperation from whatever little power structure existed in the republican party and , since i was his friend , i would by implication be dragged into an impossible task but people have underestimated bill powers for a long time , mr d'amato said i guess it s that old tradition that comes out of the marines when you have to stand and fight , you do as a group , politicians are much maligned , so it is not surprising that their partisanship when his 1991 cadillac was stolen in albany in 1993 mr powers publicly blamed the liberal , revolvingdoor lenient sentencing policies supported by mario cuomo and his cronies sometimes yields to a baser instinct selfpreservation mr powers s colleagues speak of him with a reverence reserved not only for winners but also for fellow professionals i do n't know that they could have staged the taking of the governorship without al d'amato , said raymond b harding , the liberal party leader who worked with mr powers on the giuliani campaign and against him in the cuomopataki race but as one pol might rate another , i think he would have been generally effective without al d'amato the rev al sharpton , a democrat who had met with mr powers several times in a public flirtation with the republican party , described him as a very frank guy who means what he says and does n't try to placate you he added , he s not the kind of guy who sits down and plays ivorytower politics daniel defrancesco , executive director of new york city s board of elections , whom mr powers bombarded during the mayoral race with complaints of voting irregularities , said of him he was always leveling he s not a backstabber martin s begun , a new york university medical school dean and former democratic district leader in manhattan , said he is the quintessential state chairman and i say that positively sometimes , i wish we had one like that he understands there is a distinction between party office and public office , which the democrats have forgotten , mr begun said at a time when justice department rulings threaten one of the last provinces of politicians choosing judges mr powers has been flooded with more than a thousand resumes for state jobs in the two months since election day but he said he has no intention of joining a pataki administration himself i have no interest in government at all , mr powers said it takes away the fun photo william d powers \( jack manning the new york times \)
the nazi submarine u234 , which surrendered to american forces in may 1945 , was found to be carrying a surprisingly diverse cargo bound for tokyo as part of a secretive exchange of war materiel between hitler and hirohito the payload represented the pride of german technology and included parts and blueprints for proximity fuzes , antiaircraft shells , jet planes and chemical rockets but nothing the u234 concealed in its warrens was more surprising than 10 containers filled with 1 , 200 pounds of uranium oxide , a basic material of atomic bombs up to then , the allies suspected that both nazi germany and imperial japan had nuclear programs but considered them rudimentary and isolated historians have quietly puzzled over that uranium shipment for years , wondering , among other things , what the american military did with it little headway was made because of federal secrecy now , however , a former official of the manhattan project , john lansdale jr , says that the uranium went into the mix of raw materials used for making the world s first atom bombs at the time he was an army lieutenant colonel for intelligence and security for the atom bomb project one of his main jobs was tracking uranium mr lansdale s assertion in an interview raises the possibility that the american weapons that leveled the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki contained at least some nuclear material originally destined for japan s own atomic program and , perhaps , for attacks on the united states if confirmed , that twist of history could add a layer to the already complex debate over whether the united states had any moral justification for using its atom bombs against japan a pivotal question that surrounds the episode is whether the three months between the u234 s surrender in may 1945 and the dropping of the american bombs in august 1945 left the manhattan project s bomb builders enough time to incorporate the captured uranium another is whether president harry s truman , who authorized the atomic bombing of japan , knew of the u234 s radioactive cargo at least a dozen historians , journalists and nuclear experts around the world are now at work on this and related mysteries surrounding the u234 , going through newly declassified documents and interviewing aging former members of the german and japanese militaries and participants in the manhattan project there s no question they were hurting for uranium , dr stanley goldberg , a science historian in washington who is writing a book on the manhattan project , said of the american bomb venture they scraped the bottom of the barrel they came to within an inch of not having enough material for a uranium bomb as to whether the weapons used any of the u234 s uranium , dr goldberg , like several historians and nuclear experts , said in an interview that he was unconvinced but intrigued even if none of the submarine s cargo went into the explosive mix , some experts hold , the u234 episode is important to explore for what it reveals about the japanese atom bomb program , which has long been clouded in ambiguity dr peter d zimmerman , a physicist who has studied the issue and advises the defense department , said , where it becomes very significant is if it helps demonstrate that the japanese had a sizable program and that there was close cooperation among the axis powers the u234 left the german port of kiel on march 25 , 1945 , bound for japan on a voyage around the horn of africa after hitler s death a month later , the submarine surrendered to american forces in the north atlantic and was taken to the american submarine base at portsmouth , nh , where reporters watched its arrival on may 19 , 1945 in secret , the navy took careful inventory of the submarine s crew and cargo , recording the details in an exhaustive manifest that today is in a public file at the navy s operational archives at its historical center in washington the manifest says that the uranium came in 10 cases , weighed 560 kilograms and was transported from germany as an oxide , which is a handy industrial form refined from raw uranium ore kathy lloyd , an archivist at the center , said in an interview that the navy had no paper trail on where the shipment went after the inventory dr zimmerman said that amount of uranium oxide would have contained about 35 kilograms of the isotope u235 , which is the critical one for making bombs that 35 kilograms , he added , would have been about a fifth of the total u235 needed to make one bomb among the experts who have tried to track the mysterious shipment is robert k wilcox , a journalist and author of japan s secret war \( marlowe company \) , a book about tokyo s atom bomb project after its publication in 1985 , he updated the book for a 1995 edition coincident with the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of japan but mr wilcox drew a blank after inspections of hundreds of documents in the national archives , the repository of papers from the manhattan project what happened to the uranium \? he asked in the book s 1995 edition it s as if the incident had never occurred , as if u234 , its important passengers and cargo had never arrived other experts have drawn similar blanks and concluded that the true story lies hidden in the government s secret files but mr lansdale , the former official of the manhattan project , displayed no doubts in the interview about the fate of the u234 s shipment it went to the manhattan district , he said without hesitation it certainly went into the manhattan district supply of uranium mr lansdale added that he remembered no details of the uranium s destination in the sprawling bombmaking complex and had no opinion on whether it helped make up the material for the first atomic bomb used in war in theory , the uranium might have helped fuel the uranium bomb that leveled hiroshima or the plutonium bomb that was dropped on nagasaki in a kind of modern alchemy , plutonium is made by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor , turning it from one element into another dr vilma r hunt , a nuclear expert working on a book about uranium used in the war , has researched the fate of the u234 s shipment for years she said she had concluded that it went into the manhattan project s mix , not based on any positive evidence she had been able to unearth but simply because of the project s great need for weapons material at that time , there was a limited amount of uranium oxide available , she said in an interview we needed it based on the comments of mr lansdale , she added you could go as far as saying it was in the stream and would have had a high likelihood that it went into one of the first three bombs that would have been pushing the system , but that s what they were doing the world s first atomic bomb was detonated in the new mexico desert on july 16 , 1945 , as a test hiroshima was bombed on aug 6 and nagasaki on aug 9 dr skip gosling is chief historian of the federal department of energy , which is the successor agency to the manhattan project and the federal government s authority on making nuclear arms in an interview , he said he had long heard rumors that the u234 s shipment ended up at oak ridge , tenn , where the manhattan project treated uranium to increase its concentration of the critical u235 isotope but he added that he knew of no documentary evidence that bore on the issue and said it would be hard to find such information half a century after the fact my guess is that none of it got in the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima , he said but i would n't bet my farm on that
the killing of robert f kennedy an investigation of motive , means and opportunity by dan e moldea illustrated 342 pages w w norton 2750 of the three major political assassinations in the united states in the 1960 s , that of senator robert f kennedy , in los angeles at 12 15 am on june 5 , 1968 , seems the least likely to have involved some sort of clandestine conspiracy unlike the killing of president john f kennedy five years earlier and of the rev dr martin luther king jr on april 4 , 1968 , the shooting of senator kennedy occurred at close quarters in a confined space before the eyes of a multitude of witnesses yet as dan e moldea , an investigative journalist , makes clear in his carefully reasoned and ultimately persuasive new book , the killing of robert f kennedy an investigation of motive , means and opportunity , the evidence against a single assassin was stronger in this case than in either of the other two as mr moldea sums up the contradictory evidence , there was the woman in the polkadot dress and her male companion who were reported by two separate witnesses to have hurried out of the ambassador hotel shortly after senator kennedy s death , saying gleefully we shot him ! we shot him ! of greater significance to the author were the powder burns on kennedy s skin and clothes , which could have resulted only from a gunshot fired inches away , and the contradictory fact that none of the many witnesses saw sirhan bishara sirhan , later convicted as the lone assassin , shoot from closer than several feet finally , many reports of bullet holes in the walls of the pantry in which kennedy was shot suggested that more bullets were fired than mr sirhan s eightchamber 22caliber pistol would have allowed to add to the confusion , police experts disagreed with one another , evidence disappeared mysteriously and in the eyes of its critics at least , the los angeles police department looked as if it was engaged in some sort of coverup only one conclusion would resolve the apparent conflicts and puzzles , and that , as mr moldea reports it , would be the existence of a second gunman in reporting his investigation , mr moldea begins by reconstructing the assassination from various pivotal points of view this section comes across as barely organized chaos , with too many characters and too much happening , which of course was part of the reason the police had such difficulty trying to control of events the author then meticulously dissects how the various disputes arose and how critics were drawn into the orbit of the case finally , he describes his own involvement , beginning in the summer of 1985 he says he was a mob reporter who had written the hoffa wars teamsters , rebels , politicians and the mob , among other books , and was approached by people who were trying to have the investigation reopened and wanted him working on it too he reports that he ended up interviewing dozens of people involved in the case who had never been questioned before , many of them members of the various investigating teams he even befriended the man suspected of being the second gunman and arranged for him to take a liedetector test finally , he talked at length to mr sirhan himself what is curious about mr moldea s dramatic account is that it brings the points of dispute into sharper focus , leading the reader to believe that the author is on the verge of a major discovery for instance , mr moldea talks with and seems to believe police officials and members of the federal bureau of investigation who insist that bullets were removed from the wood panel next to the pantry doorway , which would prove that more than eight shots were fired yet at the same time he somehow leaves you with the faint suspicion that these witnesses are only repeating hearsay one naturally hesitates to withhold mr moldea s conclusion , which is ultimately consistent with the evidence he turns up yet comes as a bit of a surprise to treat such a momentous subject as if it were entertainment seems in questionable taste on the other hand , to sum up the book s conclusions out of context would provide an excuse for strong partisans to reject what the author has to say the cleverness of his strategy in the book lies in his playing so effectively the part of devil s advocate some readers will be unhappy with the killing of robert f kennedy and will dismiss its conclusion as a cavein , which will not be entirely unfair considering the suddenness with which mr moldea arrives at what he finally thinks yet his book should be read , not so much for the irrefutability of its conclusions as for the way the author has brought order out of a chaotic tale and turned an appalling tatter of history into an emblem of our misshapen times photo dan e moldea \( amy toensing for the new york times \)
ashiya , japan , jan 24 to prowl the wealthy neighborhoods here in the beverly hills of japan , where 5 million ranchstyle homes peek from behind stone walls , is to see that it was not just luck that determined who lived and who died in the devastating earthquake last week money also played a role while nature was democratic , in that the tremblor rattled rich neighborhoods as well as poor ones , its consequences were not frequently , it was the poorer people s homes that collapsed and buried them in rubble some wealthy people were among the 5 , 063 dead counted so far , of course , but disproportionately it was the poor and elderly who lost their homes , jobs and lives this week , many poor families are arranging funerals and many rich ones are arranging vacations the earthquake zone includes some of the wealthiest parts of japan , and this city is famous as a playground of the rich nestled on the edge of the port city of kobe , ashiya was the setting for the novel the makioka sisters , junichiro tanizaki s portrayal of the life of a rich family in the 1930 s if the makioka sisters were around today , they probably would have come through the earthquake all right , just as the honda family did dr minoru honda and his wife , yoriko , live in a spectacular twostory wooden house with a huge garden and duck pond by and large , the damage to the house is manageable a shattered beam that they have already found someone to fix , a broken sauna , a toppled bookshelf and an overturned aquarium that left seven tropical fish gasping in a puddle on the hardwood floor dr honda , an amiable surgeon who rushed to a hospital after the quake and worked for two days without sleeping to treat the injured , further remedied things today by going out and buying a motorcycle to get around the terrible traffic jams those things are useless now , he said , pointing to his porsche carrera and mercedesbenz cars mrs honda served coffee in her dining room , offering it in german cups and saucers to replace the french ones that had shattered , and noted that some wealthy people had died in the quake she told of a friend , a businessman who had been killed in his home along with his 25yearold son , when their roof caved in on them but after the quake , it s different for rich people , she added the rich have relatives with extra rooms , so they have somewhere to go if they need to and if they 've got money , they can buy anything they need at the time of the earthquake , we had lots of food in the refrigerator , and lots of toilet paper , so we were n't in such a bad way , mrs honda added in our houses , we have extra things , so we 're ok wealthy families like the hondas seem full of compassion for their less fortunate neighbors in the shelters , and there seems to be relatively little resentment among the homeless that so many rich people came through unscathed the chasm between rich and poor in japan is narrower than in many societies , and 80 percent of japanese identify themselves as members of the middle class yet income gaps exist , and they are reflected in the homes people live in while buildings of all kinds collapsed , by far the greatest number were old traditional japanese wooden houses with heavy tile roofs everywhere in the quake zone , it is common to see a pile of rafters that is all that remains of a traditional wooden house , while a modern concrete building stands intact next door highrises were scarcely affected , while twostory wooden homes many of which have now compressed into onestory houses were perhaps at greatest risk poor people , and especially , the elderly , were most likely to live in these old wooden houses the wealthy were more likely to have built newer homes and to spend more money on betterquality construction the affluent also tended to have larger rooms and often slept on beds poorer people slept on futons on the floor of tiny rooms , so that a falling wardrobe was almost sure to hit them there has been no study comparing incomes with mortality rates in the earthquake , but the yomiuri shimbun , a japanese daily , did examine the ages of the victims it found that more than half were over the age of 60 , presumably because they were in more fragile health and also because they often lived in old wooden homes in shelters for victims of the quake , the homeless often speak in workingclass japanese and seem overwhelmingly less educated and less affluent than the population at large while wealthy people were sometimes forced to stay in shelters for the first night or two , they have since fled to osaka or other cities to stay in hotels or with friends and relatives the rich have good houses , but we 're ordinary people , explained setsuko kawahigashi , a 54yearold snackshop owner living in a shelter in ashiya lots of the rich folks had second houses , so they moved into those and some of the rich have already bought new apartments i heard of somebody who bought a new apartment on the day after the earthquake they 've already moved in , and they 've got running water there and everything mrs kawahigashi said she has some savings and a pension , but not enough money to rebuild her home a 50yearold wooden house or her small shop , which was also badly damaged she is also unsure what furniture she can recover from her house , which collapsed around her and buried her for two and a half hours although she finally burrowed through a wall and escaped , mrs kawahigashi is worried about her maltese terrier , who is now trapped inside the house every day mrs kawahigash goes to the wreck of her house and throws food inside for her dog , but it has been two days since she heard it bark or make any other sound a few minutes' drive by mercedesbenz from mrs kawahigashi s collapsed house , tomiko kubo is straightening up the mess in her hilltop mansion a friendly 77yearold woman wearing a mink coat against the chill , she has made some headway we lost some very nice porcelain , beautiful antiques , mrs kubo said but everybody s fine , and that s the important thing it s very different for those down there what a tragedy her 23yearold grandson , gohsuke kubo , explained the difference this house is built on rock , while down there the houses are old cheap wooden buildings constructed right after world war ii still , the entire neighborhood is putting up with the inconvenience of no running water or gas supply , so most residents in the multimilliondollar homes have fled to osaka or other places among our close friends , none were killed or injured , mr kubo said but nobody lives around here now it s like a ghost town photo partly because their houses are more solidly constructed , wealthy people generally fared better than the poor in the earthquake that devastated parts of western japan last week yuriko honda , 46 , who lives in a big house with a duck pond in affluent ashiya , said her sauna was broken , a beam was shattered and an aquarium and a bookshelf overturned we were n't in such a bad way , she said \( dennis gray for the new york times \) map shows the location of ashiya , japan

washington , dec 31 in the latest of an escalating series of confrontations with china over trade , the clinton administration threatened today to impose retaliatory tariffs against 28 billion of chinese exports to the united states unless beijing cracked down immediately on rampant pirating of american music , movies and computer software the move came after an endoftheyear deadline ran out on negotiations with the chinese government , which has refused to close down 29 factories in southern china that churn out 70 million compact disks and other illegally copied products every year , at a cost to american industry that the administration estimates at 1 billion in sales american businesses are especially concerned by chinese exports of these illegal products to other countries in asia if any sanctions ultimately take effect , they may hurt a variety of chinese industries including some staterun factories closely linked to government leaders and their families but they could also cost american consumers if the sanctions go into effect on feb 4 , at the end of a statutory deadline , the prices of items ranging from chinesemade consumer electronics to toys and clothing will go up we have to send an unambiguous message to beijing , said mickey kantor , the united states trade representative , who has demanded that the chinese government create strike forces to close down the factories by the year 2010 china could be the secondlargest economy in the world , and now is not the time to let them continue to act as they have in the past they have too much impact on the world economy unless the pirating issue is resolved , he said , the united states will continue to block china s effort to join the world trade organization , the new international rulemaker and arbiter of trade , which comes into existence on new year s day in the past , retaliatory threats like the one made today have often proved effective at forcing concessions from china and japan in a variety of disputes but the record has been mixed two years ago , the united states threatened similar sanctions against china on the same issue , but backed off when beijing agreed to pass laws to prevent the illegal copying of foreign products but none of those laws have been enforced in the case of textiles , however , a similar threat from washington accomplished the american goal of resolving a trade dispute the administration s recent collisions with china extend beyond the immediate arguments over products like the videotape of the lion king , which was illegally copied and distributed in china even though it has not been released in the united states they raise the question of whether president clinton s decision in may to reverse american policy toward china , renewing its trade benefits without regard to its treatment of political dissidents , is improving either trade relations or human rights the united states' huge trade deficit with china continues to grow , and repression of chinese dissidents has continued in an angry response just an hour or so after mr kantor s announcement , the chinese government threatened to meet any sanctions with retaliation of its own , including a suspension of talks on joint ventures with the big american automobile manufacturers china will have no other choice than to take the counterretaliatory measures against the trade retaliatory measures of the united states , the official new china news agency said , quoting from an announcement by the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation it also threatened to hold up applications of american companies and their subsidiaries to set up holding companies in china , implicitly suggesting that it would give an edge to companies from japan and other countries that are racing into the chinese market despite their heated reaction , mr kantor said chinese authorities also delivered a letter to the american embassy in beijing this morning offering some criteria for further negotiations but he said that the document had not been translated yet and he noted that eight previous negotiations on the subject had been fruitless mr kantor acted under what is known as the special 301 provisions of the 1974 trade act , which covers intellectual property the law requires that after an investigation , which can last up to six months , the trade representative must make an initial determination of whether a country s trade practices are unreasonable mr kantor formally announced that decision today and published a list of products that will be the subject of retaliation that starts a 30day period for american companies to comment on the list , and to argue as many have done when similar action was taken against japan that the sanctions will raise the price of foreign components , and ultimately raise prices for american consumers although mr kantor published a list of 28 billion of goods that could be subject to retaliation , the final list will likely be pared to something closer to 1 billion
washington , july 18 house republicans took the unusual step today of using a spending bill to make policy , approving an appropriations measure that would revoke or substantially restrict nearly 20 environmental laws that have become anathema to big business the action was but one skirmish in a multifront budget battle in the house of representatives and in committee , as house republicans worked furiously to finish their 13 appropriations bills before the scheduled august recess but whatever final legislation emerges from the house , its decisions on the series of bills that provide financing for government agencies are likely to be mediated by the much more moderate republican majority in the senate ample evidence of that was seen today when senator mark o hatfield of oregon , chairman of the budget committee , released the budget limits for the senate appropriations subcommittees the senate plan included the same bottom line in budget authority as the house , 489161 billion , but differed significantly on how to spend that sum mr hatfield would allocate 16 billion more for labor , health and human services and education programs than the 61 billion that the house allowed he would give 16 billion more to water and energy development , a traditional haven for legislators' pet projects or pork barrel spending , than the house s figure of 187 billion mr hatfield also cut deeper into spending for a halfdozen departments , including defense , 14 billion commerce , 13 billion , and transportation , 200 million , than the house even as the house appropriations committee moved to rein in some environmental laws that big business has complained about most , the senate balked at passing regulatory changes that big business has also championed , causing the majority leader , bob dole , to pull the bill off the floor the house committee , voting along party lines , approved a 617 billion allocation for veterans , housing , environmental and other programs for 1996 , but included language that would withhold money for enforcement of statutes like the clean air and clean water acts until congress had decided on reauthorizing them as the appropriations committee worked , the full house ended its debate and voted on an 1196 billion allocation for the interior department that bill , which passed 244 to 181 , includes legislation that would reduce federal financing next year by 40 percent for the national endowments for the arts and the humanities and would halt all financing to the arts agency in two years that vote was followed immediately by the opening of a floor debate on the appropriations for the treasury department , the postal service and other agencies that 232 billion measure is 3227 million less than in 1995 and 18 billion less than the administration had requested there are 41 million in cuts from the executive office , including all money for a major advisory group , the council of economic advisors , and the bill prohibits federal employee healthinsurance plans from covering abortions , except when a mother s life is at risk before the house quits for the week on friday , it is also scheduled to debate three other appropriations bills , for the agriculture department , for the transportation departments and for the commerce , justice and state departments , as well as for the judiciary the bill on veterans , housing and environmental programs , which the committee approved today in a partyline vote , was one of the sparest appropriations bills to gain favor although the national aeronautics and space administration budget sailed through virtually unscathed at 1367 billion , 705 million less than its budget request , the bill overall cut discretionary spending by 83 billion from the 1995 allocation the major cuts are from the environmental protection agency , which would receive 488 billion , 33 percent or 24 billion less than its current budget , and from the department of housing and urban development , which was allocated 191 billion , a 23 percent or 55 billion reduction it is certainly the case that many of the agencies in this bill are unhappy , said representative jerry lewis , republican of california and chairman of the subcommittee on the veterans affairs department , housing and urban development and independent agencies but the house appropriations committee is clearly prepared to draw a line on spending the bill would close four agencies , for savings of 723 million , the subcommittee s part of the national service program , known as americorp the community development financial institutions , the chemical safety and hazards investigation board and the council on environmental quality the bill also has 17 riders or side language about the epa , which democrats complained went beyond the appropriations committee s traditional powers and intruded into realms usually reserved for authorizing committees the bill would allocate 15 billion for the water programs , but it has a rider that none of the money would be available unless congress reauthorizes the clean water act another rider would exempt states from having to start centralized vehicleemissions tests the effect of this bill is that people in communities across this country will suffer , the epa administrator , carol browner , said in a telephone interview my ability to make sure that the quality of air that people breath and the water that they drink is good will be in question
the sheer insensitivity of getting a typewritten letter from the state commission on the blind bothered joeann jackson almost as much as the bad news it contained ms jackson , 33 , who is blind and deaf as a result of sickle cell anemia , considers herself relatively independent she maneuvers her way around manhattan using a cane , and wearing a sign that asks for help crossing streets she talks on the phone using a teletype machine hooked up to a braille translator she communicates with her son by sign language that he speaks into her palms one thing she clearly cannot do is read a typewritten letter , like the one the state sent her six months ago to tell her that she was losing her state assistance it was only when ms jackson called the state to request repairs to her braille machine , her link to the world , that she learned she was no longer a state client it was like throwing ice water in my face , she said in an interview using her braille machine at her sparsely furnished east 14th street apartment like ms jackson , other deafblind people , their relatives , and even some of their social workers say they consider the state social service bureaucracy insensitive and often unhelpful to the deafblind they say that deafblind people often find themselves caught between two state agencies , one for the deaf and the other for the blind , and that neither agency has mastered what it takes to help people with both disabilities they tell of waiting one to three years to get even the most basic equipment and services , like a walking cane , transportation to a job , or training on how to get around their neighborhood social workers and disability specialists say the deafblind often fall between the cracks of the state system because their numbers are relatively small and they often literally cannot voice their complaints the state commission for the blind has been particularly slow to adjust to their needs , they say until recently , none of the counselors for the deafblind clients even spoke sign language which can be spoken into a hand the commission for the blind , a division of the state department of social services , serves about 100 deafblind people in new york city , a total of 450 deafblind clients throughout the state in addition to rehabilitation and vocational training , the commission also provides mobility and communications equipment to the deafblind daniel callahan , the state commission for the blind s regional director in new york city , would not comment on specific cases , but defended his agency s work with the deafblind there have been some pretty dramatic improvements in services for the deafblind in the last two years , he said maybe we 're not moving fast enough , but we 're moving in the right direction joe cioffi , a rehabilitation specialist for the deafblind who has worked for the commission for 14 years , said he had become increasingly frustrated by what he sees as the agency s cavalier attitude toward his clients a problem he never encounters in new jersey , he added the deafblind are the easiest group to sweep under the rug because they ca n't just pick up the phone and complain , and to a large extent they live in total social isolation , he said harvey kwitkin , for example , has been waiting for a year and a half to get van service so he can rejoin the labor force the 59yearold deaf man suffers from usher s syndrome , a congenital disease that causes about 6 percent of the deaf population to go blind gradually people suffering from usher s syndrome , which has no cure , account for about half of the deafblind population in new york other major causes of deafblindness include rubella and diabetes until his eyesight started to fail , mr kwitkin worked for a long island pharmaceutical company for nearly 30 years , filling packages and stuffing envelopes mr kwitkin continues to ride the subway on a familiar route from his manhattan apartment to his barber in brooklyn , but he has accepted his need for special transportation to get to a new job , said mr kwitkin s brother , beryl we worry about his traveling on his own all the time , but to tell him to stop would decrease his independence , and that s all he s got , beryl kwitkin said we 're not asking for more than he s entitled to he just wants to be able to work again harris hand , who also has usher s syndrome , first sought help from the commission in the summer of 1993 when he realized he could no longer safely get from his apartment in coop city in the

ann arbor , mich , nov 25 this was a throwback game if there ever was one ohio state and michigan battling , scratching , clawing , bullying and scrapping for the 92d time they have been doing this since 1897 , you know back then , way back then , the running game was the thing over the years , that is the way this game has evolved forget the fancy forward pass you run in this game , in this rivalry second to none in college football , and you win and , boy , did michigan run the football in this game and in the process , it ran ohio state right out of its bid for a perfect season , the big ten championship and the rose bowl michigan looked like a throwback to some of its best teams this afternoon at michigan stadium , not the 83 edition that entered here it ran , ran and ran some more , off tackle and around the end and on counter plays and traps and any other run it could think of most of the time it worked for 385 yards rushing in total and that beat the buckeyes , 3123 , in an upset that really was n't an upset just ask anybody at michigan or ohio state , for that matter and ask fans at northwestern how they felt about this delicious game that left michigan 93 and ohio state with its first loss in a season in which it had won its first 11 games and had climbed to no 2 in the associated press and usa today cnn polls and no 3 in the new york times computer ranking now , northwestern goes to the rose bowl for the first time since 1949 , and ohio state will likely go to the citrus bowl for the second year in a row michigan , which was ranked 18th by the associated press , 20th in the usa today cnn poll and which was n't even in the times ranking , is either headed to the outback or alamo bowl what a sad day for john cooper , the ohio state head coach , who did everything right this season and then on this day , once again , suffered miserably he is 261 versus michigan and he knows this feeling he has lost all four games he has coached at this stadium two years ago , the buckeyes were 901 and ranked fifth , but the wolverines beat them by 280 and wisconsin went to the rose bowl now this i do n't know if i 've ever been so disappointed in my life , cooper said we wanted desperately to go all of the way they beat us up front mercilessly what a glorious day for lloyd carr , the new michigan coach , who won his first time around in this battle that always ends the regular season for both teams we did n't win the big ten championship , but this is great , carr said i do n't think anybody in the country thought we had a chance we talked about believing that we did and now they have something they can savor for the rest of their lives i do n't know how i could ever have a win bigger than this one their kids said we were n't very good you talk about someone with the tradition we 've had here and then you have to come into their stadium i do n't know if it helped us prepare , but it certainly did n't hurt us it was buckeye receiver terry glenn who said michigan was n't what it used to be it was michigan tailback tim biakabutuka who set about proving him wrong carr said his star back had told him during the week not to worry , that on this day he would show the nation who the best back in the big ten was it was supposed to be eddie george , the highstepping , highpowered buckeye who was a leading heisman trophy candidate not today george gained 104 rushing yards and 1 touchdown and caught 5 passes for 50 yards biakabutuka , churning , spinning , and punishing people all afternoon , rushed for a careerhigh 313 yards that helped him earn the singleseason rushing record at michigan \( 1 , 724 , beating the jamie morris mark of 1 , 703 set in 1987 \) biakabutuka was sensational on nearly all of his 37 rushing attempts , obviously inspired by the presence of george his offensive line tackles jon runyan and jon jansen , guards zach adami and joe marinaro and center rod payne showed flexibility , poise , courage , intelligence and domination , paving the way for one of the biggest victories in michigan football history on the very first run play , marinaro said , i knew we were going to be able to move the ball they do n't like to get their linebackers hit they like for them to be free to make plays on that first run , we handled the line and got to the linebackers and sealed them off i knew it then they were in trouble a lot of what we were running was supposed to be offtackle plays tim was just cutting them back and going with what he found he had an eye today , as well as the footwork and the other stuff the ninthlargest crowd in stadium history \( 106 , 288 \) watched as michigan built a 109 lead at halftime and then in the third quarter matched ohio state touchdown for touchdown \( quarterback brian griese s 2yard run with 10 minutes 52 seconds left and george s 1yard dive with 1 14 left \) that made it 1715 entering the final quarter once there , michigan s clarence williams ran wide left on a pitch for an 8yard score and biakabutuka added a 2yard scoring run that put michigan up by 3115 bobby hoying tossed a 19yard scoring strike to split end buster tillman , and that helped set up the finish buckeyes with the ball with 48 seconds left at the michigan 34 fourthand10 hoying was intercepted by cornerback charles woodson , who leaped high and took the ball away from glenn in deion sanderslike fashion game over the ohio state fans stood in their corner endzone seats long after this game was over simply staring ahead , stunned they watched as the roses they had longed for wilted on this storied field photo running back eddie george \( 27 \) being consoled by leshun daniels after ohio state lost to michigan yesterday \( associated press \) michigan tailback

on saturday night , at the brooklyn intersection she crossed on her way home every evening after twilight , rachel neufeld went down under the right front wheel of a city bus and was crushed to death she was 70 years old , and a woman unknown in a city where fame and riches are the ordinary measure of a life the details of the accident at avenue j and bay parkway in midwood were hazy and under investigation , the police and the transit authority said , though the driver was on probation for reasons that were unclear yesterday , so no one was able to say precisely how or why mrs neufeld had been killed but after her funeral at a jewish chapel in borough park yesterday , as her family sat shiva at her apartment at 1134 east second street , two blocks from the accident scene , her sister , anna klein , choked back tears and said some of the things that needed to be said about a small graceful woman of the 20th century she was an intelligent , courageous woman , mrs klein said , and had come halfway around the world since the 1920 s from their village in czechoslovakia it was a journey that had taken her to the nazi death camp at auschwitz , where she lost everyone but her sister , to bremerhaven where she made german bombs in a cavern while allied bombs shook the earth , to a saxony woods where she ate grass and leaves and waited for liberation , to postwar transit camps in budapest and vienna , to jerusalem and finally to new york she had survived the holocaust , married , given birth to a son and daughter she had worked at job after job sweatshops , day care centers , kitchens and offices to send her children to college , to see them settled , one as a banker and the other as a school principal and she had somehow retained her faith and an appreciation for the world at her fingertips we walked together on ocean parkway it was shabbat , mrs klein said of her last day with her sister it was cloudy i like this kind of day but she said , 'oh , what a lot of lovely flowers' i am very cynical about flowers none of them are related to me she was angry with me 'you do n't have a sense of beauty , ' she said she enjoyed every leaf , every blade of grass and now , she added , the accents of her east european childhood still husky in her throat , i am devastated i do n't know where to put myself , or how i will get up in the morning she was born rachel zhwartz on feb 3 , 1925 , in what was then known as sevlus , a town of 14 , 000 including 4 , 000 jews in southwest czechoslovakia she had an older sister , gabriella , who had been born in 1922 her younger sister , anna , was born in 1926 their family had been in the wine business for many years and the three sisters lived in a big house on the main street with their mother , ilona , and father , martin , who was secretary to the jewish community mrs klein remembered the day the nazis arrived march 19 , 1944 there was no time to hide , she said they came in with their tanks there was no time they had guns and we were taken away they took all the jews in town and put us into a ghetto in the poorest part of town we had nothing but the clothes on our backs we were in a room with 32 people packed on the floor , and we were kept there for two months until may then they took us to auschwitz in a railroad train , in cattle cars it was horrible it was the three of us and our parents and , by then , my sister , gabriella , had a baby 13 months old when they arrived at the infamous arch , arbeit macht frei \( work makes you free \) , rachel and anna were separated from the other members of the family we , the two of us , were sent to the shaving of the hair , and then to the barracks , mrs klein said we never saw our family again she remembered the torments in the barracks the terrible conditions , the forced labor and the waiting the only consolation was that the sisters , anna and rachel , were together we were waiting for our turn , she said , but our time did n't come they demanded labor and we were chosen in august , in an extraordinary reprieve apparently made possible by the nazis' need for slave labor in the production of war materiel , mrs klein said she and rachel were sent to northern germany , to a cavernous underground plant near bremerhaven , where they helped construct bombs for the luftwaffe she told of terrifying days and nights working on bombs while the earth shook from explosions as allied bombers roared overhead but we were together , she said rachel and i kept together like two fallen birds through autumn , winter and into the spring of 1945 , the allied bombing grew heavier then april arrived two days before the end , there were 40 percent casualties , she said the germans took us out then from where we worked they wanted us as security when the liberators came but it never worked out they got scared and ran we were left in the middle of the woods we ate grass and finally the britsh came and took us out after the war , they wanted to go to israel , but found themselves in the limbo of a transit camp in budapest , where they both stayed for four years and were married rachel in 1946 to zev neufeld , a hungarian 20 years her senior , who had lost his first wife and a daughter at auschwitz , and anna in 1948 to samuel klein the two couples were inseparable and in 1949 they went to live in the newly independent state of israel , settling in jerusalem

washington , oct 19 house republicans took a giant step today toward dismantling decades of democratic social policy , passing legislation to curb medicare spending and encourage the elderly to turn to private managedcare organizations from the traditional government plan that has served them since 1965 the vote was 231 to 201 , as 4 democrats joined 227 republicans in favor of the bill , while 6 republicans , 194 democrats and 1 independent voted against it speaker newt gingrich , appearing weary after hours of hard bargaining , closed the debate before the vote by saying we want to solve problems for all americans we want no racial division we want no class warfare we want no conflict between generations he added , we want a solution to preserve and protect medicare but president clinton renewed his threat to veto the measure , which will become part of the massive budget reconciliation bill going to the floor next week he told a news conference that the bill amounted to a 270 billion cut in medicare that will eviscerate the health system for our older americans addressing his remarks to house republicans , he declared i will not let you destroy medicare i will veto this bill with the senate expected to adopt a similar measure , the stage will be set for a definitive political clash over the size , shape and purpose of federal spending , with mr clinton and the republicans each blaming the other for risking a government shutdown or a default on bonds the argument on the house floor was less a debate than an exercise in serial speech making , with each side having a few carefully scripted points , made over and over again democrats complained about tax cuts and increases in medicare premiums republicans said their bill would keep the system from going bankrupt when representatives actually responded to each other s remarks , it was usually to offer flat contradiction or insult accusing democrats of medagoguery , representative porter j goss , republican of florida , said , we 're going to pass this bill because we want to save medicare representative pat williams , democrat of montana , said they are gutting medicare today , medicare tomorrow , social security , programs they have always opposed and oppose today representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , said the bill changed the meaning of gop , from grand old party to get old people there is only one reason this bill is required to finance tax cuts for the rich , said representative john d dingell , democrat of michigan , who waved the gavel he used to preside over the house when it passed the original medicare legislation in april 1965 representative martin r hoke , republican of ohio , said democrats offered nothing more than another in a long line of bandaid solutions representative tom delay , republican of texas , the majority whip , called the democratic alternative a joke wrapped in fraud and shrouded by farce although none of new york s 14 republicans voted against the bill , several of its provisions alarm new york health officials they are concerned that its spending curbs will hit urban hospitals with particular severity because many depend on a variety of federal subsidies that the bill would reduce or eliminate there is particular concern in academic medical centers and hospitals that depend on large numbers of foreigntrained residents , because the bill appears to reduce reimbursements for them the democrats proposed cutting only 90 billion from the program over seven years , or as much as they said was really needed if a 245 billion tax cut plan were not part of the republican program the democratic proposal was defeated , 283 to 149 many democrats , including representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the minority leader , opposed even those cuts mr gephardt s aides said he did not want to cut medicare at all until the republican tax cut proposal had been abandoned the senate finance committee approved it today the republican medicare bill , closely similar to one the senate is expected to adopt as part of budget reconciliation later this month , would reduce allowances in the future for inflation in medicare expenditures for hospitals , doctors and other health care providers according to the congressional budget office , more than half of the 270 billion would come in that way its most innovative section would encourage the elderly to get their health care through health maintenance organizations or other plans with a specific list of providers under the general rubric of managed care these plans , called medicareplus , would have to provide at least as much in benefits as the traditional feeforservice system did one element would be medical savings accounts , with which individuals would make taxfree deposits to cover expenses , deductibles on insurance policies , copayments and some items that medicare does not cover , like prescription drugs though republicans touted these innovations , the congressional budget office found that only 13 percent of the bill s savings would come from encouraging the elderly to move into managed care another 20 percent would come from increases in the monthly premiums medicare beneficiaries pay for doctor care

melbourne , australia , jan 25 the clothes are straight from skateboard heaven , but the goatee adds a satanic touch the earrings and bandana have given him pirate power , and so far all five of andre agassi s australian open opponents have walked the plank at the briskest possible pace here in australia , where they are short on ozone , agassi is in the zone the master of contradictions , the superstar who is wearing the jolly roger as this season s corporate logo , is making no bones about that it s my first time playing down here , and i'm coming out there firing on all cylinders , agassi said after a 62 , 75 , 60 extermination of 10thseeded yevgeny kafelnikov andre is really on fire , said kafelnikov his ground strokes are unbelievable he just shows you how weak you are , how stupid you look on the court when you 're playing against him aaron krickstein was almost as formidable in a 76 \( 73 \) , 64 , 57 , 64 dismissal of jacco eltingh tonight with the victory , krickstein joined agassi , pete sampras and michael chang in the first allamerican cast of grand slam semifinalists since the 1979 united states open after upsetting sixthseeded stefan edberg , krickstein was undaunted by the prospect of upsetting another netminded player , in this instance the 24thranked eltingh of the netherlands the 45thranked krickstein not only dominated from the baseline , he also served 19 aces in their 2hour34minute match krickstein said his three previous hardcourt victories against agassi , his occasional practice partner and now his semifinal opponent , might lighten the load of facing a player he says is hitting the ball extremely well from the ground , better than anyone else in the world at the present time in the fourth round , agassi made the local glamour boy , patrick rafter , look silly on the stadium court rafter could n't think of any other way to describe the humiliation of a 60 third set today in the quarterfinals , agassi delivered precisely the same parting shot to kafelnikov , and provoked the same awed response no chance , no chance , no chance , kafelnikov chanted about the possibility that any other player except the topranked sampras , who today lost his spot as the oddsmakers' favorite to agassi , could prove a sufficient obstacle to the las vegan agassi was reverential regarding the defending champion s tearful comeback from a twosetstonone quarterfinal deficit against jim courier it s an extraordinary thing to see what pete has managed to do , agassi said of sampras s consecutive comebacks from two sets down , the second of which took almost four hours and provoked the world s no 1 player to cry openly during the fifth set because he was overcome by worry over his ailing coach , tim gullikson just to have him still be in the tournament , it s inspiring , agassi said he s obviously going through a lot of things at the moment with tim , and i can identify with that today agassi identified with the task at hand , needing just 83 minutes to stun the 20yearold russian into submission with a knockout combination of steady serves and blistering angled ground strokes by the third set kafelnikov was so tired of being jerked around the sunny stadium he surrendered the final set in 19 minutes after being the evening headliner for the majority of the previous rounds , agassi blithely used this daylight outing to be out there in the sun and get a little bit of a tan quite honestly , this has been incredible practice more than anything , said agassi , who has yet to be tested to play three sets every other day is not taking a whole lot out of you the secondseeded agassi has approached this grand slam event as a seven match , 21set process , and the guarantee of an unseeded semifinal opponent appears to enhance his efficiency expert s schedule but agassi scoffed at the suggestion that his semifinal berth has come too easily , and pledged to treat krickstein the same way he would have treated thirdseeded boris becker , the man who would have been his penultimate rival had the seedings held to form if i'm playing somebody unseeded or if i'm playing boris , i'm going out there with the same mindset , said agassi gullikson admitted to hospital tim gullikson , coach of topranked pete sampras , was admitted to the university of illinois at chicago medical center for tests today gullikson was coaching sampras in the australian open last week when he had a dizzy spell that doctors thought might have been related to a heart condition and two recent strokes a hospital spokesman , ed tate , said gullikson s family had requested that no more information be released about his medical condition further testing was recommended because there has been concern that the blood thinning medicine prescribed to gullikson last december does not appear to be improving his condition photo andre agassi making a return in his threeset victory yesterday over yevgeny kafelnikov in melbourne \( associated press \) \( pg b14 \)
los angeles , july 13 judge lance a ito today barred o j simpson s lawyers from advancing their theory , which he called highly speculative , that nicole brown simpson and ronald l goldman were killed by drug dealers whose real target was faye resnick , mrs simpson s friend and , for a time , an admitted cocaine user under a 1986 ruling by the california supreme court , evidence that a third party killed someone cannot be used without direct or circumstantial evidence tying that person to the crime in curbing the upcoming testimony of christian reichardt , a beverly hills chiropractor and ms resnick s former fiance , judge ito said the defense had furnished no such evidence defense lawyers had suggested that ms resnick , who has acknowledged using cocaine during a short stay with mrs simpson a week before the killings on june 12 , 1994 , had failed to pay her drug debts , and that drug dealers had come to mrs simpson s condominium at 875 south bundy drive to deliver a colombian necktie , in which a victim s throat is slashed and his tongue may be pulled through the wound but mr simpson s lawyers , who now say they will not call mr reichardt as a witness , had never offered any evidence to support that theory deputy district attorney cheri lewis said today that ms resnick s drug use was merely a nickelanddime habit , and called the idea that drug dealers had mistakenly killed mrs simpson and mr goldman in her place tortured and absurd speculation none of this evidence in the entire trial warrants finding that there s evidence actually linking anybody other than the defendant , orenthal james simpson , to these murders , she told judge ito it s just not there no matter how much mr cochran and the other defense team members would try and weave that spin in front of the jury , it just does not survive testimony in the case today focused on the knuckle of the middle finger of mr simpson s left hand , and precisely when he cut it a succession of witnesses testified that mr simpson s hand appeared unscathed through the early hours of june 13 , when he flew to chicago for a hertz corporation function , but was bleeding several hours later , when he flew back to los angeles the witnesses included passengers on his flights and hertz employees prosecutors say mr simpson cut the finger during the killings the witnesses who accompanied mr simpson eastward , or met him once he arrived , described his demeanor as cordial and relaxed he seemed like the old o j that i always see here and there , said howard bingham , muhammad ali s longtime personal photographer , who was on that flight several other witnesses said his hand appeared normal one said he had specifically studied it because he was looking for a championship sports ring after the los angeles police telephoned mr simpson in chicago to tell him his former wife had been slain , mr simpson flew home witnesses who either took him to the airport , or accompanied him back to los angeles , described him as frantic , looking skyward , sighing and moaning frequently his left finger was either wrapped in a bloody bandaid or in a paper towel , they said mr simpson s chief lawyer , johnnie l cochran jr , asked mark partridge , a copyright lawyer from chicago , whether mr simpson appeared to be acting on the flight to los angeles i thought the way he was behaving was very sincere , replied mr partridge , to whom mr simpson had confided the news about the slayings even so , mr partridge said , mr simpson complied when asked for an autograph i thought , 'what a nice man this was to be doing this , having heard about the tragedy that was affecting his life , ' said mr partridge , who has copyrighted each of the eight pages of the statement he prepared two days after the flight as mr partridge testified , mr simpson appeared to be crying , wiping away a tear as he spoke to his lawyers mr simpson has said he injured himself on the morning of june 13 , shortly after learning that his former wife had been murdered the night before he told the los angeles police later that day that , anguished over the news , he crushed in his hand a glass he found in the bathroom of his chicago hotel this morning , judge ito barred testimony from a chicago travel agent who has said that while she was talking on the telephone to mr simpson while he was in his hotel room on june 13 , she heard a crashing sound , and that mr simpson then said , i just cut myself and i'm bleeding the travel agent s testimony was inadmissible , the judge said , because mr simpson s lawyers had produced no telephone records of the conversation but while arguing the point , ms lewis challenged the defense s good faith on the issue of mr simpson s hands , noting that in the statement he gave to the police , mr simpson said he had cut himself while still in los angeles in that statement , mr simpson said he had reopened in chicago a wound that he sustained the previous evening , while rushing to catch his flight that wound , he said , accounted for the blood drops the police found around his house i knew i was bleeding , but it was no big deal , he said in the statement i bleed all the time he said he placed a napkin on his finger , and the bleeding stopped prosecutors have been unwilling to introduce the statement into evidence , for fear that to do so would effectively let mr simpson offer an alibi without undergoing crossexamination ms lewis raised the statement today , out of the jury s presence , after a defense lawyer , carl douglas , detailed upcoming testimony that mr simpson had no cuts or bandages while traveling to chicago , but had both on the way back i do n't see how he can look you in the face , ms lewis said , when he knows that in his client s own statement to the police , he acknowledges that he cut himself in los angeles it s galling it s absolutely galling mr douglas replied that mr simpson had actually sustained several injuries on his hand there were other cuts on other portions of his hand , but the major cut on the top of the middle finger of the left hand , witnesses will say was not bleeding , he said mr cochran said in his opening statement that mr simpson had cut the top of his middle finger , but not his knuckle , as he was about to leave los angeles no one on the first flight saw that injury prosecutors could well decide to play part of mr simpson s statement to the police in their rebuttal case earlier , mr cochran catalogued ms resnick s accelerating drug use in the spring of 1994 he said ms resnick s own friends feared that the murders were a drugrelated situation and a payback for not paying for these drugs , telling themselves , he said , if o j is n't guilty of this , then we 're all in trouble
dance is often proclaimed an international art so it s not surprising that the ceremonies honoring the 50th anniversary of the united nations charter , signed in san francisco on june 26 , 1945 , will include united we dance an international festival the celebration , sponsored by the san francisco ballet and to be presented at the san francisco war memorial opera house from may 9 to 14 , will feature premieres by representatives of ballet companies from 13 countries helgi tomasson , the san francisco ballet s artistic director , had firm ideas about the sort of festival he wanted to organize at many international galas , companies simply parade their stars in snippets from the classics mr tomasson will have none of this instead , he wishes to stress new works especially , because he is a ballet director , new ballets the only festival participant that is not strictly balletic is the rambert dance company this london troupe , england s most experimental ballet company of the 1930 s , has emphasized modern dance since the 60 s under his broad theme of emphasizing the new , mr tomasson has given all the participating companies total freedom to select their contributions frankly , i do n't know much about some of the choreographers , mr tomasson said their creations will be as much of a surprise to me as they will be to our audience these productions by troupes from around the globe may stir up important esthetic issues for instance , do national ballet styles now exist as strongly as they did in the past , or is some allpurpose international style now dominant \? or is a company s character determined not so much by regional history and tradition as by its choreographers' personal tastes \? and , in the final analysis , does the issue of national style even matter \? no definitive answers may be forthcoming to such questions , yet the chance to debate them will make the festival appeal to the mind as well as the eye three different programs are scheduled the san francisco ballet , as festival host , will appear in all of them , presenting a premiere on one bill and repertory works on the others from melbourne to moscow the australian ballet the melbournebased troupe will bring a new version of corroboree , john antill s musical evocation of aboriginal ceremonials composed in 1936 and first staged as a ballet in 1950 , antill s dramatic score

choreographer the royal danish ballet copenhagen s venerable company will be living in the present with partita , a ballet to bach keyboard music by anna laerkesen , a danish ballerina who has embarked upon a choreographic career new yorkers saw a work by her last year during the new york city ballet s diamond project the bolshoi ballet moscow s great company has had a recent change of

pronounced the apotheosis of the dance mr scholz also wanted to offer a balletic protest against the inhumanity of world war ii mr tomasson has therefore scheduled mr scholz s pax questuosa , to music by udo zimmermann and poetry by elsa laskerschuler , a german writer who fled to palestine during the 1930 s san francisco ballet audiences found mr tomassons s when we no longer touch , a pas de deux

chicago , oct 3 using computers and shoe leather , a team of investigators from the centers for disease control and prevention has been following a trail of mass death for the last three months it winds not through a distant rain forest haunted by an exotic plague but through the brick and concrete valleys of this city the team has been studying the living and the dead of chicago to determine why at least 500 of the city s residents , perhaps more than 700 , perished in a brutal invasion of high heat and humidity in july , one of the deadliest periods in the history of a city that has survived snow storms , fires , gangsters and skyscraperbending winds it was an extraordinary event , said dr joel selanikio , a member of the federal team routinely , there are very hot summers in chicago , but you do n't have 600 people die we 're trying to find out what made this distinct indeed , health experts say , the staggering number of deaths is finally drawing the nation s attention to their longignored warnings heat is a public health hazard that is deadlier than most people realize , and many cities are inadequately prepared to fight it the centers' investigators estimate that heat has killed more than 5 , 000 americans in the last 15 years , and they expect that figure to rise as they reexamine deaths originally attributed to natural causes in the last three months , chicago has been transformed into a sprawling laboratory for the study of this health threat investigators examining the heatrelated deaths here in july now put at 536 to 733 are focusing on areas where the city s emergency system may have fallen short there is no federal definition of a heatrelated death , in which experts say the heat wears down the bodies defenses a standard method used here was a body temperature of 104 degrees or more until the deaths began to mount last summer , chicago had a heat plan it also had airconditioned shelters , though no way to get vulnerable residents to them hospital emergency rooms in the workingclass and struggling neighborhoods of the south side were overwhelmed far sooner than those elsewhere whatever the findings of the current inquiry , one thing is already clear to health experts , and that , said dr thomas p houston , director of preventive medicine and environmental health for the american medical association , is that big cities ought to be looking at heat as a potential natural disaster what happened in chicago , dr houston added , could happen anywhere it already has while no other city in recent memory has suffered as many heatrelated deaths over such a brief period , in 1980 , 1 , 265 deaths around the nation were attributed by health officials to a heat storm that took the lives of dozens of people in st louis and kansas city , mo , alone after this summer s disaster , the chicago public health department began reviewing old mortality figures and discovered an additional 232 deaths in a 1988 heat wave and an additional 885 deaths in july and august of 1955 , previously the city s hottest summer on record , that they now believe were heat related it s happened before , here and in other cities , said jennifer neary , executive director of metro seniors in action , an advocacy group a city the size of chicago should have been better prepared many here agree , and now the city , the national weather service and a committee of the illinois senate are investigating whether deaths could have been avoided with better planning and policies or perhaps simply more awareness in the early days of this summer s heat wave , many chicago officials , including mayor richard m daley , denied the medical examiner s numbers they were too high , the skeptics said winter is the danger season but as the death count grew , the doubts melted and the fingerpointing began no one is blaming the city administration for the heat , said state senator robert m raica , a chicago paramedic and the chairman of the senate s public health and welfare committee , which is conducting an investigation but the city got caught off guard the mayor s office originally laughed about the heat the siege of heat broke records and hearts like the cook county morgue , funeral homes were almost overwhelmed by weatherrelated deaths one funeral home , a a rayner sons on the south side , had to order extra coffins , cancel employees' days off and hold services late into the night paul w dailey of the chicago office of the national weather service said we knew it was going to be really nasty outside , but none of us dreamed that we would experience the number of deaths that we did it s just one of those rare events you 're really not prepared for you think you are , but you 're not the city had several public cooling centers , airconditioned rooms in office buildings , but , senator raica said , few people knew about them ms neary said many elderly people did not use the centers because they had no way to get to them the city did not provide transportation and made no coordinated effort to contact the elderly the problem , ms nearly said , was there was no plan
back in the 1920 s , the literature teachers and professors of america were in an uproar the burning issue was the fear that standards would deteriorate if teachers began using contemporary literature by novelists like henry james , theodore dreiser , upton sinclair and sinclair lewis and by poets like carl sandburg , amy lowell and ezra pound in the end , the barbarians were allowed through the gates , and the world survived now , there is again much sound and fury about the destruction of the traditional literary canon this time with multiculturalism often cast as the culprit but two recent reports on what high school and college students read in class have found that they are apparently reading pretty much the same things their parents did the ruckus now seems less over what has changed than over what some fear may change the modern language association of america released a survey in december of 527 english departments at two and fouryear institutions the study , conducted in the 199091 school years , found that the writer most often included in american literature survey courses was nathaniel hawthorne , whose work was taught in 66 percent of courses the list , in order of frequency , continued with herman melville , walt whitman , emily dickinson , mark twain and ralph waldo emerson the names of 20 white authors , 17 of them male , appeared on the list before that of a black writer , frederick douglass in british literature survey courses , the most frequent authors began with geoffrey chaucer and went on to include william shakespeare , john milton , william wordsworth and alexander pope \( the reason shakespeare was not first , researchers say , is probably because he is so widely taught in separate courses that some survey courses leave him out \) at almost the same time , the college board released a report on the vocabulary in reading materials used by high school and firstyear college students its listing of the authors whose work was most widely taught began with twain and continued with hawthorne , ernest hemingway , charles dickens , shakespeare , john steinbeck and f scott fitzgerald the first nonwhite writer on the list , ralph ellison , ranked 33d the list of books most widely read began with the scarlet letter and continued with huckleberry finn , the great gatsby , lord of the flies , great expectations , hamlet , to kill a mockingbird , the grapes of wrath , the odyssey and 39 others before a work by a nonwhite author , richard wright s black boy , appeared neither study is totally up to date the college board used various sources , perhaps the most important being a survey done in the spring of 1989 and published in 1991 by arthur n applebee , director of the national research center on literature teaching and learning at the state university at albany but dr applebee said it was not likely that the findings now would be enormously different we thought we would be tracking change , and , in fact , there was n't much change , he said i think what happened was that the debate about what s taught was largely triggered by proposals for change , rather than by specific , real changes that actually occurred dr applebee said there were many reasons change often trailed the public s perception of it it takes years for publishers to print and for schools to buy new reading materials and textbooks even then , publishers are likely to take a conservative approach , rather than risk losing their old customers and communities and school boards , particularly in the current politically charged atmosphere , he said , are far more likely to opt for the safe and familiar than the risky and new it is true that neither study provides a complete picture of what students read and at the college level , where required courses have dwindled over the years , what is taught in specialized courses based on , say , sex or ethnic issues , may reach more students the low frequency of citations for black authors partly reflects the degree to which there is no consensus on who should be taught , researchers say , so writers like toni morrison , richard wright , ralph ellison , langston hughes and james baldwin may all be taught in different places , but none so frequently as to rank higher on the list yet the language association s study indicates that oncerare courses on female writers or writers from ethnic minorities have found a firm foothold on campuses phyllis franklin , the executive director of the language association , said , the way i read it , what s happening now is congruent with what has happened over the century that the mla has been around , which is to say that the literary canon , the books and authors taught , changes with some regularity , but only around the edges on the other hand , the college board survey finds that at least the vocabulary is changing a study tracking word use in books and periodicals read by students in 1944 and 1994 found , perhaps not surprisingly , no instances of the words byte , telecommunications or ecology half a century ago there were also no instances of the words chicano and racism and of 20 words whose uses in 1944 and 1994 were compared , only blithe was more common half a century ago , used twice as often then as now webster s defines the word as of a happy lighthearted character or disposition no wonder it does n't get used anymore

concord , nh , sept 14 there is a small slate on the wall of bob dole s campaign headquarters here on which workers chalk the number of days left until this state s 1996 presidential primary as ever , the first in the nation the other day , the number was 160 that ought to be enough to convince people that there is still a lot to play for in new hampshire that and the memory of powerful lastminute surges here by politicians like dwight d eisenhower , henry cabot lodge and george bush , to say nothing of gary hart , george mcgovern and eugene j mccarthy yet many people in washington , seduced by polls showing mr dole with 30 to 40 percent , patrick j buchanan with 10 or 12 and their rivals in single digits , tend to think that the kansas senator has the new hampshire primary , if not the republican presidential nomination , all but wrapped up people in new hampshire beg to disagree these things tighten , said former senator warren b rudman , and although dole is a very strong favorite , there are risks to any frontrunner thomas rath , a politically hyperactive concord lawyer who worked for senator dole eight years ago , is backing former gov lamar alexander of tennessee this time like many of the republican insiders of the state , the only people whose interest has been engaged so far , he argues that the voters are still looking , and none of the candidates have closed any sales either somebody will catch lightning in a bottle , he said , or dole will win usually , but not always , someone catches lightning who that might be next year is far from clear gov stephen merrill , a republican and the state s most popular politician , has endorsed no one he shook up politicians last week by saying he was increasingly alive to the possibility that a colin powell or the possibility that a newt gingrich might get involved after two twoyear terms , mr merrill has told friends that he is not keen for another among other things , it appears that the state s longdelayed fiscal crisis may finally be close but new hampshire has two relatively young republican senators and two relatively young republican representatives so where does mr merrill go \? despite his denials , many speculate that he may try to use the primary as his ticket to washington , as it was in 1988 for his predecessor john h sununu in any event , his backing could provide a crucial lift to a candidate mr dole has the backing of nearly all of new hampshire s republican establishment , much of which opposed him in 1988 , except for the governor and the small band of moderates that remains in the party one of those , susan mclane , a former state senator , said , people like us have no candidate , and i guess we will end up supporting bill clinton i was an eisenhower republican , she said , and i gave george bush his first party in new hampshire i 've spent my political life separating the good guys from the bad in my party , but this time i see no good guys hers is a minority view but dick bennett , a pollster who heads the american research corporation in manchester , agrees that for all their frantic activity these candidates have made no connection with most voters here , and everyone s support is very soft what new hampshire republicans want to hear , he said , is how somebody is going to give them better value for the money they spend on government , the way walmart gives them better value on other stuff david carney , regarded as one of the state s premier organizers , has put together the kind of grassroots organization for mr dole that he lacked in the past in addition , the senator has made frequent visits to the state eight days last month alone during which he saw close to 4 , 000 voters that part of it is done , mr carney said now the most important thing for dole is to get welfare reform through , and tax cuts , and a balanced budget , and to preserve medicare if they get bogged down , that s not so good for us , because people know that dole is the majority leader his greatest asset is the cloak of inevitability seasoned , tested here twice before in 1980 and 1988 , he is a frontrunner with no obvious challenger but that is his big vulnerability as well if he stumbles over the next few months in the senate or in the iowa caucuses , scheduled for feb12 , eight days before the voting here he will have few ideological true believers to fall back on i ca n't see how dole can hold up , said michael pride , editor of the concord monitor he s all over the lot , showing the same lack of center as before , and voters do n't identify with that mr buchanan , the conservative commentator who threw a scare into george bush in new hampshire in 1992 , this month won the endorsement of the union leader in manchester , the only statewide newspaper here that has sometimes mattered , sometimes not in 1972 it backed mayor sam yorty of los angeles for the democratic nomination and representative john ashbrook of ohio among the republicans but its editorinchief , joseph mcquaid , said he thought the choice might count this year in a contest where almost all the candidates claim to be the true conservative , our opinion might just make the difference , he said running against an incumbent president in 1992 , mr buchanan pulled 37 percent of the vote his backers expect him to do equally well this time , but his stridency and his extreme positions may limit his potential the union leader s endorsement certainly complicated the life of senator phil gramm of texas , who had hoped to win it himself he had already hurt himself with the governor and others by flirting with officials in delaware and arizona who wanted to horn in on new hampshire s treasured status as the bellwether primary mr gramm has drawn sparse crowds in this state , even though his platform is right in tune with new hampshire s aversion to taxes gov pete wilson of california abandoned iowa this week in favor of concentrating his energies here and in the other new england states , which vote on march 5 , hoping that support from the popular gov william f weld of massachusetts can help him mr weld has promised to raise 10 million for mr wilson this is an entirely new road to the nomination , governor wilson said in nashua on tuesday politicians here think he has betrayed weakness by pulling out of iowa , and they say paul collins , the onetime sununu aide signed up to build an organization , got too late a start to be really effective which leaves mr alexander , the real conundrum of the new hampshire campaign he is taken seriously here , if only because mr rath is taken seriously like mr wilson , he is already begun broadcasting television commercials , spending about 75 , 000 so far he has been walking across the state , wearing a bright red shirt but all of it has just barely pulled him clear of the rest of the floundering field trees do n't vote , said robert k turner , one of mr gramm s main operatives people do , and they do n't know lamar yet among the other hopefuls , senator arlen specter of pennsylvania has failed so far in his bid to woo the moderates , and senator richard g lugar of indiana has achieved little visibility beyond a billboard in downtown manchester that calls him everything a president should be
paris , june 25 the organizers of the tour de france are no longer content to think of it as merely the world s greatest bicycle race or even the thirdbiggest spectator sports event after the olympic games and the soccer world cup they prefer to think of it also as theater , replete with pity , terror and catharsis we must provide drama , said jeanmarie leblanc , who directs the race there must be a crescendo the excitement must build for the estimated total of 15 million fans who will turn out to watch the tour , the curtain goes up saturday in the brittany region it drops on july 23 in paris , after about 3 , 535 kilometers \( 2 , 210 miles \) of racing clockwise around the country and across belgium in addition to those at the sides of the tour s many roads , tens of millions will watch the daily stages on television in 140 countries if the race is indeed theater , a rough advance script for this 82d tour is available although the spotlight falls first on a fresh new face , he is soon replaced by another young lead , highly popular with the audience for a week , various character actors strut and fret their hour before the lights dim and the first act ends as soon as the second act begins , the star makes his grand entrance and rapidly it becomes a oneman show the star is , of course , miguel indurain , the spanish leader of the banesto team , who will be seeking his fifth consecutive tour de france victory since the race began in 1904 , only three riders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx and bernard hinault have won it as many as five times , and none of them did it consecutively records do not concern indurain asked recently whether he hoped to be the first rider to win six tours , he replied , no , my real goal is to win the tour , whether it s the first time , the third or the sixth for the fifth time he appears to be in wonderful form , having easily won his two long , tuneup races , the midi libre and the dauphine libere in france his motivation is unquestioned , and his team is strong but if the law of averages seems to be standing in indurain s way , so does tony rominger , the swiss leader of the mapei team , who talk about typecasting will be the main challenger for the third successive year rominger finished a distant second in 1993 and dropped out , an even more distant second and weary physically and psychologically , halfway through last year at age 34 , the understudy is running out of time to challenge indurain , who will turn 31 on july 16 the swiss is also in splendid form after an easy victory in the giro d'italia this spring further , his morale was restored when he set the record for the hour s ride against the clock last fall , and he does rank no 1 in the computerized standings of the world s 900 professional riders , decisively ahead of indurain , who is no 2 in the role of the fresh new face is chris boardman , who will be 27 on wednesday , the english leader of the gan team the world champion in both pursuit and the individual time trial , boardman is the favorite in saturday s short prologue , which he won last year if he repeats , he gets to wear the first yellow jersey of the overall leader probably he will not long see his name in lights in the team time trial on july 4 , laurent jalabert , 26 , the frenchman who is a coleader of the once team , should emerge from the wings he is expected to do well in the prologue and , since his team is stronger and faster than boardman s , gain enough seconds in the time trial to take the jersey , which he ought to wear the rest of the week if so , it will be an emotional time jalabert was badly injured in a crash early in the last tour and spent many weeks recuperating when he returned to action this season and won such important races as milansan remo and parisnice , he became a great french favorite neither indurain nor rominger should be conspicuous during the tour s first week , when the 21 teams of 9 riders each will be racing on the flat territory of northern france and belgium the main roles there have been assigned to the sprinters and longrange , often kamikaze , attackers but on july 9 the first individual time trial , 54 kilometers in belgium from huy to seraing , opens the second act in his four victories in the tour , indurain has blown away his rivals in the first race against the clock , gaining two , three and four minutes and sapping their resolve then he has stayed with the best climbers in the mountains , conceding just seconds of his lead he has some strong secondary challengers this year boardman and jalabert yevgeny berzin , 25 , a russian with the gewiss team richard virenque , 25 , a frenchman with festina pavel tonkov , 26 , a russian with lampre claudio chiappucci , 32 , and marco pantani , 25 , both italians with carrera alex zulle , 27 on july 5 , a swiss with once alvaro mejia , 28 , a colombian with motorola perhaps piotr ugrumov , 34 , a latvian with gewiss since indurain s first victory in 1991 , many of these riders have spent their tours battling each other for the right to finish second and third , too cowed by the timetrial results to attack the spaniard although one man in his time plays many parts , as the tour s drama critics might say , again this july indurain looks to be in a singular role
rome , june 14 the teatro dell'opera here has just ended its most successful season in two decades , a tribute to the new team that took over the debtridden and infamously mismanaged house last year with orders to rescue it from bankruptcy and possible closure yet there is no certainty the feat can be repeated audiences and critics acclaimed new productions of berlioz s benvenuto cellini and verdi s macbeth , but the theater s 650 workers are not happy with the change of regime and if they disrupted only two performances with strikes this spring , it was not for lack of trying inside the 19thcentury house , warfare continues to simmer between management and staff last month , angered by new strike threats , rome s mayor , francesco rutelli , canceled the company s outdoor summer festival at the piazza di siena in the villa borghese two weeks later , the opera house s seven unions backed down , reluctantly pledging not to disrupt the program of two operas and one ballet the sixweek festival will begin as planned on july 16 but if the unions lost this battle , they are not about to surrender the right to strike is enshrined in the law , said massimo di franco , leader of one union that says it represents 150 opera house workers rutelli imposed an unacceptable condition , but it was accepted we did n't want to be blamed for destroying a tradition but the agreement lasts only until the end of august for giorgio vidusso , the theater s new general director , this augurs fresh headaches i'm a musician , not a labor lawyer , he said , in his cramped office , but i spend 95 percent of my time on something i'm no good at the union situation here is like bosnia they all work against each other they all want the opposite of what the other wants he lighted yet another cigarette and sighed deeply i am very tired and very worried , he said clearly , even his years running the florence and trieste opera companies did not prepare the 68yearold director for this all i want to do is to run a normal theater , he went on that would be a great revolution a normal theater that performs when it promises , with the singers it announces operatic power struggles inside italy s opera houses are nothing new early this month at la scala in milan , the curtain was about to rise on la traviata when the orchestra called a strike as the audience yelled in fury , the conductor , riccardo muti , offered to accompany the singers and chorus at the piano , and the evening ended in ovations but mr muti was too distressed by the incident to assume the mantle of hero i felt that the evening could not finish like that , with the shouts of the audience , the curtain falling into darkness and silence , he later explained we are all losers there are no winners it was an evening to assign to the saddest pages of italian musical life yet , while labor troubles , mismanagement and political meddling have been the norm for italy s 12 statefinanced national opera houses in recent years , none has come close to matching the record of the teatro dell'opera in rome , particularly during the reign of gian paolo cresci as its sovrintendente , or general director , from 1990 to 1994 a political appointee with little knowledge of opera , mr cresci quickly earned the nickname of nero for his spending habits he rented persian carpets for opening nights , paraded elephants accompanied by 1 , 000 extras through the streets of rome to publicize a new production of aida , sent private jets to pick up favorite tenors and handed out free tickets galore his strategy for appeasing the unions was to promote 320 workers to new positions and salary levels and to provide such generous overtime payments that stage technicians were soon earning an average of 4 , 000 per month the teatro dell'opera ran up a 33 million debt , but its productions were still considered mediocre and the paying public stayed away after mr rutelli was elected mayor of rome on a leftofcenter ticket in december 1993 , he inherited the position of chairman of the opera house with the backing of italy s central government , which provides more than half the theater s annual 55 million budget , he assumed special powers to impose order it took him four months to ease out mr cresci , who counted a number of politicians as well as the director franco zeffirelli among his defenders but in this , the mayor was helped by a report from italy s independent audit court , which described mr cresci s financial management as insane the appointment of mr vidusso as general director was widely welcomed the new team acted quickly mr cresci s 320 promotions were canceled , costcutting was instituted , the city chipped in with emergency financing and the central government pledged 13 million toward paying off the debt after a public clash of wills , mr vidusso also dismissed the veteran composer gian carlo menotti as music director in a business in which programs are often set and singers booked years in advance , mr vidusso had just six months in which to prepare his first season he decided to start with benvenuto cellini and follow with cosi fan tutte , macbeth , le coq d'or , elisir d'amore and madama butterfly then , two days before the season was to open , the unions threatened to sabotage the premiere of benvenuto cellini mr vidusso offered his resignation in despair , but mr rutelli decided to call their bluff i summoned them and told them that if they went on strike , i would cancel the entire season , the mayor recalled they pulled back the production earned the teatro dell'opera its first raves in recent memory but four months later , the unions showed their teeth again pressing their demand that 50 temporary workers be given permanent posts , they forced cancellation of the opening night of the ballet coppelia a charity performance of verdi s requiem by mr muti and la scala s orchestra and chorus had to be moved to the santa cecilia academy in rome despite those disruptions , the opera season was a success , with record boxoffice receipts but when the summer festival was threatened last month , mr rutelli was clearly in no mood to negotiate the unions now understand that we do n't accept blackmail anymore , he said in an interview they know that if they try , they wo n't win they know we have the full support of the cultural community still wary , though , mr vidusso is preparing what he describes as a prudent 199596 season he hopes to increase the number of performances to around 100 from 70 this year and he is working to improve the quality of the theater s orchestra , chorus and dance company but he plans to delay major digressions from traditional italian repertory until things are more settled his caution is probably well placed vidusso is a great artistic maestro , said mr di franco , the union leader , but he has had some difficulty running a place that has been so politicized for so long promises are made that are not being kept so , mr di franco was asked , are more strikes in the offing \? if we just stand outside the building holding banners , he said , we can achieve nothing photo giorgio vidusso , general director of the teatro dell'opera in rome , spends most of his time on labor disputes \( francesco ziola for the new york times \)
hollywood , april 30 it has been more than 35 years since janet leigh saw herself on the screen in alfred hitchcock s classic horror film psycho after viewing the famous shower scene , in which she was repeatedly stabbed , ms leigh was seized with an overwhelming and lasting terror i stopped taking showers and i take baths , only baths , she said in fact , when the former movie star stays overnight in a hotel or at a friend s home where only a shower is available , she panics i make sure the doors and windows of the house are locked , she said , and i leave the bathroom door open and shower curtain open i'm always facing the door , watching , no matter where the shower head is the film s impact on ms leigh may seem extreme , but it s understandable and , she says , she s not alone psycho stands as one of the darkest movies ever made , one that revised the standards for horror and suspense films and ms leigh says it left an imprint on tony perkins , the star , and on a number of others connected with it as well , even hitchcock himself the 67yearold ms leigh , a top star of the 1950 s and 60 s , offers a revealing look into the film in a new book , psycho behind the scenes of the classic thriller , to be published this month by harmony books , a division of crown her coauthor is christopher nickens the actress began her career in 1946 and semiretired in 1984 after more than 50 films , including the manchurian candidate , touch of evil and my sister eileen , and 30 television movies she has spent the last decade writing her biography , there really was a hollywood , was published a decade ago , and a novel , house of destiny , partly about the movie business , will be released in the fall by harlequin press but psycho , with hitchcock s bag of nervejangling cinematic tricks and the screeching score by bernard herrmann , is what she is remembered for in the film , she played marion crane , a troubled woman seeking to break off an affair with sam loomis \( john gavin \) one day her employer asks her to deposit 40 , 000 in the bank on her way home viewing the money as her ticket to freedom , she embarks on a trip to see sam a torrential storm causes her to miss the main highway , and she stops at a lonely motel run by norman bates \( perkins \) , who befriends her norman tells her he lives with his powerful , unbalanced mother realizing that she is as trapped as he is , marion resolves to return home the next morning and face the consequences but that s tomorrow tonight , she 'll take a shower psycho consumed ms leigh for years a casual meeting with some publishing friends in new york last year , when ms leigh mentioned the mail she still receives about the film from viewers who have seen it on cable or home video , led her to do the book seated in her beverly hills home , the actress said that while there have been numerous books about hitchcock , including explorations of psycho , none have been written by an insider who was actually present at the creation of the film i 've been in a great many films , but i suppose if an actor can be remembered for one role then they 're very fortunate , she said and in that sense i'm fortunate the film had a negative , perhaps even destructive , impact on the career of perkins the actor , who died two years ago , felt that the shadow of norman bates dominated his life , ms leigh said she interviewed perkins s widow , berry berenson , his sons and his friends tony was definitely the consummate actor , she said he could do anything but very often the industry will get a fixation on an image of someone and they ca n't lose it while sympathetic to perkins s plight , ms leigh pointed out that the actor himself probably contributed to his difficulties after psycho he went to europe for several years and starred in films with ingrid bergman , sophia loren , jeanne moreau and others but he later returned to the united states and starred in three psycho sequels by then mr perkins was totally identified with norman bates as for hitchcock , ms leigh believes that the director sensed somehow that he would never top psycho although he later made such popular films as the birds and marnie , she said , unconsciously he knew he could never do it again although there have been accounts of the director s personal and sometimes harmful obsession with some of his glacially beautiful stars , grace kelly and tippi hedren among them , ms leigh said he never took his relationship with her beyond the most professional level with people like vera miles and tippi hedren , he was going to be their svengali , groom them for stardom , she said as talented as these women were , they were not really established , and initially they were n't married i had made many pictures i was married and we had socialized a bit it was a completely different association i had with him was hitchcock a tortured man \? i ca n't answer that , said ms leigh , who was married to tony curtis when she made psycho they were divorced in 1962 , after 10 years of marriage for the last 32 years she has been married to robert brandt , a stockbroker she has two daughters , the actresses jamie lee curtis and kelly curtis i do n't know what hitchcock s fantasies were , she said i do think he was happy at times he enjoyed his wining and dining he enjoyed his success was he happy \? it s hard to say in an interview with francois truffaut years ago , hitchock said the shower scene the suddenness of the murder served as his principal reason for making psycho , which was adapted by joseph stefano from a novel by robert bloch the shower scene had been technically difficult , she said it took seven days to shoot , but it lasts only about 45 seconds on the screen i wore a moleskin suit and it was very uncomfortable the first time i saw the movie was in a projection room with hitchcock and several others , she recalled i did n't know what to expect , so when i saw it i was stunned with the editing and rhythm and the music it was like you could actually feel the thrusts of the knife like it was going through me it was very , very emotional ms leigh has seen the film at least 15 times and still finds unexpected moments of hitchcock s technical brilliance you notice so many things , seeing it again and again , she said there s a light , almost an ethereal light , a heavenly light on marion it was like she was being purified cleansed the water it was like she was being baptized she was cleaning not only her body but also the inner dirt and this made the attack even more horrible asked if doing the book has somehow eased her fear of showers , ms leigh laughed i have absolutely no intention of stepping into a shower , she said photo janet leigh , actress and writer , outside her beverly hills , calif , home \( steve goldstein for the new york times \)
washington , march 3 ben nighthorse campbell , the only american indian in the united states senate , startled and puzzled the political world today by bolting from the democratic party and joining the republicans he suggested that the democrats no longer represented his views but in a typically ambiguous statement , he said he would continue to vote as he had in the past , which has been with the democrats and president clinton 78 percent of the time , according to tallies by congressional quarterly i can no longer represent the agenda that is put forth by the party , mr campbell told a packed news conference here this morning , although i certainly agree with many of the things that democrats stand for those who know mr campbell , a sartorial maverick who wears bolo ties and his hair in a pony tail , said that his defection had more to do with growing personal antagonisms he had experienced within the democratic party in colorado than with any ideological split they said mr campbell had become increasingly estranged from his party since last year , when he got into a bitter public dispute over personal finances with his former chief of staff , sherrie wolff , who was running for secretary of state party officials blamed mr campbell for costing her the race he has a very , very sharp temper and has a hard time controlling it and he will lash out at real or perceived slights , said lawrence dodd , director of the center for the study of american politics at the university of colorado at boulder when he gets in fights , he tends to settle them publicly mr campbell only alluded to his internal party problems today , saying , i have not been able to live up to the expectations of the democratic party , so it s just very clear that we go our separate ways the wellkept secret of his defection outraged democrats in colorado as well as his staff in washington , most of whom quit on the spot when they heard the news this morning we 're democrats , not republicans , one said republican leaders in washington cautiously welcomed mr campbell into the fold , his addition swelling their ranks to 54 and leaving 46 democrats but no one seemed under any illusion that senator campbell , 60 , who roars around town on a highly accessorized harleydavidson , would necessarily hew to the republican line indeed , president clinton said that when mr campbell called him this morning to report his switch , he told the president he essentially supported our economic policies , our education policies and our social polices and that he would not change that mr clinton said that he hoped mr campbell would continue voting as he has since his election to the senate in 1992 mr campbell is viewed as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal , a democrat who supports a balanced budget amendment and a capital gains tax cut but also supports abortion rights he has sided with developers and the timber and mining industries , earning the enmity of environmentalists i 've always been considered a moderate , to the consternation of the left wing of the democratic party , he said today i imagine my continued moderacy will be now to the consternation of the right wing of the republican party partly because of his insistence that he would not change his stance on issues , mr campbell said he had no intention of resigning and standing for reelection as a republican but the colorado democratic party , which is meeting this weekend , is sure to call for his resignation , said howard gelt , chairman of the party there is precedent both ways senator phil gramm of texas stepped down and ran again when he switched parties , but senator richard shelby of alabama did not mr campbell is up for reelection in 1998 colorado limits its senators to two terms don bain , chairman of the colorado republican party , said he saw no reason for mr campbell to quit only to run as a republican the people of colorado voted more for campbell as a personality than as a representative of one party or the other , mr bain said his image is one of western independence , the lone ranger kind of indian image , the guy out there all alone on the western plains staring into the horizon , mr bain said he ran that way , as the ragstoriches success story who has some kind of olympic medal and makes jewelry and rides a motorcycle there has been speculation in colorado that mr campbell has already decided not to seek a second senate term in 1998 , partly because he was unhappy in the senate and might run for governor that year people think he wo n't run again because he hates the senate so much , with its prima donnas , and he s such a loner there , said bob drake , a denver pollster but these ambitions do not necessarily explain his switching parties , since the governor s race is expected to draw strong republican contenders others said the switch occurred primarily because mr campbell s personal feuds had made staying in the democratic party untenable most recently , he endorsed an opponent of the democratic mayor of denver , wellington webb in washington , mr campbell is better known for his unorthodox lifestyle than for any legislative accomplishments perhaps his most notable achievement has been to bring about the renaming of the custer battlefield national monument in montana , a name the indians found offensive , to the little bighorn battlefield national monument mr campbell spent part of his early years in an orphanage and has attributed his independence to not having a family it made me very selfreliant and independent , he told his biographer , who was writing the book at mr campbell s request if you have nobody to rely on , then you have got to do it yourself his mother , who was portuguese , died of tuberculosis , and his father , a northern cheyenne who was an alcoholic , placed the children in orphanages the senator , who was born ben marshall campbell , did not accept his indian heritage until adulthood , after he learned that his grandmother s half brother , alex black horse , was a leader of the northern cheyenne and that some of his ancestors fought at little big horn he keeps a knife from the battle in his capitol hill office he was given the name nighthorse by the tribe in 1980 a highschool dropout who later put himself through san jose state university by driving a truck , mr campbell was captain of the united states judo team in the 1964 olympics he was elected to the colorado legislature in 1982 and to the united states house in 1986 even his jewelrymaking is unconventional while most indian jewelry is made with turquoise and silver , his includes gold , diamonds , sapphires and rubies mr campbell is the eighth american indian to serve in congress and the only one at the moment he once said he wished there were a lot more or none at all because it s damned tough being the only indian photo senator ben nighthorse campbell of colorado , second from the right , stood with fellow republicans yesterday after switching parties on the right is bob dole of kansas and on the left are trent lott of mississippi and orrin g hatch of utah , who wore a bolo tie

chris terreri , the diminutive goaltender who has presided as the devils' premier goaltender in the past , has accepted his role as the backup to martin brodeur this season and has thrived on it terreri s best work has come in relief appearances , the latest on friday night although he had not started for eight games , terreri looked as if he had not missed a minute of play when jacques lemaire threw him into the game against the islanders after brodeur allowed three goals on the first five shots he faced terreri took over in the net with six minutes left in the first period and his solid performance brought inspiration and confidence to the devils , who scored six unanswered goals for a 63 triumph that has boosted their morale lemaire was so pleased with the way his team responded after terreri s entrance that he made yesterday s practice optional in preparation for tonight s game against the visiting hartford whalers it s my role right now and i have accepted it , said terreri , who played 54 games three seasons ago all i can do is stay sharp by working hard in practice terreri s previous appearance , a 11 tie with tampa bay on april 4 , was also in relief after brodeur allowed the goal on nine shots terreri played 45 minutes without allowing a goal in that game and 44 minutes without allowing a goal against the islanders on friday night i'm not looking at these things , terreri said of his shutout streak all i want to do is help the team when i'm needed it s a crapshoot sometimes , but that s my role the 30yearold terreri is proving how right the general manager , lou lamoriello , was not to trade him while the goalie is playing out the option year of his 600 , 000 contract terreri also proved his value in the playoffs last spring when he stepped in and won three key games in the elimination of the boston bruins terreri expects to become a free agent in the summer and he has filed for arbitration , but he is not looking to move this is his ninth year with the devils , and he was also associated with lamoriello for four years at providence college before that just as a important as lamoriello s affection for terreri is the fact that lemaire likes terreri s disposition you can always rely on chris , lemaire said it seems that he is always ready and he is at his best every time he has replaced martin tererri s last start was march 26 , and he may not see another start this season since none of the eight games remaining on the schedule are on consecutive nights
washington , feb 13 the house today took up the final piece in the republican overhaul of last year s crime bill , debating a measure that would gut president clinton s pledge to put 100 , 000 police officers on the streets the president said on saturday that he would veto a bill that eroded that pledge , and house democrats said today that they had enough votes to sustain a veto , although they had not actually counted heads yet but it may not be as simple as that the house republicans' anticrime package is six bills , though the senate may consolidate them before sending them to the president and mr clinton might find it difficult to veto a consolidated package if its components had passed with strong bipartisan support tony blankley , the chief spokesman for speaker newt gingrich , said today that the democrats apparently have divined some very scant political morsel out of their stand , but they could n't have a meal of it he added , we will be testing whether he wants to veto a tough anticrime bill or not financing for the additional officers was the centerpiece of last year s 30 billion anticrime package and one of mr clinton s most visible campaign promises to become law last year s bill set aside 88 billion over five years for 100 , 000 new officers , 17 , 000 of whom have been hired so far in about 8 , 000 communities across the country at a cost of 13 billion , the justice department says the bill also set aside 4 billion for prevention programs the republicans propose to collapse both of those allocations into a single , unrestricted lumpsum payment , or block grant , of 10 billion over five years to local governments , which could use them to reduce crime the size of a grant would be determined by an area s rate of violent crime a vote on the measure could come by tuesday republicans argue that the block grants allow local governments , not all of whom want more officers , to decide how best to spend the money , a fundamental concept of government that the new republican majority has been advocating across the board as it tries to move decisionmaking away from washington the republicans also say that their bill provides safeguards , including local advisory boards to review the use of funds , to insure that the money is responsibly directed tonight , the house passed on a voice vote an amendment to require local governments to put up a 10 percent matching grant to get the federal money a matching grant was absolutely essential for accountability , said representative bill mccollum , republican of florida the amendment was a response to democratic critics who complained that the blockgrant approach was short on accountability and ignored the benefits of having officers patrolling beats last year s bill required a 25 percent matching grant this year s bill initially required none the debate illustrates a philosophical difference between the two parties , representative henry j hyde , the illinois republican who heads the judiciary committee , said today on the floor the democrats , he said , say the federal government has to control the money because daddy knows best , while the republicans believe the best government is closest to the people and the most responsive to their needs democrats seemed to put more effort into a news conference with attorney general janet reno today than into their arguments on the floor , where their numbers were sparse at the news conference , they displayed signs quoting speaker gingrich as opposing block grants in the past mr gingrich said last year in reference to an anticrime blockgrant proposal if they say to me , in the name of fighting crime , will i send a 2 billion check to cities , many of which have destructive bureaucracies , to let the local politicians build a bigger machine with more patronage \? my answer is , no representative charles e schumer , the brooklyn democrat who wrote much of last year s bill , said block grants were bad then and good today simply because the name gop precedes the language meanwhile , a group of republicans who ardently support repealing last year s ban on assault weapons announced the formation of a task force to make a sweeping study of all firearms and second amendment issues the issues range from repealing the ban on assault weapons to curtailing the powers of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms the speaker agreed to the proposal last month when he stopped the group from adding a repeal of the ban to the current anticrime legislation it is unclear now when the proposed repeal will come up , but it almost certainly will not be until after the first 100 days of congress the house is believed to have the votes to overturn the ban , but the situation in the senate is less certain our government is failing to meet its fundamental , most important , basic responsibility , and that is to protect citizens and their property , said representative bob barr , the georgia republican who will head the task force the speaker has asked us to look into the fundamentals of the second amendment , what it was intended to provide , what sort of protections and rights it guarantees our citizens , how it is being enforced representative roscoe g bartlett , republican of maryland , said much of this firearms legislation , no matter how wellintentioned , has simply been distracting and diversionary and gives the illusion that you are doing something about crime , and you are doing nothing about crime many of the laws that we have on our books are an infringement of the second amendment rights
more journalists were killed worldwide because of their work last year than at any time in recent years , according to a report issued in new york by the committee to protect journalists the committee , an independent group of american journalists , said 72 reporters , photographers and editors died in the line of duty in 1994 , more than in any year since the organization began keeping records of journalists' deaths in 1981 in 1993 , the committee said , 64 journalists were killed because of their work the committee said 58 of the killings last year appear to have been deliberate political assassinations in none of the 18 countries where the killings occurred has anyone been arrested for them , it added another 14 journalists were killed in 1994 covering battles in places like bosnia , somalia and chechnya william a orme jr , the committee s executive director , said two trends appeared to be subjecting journalists to greater dangers in their own countries in many countries , he said , islamic militants have singled out independent reporters because they see journalists as supporters of secularism he also said that in places like the former soviet union , where journalists are experimenting with new freedoms , reporters are testing their societies' support for a free press the committee said algerian islamic rebels were responsible for 19 killings , making algeria the country with the highest death toll for journalists other countries with many killings of journalists were rwanda , tajikistan and cambodia in what the report called an especially disturbing development , two investigative reporters in russia were killed in what the committee concluded was retaliation for their work one of the russians , yuri soltis , a crime reporter for the independent news agency interfax , was investigating russian underworld activities when he was beaten to death , the committee said the other reporter , dmitri kholodov , had been investigating organized crime connections with the russian military for the newspaper moskovsky komsomolets , when he was killed by a bomb blast at the newspaper s office the committee , which receives much of its financing from american news organizations , said it only cites incidents when it can corroborate from more than one source that journalists were killed because of their profession
john denver has always been the most presidentialsounding american pop singer performing his folkpop anthems exalting the rugged western landscape , mr denver paints a picturepostcard vision of rustic life that is tinged with the rhetoric of the human potential movement in concert , mr denver suggests a grownup johnboy walton , alternately ministerial and folksy as he imparts his messages of spiritual uplift , humanitarianism and care for the environment those inspirational thoughts are couched in tidy verses that are vague enough to have a broad populist appeal but pointed enough to have political overtones if mr denver decided to ride into washington on a white horse for one of his causes , he would know exactly what tone to take mr denver s concert at radio city music hall on saturday night to benefit the wildlife conservation society was a typically smooth exercise in ceremonial grace except for having put on a few pounds , mr denver seemed remarkably unchanged from 20 years ago when he was one of the country s two or three bestselling pop singers what has changed drastically is the pop climate mr denver s pastoral reveries have lost their footing in a pop mainstream increasingly obsessed with paranoia and complaint although mr denver can be heard on country radio stations , as he pointed out on saturday his music is really more western than country that music is well made , and on saturday it was ringingly performed mr denver s voice , with its builtin twang and rapid vibrato , has lost none of its oratorical clout singing with an almost mechanistic precision and with perfect pitch and enunciation he projected his voice as though it were meant to bounce off mountainsides and resound to the heavens the old hits rocky mountain high , back home again , take me home , country roads , poems , prayers and promises and sunshine on my shoulders sounded sturdy so did lesserknown later songs like eagles and horses and for you , although their messages were more abstract and spiritual it is the material for an allamerican song book photo john denver at radio city music hall on saturday night \( adam scher the new york times \)

washington , jan 23 ruling unanimously in a job discrimination case , the supreme court today rejected a defense that employers have used with increasing success to avoid liability for dismissing an employee for an illegal reason like race or age the court ruled that employees who lose their jobs because of discrimination are still entitled to back pay , even if the employer later discovers misconduct that would have justified dismissal had it been known at the time a growing number of lower federal courts have allowed employers to use what is known as afteracquired evidence belated discovery of an exaggerated resume or a violation of company rules , for example as a complete defense to a job discrimination lawsuit even if the employer has conceded that the real reason for the dismissal was a discriminatory one writing for the court today , justice anthony m kennedy said that this use of afteracquired evidence frustrated the purpose of the federal laws against discrimination in the workplace overturning a decision by a federal appellate court , the court ruled on behalf of a 62yearold secretary who was dismissed in a purported staff reduction by a nashville publishing company , only to have her job filled by a 26yearold despite the employer s concession that age discrimination was the real reason she was discharged , the secretary , christine mckennon , was denied any relief because the company learned during the discovery phase of her age discrimination suit that in the previous year she had taken home some confidential documents in violation of company policy accepting the employer s view that this misconduct would have warranted immediate discharge , the federal district court in nashville , in a ruling affirmed in 1993 by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit , in cincinnati , dismissed ms mckennon s lawsuit it was irrelevant whether she had been discriminated against , the appellate court said justice kennedy s opinion rejecting that view today emphasized the broad societal purposes served by the federal laws against discrimination the goals of compensating victims and deterring employer misconduct are furthered when even a single employee establishes that an employer has discriminated against him or her , he wrote what matters for that determination is the employer s motive , he said , adding that in this case , the employer could not have been motivated by knowledge it did not have and it cannot now claim that the employee was fired for the nondiscriminatory reason nonetheless , justice kennedy continued , an employee s wrongdoing did have to be taken into account in fashioning a remedy , even when it came to light only after the discriminatory act once an employer learns about employee wrongdoing that would lead to a legitimate discharge , we cannot require the employer to ignore the information , he said , even if the information would never have been discovered if the employee had not filed suit justice kennedy said back pay was appropriate from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered as a general rule , he said , neither reinstatement nor future wages would be a justifiable remedy , although extraordinary equitable circumstances might require other outcomes in particular cases he said the employer had the burden of establishing in the first instance that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge in her appeal , mckennon v nashville banner , no 931543 , ms mckennon asked only for back pay and did not seek either reinstatement or future wages while the case involved the federal age discrimination in employment act , the decision also applies to the broader proscriptions against job discrimination on the basis of race , religion and sex that are found in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 the age discrimination law , enacted in 1967 , was modeled after the 1964 law before the afteracquired evidence doctrine was adopted in 1989 by the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit , in denver , it was almost unknown but it was spreading , theodore shaw , a lawyer with the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc , which helped represent ms mckennon , said in an interview four of the 12 federal circuits had adopted it mr shaw said that as the defense became more widely used , employers began checking deeply into the background and behavior of employees who filed discrimination suits , in the hope of discovering some misconduct the lower courts , he said , were sanctioning witch hunts in his opinion today , justice kennedy took note of mr shaw s concern he said the federal court rules against frivolous or abusive requests in litigation , as well as the authority of judges to order employers to reimburse plaintiffs for their lawyers' fees , will deter most abuses there is no national inventory of cases in which afteracquired evidence has been used as a defense in any event , most employment discrimination cases are settled without going to court
the problem seemed trivial and unlikely to generate much squabbling but the issue of restrooms turned out to be too sensitive to settle easily so the members of the town council did what public officials often do they appointed a task force in this case , the mystic public restrooms task force more than two years and countless hours of debate have gone by since merchants in downtown mystic first started pushing for public restrooms to serve the tourists , who crowd the sidewalks every summer , and residents , who patronize downtown stores all year mystic which has no local government and is partly in the town of groton and partly in stonington , still has no public restrooms the merchants are desperate for them , said a task force member , michael williston , owner of the finer line gallery on west main street it s difficult to let people use our bathrooms , because the bathrooms are often our storerooms but if you turn people down , the ill will you create tears you apart merchants , residents and town officials on the task force have been meeting for the last few months to consider possible sites for the restrooms the town of groton appropriated 56 , 000 for the project two years ago , and the mystic chamber of commerce has agreed to maintain the restrooms beyond that , the details still have to be resolved the job seems straightforward on the surface but look again a proposal from the town of groton to build restrooms on gravel street in the mystic historic district met with loud protests from homeowners in the area the street , which winds along the banks of the mystic river , is lined with elegant , historic houses one of the homeowners' complaints was that the proposed site would violate zoning ordinances the town council then appointed the task force in order to find a more suitable location john foley , a columnist for the day of new london , wrote last january mystic has had many burning , to say nothing of quixotic , issues over the years , but 'the great public restrooms controversy' has many denizens of that tight little community all but at each other s throats gravel street residents have been in a dither over the impact of having what they feel could be the ultimate outhouse virtually in their own backyard the task force has 8 possible sites left to study out of an original list of 21 , said one member , william d carlebach , who lives on gravel street i think we 're on the edge of finding one that would be available at no cost , but i do n't know this yet , he said no permanent toilets will be ready for this summer , he added which led to the next problem what to do in the meantime to accommodate the tourists , especially those whose children drink too many sodas and cannot wait to use the bathroom the situation becomes even more urgent for people on one side of the mystic river who are unable to reach restrooms on the other side , because the drawbridge is up solving land use problems in mystic is complicated , since the community is divided into sections in groton and stonington a dense commercial district surrounded by stable , historic residential neighborhoods lies to the west , on the groton side of the river , and large tourist and retail attractions , like mystic seaport , mystic marinelife aquarium and olde mistick village shopping center , are on the east bank in stonington it seems as though there s a stone wall in the middle of the river , said peter pappas , another task force member and the owner of bee bee dairy restaurant on west main street stonington has not been part of the restroom project so far , mr pappas added , but he and others on the task force plan to invite the town s first selectman , david burdge , to participate mr burdge said stonington has no money in its proposed 199596 budget for public restrooms we have n't gotten into it , he said we 're putting our budget together now i asked that people with thoughts about the budget notify me , and no one came forward about restrooms the task force recently agreed to install portable toilets for the summer at two sites in the groton section of mystic the headline in an article in the day announced portable toilets coming to mystic one of the sites is near the place that was rejected for permanent restrooms a sewage pumping station on gravel street but mr carlebach said none of his neighbors on the street called to complain this is very different from a permanent addition to the pump house , he said and the toilets can be screened they should n't be within anybody s view mr carlebach said that when he suggested placing the portable toilets near the pump station , no one on the task force offered a better idea the storekeepers do n't want it near them , and the banks do n't want it near them , he said we started out with 20 places , and now we 're down to 2 most of the community buildings were built before automobiles there s no parking , and the shopkeepers are cramped for space stonington is shying away from portable toilets , too i would rather not comment on that at all , mr burdge said i do n't have an opinion either way i would have to see how the people felt about it more opposition to public restrooms may lie ahead , this time to the idea of financing the project with additional tax money when we were the hub of shopping , before the crystal mall , no one cared about toilets here , said john pillar , a government watchdog who lives in a section of groton outside mystic all of a sudden , they want toilets , and they want us , the taxpayers , to pay for it i do n't get a nickel out of the tourists tourism does n't help groton it helps just mystic the merchants are the ones pushing this why do n't they build them \? pulling various interests together into a package to be sold to the community has gone slowly , mr williston said , but the tone of the task force meetings has been friendly and professional the merchants understand the feelings of the residents , and the residents understand the needs of the merchants and that we 're not all greedy , he said it s not an easy thing to do everyone seems to have a strong opinion on some aspect of the situation , including the writer for the day , mr foley , who expressed his views on the way restrooms should be designed and decorated referring to the hubbub stirred up by the gravel street neighbors , mr foley wrote in his column whatever , gravel street will always be a great little street , and the 'public facilities' may not have the visual impact its residents fear but if they are approved , it is devoutly hoped that the architect will not come down with a case of the cutes and dress them up in the manner of a nautical or antique outhouse an understated anchor or sailboat motif on each side would be an appropriate enough touch in the old seafaring community photos gravel street was one mystic site proposed for publicrestrooms residents objected \( thomas

what does it say that the most ballyhooed exhibition in months is ross bleckner s midcareer retrospective at the guggenheim museum \? mr bleckner s name makes the society pages about as often as his friend bianca jagger s , and it s hard not to connect that fact with all the publicity preceding the show and the glamorous sponsors who stepped up to finance it one of them , the entertainment mogul david geffen , is also mr bleckner s friend the principal sponsor , hugo boss , even furnished mr bleckner with the suit he wore to his opening , an event paid for by another sponsor , vanity fair magazine , which recently published an admiring profile of the artist none of this would signify anything , of course , beyond mr bleckner s personal good fortune , if his work justified a big show at a major museum but with 268 paintings and drawings , the exhibition looks absurdly overblown and it has the effect , which retrospectives are supposed to have , of shifting one s opinion of his art but in this case , for the worse a second effect is to overshadow the opening of another show , also at the guggenheim , a survey of the work of felix gonzaleztorres if a significant number of mr bleckner s fans come from outside the art world , mr gonzaleztorres s come mostly from within it for them , this was to have been his moment , the time when his restrained and elliptical blend of conceptualism , minimalism and politics would reach a large audience and maybe even offer a discreet alternative to mr bleckner s opulence after all , his art and mr bleckner s are nearly flip sides of the same coin , both of them dealing with reallife issues like aids as it happens , the 36yearold mr gonzaleztorres is n't yet able to sustain a full midcareer retrospective much less is his quietude a potent enough antidote to mr bleckner s melodrama since the early 1980 s , mr bleckner , who is 45 , has mixed op art effects with themes involving death and dying to his advocates over the years , this curious strategy has allowed him to be hailed as a champion of one or another cause he has been embraced as a postmodern ironist , reviving a discredited , or at least neglected , genre of abstraction , namely op , but reviving it with a twist instead of the cheery optimism that characterized real op art , mr bleckner s somber pictures suggested loss and melancholia for those in the art world fretting , as art world people periodically do , that abstract painting had run its course and had nothing more to say , mr bleckner s work could be touted as a clever response to the problem painting about painting s demise but his work has also been embraced for being essentially the opposite not ironic , its melancholia a sincere reaction to aids mr bleckner has reinforced this view by , among other things , filling his dimly lighted pictures with urns , candelabra , flowers , ghostly birds and other funerary motifs , not to mention by giving them titles that explicitly refer to aids and death oscar wilde famously said that all bad poetry is sincere , and the same could be said of bad painting there s no question that in his personal affairs mr bleckner has been an effective and tireless advocate for aids causes but his art is something else , and it s hard to know whether it is better for him that it be thought of as sincere or as ironic , because if the first , he is a sentimental purveyor of pseudovictorian kitsch , and if the second , he is exploiting a serious issue i suppose it s also possible to see his message as the difficulty of conveying , in paint , feelings adequate to the enormity of aids and death but this convoluted notion requires leaping through intellectual hoops for an art that does n't inspire it not that mr bleckner s admirers have n't leaped through plenty of them the essays in the show s catalogue are sprinkled with comparisons to tintoretto , velazquez and caravaggio absurd though this is , it does reveal an essential problem with mr bleckner s art it accommodates itself too easily to whatever happens to be the intellectual topic du jour , not to mention to whatever end seems apropos the end of painting , the end of the century , the end of life they become interchangeable in mr bleckner s work which is one reason it seems slick another is literally the way mr bleckner handles paint to be sure , his images can be superficially seductive , with their burnished surfaces , elaborate glazes and dark backdrops combined with dazzling light effects that can bring to mind the illuminated spaceship in steven spielberg s close encounters of the third kind \( mr bleckner has said how much he admires mr spielberg \) actually , mr bleckner s best paintings are n't the most complicated ones in a group of 1994 pictures , oplike grids of blurry ovals , strongly colored , seem to throb and float against indeterminate gray fields mr bleckner has returned time and again to this basic idea pitting suave surfaces against illusions of depth this may mean that pictures like these recent ones are just moody , romanticized variations on what bridget riley and larry poons were doing 30 years ago , but they have a definite visual punch nonetheless
tokyo , may 16 shoko asahara , who was arrested today on murder charges connected with the nerve gas attack on the tokyo subway system , had always sought fame in japan , although perhaps not the kind he acquired in recent weeks as a young man , he told several people that he wanted to become prime minister as recently as 1990 , he ran for parliament , but after his loss he seemed to give up on politics as a road to power and became more radical in the leadership of his religious sect , aum shinrikyo mr asahara , whose real name is chizuo matsumoto , was born 40 years ago in a rural area in southern japan he had poor eyesight and so his father , a tatami weaver , sent him to a special school for the blind mr asahara s biographer says his eyesight was probably good enough for him to have attended a regular school because his eyesight was better than that of the other pupils at the special school , mr asahara emerged as a natural leader , the one who could tell the others what was going on around them some people believe that mr asahara s effort to start a sect was an attempt to recreate the environment of his school for the blind a martial arts enthusiast , mr asahara earned a black belt in judo and became interested in yoga as well religious scholars say he is an excellent yoga practitioner , and his sect is in fact an outgrowth of a successful yoga school he operated mr asahara came to tokyo in 1976 , initially to study to enter tokyo university he was not admitted but instead set up a store selling traditional chinese medicines this led to his first brush with the law he was arrested for selling fake medicines , and fined his business collapsed around that time , he married his wife , tomoko , who is today also a senior official of aum shinrikyo his five children live in the sect headquarters , and one of them , an 11yearold girl , was ranked as a high official and by some accounts was supposed to be his successor none of mr asahara s family members have been arrested , and they are believed to still be living in building no 6 of the sect s headquarters , near mount fuji with his yoga school flourishing , and an increasing emphasis on mystical teachings , mr asahara founded aum shinrikyo in 1989 with 10 followers it campaigned very aggressively for new members , particularly university students , and mr asahara proved masterful in marketing religion in ways to appeal to bright young men and women searching for greater meaning in their lives the sect grew very rich , in part because mr asahara advised members who wanted to become monks that they had to part with all their worldly possessions by handing them over to the sect while his followers fasted to the point of malnutrition , mr asahara master asahara , they called him grew a paunch and drove around in his own rollsroyce indeed , one of the clues that mr asahara was hiding in kamikuishiki , the village where his headquarters was located , was that sect members continued to buy extremely expensive melons of which he was fond no one else in the sect was entitled to the melons in recent years , mr asahara described his health as poor and sometimes hinted that he was dying his theology also seemed to grow more bleak , and he frequently preached that the world would erupt in war by 1997 and that only members of the sect could count on surviving we all die , mr asahara declared in a recent pamphlet , urging people to attend a program of his called death and rebirth modern japan has been unjustly deprived of the concept of death and life after death , he added , offering to teach people more about both photo businessmen watch a television report about shoko asahara , the sect leader who has been accused in the tokyo subway gas attack \( reuters \)

santa clara , calif , jan 18 it capsized troy aikman 19 times , soiled his uniform and dislodged his mouthpiece the san francisco 49er defensive line may come from all walks of life there s a hay baler and a restaurateur , to name two but it keeps meeting at the quarterback aikman , its target , was sacked four times in last sunday s playoff game , and that s not counting the 15 other times he was knocked off his feet as deion sanders will testify from his atlanta days , a defensive secondary is only as good as its pass rush , and the 49ers now have some semblance of one just in time for the super bowl it is an evolution two years in the making , and san francisco has emmitt smith to thank smith , in the january 1993 conference title game , was a bull in the 49ers' china shop had he been dusted for san francisco fingerprints , none would have been found so 49ers coach george seifert vowed to draft defense , and more defense , and his wide firstround 1993 selection was a 300pound defensive tackle , dana stubblefield of kansas stubblefield s resume did not include his three years on the farm he was raised , originally , on the streets of cincinnati , but his mother wanted a change of scenery so she and her son moved to rural cleves , ohio , and they found they could leave their door unlocked to stubblefield , it was a delightful departure , but his mother missed her friends in the city dana allowed her to move back on one condition he could stay behind and graduate from high school he needed temporary guardians and terry and martha heat volunteered martha had been one of stubblefield s teachers , terry had gone to high school with stubblefield s mother and they had a son , matt , who was approximately stubblefield s age it was a snug fit , except for one small detail dana had never milked a cow it was like taking a kid out of a candy store and putting him into a dental office , stubblefield said of country living stubblefield is black , the heats are white and their barn was integrated with five different kinds of animals but they were a happy family , until matt and dana went hunting one day matt and i used to go out and shoot a 12gauge rifle and kill birds and feed them to the barn cats , stubblefield said and one day , we 're out there , and i 've got this big overall green army jacket on just full of bullets , and my 12gauge is loaded and we 're just walking around , and something moves in the bushes we just unload pow , pow , pow , pow and it was n't nothing then , all of a sudden , we turn around and there s a police officer standing down there with a gun pointing at us , telling us to freeze and one walks out of the bushes that we were shooting at dana and matt were deposited on the family doorstep , but terry heat did not ground them he told them to bale some hay instead he s 100 percent country , stubblefield said of his foster father he always has a big fat cigar in his mouth , he s got his cowboy hat on , he s got his big , fat belt buckle on just laid back , always takes his time and does things right real country the experience paid off during stubblefield s recruiting trip to kansas on his campus visit , he won a haybaling contest at a county fair , flipping the heavy hay like a frisbee , and the jayhawk coaches admired his strength they were , 'we need a guy like you , ' stubblefield said soon , he would wind up as the 1993 national football conference defensive rookie of the year , and the 49ers were on the defensive map again all stubblefield needed now was neighbors san francisco drafted defensive tackle bryant young the son of an auto worker out of notre dame in the first round and then scoured the earth for veteran free agents richard dent and rickey jackson were brought in for pass rushing from the defensiveend spots , and , then on the first day of training camp seifert walked by another defensive linemen without recognizing him dennis brown brown had been a chronic overeater , denting the scale at 330 pounds in 1993 but he arrived in baggy jeans for the 1994 season , 50 pounds lighter and able to fit into one polaroid picture he became their best defensive end against the run by the middle of this season , an injury to dent left a void in the pass rush it was the only snag in the 49er sweater , until seifert had a brainstorm tim harris harris had recorded 17 sacks for the 49ers in 1992 , but he had then fled for philadelphia , where he alienated the eagle coaches and seriously injured his elbow i was 30 , and it looked like it was pretty much over , harris said an old friend , larry silva , offered him a partnership in an eclectic california restaurant , larry s surf and turf , although harris s only qualification was that he had played on turf when seifert phoned him 12 weeks into this season , he was about to sit a party of four to a nonsmoking table , harris said during his first workout with the team , he slipped six times while passrushing , and the 49ers told him to see them in three weeks he ran on the beach twice a day , and , on his return visit , he destroyed offensive tackle steve wallace in practice i'm back , i'm back , he shouted his contract called for 5 , 000 per sack , and he rang up two of them alone in the dallas game last sunday his fingerprints were all over aikman and smith , and his presence completes the 49ers' role reversal into a defensive menace i'm thinking about treating the team at larry s surf and turf , harris said it 'll be on the house , of course they brought me to the super bowl , so i ca n't very well charge them

michael sommer , a 70yearold retired salesman , is enduringly fond of his coop in forest hills , queens he enjoys being board president in his eight years in the job , though , his attention has been arrested by a certain amount of aggravation there was the uprising five years ago when the board raised the maintenance fee there was the child unwilling to cease rollerskating in his apartment until he moved to california and who could forget the elderly woman who , for no discernible reason , would steal out of her apartment during the night , jam the frontdoor lock and pitch cups of coffee at the hallway walls she ended up in a nursing home none of these episodes spooked him but his eyes did enlarge a couple of years ago when he read that an incensed tenant in woodside , queens , had murdered his coop board president in what was probably the most perverse and permanent resolution of coop tension that made me a little nervous , mr sommer said that was n't too funny harrowing as it may be to buy a coop apartment , there remains the challenge of trying to live in it as much as boards strive to create homogenized environments , coop owners say , the contours of life in coops can sometimes veer sharply away from the idealized notion of communal behavior people are dealing with where they live and where they have staked a considerable amount of their savings , and so while strife among neighbors is distracting enough in rental buildings in new york , everything gets more rambunctious in coops in interviews , dozens of coop owners waxed reverent about the beauty of their apartments only after they got to talking in detail about daytoday life , however , did concerns about the constrictions of the coop world emerge that is about when they became bashful about having their names used as one queens coop owner put it \( after carping about being fined for storing wet boots outside his door \) if a board member sees this , we could be talking bigtime trouble maybe another fine a constant concert some years ago , a family moved into a seemingly placid , upper west side coop of some luxuriance above them lived a pianist with unwavering fidelity , she practiced eight hours a day when the husband phoned to ask if she might cut back , she hung up on him when he knocked on the door , the pianist s husband slammed it in his face the newcomers essentially evacuated their living room a newspaper review of one of the pianist s performances compared listening to her to being locked in a broom closet with the united states marine band that was the sensation in their living room it drove them to juvenile behavior i did a very vicious thing totally unlike me , the husband said i put the speakers of my stereo right next to the ceiling , dialed a rap station and turned the stereo as loud as possible we did that for a week that brought new problems on three occasions , the couple said , the pianist deliberately caused her bathtub to overflow so that it dripped through the light fixtures of the couple s apartment the enduring distress encouraged the wife of the aggrieved couple to get on the board , and when the pianist refused to temper her behavior , the coop began litigation it dragged on , in various forms , for 15 years at great expense finally , a judge ordered the pianist not to touch her piano until her apartment was soundproofed put off by the cost , she signaled defeat she moved out the garden club barbara brine , a realestate agent , very much likes her life in the majestic , at 115 central park west when i came here from a rental building on the east side , i thought being in a coop would be very different , she recalled now i 'll know my neighbors and it will be very friendly the first thing i got on the day i moved in was a note from the super saying i was making too much noise i was hanging a picture that was my welcome from a neighbor ms brine has a small terrace and a large interest in gardening a couple of years ago , she and a neighbor thought of starting a garden club in the building i did n't know what to plant to handle the wind facing north , she said and i had a lot of trouble getting vines to grow invitations were circulated to everyone with a terrace about a dozen people turned out for the first meeting mayhem resulted , ms brine said everyone had their own agenda why is my terrace being torn up for the second time in eight years \?

for the big national broadcasters , the unsettled status of the telecommunications bill was not totally unsettling because none of the issues they care about remain in dispute the bill , whenever it is passed by congress , will give the largest station owners , such as the broadcast networks , the right to increase their television station ownership up to a level equal to 35 percent of the television homes in the country the provisions for radio are scheduled to be loosened even more , with no limits set on the number of stations any one broadcaster can own nationally , and a sliding scale on the number they can own in one city the prospect of such a change in radio drove up the stock prices yesterday for big radio station owners such as infinity broadcasting , which saw its shares rise 375 , to 3650 on the new york stock exchange the only reason television station owners did not experience the same bounce , said derek blaine , an analyst for paul kagan associates , a firm that specializes in media companies , was broadcast valuations are already sky high in anticipation of this bill being passed one senior network executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that renewed haggling over the bill between democrats and republicans yesterday was not likely to affect anything in the bill important to broadcasters , other than timing an awful lot has been resolved , the executive said i suspect even if this were to carry over until next year , it would still come out pretty much this way on the major issues the major issues for the broadcast networks have been the lifting of the current cap on ownership from stations that reach up to 25 percent of the national television homes to stations that reach up to 35 percent and how much of a station a company must own to have that station count against its 35 percent total the latter issue , called attribution , would have the most impact on rupert murdoch s fox broadcasting company , because fox has taken a minority percentage in a number of recent station deals fox had wanted the new telecommunications bill to include a provision that would keep intact the current complicated attribution formula current rules have allowed fox to buy a 20 percent stake in stations owned by new world communications without having that investment count in the total number of stations attributed to fox the federal communications commission has already given notice that it will conduct a rulemaking procedure on the attribution rules , and the commission is widely expected to toughen those rules if the new world stations are forced to be counted as part of the total attributed to fox , that network would jump immediately to the 35 percent national limit that development would endanger other deals fox has made for minority interests in companies such as savoy broadcasting and black star broadcasting the question of the timing of the passage of the bill is most important to the westinghouse electric corporation , which gained a waiver from the fcc when it completed its deal to acquire cbs last month the combination of stations owned by westinghouse and stations added in the cbs deal means the cbs westinghouse stations now reach 33 percent of the country that deal was concluded in anticipation that the station limit would grow to 35 percent if the telecommunications bill is delayed , cbs will be forced to ask for an extension to its waiver we expect to get it , a senior cbs executive said but it could get ugly we 'd much rather have the bill passed if the bill passes in the next week or even sometime next year , the immediate result is likely to be a renewed buying frenzy in television stations broadcasters will seek to expand their station base , knowing that economies of scale are especially good in the broadcast business , said sharon armbrust , a senior analyst with kagan associates david westin , president of abc , said if the bill passed , we 'll be looking for television stations , though prices are certainly going to be a challenge he noted that station prices have soared since the television marketplace was roiled by fox s investment of 500 million for its 20 percent stake in new world two years ago that set off a long roundelay of affiliation switches , which led to a further round of defensive moves by broadcasters the most significant of those moves was the signing of longterm affiliation contracts between networks and affiliates mr westin said those contracts would affect whatever station purchases were made by networks in the wake of the bill because of things like 10year affiliation deals , networks will necessarily look first to buys stations already affiliated with them , mr westin said you can look for some deals that result in affiliation swaps but as a practical matter we 'll be looking first to abc affiliates

albany , oct 11 the state senate today confirmed 36 of gov george e pataki s nominees many of them his political supporters and campaign contributors to an assortment of posts , rejecting none the confirmations , ranging from the important to the minor , included two men named to run the state s mental health department and the division of human rights the approvals of the nominees came as democrats complained that the pataki administration had used a number of posts to reward supporters i think it s excessive the way that they are using the levers of government to reward people for their partisan political activities and their fund raising , said senator franz s leichter , a democrat from manhattan i find it disturbing criticism focused on three nominees for directors of the state s science and technology board , which awards large grants to research institutes and companies to encourage hightechnology industries in the state the men charles dorkey 3d , david feinberg and anthony gioia have collectively made contributions of more than 86 , 000 to mr pataki s campaign their confirmations are expected to be taken up by the senate on thursday but mr gioia , a businessman from buffalo , dismissed the criticism and said that it was not unusual for a politician to appoint someone who was a campaign supporter it s not the first time this has happened in the history of either party , said mr gioia , who like the others would receive no salary if confirmed i supported governor pataki because we shared the same ideology , and he would like that ideology implemented through his appointments mr pataki also nominated to minor posts a number of other people who contributed to his campaign , including james ortenzio , a business executive from new york city , and louise woerner , who heads a home health care company in rochester their collective contributions totaled 25 , 500 the senate voted to approve mr ortenzio s nomination to the board of trustees of cornell university , as well as approving ms woerner s nomination to the public health council the governor also nominated the rev calvin butts to both the science and technology board and the empire state development corporation , an economicdevelopment agency the rev butts gave mr pataki s campaign a major push last year after he invited the governor to speak to his congregation at the abyssinian baptist church , a prominent black church in harlem the formal vote in the republicancontrolled senate took place this afternoon after a roughly onehour hearing before the senate finance committee in which every one of the 36 nominees was accepted with no resistance the senate will resume the nomination hearings on thursday james l stone , 55 , a former director of mental health and community services in monroe county , was approved as commissioner of the mental health department , one of the nation s largest mental health systems , with 2 , 300 employees and a 2 billion annual budget he has been acting commissioner since his nomination in august his salary will be 102 , 335 the senate also filled two other important posts today , voting to accept edward mercado as the new commissioner of the division of human rights and roland m malan as the new inspector general of the metropolitan transit authority mr mercado s salary will be 82 , 614 , while mr malan will earn 102 , 335
south orange like other small towns across the nation , south orange has been fighting a losing battle against shopping malls since the 1970 s , when two malls were built nearby , business failures have turned the village s central business district into a checkerboard of shuttered storefronts but south orange is fighting back with an offbeat approach to redevelopment anticipating a new commuter rail link that will open in 1996 , and taking advantage of a 1992 state law giving greater clout to municipalities that want to finance their own urban renewal , it has begun what village officials hope will be a complete makeover we understand that we will never compete with the malls for large stores , said barbara sacks , the south orange village administrator what we can attract is the kind of small service businesses that you do n't find in the malls that is the strategy behind the first phase of the village s plan south orange has raised 500 , 000 in lowinterest financing for a developer to renovate its biggest commercial eyesore , a row of six blighted and mostly vacant stores on south orange avenue , directly under an elevated new jersey transit railroad station the thing that makes this work , and could make things happen elsewhere in new jersey , is that the village is using its own good credit to support redevelopment , said cary heller , the developer to be sure , the partnership between mr heller and south orange has not been without strife the project was delayed for more than a month early this year , and nearly abandoned , when the village s planning board insisted that the developer seek several small tenants to provide a variety of services , and he refused to rule out the possibility of having only one tenant but that was resolved in late february , when mr heller agreed to seek at least three tenants now , he says he is trying to lure a gourmet food store , a printing shop , a diner , a bakery and other small stores , and expects the first , the bakery , to move in by the end of june south orange , meanwhile , has bigger plans in january , the village trustees approved a blueprint for the blocks surrounding the train station , including a hotel , 220 new town housestyle homes , a garage and a movie theater the cost , according to village officials , is projected at 57 million , all of it dependent on private investment at a time when the new jersey economy remains weak but there are reasons the plan could work this is a village with unusual advantages , said patrick henry , a partner in the atlantic group , an urban development consulting firm that has been advising south orange there is reason to be enthusiastic that this will come together although there is no single culprit in the decline of south orange s business district , shopping mall culture has taken a huge toll the livingston mall and the short hills mall , both less than 20 miles from the village , have been luring shoppers for two decades , gradually pushing a furniture store , a shoe store , an art supply store and other retailers out of business but the village , with 16 , 000 residents , remains affluent the median household income is over 65 , 000 , according to the state labor department seton hall university provides a tantalizing market for retailers , and many residents commute to highpaying jobs in manhattan the village s link to manhattan is about to become more convenient new jersey transit is expected to begin operating the kearny connection , a rail line from penn station that will make its first westward stop in south orange , next march the new line will eliminate the need to make a connection in hoboken , and could bring hundreds of additional commuters through town that prospect was what attracted mr heller to the stores under the south orange train station late last year , he formed a development concern called lokko motive inc , and bought out the lease to finance the deal , he persuaded south orange to take advantage of the new jersey redevelopment act , which lets villages underwrite development in a way used more commonly by states , by selling taxfree municipal bonds to extend lowinterest loans with a 500 , 000 loan from the village , and with the new train service being readied over his stores , my project makes sense even if none of the rest of the plan happens , mr heller said but mrs sacks said the village was aggresively promoting its larger redevelopment scheme , with the new train link as its cornerstone she said village officials had begun talks with new jersey transit to construct a parking garage near the station photo a developer plans to renovate stores under the south orange train station \( lenore victoria davis for the new york times \)

watching from his perch behind the cage while the mets were taking batting practice yesterday at shea stadium , joe mcilvaine was asked which of his young outfielders possesses the most pure talent without hesitation , the mets' general manager pointed at the lean , 24yearold right fielder who happened to be taking some cuts a few hours later , the lean , 24yearold right fielder , carl everett , went out and turned last night s game around with one swing of the bat it was a fifthinning grand slam that thrust the mets to a 105 victory over the san diego padres do n't be fooled by everett s unimposing size hidden inside a frame that is generously listed at 6 feet and 190 pounds is a power source the mets are hoping to tap for years to come when everett catches hold of one , it could wind up more than 400 feet from home plate last night , he caught a 20 fastball from willie blair and launched it nearly to the base of the scoreboard in right field , an estimated 401 feet away that was with the bases loaded that was with the mets trailing by 21 in the fifth inning and that was pretty much the ball game i 'd rather hit them that far instead of having to blow them over the fence , everett said everett s first major league grand slam , one of three mets home runs , propelled jason isringhausen to his fourth victory in six decisions the mets have won 7 of their last 9 games , 13 of their last 16 and 23 of 41 since the allstar break do n't look now , but the mets are on a roll this is about as much of a nonpressure situation as you 'll ever have in the major leagues , these next six weeks , said mcilvaine the mets are playing like it , even though most know that mcilvaine will be using the time to evaluate them for next season the key for any player is learning to relax so he can let his talent come through , mcilvaine said everett is proof mcilvaine proudly pointed out his role in the development of five young players from tampa , fla dwight gooden , gary sheffield , fred mcgriff , derek bell and everett , whom he traded infielder quilvio veras to the marlins for last november growing up , everett played little league with bell and sheffield mcilvaine is hoping that everett can reach the potential of the other four everett , though , was sent to the minors on may 15 after going 11 for 57 but he is making the most of his second chance he has made strides in pitch recognition and swing selection he is not falling behind in the count as much and he is really starting to pound the ball last night s grand slam was everett s fourth home run in his last six games and his 10th of the season i told him tonight in the dugout that patience pays off , manager dallas green said he took a walk and then hit the big bomb he s been patient and selective and it s added up to some good atbats for him none better than this one it came on the heels of an isringhausen single \( the rookie pitcher s second hit of the game \) , a blair error and a bunt single by jose vizcaino blair , who had been outstanding since moving into the rotation after andy benes was traded to seattle , quickly fell behind everett and then paid dearly when he finally found the plate everett is now 30 for 108 \( 277 \) since his recall from class aaa norfolk on july 24 he has reached base safely in 14 of his last 20 plate appearances \( including seven walks \) on this homestand , he is 10 for 32 with nine runs batted in i 've just been making the pitchers pitch , everett said my last 12 atbats , they have n't thrown a firstpitch strike and i have n't swung i'm feeling comfortable , allowing myself to hit the pitch i'm looking for instead of swinging outside the zone and the home runs \? they just come , he said i do n't feel like i'm a home run hitter inside pitch jason isringhausen allowed two firstinning runs and then did not allow another hit until the sixth , when the padres touched him for another run isringhausen became the first mets pitcher this season to have two hits in a game rico brogna \( 15th \) and butch huskey \( 2d \) added the other home runs brogna s solo shot to right in the second inning traveled an estimated 415 feet huskey s homer came four batters after carl everett s grand slam , a towering blast to leftcenter that landed a foot farther than brogna s huskey , who left thursday s game after fouling a ball off his foot , went 2 for 4 blas minor , fresh off the disabled list , closed out the last three innings with six strikeouts for his first save of the season dallas green , on whether bobby jones \( bruised right index finger \) can start tomorrow s game my gut feeling is he 'll probably have to wait another day or two reid cornelius will get the start if jones cannot make it photo carl everett , right , being congratulated at the plate following his grand slam in the fifth inning last night \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg29 \)

millburn brigadoon , the evergreen fantasy about a village that leaps to life every 100 years , was welcomed as fresh and original when it opened in 1947 but by the time of its first revival , just a few years later , reviewers were already calling it dated , relegating it to the antiquity of operetta actually , the tale , about a couple of americans lost in scotland , was created some 20 years after the decline of operetta a term disavowed by lerner and loewe , who had their first success with it his viennese heritage aside , frederick loewe wrote in the broadway tradition of gershwin , kern and rodgers , mixing the sentimental and the romantic in a style that alan jay lerner described as larger than life , not operetta but it was lerner s affinity for the lugubrious that almost instantly marked his librettos as outmoded only my fair lady was saved by shaw , the master of turning obsessive loquaciousness into literate art \( more than half of lerner s words for the musicalized pygmalion were taken line by line from shaw s play \) none of the post brigadoon lerner and loewe shows \( paint your wagon , gigi and camelot \) signaled innovations in musical theater rather , they aspired to preserve a sense of the adventurous , the extravagant and the mythic trim a lumpy line here , cut a limp joke there , and brigadoon is no more dated than phantom of the opera , beauty and the beast , miss saigon even the comparatively modern sunset boulevard , with its 1950 source for broadway s ostensibly new musicals are mere technological transplants the old hat mechanically converted into the hot ticket if any regional theater has full possession of the resources to transform brigadoon into a geewhiz demonstration of vanishing hills , descending trees and all manner of highland voodoo , it s the paper mill playhouse instead , david holdgrive , the director , goes for a straightforward rendering of score and text , inviting easy attacks on grounds of datedness neither obviously revisionist nor overly reverential , the paper mill brigadoon , with desmond heeley s settings an enchanted glen , a village square on loan from the 1986 new york city opera production , is , above all , musically satisfying given voices that measure up to loewe s luscious melodies , the show s real accolades belong to the musical director , jim coleman the theater s orchestra sounds simply wonderful , pouring forth the human , live sounds one no longer hears in overamplified distant broadway musicals mr coleman conducts in warming accompaniment to the singers , in masterly command of instrumental interludes when applause greets the first bars of almost like being in love , you know something beloved is in the house still , the secondact duet from this day on , a soaring ballad , is the score s romantic peak , ardently sung by joseph mahowald and lee merrill as much a dancing as a singing show , brigadoon is here the beneficiary of greg ganakas s and diana gonzalez s precise recreations of agnes de mille s original ritualistic choreography in a wide range from celebratory to mournful a graceful cast overcomes a surfeit of subplots , and the ensemble is appropriately leisurely as the townspeople who take life one century at a time john clonts brings off a ravishing come to me , bend to me ms merrill s highflying , accurate soprano matches mr mahowald s heroic vocal splendor as tommy , an american tourist in flight from an overbearing fiancee , desperately seeking his passport to disappear so he can live eternally with fiona \( ms merrill \) the pair realize lerner s paean to longing fulfilled in contrast , p j benjamin s cynical and humorous take on jeff , tommy s earthbound friend , puts a levelheaded perspective on an otherworldly love by the time tommy returns to new york , though , mr mahowald s trancelike glow provides the necessary suspension for belief in the miraculous even though lerner wrote that in real life he had no such divine fantasies , it is clear that brigadoon is his everlasting sublimation loewe s music , forever sublime , is the wishedfor consummation brigadoon paper mill playhouse brookside drive millburn performances continue through may 28 wednesday through sunday , 8 pm thursday , 2 pm saturday and sunday , 3 pm \( 201 \) 3764343 photo larger than life , not operetta , is how alan jay lerner described the 1947 show brigadoon , which he wrote with frederick loewe \( gerry goodstein \)
at this time of year , it is no surprise to encounter l'enfance du christ , hector berlioz s sacred trilogy , and sir charles mackerras and the orchestra of st luke s will oblige on saturday evening at carnegie hall but it is a surprise at any time to encounter the composer s lone comic opera , beatrice et benedict , which yale opera , of the yale university school of music , will present at alice tully hall in semistaged form on wednesday evening in different ways , these relatively late works , both with texts by the composer , have always been considered somehow apart from the rest of berlioz s output l'enfance du christ \( 1854 \) , which tells of the holy family s flight to egypt to avoid herod s slaughter of infants , was one of the rare works of berlioz to be received with considerable enthusiasm in his native france during his lifetime , and it has never lost its popularity it is generally regarded as a product of a kinder and gentler berlioz beatrice et benedict \( 1862 \) , his last major work , was produced by extracting the beatrice and benedick subplot from shakespeare s much ado about nothing while writing it , the composer was suffering considerable physical distress along with the frustration of being unable to mount his opera les troyens , which he must have known was his greatest work apart from its dazzling overture and a couple of numbers that are acknowledged to be among the composer s most beautiful music , beatrice has never won more than respectful attention though there have been four recordings , at least two on cd , none is currently available all of which might suggest that l'enfance is the better understood of these works but in fact no work of berlioz s may be more misunderstood none of the available recordings , for example , can be easily recommended , and even among the unavailable ones , serious scrounging is required the composer does not seem to have wanted to be obscure on the contrary , the more you look at his major works , the plainer it becomes how desperately he wanted to be clear and , indeed , how clear he was the performers most likely to succeed are those who respond most openly and honestly to the text rather than try to impose attitudes or theories on it the obvious place to look first is the opening of l'enfance , the introduction to part 1 , herod s dream the narrator sings a mere 30 bars , accompanied at first only by flutes , clarinets and bassoons , which can sound like a harmonium or a wheezy church organ in the manger at that time , the narrator begins , jesus had just been born but no miracle had yet made him known and already the powerful trembled , the weak hoped everyone was waiting suddenly the strings begin a tremolo , as the narrator continues , now learn , christians , what an appalling crime was suggested to the king of the jews by terror the strings come to rest on a downbeat for the second syllable of terreur , and the wind accompaniment resumes in midbar , as the narrator promises another tiding the heavenly counsel that , in their humble stable , was sent to the parents of jesus by the lord careful word inversions have put la terreur and le seigneur at the ends of these two lines this seems so simple as to be beneath discussion the detailing is so subtle that it could be discussed for hours , though you might wind up no closer to understanding the power of such obvious devices as the switch from major mode to minor going from the powerful to the weak and from the appalling crime to the heavenly counsel turn to the recordings for illumination , and you will find mostly singsongy sermonizing and sentimentalizing for performances in which these 30 bars are truly lived , you have to watch for the recording conducted by jean martinon , with alain vanzo as the narrator \( nonesuch lp s \) , and the somewhat wild and woolly one conducted by pierre dervaux , with michel senechal \( ades cd s \) berlioz had used a similar narrative technique in romeo et juliette , his dramatic symphony of 1839 there , too , he told the basic story in a prologue , then told it again in various forms of reenactment but the narration in romeo was more exotic , involving a small chorus and a solo alto out of these elements , the composer forged music s most enduring representation of the first experience of romantic love this ability to use music to render the dramatic truth of crucial human moments was berlioz s special gift in romeo , he went shakespeare one better , making of father \( not friar \) laurent an avenger who forces the veronese to face the consequences of their blood feud and effects a thundering reconciliation in l'enfance , berlioz confronted behavior even more monstrous than that of the feuding veronese herod s crime and the commentators never seem to grasp what berlioz did , simple as it is after herod s precarious mental state is discussed by a pair of soldiers , in a delectable night scene , the king is

washington as marcia clark showed a jury an incriminating trail of blood on tuesday afternoon , another mystery of sorts unraveled at a house subcommittee hearing on capitol hill lynne cheney , the reagan appointee who ran the national endowment for the humanities for more than six years , loudly argued for its death as punishment for a project she deplores called the national history standards the mystery \? this project was originally financed and guided by none other than mrs cheney , who called it her single most important legacy and her favorite grant before leaving the neh after the '92 election now that her husband , dick cheney , has dropped his presidential bid , has she turned against her former agency so she can play her own starring role in the culture war that the far right hopes to ride to the white house \? except for one congressman , david skaggs of colorado , who caught mrs cheney in a lie on tuesday , her double game has gone largely unprobed the free ride must end as the new gop majority moves to zero out an agency whose flyspeck budget \( 177 million \) underwrites the preservation of our most valued museum and library artifacts even as it furthers new touchstones like ken burns s civil war the story begins last october , when mrs cheney took to the wall street journal to deliver her first attack on the history standards a lesson plan for schoolteachers devised by teachers , historians and mainstream academic organizations she faulted the guidelines for political correctness , suggesting that pressure groups had forced an overemphasis on the likes of harriet tubman at the expense of white men and the constitution her battle cry was immediately picked up by rush limbaugh , who led the call for the neh to be abolished along with the national endowment for the arts but as the historian jon wiener documents in the new republic , few had actually read the standards to verify mrs cheney s mischievous , at times inaccurate characterization of them the standards are in fact an imperfect , middleoftheroad committee product and voluntary to boot as mrs cheney distorted the standards , so she also may have distorted the chronology of how her oncebeloved project went wrong according to three sources who worked on it , a 100page draft of the opening section was available to mrs cheney when she was still at the neh and still singing the standards' praises that draft contained some of the same elements the treatment of the constitution , for instance that mrs cheney so strenuously denounces now what did mrs cheney know and when did she know it \? the answer is important not only because it tells us whether she is a hypocrite but because it will indicate to what extent she has manufactured this whole controversy for political ends did mrs cheney turn against the standards and the neh because both have changed so radically since the '92 election or simply because she will stop at nothing to be a major player in the gingrich order \? the evidence suggests she has deliberately caricatured her own former pet project as pc hell incarnate so it can be wielded as a mapplethorpelike symbol to destroy the agency she so recently championed no less suspect were the two other witnesses who trashed the endowments on tuesday the bestselling author william bennett , also an neh chairman in the 80 s , is happy to kill the agency now that he no longer needs the 970 , 000 in grants he secured for the national humanities center in the 70 s edwin j delattre of boston university attacked others who make a living securing federal grants , but was careful not to dwell on the 27 million in neh funds his own grantsmanship has netted mrs cheney , meanwhile , continued to misrepresent the history standards in her testimony when mr skaggs recited chapter and verse from the standards' text to challenge her erroneous assertion that they emphasize a single book about a hiroshima victim in teaching about world war ii , she nervously backpedaled , saying , if i said that , i misspoke , and , maybe i read them too quickly maybe testimony this rich cries out for crossexamination is there a marcia clark in the house \?
washington , jan 29 after a month of trial balloons and uncertainty within the administration over how best to push for a higher minimum wage , this much has become clear the white house is still grappling with the question of how best to act in a new political world dominated by a republican congress just last tuesday night , president clinton promised that he would fight for an increase in the minimum wage , now 425 an hour , only to have his aides disclose the next morning that he had no immediate plans to submit legislation calling for that step since november , there has been almost total agreement within the administration about a need to increase the minimum wage a move the white house is convinced will help the plight of struggling workers while resulting in few jobs lost with labor secretary robert b reich playing a leading role , the president s advisers agreed to seek an increase in the minimum , the preference being 75 cents an hour , to 5 , over two years and by early this month , advocates of the plan were saying mr clinton would unveil the proposal no later than his state of the union message but those disclosures clashed with the strategy of leon e panetta , the white house chief of staff , and other political advisers wary of setting public targets that the republicans could shoot down , they embraced an unorthodox view that the wisest course for mr clinton in the last two years of his term would be to test congressional waters before adopting a rigid public line what the president is doing correctly in my opinion is consulting with us on what is doable in this congress , senator john b breaux , the louisiana democrat who is the chief deputy whip , said in an interview at week s end he did not do enough of that on health care this is an indication that he has certainly learned yet the mixture of policy making and commitment to consensusbuilding resulted in muddiness when the white house said on wednesday that the president was not yet ready to spell out what terms he favored , despite his call for action the previous night that apparent edging away from a plan , many of whose details were already widely known , generated so much adverse publicity that mr clinton and his aides had to spend much of the rest of the week arguing that the president truly intended to fight white house officials acknowledged that the experience had underscored the notion that too much consultation could also give the impression that mr clinton is irresolute nevertheless , white house aides pointed to the strategy of consulting first as the model that mr clinton intends to embrace on issues ranging from immigration to welfare to mexican loan guarantees , they say , it is the best way for him to try to maintain some sway over a congress whose new republican majority could quickly strike down everything he proposes we 're in an environment now where our efforts will have to be aimed less at legislation and more at a legislative strategy , said michael d mccurry , the white house spokesman if he is careful about picking his fights , aides to mr clinton say , the president firmly believes that he can achieve more in the next two years than commentators have predicted and on issues like the minimum wage , the aides say , he regards even a victory in which he must share credit with republicans as far preferable to principled defeat it was not until last weekend , after mr clinton sought advice from senator edward m kennedy , the massachusetts democrat , that the white house strategy was finally set , administration officials said mr kennedy , who had already introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage by 150 in three annual steps , to 575 an hour , convinced mr clinton that the more modest white house plan would have a better chance of winning support if the president withheld its specifics for now and left the senator s plan as the republicans' chief target i have to create the conditions in which we can raise the minimum wage if i possibly can , mr clinton said in an nbc interview last week in explaining why he had accepted that counsel i do n't want to waste a lot of time making strong posturing and undermining the chance that we can raise it but the strategy of consulting with democrats in congress to develop a consensus on the minimum wage is not an easy one , and has been plagued by leaks from within the administration this limited mr clinton s room to maneuver , some administration officials said there was some sense here that the president was being boxed in , and that was not appreciated , mr mccurry said he declined to say exactly whom the white house blamed despite the disclosures , the president s senior advisers have agreed that 1995 should be the year for him to press for the increase indeed , inflation has eroded the minimum wage to a 40year low in terms of buying power until the election , the administration had been unwilling to push for both a health care plan and a higher minimum wage , both opposed by business groups but with the republican victory and the roadblock it erected to the health care initiative , the president and his aides saw a fresh opportunity on the wage issue
trenton party leaders , heading into an election , wish for order and discipline in their own party , and disorder , food fights and rampant queue jumping for the other guys this year , it looks as if new jersey s democrats and republicans will each get half of what they wish for , the half about the other guy they can blame senator bill bradley before he dropped out it seemed that representative richard a zimmer had the republican nomination for next year s united states senate seat pretty well in his sights mr zimmer earned it by being disciplined and orderly , politely waiting for the speaker of the assembly , chuck haytaian , to challenge and lose to senator frank r lautenberg on the democratic side , representative robert g torricelli became the democratic organization s first choice i am not making any endorsements , but he is the frontrunner , i have said that , says the state chairman , tom byrne once mr bradley decided not to run but far from having a polite race , with a minimum of primary spending and bloodletting , both parties are now watching in dismay as the field begins to fill with big shots , long shots and maybe even one or two who are thought to have already had their shot one of the republican newcomers to the race is state senator richard larossa , a man with none of mr zimmer s political table manners in his four years in the legislature , which represent his entire career in politics , mr larossa has been both a thorn in the side of the hidebound senate and a feather in its cap he is careless of protocol , and sometimes of loyalties , and full of bluster yet he is a strong republican votegetter from an aging urbansuburban district that once belonged to the democrats outright , and that few other republicans dared touch the buzz in the state house on mr larossa goes like this mr zimmer is giving up his house seat to run , so if he loses , he will be out of politics and , getting to the important part , unable to punish party members who do not support him if mr larossa should fail in his bid for the senate nomination , or in the general election , he will still be a member of the state senate , and on the finance committee , where the votes have been getting closer and closer , and where the senator would be in a good position to punish people who worked against him enough said rounding out the republican field is richard duhaime , a passaic county freeholder with strength in north jersey , where the votes are , and a healthy sense that political life can exist outside of trenton waiting in the republican wings is representative marge roukema of ridgewood , the dean of the new jersey congressional delegation , who is deciding , as an aide put it , whether she can do more as a senior member of the house or as a junior member of the senate the democratic side is hardly any less messy , largely because of the approaching energy field radiated by former gov jim florio , a name that was mud in this state not long ago and may yet prove to be mr florio is thinking about toying with , he says joining the race , and his name is already on the speakers' list \( with mr duhaime , mr larossa , mr torricelli and maybe mr zimmer \) at next week s annual richard j hughes foundation fundraising dinner , a political gab fest and beauty pageant it s going to be interesting to see who can do the best job at poking fun at each other , said mr larossa , evidently relishing the thought it is supposed to be satire , not political but then , satire is always political mr florio points out that he has run three times in statewide races and never won less than 49 percent of the vote he has also won only one of those races , and his tendency to fade in the stretch gives democrats ulcers yet the polls show him running well ahead of mr torricelli , something he probably owes to high name recognition , and no one who has seen mr florio campaign can doubt the energy and focus he brings to the task the emphasis i would put on my candidacy , if i became a candidate , is on developing the ideas that you put out there in the political discussions , mr florio said with characteristic opacity the republicans have been good at this but in a shallow way , and we are starting to see right now how the contract with america is not necessarily the kind of change that people find they approve of this is a modified version of mr torricelli s game plan , which is to run against mr zimmer by running against speaker newt gingrich and the republican revolution before he can get to that , however , mr torricelli may have to get by the former governor
los angeles , may 28 one of the nation s leading fertility clinics has been ordered to close this week after its sponsor , the university of california , accused its doctors of playing god with their patients , transplanting their eggs and embryos and conducting research on them without their knowledge or consent after more than a year of investigation following what it called whistleblower complaints , the university terminated its contract this month with the clinic , the center for reproductive health , and told its doctors to remove their medical equipment from its irvine campus by friday the doctors have vigorously denied the university s allegations , which specialists said were among the most serious ever raised in the field of reproductive medicine the allegations are contained in a lawsuit filed may 16 and expanded last thursday in which the university seeks access to the clinic s records on may 20 , the founder of the internationally respected clinic , dr ricardo asch , resigned , saying the university had made it impossible for him to continue with his work simultaneously , the university placed dr asch on leave , along with two colleagues , dr sergio stone and dr jose balmaceda dr asch is one of the nation s most prominent fertility doctors , attracting patients from around the world with a procedure he developed in 1984 with dr balmaceda called gift , or gamete intrafallopian transfer the procedure involves placing a woman s eggs and a man s sperm into the woman s fallopian tubes and allowing conception to occur dr asch s lawyer , lloyd charton , said the accusations stemmed from an attempt to extort money from the doctors the accusations that dr asch conducted procedures inconsistent with the desires of his patients are completely wrong , mr charton said at no time did dr asch ever once intentionally violate the instructions of his patients if there were problems in keeping records , the lawyer said , the university shared the responsibility and if any mistakes were made in following procedures , they could have been made by technicians without the knowledge of the doctors the university has said its investigation has been hampered by the doctors' refusal to turn over their records mr charton responded that dr asch was chomping at the bit to say , 'look at these records , ' but that he was stymied by patientconfidentiality laws the issue was brought into the open this month by reports in the orange county register about the unauthorized transfer of fertilized eggs from one woman to another basically , said dr arthur caplan , director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , you 've got the most serious charges ever leveled in the history of assisted reproduction since louise brown , the first testtube baby , was born in 1978 you 've got claims made of the improper use of embryos and eggs , dr caplan said you 've got claims made that people were created under false pretenses you 've got claims made of research being done on vulnerable subjects desperate couples who were infertile without obtaining informed consent dr arthur wisot , executive director of the center for advanced reproductive care in redondo beach , calif , emphasized that none of the accusations against dr asch s clinic had been proved and he emphasized that most fertility clinics operate in an ethical manner , under multiple safeguards it is important to point out to people that we are dealing with an industry that is basically over all a safe industry , and they should n't be discouraged by these allegations , dr wisot said he said the most serious of the allegations , the transfer of embryos , was on a par with an earlier controversy in the field , the case of dr cecil b jacobson in virginia , who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1992 for using his own sperm without his patients' knowledge to impregnate scores of women among the university s accusations is that dr asch used a woman s eggs for experiments in 1993 without her knowledge and , with the controversy brewing around him , asked her just last month to sign a retroactive consent form dr asch denied this , issuing a statement in which he said i have not recently gone to anyone asking them to sign a consent form for procedures done in the past , and deny any report to the contrary not only have i not done it recently , i have never done it in my career in legal papers filed on thursday , the university added allegations that the three doctors dispensed a fertility drug , hmg massone , that had not been federally approved , and underreported to the university their incomes from private practice dr asch s lawyer said that he had done nothing wrong and that these additional charges were based on actions that were proper and defensible a spokeswoman for the university of california at irvine , frank tardiff , said the university had received a number of whistleblower complaints following the initial one in february 1994 the investigation gained momentum early this year as the university took control of all available patient records , terminated its management agreement with the fertility clinic and initiated an internal investigation of the three doctors asserting that the doctors were stonewalling , the university this month sued to obtain their medical records photo dr ricardo asch has resigned from the clinic he founded at the university of california at irvine saying the university has made it impossible to continue his work \( orange county register \)
vancouver , british columbia the vast and sparsely populated coast of british columbia is increasingly being used as a transshipment point for drugs that are smuggled overland into the united states the royal canadian mounted police , the national police force and chief lawenforcement agency against illegal drugs , attribute this to steppedup coastal enforcement by the united states and to comparatively lenient canadian penalties for drug offenses until about a halfdozen years ago , illegal drugs used in british columbia were brought in from the united states , but now there s been pretty well a 180degree turn , said staff sgt pat convey , chief of the mounties' victoria drug squad we 're seeing a lot of narcotics in this part of the world destined for the states of the drugs that are passing through western canada , the heroin that is coming primarily from the socalled golden triangle region of southeast asia is causing the most serious problems it has led to a sharp increase in fatal overdoses in british columbia because an estimated 5 to 10 percent remains in the local market the other drugs include hashish from south asia and cocaine and marijuana from south america the drugs are hidden inside shipping containers that arrive at the ports of victoria and vancouver , or are transferred from larger vessels on the open seas to fishing boats or other small craft , then dropped off at isolated beaches vancouver , one of the busiest ports in the world , receives more than 100 , 000 containers a week from dozens of ships from the pacific basin in one seizure last summer , more than 156 pounds of pure heroin was found in a container of rice vermicelli from china staff sgt jack dop , chief of an enforcement unit of the mounties' vancouver drug section , said increasing supplies were coming from china while the force does not break down figures by region , seizures of heroin have increased threefold from more than 96 pounds in 1989 to 339 pounds in 1993 nationally , according to a compilation at headquarters in ottawa figures for last year are not yet available as more drugs pass through british columbia , more are being used locally this is reflected in a nearly tenfold surge in the number of drug overdose deaths , mainly from heroin , in the province during the last halfdozen years as a result , the province s chief coroner , vince cain , has called for decriminalizing the simple possession of drugs however , he wants importers of illegal drugs to be treated as murderers he made the comment jan 20 while releasing a report showing that 331 people died of overdoses from such drugs as heroin and cocaine in british columbia in 1993 , up from 162 in 1992 and 39 in 1988 the 1993 number included 216 in metropolitan vancouver , a city of 17 million people in a province of 35 million according to the united states government s substance abuse and mental health services administration , new york has the largest number of overdose fatalities of any american city with a population of more than 7 million , new york recorded 1 , 389 such deaths in 1992 and 1 , 443 in 1991 los angeles , with a population of 35 million , had 1 , 094 in 1992 and 924 in 1991 the coroner s offices of both cities said 1993 figures were not yet available five years ago , sergeant convey said , heroin sold on the street was 4 to 10 percent pure , but now we 're seeing it anywhere from 70 to 100 percent southeast asians , who in recent years have moved to canada s west coast in large numbers , are said to be the main street traffickers competition among vietnamese , hong kong chinese and mainland chinese gangs has helped cut the price the gangs fight turf wars , which account for a rising level of violence while a small fraction of the drugs remain in this region , the rest are transported to warehouses in the interior , where shipments are prepared for the overland trek south , usually across rural border points into such states as idaho , montana and north dakota and then to the major drug consumption centers the american authorities agree that drugs are being brought across the border , but they say that it is very difficult to detect because of the ease of movement between canada and the united states neither side can give an accurate estimate of the quantity of drugs involved the mounties say they find evidence of american participation in virtually all of the shipments every importing case that we 've had in the last four years has had some american content to it , either the organizer , or the investor , or part of the distribution that seems to be american , said wayne wilkes , staff sergeant in charge of the vancouver drug section s sea interdiction unit the transshipments have also been a concern of the american authorities the more we plug up the hole , the farther north these people are moving , said bob parks , chief of the fouragent drug enforcement administration office in blaine , wash it s so remote up there it s virtually impossible to patrol that s a big chunk of water out there

mr matsuno had never before told his secret , and when he came out of the closet by posting his message on a computer bulletin board for gay teenagers , the response was overwhelming he received a private message that night from another gay youth in california , and they chatted by computer for three hours in subsequent days , more than 100 supportive email letters poured in now a regular contributor to the bulletin board , mr matsuno has kept its readers up to date on his decision to tell his mother \( he gave her a book , a flower and a tellall letter \) being on the bulletin board finally gave me the initiative to go through with telling my mother , mr matsuno said in a telephone interview i 'd been reading these guys' postings and seeing how they 'd done it the fact that all these guys are secure with themselves gave me courage mr matsuno is one of a growing number of gay teenagers , previously isolated and fearful in their separate hometowns , who are using the internet and other computer networks to declare their homosexuality , ask questions and seek support from other gay youths along with online meetings of alcoholics and support groups for the parents of terminally ill children , the sites for gay and lesbian youths are the source of some of the most stirring stories in cyberspace one of the beauties of the internet is that nobody knows you 're 15 and live in montana and are gay , said reid fishler , 19 , the founder of the youth assistance organization , an internet site that includes an electronic pamphlet , i think i might be gay \( now what do i do \? \) it s a great place because the electronic curtain is not a closet mr fishler , who grew up in huntington , li , said he started his internet site because i did not want to see anybody go through what i went through , basically four years of hell in high school , knowing i'm different and not having anywhere to go although there is no accurate measure of traffic on the information highway , anecdotal reports suggest the popularity of online sites for gay teenagers , which include bulletin boards , chat rooms and multimedia sites on the world wide web the most popular bulletin boards receive 15 to 30 messages a day , and system operators estimate there are thousands of lurkers who have not yet found the nerve to join in the sites flourish despite what some civil libertarians see as a potential for censorship that could result from current legislation intended to shield minors from indecency on computer networks , and despite the occasional attempts by older men to sexually solicit gay youths boys 14 to 16 , said chris kryzan , a marketing consultant and director of out proud , a coalition of gay youths , typically ask , i think i'm gay , but how do i know for sure \?

next they 'll want the empire state building they ca n't have it new jersey s case is grounded more on the intent of the initial effort to resolve its unhappiness with colonial charters these set the border between the states on its bank of the hudson river an earlier unresolved supreme court case prompted an 1834 agreement to redraw the border line down the middle of the hudson river but new york retained jurisdiction over ellis island even though it was west of the line , while new jersey got the underwater rights we consider the filled portion of ellis island part of new jersey , said mr yannotti , a new jersey assistant attorney general , and we want that to be established the federal government took possession of ellis island for the famous immigration processing center built in the 1890 s and started a massive landfill in the early 1900 s to create an area for a hospital at the time , new jersey demanded that its stake be recognized the government paid it 1 , 000 for the right to complete that landfill , which constitutes the southern portion of the ushaped island the question now is which state gets to exercise administrative and political jurisdiction over the various landfill bits at present , new york gets all of the tax revenue , as well as almost exclusive use of the main symbol of the american immigration experience the sales tax from food and souvenirs amounted to 430 , 000 last year , said richard wells , a federal parks official on ellis island court documents indicate that in 1993 , employees paid 12 million in income taxes new york has also collected tens of thousands of dollars in corporate franchise taxes for construction the sums at issue now are relatively small \( if new jersey won , for example , it could claim only the sales tax from cash registers believed sitting on landfill \) but new jersey wants to stake a claim to future economic benefit if longpostponed restoration plans lead to a hotel or convention center on the island winning would also strengthen new jersey s hand in trying get a pedestrian bridge built , thereby siphoning off a larger share of the three million annual visitors to ellis island and the statue of liberty the supreme court , mandated to settle territorial disputes between states , appointed a law professor , paul r verkuil , to make a recommendation in the case hearings are to start may 6 on the island itself they were initially set for november , but were postponed largely because of the alpine proportions of the documents the teams pawed through thousands of pages of old deeds and maps and lists in the national archives , the newyork historical society , the new york public library , and the new jersey historical society , plus at least half a dozen university collections none of the participants are around anymore , mr yannotti said , so essentially this whole story is going to be told through the documents interested in royalty \? read the june 24 , 1664 , charter from the duke of york granting what is now new jersey \( sans islands \) to two men , lord berkeley and sir george carter like maps \? pore over dozens , including the 1776 ratzer map published in london showing the islands within new york s boundaries or the early 20th century maps from the us department of war titled ellis island , nj no agency is too obscure , no detail too small new york s evidence includes excerpts from the walt whitman poem mannahatta the flowing sea currents , the little islands , larger adjoining islands , the heights , the villas , the countless masts city nested in bays ! my city supposedly further buttressing new york s claim is that it used ellis island to hang a felon named charles gibbs after a life of pirate crime that included 100 murders marriage licenses , death certificates , psychiatric exams , voting rolls even the view is part of the fight new york argues that incoming immigrants stared almost exclusively toward its skyline those looking at new jersey were few and far between , its court papers say and those being booted out via the island , like emma goldman , tried to block their expulsion through federal district court in manhattan the basic documents from new jersey fill twin binders , each as thick as the combined manhattan yellow and white pages a united states government letter dated may 17 , 1808 , that was extracted from the archives at the ruth lilly medical library at indiana university ridicules the idea of paying 10 , 000 for an island worth 4 , 500 at most pages and pages detail a decision during the depression to hire bricklayers and other laborers from new jersey for work on the island and when anyone died , the undertaker came from new jersey new jersey is a little bit secretive about its case , agreeing to detail only a few greatest hits in its evidence and barring a reporter from listening to the crossexamination of the 10 expert witnesses new jersey is also a little bit dismissive about all the new york documents the lawyers often played counterintelligence games in the archives , scouring lists to see where their opponents searched and then digging through the same boxes ms kramer went so far as to try to prove that the actual dirt in the landfill was part of new york city , excavated during the construction of the subway system she could find no proof for what seems to be a longcherished piece of urban folklore the lone reference she uncovered was a speech by a federal official poetically describing the landfill as ballast from the ships of many nations what bunk ! ms kramer said what bunk ! he makes this speech like it is mud from france and mud from italy and lava from mount vesuvius and i do n't know where
if restaurants were rated for niceness , frontiere would get four stars it is hard to imagine a cozier place than this brickwalled , openfronted soho bistro , and it is constantly filled with regular clients the chef and owner , andrew nathan , and his wife , belinda , move through the room as if they were hosts at a rolling party taste this , mr nathan urges , pressing tidbits upon friends who have dropped in for a quick drink at the bar let me surprise you , he says to familiar customers as he takes their orders and once , to an embarrassed firsttime customer who had forgotten his wallet , just come back and pay me when you can if you ever write a column on how hospitable an owner can be , please include mr nathan at the top of your list , said the astonished diner , recalling the incident the nathans have perfected the art of making their customers feel at home a bottle of wine stands on each table , its cork pulled please feel free to pull the cork and pour your guests a glass , says a small note cost is by consumption only inquire about one of the other vins du patron \( which cost 17 a bottle \) and ms nathan is likely to say , let me just bring you a taste so you can see if you like it this generosity of spirit is what makes frontiere so appealing much of the food is , too some of the dishes on the menu are so good , so generous and so reasonably priced that they would bring me in even without the cheerfully casual ambiance the luxurious bacon , roquefort and leek tart , for instance , the crust sweet and strangely appealing against the saltiness of the cheese and the meat belinda s salad , a wonderful mix of chopped arugula , tomatoes , red onions and mozzarella , and the cote de boeuf , an enormous hunk of excellent steak that rides into the dining room on a wooden board and is sliced with appropriate ceremony served with a robust and garlicky potato gratin and a small pitcher of sauce bearnaise , it costs 45 for two and would easily feed both people again the next day soups are good , too one night there was a thick , bright red pepper soup that was enormously satisfying most of the salads are very good these change with the seasons but at the moment there is an appealingly autumnal creation made of roasted beets with baby greens and goat cheese and the grilled lamb chops with white beans and mashed potatoes are reliably good other dishes , however , can be uneven mr nathan , who is clearly a passionate cook , sometimes gets carried away his antipasto plate offers too many different salads on too small a plate his warm roasted mushroom salad includes endive , greens , cheese and truffle oil it all becomes a bit too much and when he combines mushrooms , potatoes and goat cheese into a dish , he muddles all the flavors fish can be hit or miss one night , monkfish with curry sauce was dry and overcooked another night , scallops in a different curry sauce were wonderful , laid on a bed of basmati rice sauteed red snapper with baby clams and mussels in a broth with fennel , saffron , tomato and aioli tastes , on occasion , like everything a new york bouillabaisse might aspire to on other nights , it has been lifeless pasta can also be a problem rigatoni with manila clams , spinach , garlic and sausage was mishandled so that the pasta was falling apart and each ingredient seemed as if it had no desire to have anything to do with the others linguine was overwhelmed by so many shrimp and peppers that the whole dish seemed overdressed most of the desserts are good the profiteroles with hot chocolate sauce are elegant little hot fudge sundaes the warm chocolate cake with macadamia nuts is a nice way to end a meal , too but the lemon mousse is disappointingly airy , and what should have been a dreamy combination of roasted peaches with pecans , cream and bourbon sauce was ruined by unripe peaches but even as i was hacking at those hard peaches and thinking how delicious that dessert should have been , i was happy to be where i was two of us had shared a cote de boeuf and a bottle of a rare and delicious provencal wine called la courtade , and i was feeling very content then a man wandered in to energetically pump mr nathan s hand i was just passing by , he said , and it looked so warm and comfortable in here that i had to come in pulling up a bar stool he added , it s nice to have you in the neighborhood i could n't agree more frontiere  199 prince street , soho , \( 212 \) 3870898 ambiance is this the perfect neighborhood restaurant \?

paris the french movie industry has good reason for feeling the blues for all the intravenous feeding it receives from the french treasury , for all its claims to be europe s last surviving movie industry , fewer french went to see its films \( and more went to see american ones \) last year than ever before clearly , living off its past no longer suffices francois truffaut , jeanluc godard , eric rohmer and other directors who created the new wave 35 years ago mean little to today s audiences and no fresh wave of talent has taken their place yet one french film has unexpectedly brought some cheer this year for most of march , gazon maudit , or bushwhacked , was no 1 at the box office , beating out such american rivals as disclosure , stargate and immortal beloved it is a comedy about a love triangle \( ah , another french love triangle \) , albeit this time between a man , a heterosexual woman and a lesbian what makes the film noteworthy is that it was written by and directed by a woman so is it women that french cinema has been waiting for \? french films , of course , have never failed to put on a pretty face whether it was anouk aimee , brigitte bardot or jeanne moreau in the early 1960 s or emmanuelle beart , juliette binoche , isabelle adjani or sophie marceau today but calling the shots offcamera was different back in the new wave days , agnes varda was the exception that proved the rule she made a number of successful films , not least cleo from 5 to 7 , but she was never left in doubt that directing was considered a man s business as recently as the 1980 s , when diane kurys , claire denis , aline isserman and chantal ackerman were making lowbudget movies in france , the rule still held the bigname french directors claude berri , bertrand tavernier , alain corneau and the like were almost all male only coline serreau struck gold with three men and a cradle , remade in the united states as three men and a baby but now , the films of female french directors are seemingly everywhere , in festivals and theaters both inside and outside france in new york , for example , martine dugowson s mina tannenbaum and agnes merlet s son of the shark were released last month ms varda is still busy at the age of 66 , those in their 40 s are finding it easier to launch projects , and , most significant , younger french women and , in the case of josiane belasko , the established actress who made bushwhacked , not so young are making first and second films that are being noticed and often acclaimed it is certainly too early to proclaim a new new wave it is probably premature to identify a movement but there is no doubt that a phenomenon exists ms denis s i ca n't sleep , ms kurys s 6 days , 6 nights and nelly kaplan s plaisir d'amour , are due in the united states later this year \( ms kurys s film opens on may 6 \) five of nine semiautobiographical films recently commissioned by the frenchgerman cultural television channel , arte , were by women three of the five movies nominated for best first features in this year s cesars , the french oscars , were also by women by all accounts , this is not a result of any drive for sex equality in the movie industry or of a fashionable new interest in women s films the women s liberation movement may have helped push women up the ladder in many professions in france , but even educated french women tend to disparage militant feminism as yet another american cultural import certainly , french women who direct movies want recognition as directors and not as women i have always refused to be associated with women s film festivals or articles about women directors , ms kurys said , explaining why she did not want to be interviewed on the subject i do n't want to be tagged as a woman director i think that puts women back into the ghetto anyway , i do n't feel any special identity with other women directors i often feel closer to men ms varda , with 25 feature films to her name in a career dating back to 1954 , was more relaxed than ms kurys on the issue i was n't the first french woman director , she said over tea in her montparnasse officecumhome there was germaine dulac and marie epstein in the 1930 s and jacqueline audry in the 1940 s she leafed through a book that described their work but for a long time i was alone , she went on what stopped women from making films \? fear \? selfcensorship \? men would n't let them \? but they also were n't pushing today , it s no longer an issue there are n't women s films or men s films there are just films her words may hold a key to the explanation for the change daniel toscan du plantier , an independent producer who also heads unifrance , france s international movie promotion association , believes there are more films by women today because women are no longer making women s films neither the public nor producers had much interest in ideological movies , he said the new directors are not making films because they are women they are not trying to carry out a social revolution through cinema the scripts they are coming up with are much closer to the market
chicago , oct 31 the latest study to explore whether eating fish reduces the risk of heart disease has found that it does that is , eating modest quantities and reducing the risk of a certain type of the illness the study found that people who ate the equivalent of three ounces of salmon a week were only half as likely to be stricken with cardiac arrest as those who ate no fish the results are being published on wednesday in the journal of the american medical association the findings may seem to conflict with a wellpublicized study in the spring by harvard researchers , who found that men who ate fish several times a week were just as likely to have heart trouble as those who ate fish once a month but the lead author of the new study , dr david s siscovick of the university of washington in seattle , said , we view these results as complementary and not in conflict with earlier findings the studies differed in two main ways , dr siscovick said the seattle study focused on cardiac arrest rather than overall heart disease , which was the chief concern of the harvard study also , the seattle study explored the value of eating some fish compared with eating none , rather than the harvard report s focus on eating more versus eating less in the new study , modest amounts of seafood containing two important omega3 oils were sufficient , dr siscovick said the oils are unique to fish , and are especially plentiful in salmon , herring , mackerel and anchovies to a lesser degree , they are present in oysters , sardines , rainbow trout , albacore tuna and other fish and shellfish one threeounce serving of salmon provides as much of the oils as two threeounce servings of albacore tuna no one knows why omega3 oils might reduce the risk of cardiac arrest , but one theory is that they may help regulate the movement of chemical compounds called electrolytes calcium , potassium , sodium and others in and out of cells cardiac arrest is different from what most people regard as a heart attack in a heart attack , a blocked artery prevents the heart muscle from getting enough blood , and part of it dies most victims survive in cardiac arrest , arteries are not clogged but electrical impulses that regulate the heart s rhythm are scrambled instead of pumping , the organ just quivers most victims die before emergency workers can jumpstart their hearts dr siscovick s team measured the levels of the two crucial oils in red blood cells in their subjects and found that higher levels were associated with lower risk of cardiac arrest that strengthens the findings , dr siscovick said cardiac arrest among apparently healthy people is rare , he noted , estimating that it strikes about 2 people in 10 , 000 annually but on a nationwide scale , the problem claims more than 250 , 000 lives a year , representing almost half of people who die of heart problems , the american heart association estimates dr alberto ascherio , who headed the harvard study , agreed that the seattle research complemented rather than contradicted his own it s a good study , dr ascherio said , adding that his own research also found an advantage in eating some fish compared with eating none previous studies of fish and fish oil supplements have yielded confusing findings consuming fish has been found to have positive effects on blood , blood pressure and arteries fish oil capsules have increased levels of the socalled bad cholesterol in some people and lowered other blood fats and blood pressure in others dr ascherio and dr siscovick said more research was needed the seattle study analyzed all cases of cardiac arrest among apparently healthy people in king county , wash , from 1988 to 1994 researchers compared eating habits of the 334 people whose deaths met study criteria with 493 similar living people the researchers controlled statistically for other factors that could have affected risk , like family history , smoking habits , high blood pressure , diabetes , weight and physical activity
if i were in a critical frame of mind , there would be no end of caviling here an unevenness in 64thnote passages , there the loss of an inner voice , elsewhere a failure to differentiate timbral qualities between sections more practice is needed in one spot , more attention to the harmonic progression in another , more dissection of difficult passages throughout but i am patient and longsuffering for i am also the player the piece is one of the more difficult in the keyboard literature , bach s goldberg variations , and some years ago i decided that in the precious minutes that fell my way , free of professional duties , i would gradually add it to a private library of partly mastered repertory this arduous task is devoted to possessing the work but also to being possessed by it it is partly a physical labor , with crisp cascades articulated up and down the keyboard , but also more a humbling reminder of why a critic got into this business in the first place the harpsichordist ralph kirkpatrick prepared one of the best performing editions of the goldbergs in a long preface , he wrote of the unearthly pure sweetness and a lyricism in every phrase that makes one long to dissolve one s fingers , the instrument and one s whole self into three or four singing voices ultimately , the work made him feel like the unworthy mouthpiece of a higher voice when i work on the goldbergs , i feel the way the cellist pablo casals must have felt when he began each day by playing bach preludes and fugues at the piano i cannot think of doing otherwise , he wrote it is a sort of benediction on the house so , too , in scattered moments , do i relish the aria , with its inner voices that add such mystery to the melody , and the canons , whose rigor seems to relax into lyricism the athletic leaps , which create uncanny dance rhythms out of sweeping gestures of hand and arm , and the crosshanded play , which molds hidden voices out of an untoward mingling of fingers studying the goldbergs over the years , with each measure carefully worked over , each voice hummed against every other , each rhythm sharpened and sculptured to be absolutely precise yet absolutely relaxed all this labor permits an intimate acquaintance with this score that i could never have acquired from listening playing is a heightened form of listening in all music , it is true , but particularly in the goldbergs this was so even at the work s origins bach s first biographer , johann nikolaus forkel , wrote that the variations were commissioned by a russian count who wanted to be amused during sleepless nights by his harpsichordist , johann gottlieb goldberg , a pupil of bach s bach made no reference to the commission when the work was published , in 1742 he wrote simply that it was prepared for the enjoyment of music lovers but what sort of music lovers did he have in mind \? the early lovers were undoubtedly meant , like the count , to watch as well as listen the wit emerges in sight as well as sound the hands mimic each other , land on top of each other , leap over each other , the acrobatic exertion giving way to sensuous thrill or poignant reflection what insomniac could find rest when faced with such display \? but the title page also calls these variations keyboard practice , leaving the impression , as so much of bach s music does , that the listener is also the player listening finds its fulfillment through practice one hears and sees and wants to play this may be one reason the work , always in the repertory of harpsichordists , has recently become a mainstream piano piece the two electrifying recordings of it that framed glenn gould s career have inspired a generation of keyboard artists vladimir feltsman , for example , credits gould s performances with awakening his own interest mr feltsman s recording on musicmasters is a fantastical variation on bach s work , with registers changed , contrapuntal lines inverted , expectations undone gould s early performance also inspired the violinist dmitry sitkovetsky to translate the goldbergs into his sound world by creating a transcription for string orchestra , recorded on nonesuch the texture takes some getting used to , but the results are robust , joyous and full of insight and in the most powerful pianistic interpretation since gould s , the young russian konstantin lifschitz , on denon , builds on that predecessor s ecstatic view of the piece , viewing it as if through a prism its grandeur glints with color i listen to these recordings again and again , as well as to another of gracious intelligence , by the harpsichordist pierre hantai on opus 111 , and then return again and again to my labors the work has become a companion i argue with it and with every performance of it i am now seeking something that i know no other player will ever provide , and that i can provide only fitfully i am working on the 13th variation these days and dare not speculate about when i shall leap into the coiled energy of the work s second half i am confident , though , that when i return to the aria at the end of the work , there will be a need for even more keyboard practice as goethe put it , let none imagine that with all their thinking they 'll ever pierce the mystery of all the song
washington , nov 21 a study of the military for congress has found that blacks are less likely to be promoted than their white counterparts , but it stopped short of attributing the difference to racism the study , conducted by the general accounting office and released on monday , found statistically significant evidence that blacks were promoted less often than would be expected based on their numbers in the armed services it also found that women had proportionally more promotions than would be expected the accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , reached no conclusion about why disparities in promotion rates turned up for blacks and other minorities and for women but it recommended that the defense department improve its equal opportunity monitoring a pentagon official responded that the recommended improvements were already being put into place the report , which covered 1989 through 1993 , was requested by representative ronald v dellums of california , the senior democrat on the house national security committee , who has long prodded the military on discrimination measuring promotion rates among women , american indians , blacks and people of asian and hispanic descent against those for whites , the report found statistically significant instances of lowerthanexpected promotion among blacks analysts measured actual promotions against what would be expected based on the proportion of blacks and other minorities to whites in each of the service branches in all , the study compared promotion levels in each of five years examined , breaking down the data by year , military service and six different ranks the result was 116 separate measures in 80 of those 116 measurements , blacks were less likely than expected to gain promotion , 31 of which were deemed statistically significant for women , 78 of the 116 measurements showed a greaterthanexpected likelihood of promotion , although none was rated statistically significant
police sent helicopters and extra foot patrols to the east village yesterday , after two shootouts between officers and drug suspects left two civilians dead , five policemen injured and a neighborhood on edge barricades closed off the intersection of first avenue and fifth street , hours after a crowd of 200 clashed with police near the scene of a fatal police shooting of a drug suspect early yesterday , after a sting operation as the police tried to push back the crowd , they were punched and pelted by bottles , and four officers required medical attention after 125 more officers were sent to quell the disturbance , the neighborhood remained calm during the day inside the lillian wald housing project , tracy parker shook her head as she watched police officers patrolling the roof of a nearby apartment building like many residents , she said she was grateful that the police have sought to drive out the drug dealers who have plagued the area for decades but in the east village , where relations between residents and the police have often deteriorated into violence , she said she was worried that the bloodshed and police mobilization might spark another ugly clash they 're making the situation more tense , she said you do n't have a hatecop attitude around here you have fear , but you do n't have hate only two days after an officer was seriously injured at what the police think was a rival drug gang robbery on east third street , the situation intensified again early yesterday , when a police buyandbust operation only a block away resulted in a running gun battle through the neighborhood officers were arresting two men in a heroin sale about 1 am when another man pulled out a gun and sped off on a bicycle , the police said the cyclist began to zigzag and snake through streets near the lillian wald housing project , inspector michael gardner said the gunman fired at the police at least twice during the pursuit , inspector gardner said , bringing at least 50 shots in return from officers pursuing him the gunman , abe richardson , was finally stopped near the franklin d roosevelt drive , where he was fatally wounded by police gunfire but as officers gathered evidence , including a bulletproof vest mr richardson had worn , at the bulletstrewn crime scene , a crowd began to gather within 30 minutes of mr richardson s death , 200 people had streamed into the courtyard , and rumors began to circulate that mr richardson had been repeatedly shot as he lay on the pavement as the police tried to control the gathering crowd , they were punched and struck by thrown bottles some residents said the tension between police and residents has been building for months jonathan rodriguez , 26 , said the police had been enforcing socalled qualityoflife laws so aggressively in recent months that he and many other young men feel harassed the shooting at a bodega on east third street on tuesday , during which the police killed an armed drug suspect and mistakenly wounded officer keith prunty , was a flashpoint , mr rodriguez said it was only a matter of time before the next incident , he said police are reviewing the shooting in which officer prunty , 29 , was shot four times , twice by fellow officers , as officers responded to a robbery call at the bodega where the police suspect heroin was sold vincent curto , 33 , was fatally shot by the police this week s clashes are just the latest in a neighborhood with a history of rebelliousness the east village s low and middleincome housing is home to a large contingent of activists , anarchists and squatters many residents bitterly recall the tompkins square disturbance , during which hundreds of officers and residents clashed in the streets this spring , the police used helicopters and a highly armed strike force to evict squatters from a camp in the village during the mollen commission hearings in 1993 , an officer testified that east village police officers routinely robbed drug dealers although the witnesses' credibility was later challenged by prosecutors and never resulted in any arrests , the highly publicized charges still fed the mistrust of some residents last night , as 100 people marched , chanting no justice , no peace , two police cars trailed them , keeping a watch inspector gardner said the police would continue an increased presence during the weekend as a precaution we do n't expect any problems at all , he said at a news briefing in an unusual move , however , inspector gardner was joined at the press conference by a ballistics expert , who said there was no evidence to support the rumors that the police shot mr richardson while he was lying wounded on the ground all the bullet marks near his body scraped along the pavement , detective hal sherman said if he had been shot while lying down , there would have been holes heading straight down into the pavement , and we saw none of that by 7 pm yesterday , as the police unloaded truckloads of barricades near the spot where mr richardson died , 40 residents gathered for a candlelight vigil photo tracy richardson , center , the sister of a man killed by thepolice

in announcing on friday night that labor leaders had agreed on 600 million in concessions , mayor rudolph w giuliani seemed to have secured a large part of the cash he needed to balance new york city s budget at least on paper but the deal includes assumptions and agreements that could unravel later , putting the budget and the city s already shaky bond rating at risk even as he trumpeted the deal as a landmark of union cooperation , the mayor did not say how he would come up with the 160 million difference between the total figure and the 440 million in savings , largely from health and pension costs , that he and the unions jointly announced for the mayor , the stakes are high the city s fiscal monitors and bond raters abhor nothing more than uncertainty , and mr giuliani had pledged he would spell out the details of the savings by the time the new budget took effect yesterday the failure to do so increases the possibility that one rater , standard poor s corporation , will carry out its threat to lower the city s bond rating , something mr giuliani acknowledged yesterday could happen even so , it was a risk the mayor seemed prepared to take by all appearances , for the sake of harmony with the city s municipal unions in reaching the agreement , he again underscored a core strategy of his administration as a republican determined to cut government in a city still dominated by labor s democratic allies , he must walk a careful line between cooperation and confrontation with labor in the 18 months since he took office , vowing to weaken labor s grip on the municipal bureaucracy , mr giuliani has strung together a series of significant labor agreements , including severance packages that have reduced the city s payroll and so far , he has done so without carrying out his threats to lay off workers or to demand concessions on wages or benefits that would come directly out of the rankandfile s pockets as one administration official said yesterday , we have to work with these people and so , for example , when talks with the unions stalled last week over the remaining 160 million in concessions , the administration did not demand a final agreement with the unions but rather gave them time to sell the proposals to their members as part of broader contract agreements , the official said it was , in fact , his record of cooperation with labor that mr giuliani cited yesterday as proof that the entire 600 million in savings would be realized of course all the details are n't worked out yet , the mayor said at city hall this is the first day of the fiscal year it would be highly unrealistic for all the details to have been worked out before the fiscal year , but the agreement is there for their part , the union leaders welcomed the agreement , saying they had helped ease the city s budget problems without ceding wages or benefits or forcing the mayor to carry out his threat of layoffs and most agreed that the savings were real , even if some are based on estimates and the 160 million must still be cemented in collective bargaining , where anything can happen we did not only a good job for the city , but at the minimum pain for our workers , said stanley hill , the executive director of district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees the key is to make sure our members did n't get shortchanged in this negotiation if realized in full , the agreement would help the mayor s budget considerably the 600 million is a major part of the 31 billion budget for the new year in numbers alone , the deal would provide the most significant union concessions since the fiscal crisis of the 1970 s , when thousands of workers lost their jobs but the agreement took away none of the sacrosanct union benefits from the number of holidays to costly pacts on staffing levels that elected officials , budget monitors and even mr giuliani as a candidate have identified in recent years as a way to resolve the city s nagging fiscal problems under the terms of the deal announced on friday night , the city would wring 440 million in this fiscal year out of health and pension costs almost half of those savings would come largely from renegotiating the rates charged by insurance carriers and requiring retirees to pay modest fees for doctor visits another 150 million would come from deferring the city s contributions to pension funds , without affecting the pensions of individual retirees the rest included a plan for early retirement for teachers and civilian workers , saving 40 million , and a deferral of 50 million in payments to welfare funds for eyeglasses , prescriptions and dental care in addition to the 600 million , the mayor and unions announced they would save 400 million in the fiscal year beginning in july 1996 , and 200 million to 300 million in the year after that in the meantime , mr giuliani said the city could reduce the payroll through attrition without the chaos of layoffs but raymond d horton , the president of the citizens budget commission , a private group that monitors the city s budget , said yesterday that mr giuliani had missed an opportunity to extract lasting concessions mr horton said that some of the savings in health costs were significant but that others , like the deferral of contributions to pensions and general welfare funds , simply pushed costs to the future the commission had recommended seeking about 1 billion from the unions i would call it the imperfect playing out of a policy that was bad from the beginning , he said they fell short of their goal of spelling it out they failed the recurring test and they did it without changing either the compensation or work rules of any municipal employees it was fat elsewhere in the system as for the 160 million , mr horton said , there s a long history of these unspecified commitments that never come to pass even some union leaders , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the agreement included contingencies , as one put it it s not as clear and hard as both sides would like it to be , the leader said but the mayor s commissioner of labor , randy l levine , said he already had solid commitments from the unions on changes in work rules and productivity improvements that would make up the unspecified 160 million that , he said , should satisfy everyone , including the raters it remains to be seen whether the agreement along with the other parts of the budget will standard poor s is expected to make its decision on the city s bond rating this month mr giuliani said he knew that standard poor s had this desire for a long time , to downgrade the city but he said it would be wrong to do so , since the agency had backed down from a threat to lower the rating under mayor david n dinkins in 1993 and since enormous progress with labor had been made since then you tell me , he said yesterday how can they downgrade without playing politics

sooner or later , bill parcells always seems to be surrounded by whispers when his 1986 giants won super bowl xxi , the whispers were that he was going to join the atlanta falcons , but that never happened when his 1990 giants won super bowl xxv , the whispers were that he was going to resign and that did happen when he was in the nbc television booth in 1991 , the whispers were that he was going to join the tampa bay buccaneers , and that almost happened when he joined the new england patriots in 1993 as their coach with control over personnel , the whispers circulated that he would never complete his fiveyear contract those whispers about his future with the patriots are being heard again , louder than ever when he was confronted with the question , are you going to be with the patriots next season \? he did n't say yes or no or none of your business what he said was , who have you been talking to \? as if one of his new jersey pals might have spilled the boston baked beans not that bill parcells has made up his mind yet he probably wo n't do that until after the patriots' season i coach from year to year , he was saying now from his foxboro , mass , office i would look it over at the end unless the patriots win all eight , or at least seven , of their remaining games , beginning today against the jets at giants stadium , they are n't likely to be in this season s super bowl xxx playoffs for a team that appeared to be a possible super bowl contender after last year s 106 spurt to a playoff berth , even a 62 finish would only salvage a 500 record some coaches would n't want to leave after a sorry season , but when that theory was mentioned to him , he said , we 'll see he will be 55 next august , not that old for a national football league coach , but he s got a scar that other coaches do n't have , a souvenir of his heartbypass surgery in 1992 but when he was asked about his heart , he grumbled i did n't have a heart problem , i had a vessel problem there s a difference i'm doing all right but after a game in kansas city three weeks ago , parcells needed to be treated for dehydration the next day he was on the job , but he s not exactly doing television commercials for a health spa coaching is stressful enough when you 're winning it s even more so when you 're 26 and think you should be 62 the talent level is better than the performance , parcells acknowledged i feel responsible for that i'm the coach , but i have n't coached any different than i have in the past matt bahr agrees , william roberts is n't so sure he s not any different , said bahr , the patriots' kicker who booted two field goals for parcells in the giants' 2019 victory over the buffalo bills in super bowl xxv he wants to see gamelike performance in practice and his health is fine he s the first one in , the last one out roberts joined the patriots this season after 11 seasons as a giant offensive guard , seven under parcells he seems to have more on his mind , roberts said he s got two titles now , coaching and personnel he has more to think about has it affected parcells s coaching \? a bit , roberts said he s around the locker room , but sometimes he does n't say as much but people change maybe he s changed a little , but he motivates the same way 'if you do n't perform , you wo n't be here' on that basis , not many patriots , including their coach , should be here , but he disputes his doubleduty role i'm not doing both jobs other people do the personnel , parcells insisted when you lose , 40 things are no good your personnel decisions your play selection the game has passed you by you can be the coach of the year one year , which i was , and be a dummy the next year bill parcells is no dummy that s why today might be his last appearance on a giants stadium sideline he s smart enough to know when to stop coaching photo bill parcells \( associated press \)
with every new drug company merger in the last few years has come speculation about which company will be the next target one by one , the rumored candidates have been picked off with the warnerlambert company as the main exception attention turned again to warnerlambert yesterday after the upjohn company , perennially seen as a takeover target , agreed to merge with pharmacia ab of sweden that deal came on the heels of the announcement last week by rhonepoulenc rorer inc of a hostile takeover offer for fisons plc but the trading yesterday in the stocks of upjohn and pharmacia may provide a cautionary tale for investors intent on speculating that more mergers are imminent in the drug industry the share prices of both upjohn and pharmacia fell sharply yesterday morning as traders expressed their disappointment that pharmacia , a swedish drug maker , did not make a cash bid for upjohn under the terms of the proposed merger , upjohn holders will receive 145 shares in a new company for each share of upjohn stock they own , while pharmacia shareholders will get one share for each current share but the stocks rebounded after the companies met with analysts to discuss the deal s merits upjohn shares closed up 1125 , at 4075 , after falling as low as 37625 in early trading on the new york stock exchange american depository receipts of pharmacia rose 1125 in nasdaq trading , to 2650 , after reaching as low as 24 each adr represents one share the rebounds came after yesterday s meeting highlighted new anticancer products emerging from upjohn s research department , said richard r stover , president of stover haley burns , a health care research firm in stamford , conn i found it interesting reading all the commentary that upjohn does not have a pipeline of new products , he said the combination of upjohn s sales force in the united states with pharmacia s franchise in cancer drugs could more than double the new company s share of the anticancer market over the next five years , mr stover added similarly , investors who are disappointed with warnerlambert s drug pipeline may be overlooking some of the company s attributes i think everybody believes warnerlambert somewhere along the line has to do something , mr stover said their drug business is not competitive and it will not be so over the next four to five years on their own but the company has a valuable consumer franchise , including products like trident chewing gum and schick razor blades lisa b tuckerman , a health care analyst with spears , benzak , salomon farrell , said that might make warnerlambert attractive to a company like procter gamble , which has a small pharmaceutical unit , or bristolmyers squibb , which might want to expand its product lines i think warnerlambert is in a bit of a corner to do something strategically to protect themselves , ms tuckerman said because an acquisition of warnerlambert might cost up to 14 billion , there are a limited number of potential buyers , she said if one emerges , it might be from an unexpected part of the globe all of the recent deals that have been done have been with american and european companies , ms tuckerman said none of the japanese companies have made much of an effort to get access to the research and development programs of the american and european companies with the pharmaceutical and consumerproduct markets growing rapidly in china and russia , she said , japanese companies might be interested in a company like warnerlambert there are huge , untapped markets at japan s back door , and it would be beneficial for a company to have access there with the kind of brands that warnerlambert owns , she said warnerlambert has long kept a vow of silence on such speculation the market indeed is undergoing a lot of changes , and people are reacting to it in different ways , a company spokesman said but we would like to remain independent anything else is speculative with so many acquisitions in recent years , mr stover said , the list of potential candidates has become short it will be harder to make a quick , nondilutive acquisition and pay for it by cutting expenses , he said consolidation is going to continue , but in fits and starts i'm not sure we 're going to see a wave of consolidation

are you happy \? i certainly am now we can begin the inexorable process of forgetting about cal ripken jr as surely as we have forgotten such other splendid ballplayers and record breakers as roger maris , hank aaron and pete rose ripken wo n't disappear immediately there will be commercials for big , durable trucks and nonchic wristwatches that take a licking and keep on ticking , for breakfast foods that keep you swinging all day , and for batteries that die harder and there will be a lou gehrig boomlet , as there was for babe ruth and for ty cobb sports licensers have called this a winwin situation for everyone consumers , too \? but ripken is different , you say , and his record is special the pundits certainly agree with that the rightfield commentators \( george f will , rush limbaugh \) have promoted ripken as a symbol of the work ethic and of family values at a time when those foundations of the american century seem shaky i agree ripken showed up and did his difficult , although parttime , job for 13 years without complaining , malingering or filing a union grievance when the payoff came , president clinton and joe dimaggio showed up , but ripken showered his obvious love and attention on his parents , his wife and his children the leftfield commentators , if they ever get over their fear of appearing soft by criticizing sports , might answer that ripken was very lucky to be born into a 50 sstyle white nuclear family where dad took junior down to the local hiring hall and got him a union card then dad moved into management and was able to help junior along meanwhile , the corporation , although it changed hands , did not downsize or spin ripken off he was able to stay in his hometown , with his family and he stayed healthy not exactly a typical lunchpail story in the 90 s as a center fielder myself , i would add that ripken represents baseball as we think it oughta be , that romanticized ken burns glow of fathers playing catch with sons , heroes who are also role models mickey mantle had the father , skipped the role , but look at the attention he got i spent several days with ripken and his folks eight or nine years ago in that curious intimacy of shooting a television news feature , and i came away with a clear definition of the phrase salt of the earth good people of course , my opinion is suspect six weeks ago , i suggested that ripken take a day off before breaking the record , and the cards and calls have n't stopped yet i thought it was funny who would expect a driven athlete to quit a foot from the tape \? it would be a crime against his conditioning but a useful scaffold from which to look at our madness for heroes , for statistics , for erasing history although we have n't discussed it , i suspect that the broadcasters larry king and keith olbermann felt the same way when they made a similar although a more sophisticated suggestion that ripken tie the record , then stop it turned out that mike schmidt , the hall of fame third baseman , had floated the idea long before any of us i still do n't understand the reaction there was nut mail \( you are a child molester \) and racial confusion \( you would n't write that if ripken was black \) but most people tried to approach the issue seriously they saw political correctness in the suggestion , new york chauvinism and liberal bias there were people who argued that the gesture would be akin to a fix , that ripken would be throwing the game someone wrote how the country needed the warm fuzzies that would come from the celebration they smothered any vestiges left of my sense of being smart and provocative after years of getting advice to lighten up , to treat sports less seriously , to stop covering fun and games as if they were political conventions or social movements , i found out that many people take all this much more seriously than i take political conventions nevertheless , i hope the ripken response lasts a long time and that ripken never feels the bitterness that maris , aaron and rose felt after they broke unbreakable records and were treated as if they had really broken something priceless of course , none of them was exactly the symbol that was being sold at the time timing is all one can only imagine the reaction had darryl strawberry hit safely in 57 consecutive games well , it s over ripken can let down , use up a sick day , renew his energy for the callous reality to come he 'll have to deal with being marketable , finally , and then forgotten , visited only on baseball holidays meanwhile , all over america , under truly difficult circumstances , single mothers , handicapped men , teachers , postal workers , dental technicians , will continue to slog to work every day because they have pride and need the money it remains to be seen whether ripken will become their patron saint , or if they need one unless he also campaigns for their health care and job security and that s all i have to say about that , except for these last two words for you lighten up photo ripken a definition of the phrase salt of the earth \( barton silverman the times \)
piscataway , nj , sept 30 rutgers let another victory slip away tonight when syracuse scored 24 points in the second half to none for the scarlet knights , who had been ahead , 173 the result was a 2717 victory for the orangemen in the opening big east conference game for both teams it was the ninth straight time rutgers had lost to this conference rival it was a wrenching defeat for the home team before a crowd of 32 , 832 at rutgers stadium many spectators displayed disgust by booing after ray lucas threw his last incompletion and by leaving after nick mikemayer shanked a 30yard straightahead field goal attempt with 2 minutes 36 seconds left to play it was mikemayer s second miss in a contest that had more lowlights than highlights rutgers had 10 penalties and three turnovers , syracuse five and two marvin harrison , the syracuse wide receiver and allamerican candidate , and his quarterback , donovan mcnabb , provided the highlights with touchdown pass plays of eight and 66 yards harrison had six receptions for 120 yards this was a game rutgers could have won or should have won because syracuse played so poorly in the first half , outgained 293 yards to just 67 instead , the scarlet knights now have a 13 record , with miami the next opponent and the season of high expectations soiled syracuse improved to 31 doug graber , the rutgers' coach , said we had our chances to put them deep in a hole in the first half but could not get it done in the second half , we seemed to shoot ourselves in the foot on offense and on defense they just knocked us off the ball momentum is a crazy thing once it s lost you need a big play to get it back and we just could not come up with one paul pasqualoni , the syracuse coach , said the orangemen s difficulties on offense in the first half had to do with the rutgers 43 defensive schemes we did n't see the defense we anticipated , he said at halftime we had to get a new game plan together that they did , with mcnabb s execution of the option play being particularly helpful syracuse gained 264 yards in the second half , 129 by rushing for tailback malcolm thomas the orange offense found life on its first possession of the second half by driving 92 yards for a touchdown in eight plays the big ones were runs of 41 and 16 yards by thomas he scored from the 7 on the option play , streaking left after mcnabb had flipped him the ball syracuse tied the score , 1717 , at 8 29 of the third period after mcnabb passed eight yards to harrison , who ran a crossing pattern in the rutgers' end zone a rutgers turnover had set up the touchdown a pass by lucas bounced off marco battaglia s hands and free safety donovin darius snatched the ball for an interception he returned 16 yards to the rutgers' 23 the orange gained the lead , 2017 , on the first play of the fourth quarter when orlindo mare kicked a 32yard field goal then a pass pattern fooled the rutgers defense and opened up the speedy harrison deep in the secondary the result was the 66yard touchdown with mcnabb s pass covering the first 30 yards that was the last score terrell willis , the rutgers running back who had predicted victory a few days ago , was unrepentant he said if we would play syracuse again next week , i would say the same thing we are a better team than they are it was just a tough second half willis and bruce presley alternated at running back and combined for 182 rushing yards , 144 in the first two quarters presley scored the first touchdown , a 1yard leap in other games jim druckenmiller threw a goahead 73yard touchdown pass to jermaine holmes with 10 42 left after angelo harrison blocked two punts to set up scores and help rally visiting virginia tech to a 2616 victory over pittsburgh chad holcomb s 53yard field goal with 2 12 remaining stopped a secondhalf surge by visiting west virginia \( 23 \) as east carolina \( 32 \) earned its first victory , 2320 , over the mountaineers in nine meetings spanning 25 years and jumped over 500 for the first time this year

for shareholders of edison brothers stores , the last year has had almost nothing but bad news , culminating in last week s bankruptcy filing but there was one piece of good news in june , edison spun off a profitable and promising subsidiary to its shareholders now even that could be threatened with edison in bankruptcy , it is possible that creditors could challenge the spinoff retroactively at the worst , the exsubsidiary , dave buster s inc , a small chain of restaurant and entertainment emporiums , might be forced to help pay the claims of edison s creditors dave buster s shareholders themselves could even be hauled into court none of that will happen if edison is able to pay its creditors when it emerges from bankruptcy but what will happen will not be clear for months , if not longer , and could meanwhile cast a spell over dave buster s stock , which has held its value but not moved much since the spinoff the reason for the threat is that federal bankruptcy law sometimes makes it possible for a company that goes broke to reclaim assets it transferred out in the year before it filed for bankruptcy that is intended to prevent what is known as fraudulent conveyance , in which a company stiffs its creditors by transferring valuable assets to its shareholders it could be that the elements are there for a claim of fraudulent conveyance , said jay alix , a bankrupcy reorganization expert mr alix , who examined the company s public reports at the request of this columnist , said arguments could be made on both sides of the issue , and that an eventual decision by a judge would depend on information not now available the possibility has already alarmed some shareholders a money manager who spoke on condition of anonymity said he had bought dave buster s stock before the bankruptcy filing , but has since sold his position and gone short , selling shares he does not own and betting that the price of the stock will fall because of the possibility of fraudulent conveyance at edison , alan a sachs , the company s general counsel , said , we do n't view it as a fraudulent conveyance and noted that the company s financial reports at the time showed it was not insolvent chas michel , dave buster s chief financial officer , said the question of fraudulent conveyance has not been raised with us , and referred questions to edison based in st louis , edison brothers runs several shoppingmall store chains , with a total of 2 , 700 locations around the country it plans to close at least 500 unprofitable stores by the end of january this year its sales have not met expectations , and as early as january the stock was sent reeling by rumors incorrect at the time that the company planned to cut its dividend it was a few days after those rumors spread that edison said it would spin off dave buster s , saying the unit could more easily raise capital if it was separate from the parent the spinoff was completed in june edison shareholders got one dave buster s share for each five edison shares they owned edison cut its dividend in may , and eliminated it in august , after reporting a disastrous second quarter , which ended july 31 refinancing plans have come and gone , ending with friday s bankruptcy filing edison s share price , near 40 in early 1993 , fell 25 cents yesterday , to 225 dave buster s shares fell 25 cents , to 1575 when dave buster s was spun off , edison had a positive book value of more than 300 million but it had negative working capital and was slightly more than four months from filing for chapter 11 it appears possible that on a fairvalue basis edison might be judged to have been insolvent , especially when considering lease obligations that are not carried on the balance sheet were a judge to rule that edison was insolvent at the time of the spinoff , then theoretically creditors of edison could try to recover from dave buster s shareholders most of them are small but there were a number of large ones at the time of the spinoff , including members of the edison family and the fmr corporation s fidelity investments , which held more than 10 percent possibly , creditors could go after the large holders while deeming small ones not worth the effort another possibility , mr alix said , would be to go after dave buster s directly , trying to force it to repay edison , perhaps with an issue of stock that would dilute the holdings not only of shareholders who got shares in the spinoff but of those who bought in a subsequent public offering completed last month the lead underwriters for that offering , which mentioned edison s difficulties but did not raise the possibility of its going bankrupt , were montgomery securities , paine webber and piper jaffray no creditor committees have yet been formed at edison brothers , so it is not possible to know if those committees will raise the issue of fraudulent conveyance but it appears certain that owners of dave buster s will be closely watching , and perhaps buffeted by , what happens to its former parent
readers have been asking what they can do about american companies that sell clothing made by exploited workers , many of them children , in the maquiladora factories of central america and the caribbean a woman from montauk , ny , wrote , i simply cannot sit back and watch my two children frolic in their vacation surf knowing that other children suffer to enable my kids to have cute bathing suits a woman from berkeley , calif , wrote it makes me want to do something but what \? a man from tulsa , okla , said for the last 20 years or so , i have watched the 'made in usa' label grow scarcer and scarcer in the clothing departments of retail stores nevertheless , over that entire time i have made a commitment to purchase americanmade apparel exclusively up to a few years ago this merely resulted in some minor inconveniences slightly longer shopping trips and increased catalogue browsing more and more it is turning into a grueling ordeal many readers asked if there were a list of good companies and bad companies , some kind of guide that they could follow the questions raised were good ones , sensible and direct , and filled with compassion and a sense of responsibility most people do not want to buy clothing made by workers who are treated like slaves , and they find the exploitation of children especially repulsive but the issue is complex , and the answers at the moment are not very satisfying in 1980 , 30 percent of all apparel purchased in the united states was made abroad today the breakdown is about 5050 , with the balance about to be tipped in favor of imports some items sneakers , for example are hardly made in the united states at all so , as consumers have found , it is very difficult to simply buy american moreover , a made in the usa label is not a guarantee that the product was made by workers who are treated humanely there is a tremendous proliferation of illegal sweatshops right here in the united states , said charles kernaghan , executive director of the national labor committee we can document hundreds of sweatshops in new york , san francisco on wednesday , officials raided a garment sweatshop complex in el monte , calif , where , according to authorities , nearly 70 thai immigrants had been held in virtual slavery the complex was surrounded by barbed wire and spiked fences i never would have believed a situation like this could exist in the united states , and i hope i never see it again , said california s labor commissioner , victoria bradshaw the best thing consumers can do is let american companies know , emphatically , that they do not want to buy goods made by child laborers , or by workers of any age who are exploited speak to clerks and store managers write to company executives ask if garments were manufactured under humane conditions if the consumers would engage the companies on this issue , if they would just enter the debate , it would be a tremendous breakthrough , said mr kernaghan consumers should ask company executives to respond with a letter certifying that none of their products are made in factories in which abusive practices are employed consumer and labor organizations can be contacted for the names of newsletters and groups that track employment practices and boycotts it is important also for consumers to write their representatives in congress , alerting them to their concerns about this issue senator tom harkin of iowa has introduced a bill that would block the importation of goods produced by children under the age of 15 a similar bill has been offered in the house according to senator harkin , as many as 46 million children around the globe make goods for the united states market many apparel companies in the us have adopted codes of conduct that are supposed to insure that the workers who make their products are not abused but the codes , primarily public relations devices , are widely ignored by the independent contractors who run the factories said mr kernaghan , as it stands now , no worker in central america or the caribbean has ever heard of a code of conduct in the headlong rush to dismantle the barriers to trade , enormous efforts are being made to protect the rights and property of the businesses involved but the workers , the human beings who make the products , are not protected in the international corridors of power , they are less than an afterthought drawing
the way federal prosecutors tell it , fadil abdelghani , a 33yearold immigrant from the sudan , was a significant element in a terrorist plot to bomb major buildings and transportation links in the new york area they say that on a secretly made videotape he is seen helping deliver barrels of diesel oil to a queens bomb factory and then helping make a bomb by mixing the oil with fertilizer but mr abdelghani , who is on trial with nine codefendants in federal district court in manhattan , told the jury yesterday that he had simply been helping the other figures in the case without knowing the purpose of the activity other than that it involved some kind of training i said , 'what is this , ' and no one answered me , mr abdelghani said of the moment he began mixing the bucket under instructions from a man who would turn out to be an informer for the federal bureau of investigation why did you do that \? mr abdelghani s lawyer , charles lavine , asked i had nothing to do and i wanted to help them , the defendant replied mr abdelghani tenaciously reiterated his explanation under a crossexamination laced with sarcasm something came over you and you had an urge to start stirring \? said andrew c mccarthy , one of the prosecutors in the sevenmonthold trial i was helping , the witness repeated , hunched forward in his seat as he stared hard at his questioner mr abdelghani , a jersey city resident , drove a van for a medical livery service before being arrested in the purported bomb factory in june 1993 the arrest came less than a halfhour after he helped stir the oilandfertilizer brew he is the third defendant to testify in the trial , in which 10 men are charged with pursuing aborted plots to bomb sites like the united nations headquarters and the lincoln and holland tunnels the prosecution says that they were motivated by opposition to united states policies in the middle east it argues that the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in manhattan , which killed six people , was part of the overall conspiracy none of the defendants are accused of carrying out that attack , for which four other men have already been convicted and two more await trial among those now on trial is sheik omar abdel rahman , a militant cleric from egypt who is accused of being the leader of the conspiracy the defendants generally argue that the case is trumped up , though different defendants offer different reasons as to why they are being prosecuted mr abdelghani said he was arrested because he had gone to the wrong place at the wrong time a queens garage that the fbi had set up as a bomb factory and that agents were to raid on the morning he was there he said he had gone to the garage with his cousin , amir abdelgani , another sudanese immigrant , who spells the family name slightly differently , while passing time as he waited for repairs to be made on his livery van amir abdelgani is also on trial on the way to the queens site , fadil abdelghani testified yesterday , they stopped off at two automobile service stations in yonkers to pick up barrels of diesel fuel mr abdelghani said he asked his cousin as they left the second station , why do you need these barrels and oil \? he said that amir abdelgani responded that he was doing a favor for another man , siddig ibrahim siddig ali , who later would plead guilty to bombingconspiracy charges in the case on monday , the jury heard testimony from another defendant , tarig elhassan , a sudanese immigrant who was also seen on the videotape mixing fuel oil and fertilizer mr elhassan argued that he had been misled by the fbi informer into believing he was taking part in training for the war in the former yugoslavia
hollywood , feb 13 television remains a stepchild of the movie business movie stars and top directors often refuse to work in it , and wo n't admit to watching it movie agents advise clients that it s the last resort for careers in distress writers and intellectuals patronize it but for a while now , the movie business has been confronted with an uncomfortable fact of life in terms of dramatic value , relevance and humor , primetime television much of it , anyway is far better than what s on at the movies admissions of this come grudgingly for the most part , but they do come , especially now , as the film industry struggles to find five films to nominate for the academy awards on march 27 \( the nominations will be announced on tuesday \) no such difficulties face television once or twice a night there are shows that are vivid or powerful or funny \( sometimes all three \) and that do not insult the intelligence of viewers beyond the age of consent they include nbc s homicide , seinfeld , er , law and order , frasier and mad about you abc s roseanne , nypd blue , home improvement and grace under fire cbs s chicago hope and picket fences hbo s larry sanders show and dream on , and fox s x files other hugely successful standbys like cbs s murder , she wrote and murphy brown and fox s married with children and the simpsons still lure large audiences because , as different as they are , these programs have lead characters that still beguile viewers compared to such preadolescent moviestudio fare as disney s jerky boys , and houseguest , or universal s billy madison , these programs qualify as high art \( new line s dumb and dumber lives up to its title , but at least has the talented jim carrey going for it \) several top movie executives who admit to watching television privately acknowledge its supremacy barry diller , who ran the movie and television sides of paramount in the 1970 s and fox in the 1980 s , is one of the few to acknowledge it publicly if you just look at the sheer creative work done on the good , much less the great , television series , it puts the movie business to utter shame , he said anybody who takes the normal snobby attitude to television is n't watching the shows barry levinson , an executive producer of the series homicide and one of the few top film directors who also work in television , says that a major problem is that for the most part films have almost abandoned real people and real issues as subject matter it s hard to pinpoint what took place that led to where films are now , he said , but we 're in a terrible time there s hardly any movie with multiple ideas and various themes played out television has stepped into the breach in doing so , television has assumed the role that hollywood studios discarded several years ago in the 1970 s and early 1980 s , quality films as varied as chinatown , mean streets , the godfather , five easy pieces , terms of endearment and one flew over the cuckoo s nest regularly came out of hollywood now , however , the studios seem obsessed with trying to appeal to younger audiences and to the lucrative foreign market , so films are far safer in terms of subject matter , as well as more derivative and more actiondriven , dealing almost entirely in fantasies and spectacles \( last year s top films at the box office were the lion king , forrest gump , true lies , santa clause and the flintstones \) there are exceptions , of course paramount s nobody s fool , columbia s little women and tristar s legends of the fall are prominent examples of intelligent , highquality studio movies but the grosses for all three combined about 120 million by the weekend are not much higher than the figure for dumb and dumber , which reached about 111 million meanwhile , the best , mosttalkedabout films of the year \( pulp fiction , four weddings and a funeral and hoop dreams \) come not from studios but from such quasiindependents as miramax , gramercy and fine line , which are owned by large companies but operate with a high degree of freedom and flexibility perhaps the most significant reason television has surpassed movies , many people here say , is that it is a writer s medium , while films are dominated by directors writers and series creators like roseanne of roseanne , or david e kelley , the creator and executive producer of chicago hope and picket fences , or steven bochco and david milch , creators of nypd blue , or gary shandling of the larry sanders show are freer to experiment and explore subjects once their shows turn successful i have profoundly more power than i would in films , said mr bochco you can just dig deeper and go further on tv , said mr kelley viewers return week in and week out to watch your characters that gives you an opportunity to deal with difficult subject matter roseanne says television viewers respond to shows with a point of view or an ethic maybe the word is vision , she said i tell my writers 'this is not television , this is a twoact play it s theater forget the garbage you usually see on tv or the movies , and write about the subjects that you usually do n't see in television or movies race , gender and class'
if gobbling a book in one sitting is any reliable indicator , then a maiden s grave \( viking , 2295 \) was a screaming hit with this blearyeyed reader three stone killers , eight little girls in peril , one lovely maiden and an fbi agent with nerves of steel are the irresistible lures of jeffery deaver s new thriller , which opens with a jolt when three escaped convicts hijack a busload of deaf schoolgirls and cart them off to an abandoned slaughterhouse in the middle of a kansas wheat field mr deaver gets great mileage out of this hellish setting , with its rank butcher blocks , one and threebay decapitation guillotines , gutting machines , grinders , huge rendering vats and lingering smells of death he also ratchets up the tension by making one of the kidnappers a rapist with a taste for small girls despite such touches , the narrative does not turn on cheap thrills , but on the character dynamics between the brilliantly conceived chief villain , an utterly amoral and unpredictable killer named lou handy , and arthur potter , the head of the fbi rescue team , who has to negotiate the lifeanddeath issues with handy while fending off ravenous reporters , the gungho local militia and a spy in the house for all the melodramatic plot twists , the story is told in a fundamentally realistic style that intensifies the suspense until you could well , scream easy sex , ugly clothes , nutty politics the 1970 s were some fun in wendy hornsby s latest mystery , 77th street requiem \( dutton , 2195 \) , the independent film maker maggie macgowen sums up the era as society on the verge of a nervous breakdown and sets out to capture its ineffable craziness in a television documentary the focus of maggie s film is the unsolved 1974 murder of a los angeles police officer , whose body was found around the corner from the hideout of the symbionese liberation army the sla is a topic near and dear to me , maggie says patty hearst , the beautiful young woman seduced into terrorism , was , in my mind , the most romantic radical of them all several things intrude to keep maggie from chasing down sla survivors for interviews someone is sabotaging her film and beating up members of her crew , maybe the same someone who guns down the assassinated police officer s partner because maggie lives with a cop who was close to both victims , she also does some extensive research into their afterhours affairs by conducting painfully intimate conversations with widows and former girlfriends all these domestic entanglements could easily become distractions ,

determined to catch the creep , even if he turns out to be joe s old mentor , a retired forensic scientist named walter zeller for someone who can be so lucid about complicated technical subjects like dna mapping , mr pearson has his problems writing about lifeforms his hero cop is cut from old cloth , and zeller has the consistency of construction paper but the prose perks up when the author moves

key to the killer s twisted scheme you do n't have to be a technonerd to get wired on this scary stuff the name r d wingfield may not set off the whistles and bells that greet the mention of p d james or colin dexter but like those authors , mr wingfield writes detective stories that have been made into a british television series fans of a touch of frost , which is shown on the ae cable network ,

virginia , unmoved by social progress , continues to tax its citizens to subsidize the virginia military institute vmi is the country s oldest military college it also refuses to admit women the clinton administration , like the bush administration before it , objects to this flagrant sex discrimination and now asks the supreme court to strike it down the vmi case is ripe for high court review the constitutional evasions offered by the state and the school are overripe for high court repudiation if lower court rulings are allowed to stand , vmi will get away with a watereddown military program for women that may be worse than the exclusionary policy it practices now as the justice department s petition makes clear , anything less than full equality will continue to send the message that women are not fit to share leadership at vmi vmi boasts a rugged , bullying brother rat regime that knocks cocky young men into shape and bonds them together unlike west point , vmi does not regularly send its graduates into immediate military service its program prepares them to be ready for military assignment when necessary because the bonding embraces a large alumni network , the program also confers the possibility of commercial success in civilian life none of that would be available to women who , though qualified for vmi , would be remitted to a parallel program at mary baldwin college , 35 miles away there are no barracks there , no physical rituals , not even equal academic courses the constitution requires much more virginia s and vmi s stance is reminiscent of the separate but equal rule for the races that the supreme court approved in 1896 indeed , the us court of appeals in richmond , which sided with vmi , called the proposed arrangement separate but substantively equal because of virginia s stubborn resistance , the case might do for gender discrimination what brown v board of education did for statesponsored racial apartheid virginia has relied on the high court s refusal to hold sex discrimination to the searing scrutiny it demands in race cases still , just as the plaintiffs argued in brown v board , lawyers now say that in some cases of gender discrimination , separate cannot be equal like the state graduate schools that offered separate institutions for blacks before 1954 , vmi s parallel program cannot possibly provide equal resources or alumni networking the justice department does not argue that the constitution always requires coeducation in statesupported schools but it convincingly argues that virginia , after years of stigmatizing women , may not maintain that course at taxpayer expense
prague pavel tigrid would like to close down the czech republic s culture ministry , which may seem odd since he is the culture minister but he is quick to defend his position for the 78yearold writer , who returned from exile last year to take up his post , the very notion of cultural policy smells of communism a democratic government should therefore interfere as little as possible in the arts stocky , bearded , outspoken , mr tigrid smiled at the neatness of his logic 'culture' did very well with communism , he said in an interview in the frenchstyle mansion that still houses the culture ministry the party was a milking cow , and it had plenty of milk it gave money left and right , to theaters , to make films , but on one condition do n't mix with politics , do n't be citizens it was a kind of bribery so now , with political freedom restored and the czech government no longer in the business of bribing artists , he holds that a culture ministry is unnecessary its 220 employees form a terrible bureaucracy that gobbles up money destined for the arts , he said further , he added , it is time that museums , theaters , opera houses , orchestras and the like started looking for financing from private sponsors but after 21 months in his job , mr tigrid is also learning that change takes time i was wrong in thinking the ministry could be abolished in one or two years , he conceded now , i would give it another five years , but not more put differently , he has discovered that his radical plan is not to the liking of opposition politicians , ministry civil servants and above all , people in the arts while a few score dissident writers and painters risked ostracism and jail by standing up to the regime under communism , performing artists depended on the government subsidies that sustained theater , opera and ballet companies , orchestras and the movie industry now much of that money has evaporated , the movie industry has been privatized and many artists and stage directors are struggling to make ends meet mr tigrid is the target of their wrath they accuse him of being the cultural hatchetman of prime minister vaclav klaus s strongly probusiness economic policies and they complain that having only returned to prague in january 1994 after almost four decades in exile , he is out of touch with his native country mr tigrid has a ready answer i was called in from abroad simply because none of my three predecessors had succeeded , he said , speaking in fluent english this is not criticism because i am failing myself but i recognize that i belong to a pragmatic government working in a market economy i have no political future so i do n't play political games i am 78 years old and will return to france when this is over he also bristles at the suggestion that he does not know his own country he spent world war ii in britain , where he worked for the bbc s czechlanguage service he returned here in 1945 , but left again in 1948 after the communist takeover , first for germany , where he broadcast home via radio free europe moving to the united states in 1952 , he founded a czechlanguage quarterly called testimony in 1960 he settled in france , wrote books and continued publishing the magazine the brilliant idea of testimony was that it was not an emigre publication , but a culturalpolitical review intended to be read in communist czechoslovakia , he said , adding that anonymous contributors included the dissident writer vaclav havel , now the president i followed what was happening here on a daily , on a weekly basis i have said arrogantly that i think i know the cultural scene better than some of those who lived here to those who say czech culture is in crisis , he responds that it is simply in transition many culture ministry responsibilities , for example , have been transferred to the municipal and regional authorities , which this year will spend about 230 million on the arts and while there is no tradition of nongovernmental support for the arts , a new law will soon offer tax incentives to companies and individuals that help finance cultural programs we have people who have become very rich over the past five years who could n't care less about culture , mr tigrid said they do n't even know what it is but now i think the time is coming that a stronger middle class is emerging and there is an opening to culture of course , 50 percent of czechs would prefer to go to beer halls , but interest in culture is growing he has defined his own ministry s priority as that of restoring museums , monuments and churches that form part of the country s national heritage and were badly neglected under communism but while 75 percent of his 110 million budget is going to this program , the ministry is also ready to step in to help , say , a chamber orchestra that cannot find sponsors and risks going under i see our job as a balancing act , he added many musicians , though , have already accepted the rules of the market with prague receiving millions of tourists each year , many of the city s churches have been turned into concert halls that provide an almost constant fare of mozart , bach and vivaldi on one recent evening , for example , 22 concerts were being held simultaneously , and not one of them benefited from government financial aid several privately owned contemporary art galleries have also opened , and although many czech painters , sculptors and conceptual artists still go abroad in search of clients , others are learning to survive independently that they cannot look to the government for help is selfevident even the new national gallery of modern art , which is to open in december , has been borrowing rather than buying works of top contemporary artists but mr tigrid has been unable to keep clear of the crisis affecting the czech philharmonic orchestra , where many musicians are in open rebellion against the chief conductor , gerd albrecht and with the orchestra s program for its 100th anniversary in 1996 threatened by turmoil , the minister recently stepped in i told them , this is your jubilee season , so could you stop infighting , he recalled i said , 'for one year , please , perform properly and do n't create troubles work under albrecht and then we 'll see' but this is clearly not a role that mr tigrid savors in his ideal world , the orchestra would be selfgoverning and in place of a culture ministry , he would create an arts council modeled after the autonomous artsfinancing bodies in britain and denmark so in the end , he does in fact favor taxpayers' money going to the arts but the communist experience has convinced him that no government should decide who gets what photo culture minister pavel tigrid of the czech republic 'culture 'did very well with communism \( martina stroek for the new york times \)
rye , ny , jan 16 the scar on the small of adam graves s back is not even an inch long but the surgical procedure last october that put it there could have forced the rangers gritty left wing to miss two months of the regular season , maybe more could have , had their not been a lockout that lasted 103 days physically , obviously , it was a very fortunate time for me to heal , graves , the team s player representative , said after practice today but needing a lockout to do it i do n't think is a good reason if there was any good at all to the lockout from the rangers' point of view , it was that the time off allowed the defending stanley cup champions to heal , not only from a brutal campaign last season but an injuryplagued preseason that s where we benefited with all our guys , colin campbell , the new head coach , said none more so than graves , who scored a team record 52 goals last season and then added 10 more in the playoffs but graves injured his back early in the eastern conference finals against the devils , and it was apparent in the preseason that the pain was not going to disappear after undergoing the surgery on oct 11 to relieve pressure from a herniated disk , the 26yearold forward did not begin to skate again until the second week of november he worked out on the ice every day until christmas , then cut down to four times a week but in the week before the settlement between the players and the owners , he did not skate at all because , he said , i was on the phone all the time now , graves is back on the ice and preparing for the seasonopener of a truncated 48game schedule , friday night against the buffalo sabres , at madison square garden , when the championship banner will be raised to the rafters it feels good , really good , graves said this afternoon when asked about his back the only soreness i have is a little bit in my legs , but that s only normal the doctor said there was no reason to worry , he only had to remove part of the disk and i 've done the proper rehab on my stomach and lower back muscles campbell said one thing he has n't had is a good hit , though , and that s the one thing that concerns a guy coming off a back injury the heavy hitting , the twisting , the turning , the bumping adam graves is a player who hits and gets hit it s not like a player who avoids hits he gets involved in all aspects do n't expect graves to back down i'm going to play hockey the way i always have , aggressive and hard , graves promised i have n't been hit a whole lot yet , but i'm sure it will feel fine slap shots mark messier s father , doug , arrived in town from hilton head , sc , sunday doug messier , paul messier \( mark s brother \) and barry klarberg \( the player s accountant \) were expected to meet with the garden president , dave checketts , and rangers president , neil smith , monday night after the knicks game against the nets the meeting was to have marked the first facetoface talks between the two camps since the lockout mark messier was still evasive when asked if he plans to be in uniform for the raising of the banner if the two sides have not agreed to a new deal i'm not even looking at that for now , he said i'm confident the deal will be done and i 'll be there friday night messier did say , however , that new york is where i want to end my career
it has been a cruel month for steffi graf first came tax problems , then more back problems and then , inevitably , problems on the tennis court with an openinground loss to amanda coetzer in toronto the united states open draw yesterday brought graf no respite as misfortune would have it , graf s firstround opponent next week at the national tennis center will be none other than coetzer , arguably the most dangerous unseeded player in the women s game , who reached the toronto final after disposing of graf in straight sets graf at her best should crush coetzer , but it is difficult to imagine her playing her best in light of recent events even if she gets past the diminutive but combative south african , her road to a fourth open title is fraught with obstacles lurking in her quarter of the draw is mary pierce , the sixthseeded australian open champion who has done well against graf in the past and if graf should reach the semifinals , she will most likely face arantxa sanchez vicario , the defending champion monica seles , coranked no 1 with graf and seeded second , is sitting pretty in the other half of the draw her firstround opponent is ruxandra dragomir of romania , more at home on slow surfaces if seles plays as she did in winning toronto , she should not face any serious resistance until the quarterfinals , where jana novotna could be waiting other seeded players could run into trouble more quickly no 11 anke huber must face the indonesian yayuk basuki in the first round no 14 mary joe fernandez faces austria s judith wiesner as usual , there is even more early trouble brewing in the men s draw topranked andre agassi , the defending champion and winner of four straight hardcourt tournaments , should be able to handle a fellow american , bryan shelton , in the first round but shelton has beaten agassi in their only previous meeting and has made a habit of pulling big upsets in grand slam events also in agassi s early path are spain s alex corretja , the twotime open champion stefan edberg \( now unseeded \) , andrei medvedev and seventhseeded yevgeny kafelnikov it was kafelnikov who stopped an injured agassi in the quarters at the french open as for the biggest threat to agassi s title , pete sampras should be able to breathe easily on his beloved hard courts sampras s firstround opponent is fernando meligeni , a brazilian who has never won a maindraw match at flushing meadows
each night at 6 o'clock , carrying on a tradition best represented in the public imagination by walter cronkite , the three major television networks bring pleasant , respectablelooking , middleaged white men into american homes to deliver the day s news the anchor role has long been viewed as the most prestigious in network journalism , and the men who attain it usually stay at their desks for years today , dan rather of cbs is 63 years old , peter jennings of abc is 57 and tom brokaw of nbc is 55 each has held his job for more than a decade none talks of retiring soon and last month , nbc gave brian williams , its 36yearold white house correspondent and substitute anchor , a contract that will pay him more than 15 million a year through 2000 , tacitly anointing him as mr brokaw s eventual successor and another perpetuator of the cronkite tradition will that tradition last forever \? the executives responsible for network news say no , that circumstances have changed considerably since the three current anchors ascended to their chairs for one thing , the networks have been preparing at least some anchor candidates who are not white men , and if none of those candidates are selected , it will be much noticed more important is the fact that the traditional evening news broadcasts have lost clout , because of competition from 24hour cable news networks and from the networks' own primetime news magazines with even more news channels on the drawing board for the near future abc and nbc both have plans to form 24hour cable channels the 6 o'clock evening news as it is now known may even become obsolete the explosion of news and information programming has meant less emphasis on the singular importance of that nightly anchor s job , said andrew lack , president of nbc news look at some of the people who have turned the job down , because they love the jobs they 're doing , which have enormous impact and give their talents a wonderful outlet , he added , referring to people like jane pauley at nbc and barbara walters , diane sawyer and ted koppel at abc but while it may become necessary to redesign the evening news broadcasts , one thing must not change , the network executives say whatever the person s race , sex or age , the anchor of the future must be an experienced journalist i do n't think these broadcasts are ever going to devalue news experience , said mr lack whoever sits in that chair should have very impressive credentials mr lack and his abc and cbs counterparts say that it is increasingly difficult to find people with such credentials younger journalists who are deft at reading the news can find attractive jobs without having to endure the gritty reporting stints that served to train their elders for cbs , abc and nbc , anchors must continue to convey authority because the nightly news broadcasts still carry weight as symbols for the networks themselves this is one of those times when the right thing to do is also the commercially and strategically correct thing to do , said paul friedman , executive vice president of abc news in a swipe at cable news , he added as there are more and more people who say they are doing news , the people who really do news cbs , nbc , abc have to continue to distinguish themselves from the pretenders , in order to be commercially successful and the way we distinguish ourselves is by having people who actually know what they are talking about bob furnad , executive vice president at cnn , pointed out that the anchors he hires often have to report news as it is breaking granted i do n't have a lot of people like dan rather who reported for many years at the white house , he said but when you 've got 15 or 20 anchors , it s a little different than when you 've got one we 're doing 24 hours a day they 're doing 22 minutes viewers may not know an anchor s career history that mr rather and mr brokaw were white house correspondents , for example , or that mr jennings was a foreign correspondent but viewers can recognize that these guys know what they 're talking about and are very different from the people they see on cnn or local cable channels , mr friedman said also , mr brokaw , mr rather and mr jennings play central roles each day in selecting and editing stories , hours before their programs go on the air first of all , they catch mistakes , said mr friedman second , they know how to write copy , and third , they have a sense of what rings true and what does n't and they know what an important responsibility this is that we ca n't make mistakes , we ca n't take cheap shots , we 've got to know what we 're talking about he and his counterparts are concerned that too few young people get the rigorous training as reporters that creates an authoritative television journalist i'm not sure we 've done as well training this generation of television journalists , those who are under 30 , as we did the last generation , said mr lack in their responsibility as reporters , in their writing skills , in giving them the reporting challenges that are what our work is really all about
